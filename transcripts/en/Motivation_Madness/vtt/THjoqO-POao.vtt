1
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So here's a little issue we have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America today.</v>

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are currently about 250,000 people</v>

3
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>a year who are dying in our hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to,</v>

4
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to preventable deaths.</v>

5
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about negligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about little accidents,</v>

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the doctor in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

8
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>not properly briefing the doctor for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about things that you,</v>

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't sue anybody.</v>

11
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that we can see that's</v>

12
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's 250,000 preventable deaths</v>

13
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about 27,</v>

14
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:52.321
<v Speaker 1>40 sevens going down every single week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the equivalent to,</v>

15
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>and the confusing thing is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best doctors in the world.</v>

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>We have the most advanced technology in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

17
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Some of the medical equipment we have is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best in the world.</v>

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>The medicines we have are the best in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

19
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>So you start asking yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are these things happening?</v>

20
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is not because of any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

21
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the reasons are actually something</v>
<v Speaker 1>vastly more simple and something very,</v>

22
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>very human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>5% of hospital administrators or</v>

23
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are number crunchers.</v>

24
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals are run like businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals are run by the numbers.</v>

25
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And the problem isn't the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the care,</v>

26
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>they're very highly trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the way those people are</v>

27
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>cared for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we've done is we've created</v>

28
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>cultures in hospitals where the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were doing the caring aren't cared</v>

29
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all of these little preventable</v>

30
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>deaths are happening because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like they're a part of anything.</v>

31
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing their jobs and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get along that well.</v>

32
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>And there's not a lot of camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the impact is death.</v>

33
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I use this example because it's</v>

34
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated because the impact is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

35
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the same in our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

36
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is we come to work and were told,</v>

37
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you must care for your clients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must care for your customers.</v>

38
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You must make them the focus of all you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

39
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And yet why aren't the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing us from the top caring about</v>

40
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

41
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>in a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact is worse,</v>

42
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but the impact that we're having on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world is just as bad.</v>

43
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not working at our best.</v>

44
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't care for the things we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

45
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>We're not helping each other is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important part.</v>

46
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And the residual impact is that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled by the work that we do and</v>

47
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>when were unfulfilled by the work that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>

48
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>we focus on the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we focus on the details,</v>

49
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 1>we retract from each other.</v>

50
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>When we track from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel lonely.</v>

51
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And when we feel lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer goes up.</v>

52
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Heart disease goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes goes up.</v>

53
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going to work,</v>

54
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>we're killing ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

55
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 1>There's another study that was released</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago that says,</v>

56
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who work late.</v>

57
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>The negative impact that it has on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>children is little to none.</v>

58
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>They may feel guilty as parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the negative impact that it has on</v>

59
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>the raising of their children is little</v>
<v Speaker 1>to none.</v>

60
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who come home from jobs they</v>

61
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>hate or don't love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids are more likely to be bullies</v>

62
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you think about the bullying</v>

63
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>epidemic we have in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Where there's this disturbing number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>young children who are killing</v>

65
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicides because of bullies.</v>

66
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not the schools and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem isn't even the parenting.</v>

67
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the jobs the parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

68
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>This is the importance and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the work that we do and the</v>

69
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>places we go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if you listen to the,</v>

71
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

72
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unemployment statistics,</v>

73
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>we're all time high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>record high,</v>

75
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>nine to 10% unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:55.751
<v Speaker 1>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

77
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hear that number and I go,</v>

78
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means 91% still have a job right?</v>

79
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.571
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

80
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>we want to get that employment number</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

81
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but that means 91% is still going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

82
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>The question is how many of them coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>home fulfilled by the work that they do</v>

83
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>and how many of them are waking up</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired to go back to work the next</v>

84
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't love our works,</v>

85
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't look out for each other.</v>

86
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't look out for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel lonely.</v>

87
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>If we don't feel lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these negative things happen.</v>

88
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>So what example can I share with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative audience about how to change</v>

89
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States Marine Corps,</v>

90
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I had the great honor last week of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending a week with the marines.</v>

91
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I spent a couple days at camp lagoon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went for a few days to,</v>

92
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris island to watch them go through</v>

93
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>bootcamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't a race.</v>

94
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable human experiment that they're</v>

95
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though they know what works,</v>

96
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't know why it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need to know why,</v>

97
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>because they know that it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But what's happening is they're taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of strangers,</v>

99
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>people who don't know each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are showing up and within a very,</v>

100
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to trust each other so much that</v>

101
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>they would give their lives for each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

102
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know everyone,</v>

103
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's ever worn a human form</v>

104
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>knows that no one runs into battle for</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and country.</v>

105
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for the guy to the left of me and</v>

106
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>the guy to the right of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason they do what they do.</v>

107
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these sort of remarkable stories of</v>

108
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>heroism where people rush into very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous situations to save</v>

109
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they always ask the question,</v>

110
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>why did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you risk your life?</v>

111
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put yourself at risk for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

112
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>And the answer's always the same because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do it for me.</v>

113
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gives him the confidence to put</v>

114
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>themselves at great risk is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that someone would do the same</v>

115
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would put ourselves at great risk for</v>

116
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>our companies if we knew that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies would put themselves at great</v>

117
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>risk for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

118
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the marines,</v>

120
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and if you go read and you know this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most I asked these young and 2122</v>

121
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.620
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these are these lance corporals,</v>

122
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>the grunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the guys,</v>

123
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>the infantry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the lowest of the low.</v>

124
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>The ones we actually send into battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front lines and I asked them,</v>

125
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>are you misunderstood in America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

126
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>yes unanimously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all nodded.</v>

127
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

128
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>What did people think of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one stood up and says,</v>

129
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>they think we're baby killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

130
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>how does it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

131
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say,</v>

132
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a story then that captures to</v>

133
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you what it means to be a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling you have of being a marine.</v>

134
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a story that captures it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect it to hear stories of I took a</v>

135
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.720
<v Speaker 1>hit and somebody saved me or I ran into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a firefight can pull somebody.</v>

136
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I expected these stories of heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a single story like that came out</v>

137
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure those stories exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those aren't the tall the stories</v>

138
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>they told me that capture what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a marine.</v>

139
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>One of the stories they told me was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young boy in Afghanistan who would come</v>

140
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>around every morning and sell kabobs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marines and then one day he showed</v>

141
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>up and he was all beaten up and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to his parents for help and he</v>

142
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to his friends to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came to the marines for help because</v>

143
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:05.111
<v Speaker 1>he trusted them more than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me a story that captured how</v>

144
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>they feel of a civilian edge that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been overrun by the Taliban and the</v>

145
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>residents of the village could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't go home because they would be</v>

146
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>killed by the Taliban and so they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just living by the river.</v>

147
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>The problem was winter was coming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the uh,</v>

148
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the elders came to the marines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked on the door and said,</v>

149
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I need you to come down to the river and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill us.</v>

150
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>And the marines said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

151
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we go back home will be killed by the</v>

152
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Taliban and if we stay out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die slow deaths this</v>

153
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier if you just come and kill us</v>

154
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The marines overran the Taliban village,</v>

155
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 1>push the Taliban out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year later they went back to this</v>

156
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>village and people were playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>volleyball.</v>

157
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>These were the stories they told me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture what it means to be a marine.</v>

158
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>They believe in doing good for others</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fulfillment they get when they</v>

159
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>put themselves at risk so that others</v>
<v Speaker 1>may prevail is overwhelming.</v>

160
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>This is not unique to the Marine Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all human beings.</v>

161
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of fulfillment comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something for another.</v>

162
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>The feeling from fulfillment comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exertion of time and energy for</v>

163
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are walking to work and you</v>

164
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a few pennies in a cup and you</v>

165
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>come to work and you say to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

166
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a dollar to somebody homeless</v>

167
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your friends going to say?</v>

168
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>A good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I gave 20 bucks to somebody homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

170
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

171
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you come in in the morning?</v>

172
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:34.701
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

173
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I gave up my Saturday and I went and</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid and as painted a school in the</v>

174
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>inner city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

175
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

176
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

177
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are they inspired to do</v>

178
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 1>something good themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the feeling that you have persists.</v>

179
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.550
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is that when we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for others,</v>

180
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>that actually inspires others to do good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for others.</v>

181
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>This is provided for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to logically,</v>

182
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>anthropologically it's all part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival of the species.</v>

183
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex feels good,</v>

184
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 1>so that will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can procreate and perpetuate the</v>

185
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're social animals and so we have</v>

186
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>to provide for the fact that we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain strong buns and build cultures.</v>

187
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what humans do.</v>

188
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>We're cultural animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we do good for others and we</v>

189
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>look out for those in our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look out for those in our group.</v>

190
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>It actually feels good biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It releases oxytocin.</v>

191
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 1>This chemical that's released when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do good for others is released and it</v>

192
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>makes you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the amazing thing is the more</v>

193
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin you have in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you want to do good for others.</v>

194
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we've replaced this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>

195
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the exertion of time and energy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital communications.</v>

196
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>We've replaced it with headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've replaced it with money,</v>

197
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the invention of money,</v>

198
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be money.</v>

199
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be like you go to someone's</v>

200
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cook them dinner,</v>

201
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>and the deal was they'll do the dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and energy exchange for time and</v>

202
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone said,</v>

203
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an Iou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like doing the dishes,</v>

205
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to give you an Iou that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>promised to do them another day,</v>

206
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what money is.</v>

207
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>It is the promise for future goods or</v>
<v Speaker 1>services,</v>

208
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>the promise of future goods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

209
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've replaced our own time and energy</v>

210
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>with promises for someone else to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>another day.</v>

211
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

212
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no exertion of time and energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the feeling people get is that I</v>

213
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>did something for you and you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing for me.</v>

214
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>You replaced it with a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Iru,</v>

215
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>with a promise for future goods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

216
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>The way we find fulfillment is by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for others.</v>

217
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>So how did the marines it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get people to do good for</v>

218
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know this intellectually.</v>

219
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's good to do good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

220
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 1>but why don't we do it then why don't we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

221
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And what the Marines learned is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I completely did not</v>

222
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kinda just yell at these guys to</v>

223
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happens.</v>

224
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a few things that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do first.</v>

225
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So we all heard of the obstacle course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 1>The marines have a thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle course and this is where they</v>

227
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>build anaerobic strength and aerobic</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

228
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>muscle strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's timed and all of this good</v>

229
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

230
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>They have another course called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence course and it's never timed</v>

231
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>and most of the obstacles on this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be completed by yourself.</v>

232
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>They must be completed in teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no choice.</v>

233
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it's designed and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say is the first two weeks of</v>

234
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>bootcamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's there to outdo each other</v>

235
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and prove that there's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of like when we start on a</v>

236
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're proof.</v>

237
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>We want to show how great we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll work a little harder,</v>

238
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll do good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how good my design is,</v>

239
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about us and how good we are,</v>

240
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they keep putting them in situations</v>

241
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>where they can't do things by</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

242
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And what starts to happen very slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said after about two weeks,</v>

243
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>they start cheering for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they get in trouble when they do,</v>

244
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but they start cheering for each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then before too long you see them</v>

245
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:55.401
<v Speaker 1>organically start helping each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is if there's one person</v>

246
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.810
<v Speaker 1>who's weak and refuses to help each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

247
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 1>the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even if there's one person who's</v>

248
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

249
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the star college athlete and they</v>

250
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>get to every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of every obstacle and they just</v>

251
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 1>stand there and wait for everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish and they don't help each other.</v>

252
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>What starts to happen as organically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group starts to ostracize that</v>

253
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>person organically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get ostracized until they learn</v>

254
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>that the only way that they will get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this thing,</v>

255
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>they only way they will survive bootcamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if they ask for help because they</v>

256
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>have no option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is no one will help them</v>

257
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 1>until they're willing to help another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the deal we have to make.</v>

258
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called vulnerability and risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to take the risk to make</v>

259
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>ourselves vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

260
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you might do something for someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they may not do something back for</v>

261
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the risk you run.</v>

262
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the risk you run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>

263
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not about giving everything to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and sort of huge,</v>

264
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming risk.</v>

265
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's about little things and little</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

266
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like going on a date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

267
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I went on a date with somebody,</v>

268
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I came home and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

270
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm marrying her.</v>

271
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.680
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

272
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Are you nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

273
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

274
00:12:57.601 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>but you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

275
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm in love.</v>

276
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>She feels the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both know it's nuts right now.</v>

277
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on a couple more dates.</v>

278
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know instinctively that the strong</v>

279
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>bond that's created that that needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be created first takes more than a week,</v>

280
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>

281
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I've been dating somebody for</v>

282
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>seven years and we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:25.661
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

284
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong?</v>

285
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

286
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>we know that it takes more than seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days and we know that it takes less than</v>

287
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we don't know how long it</v>

288
00:13:36.161 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in the middle.</v>

289
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 1>All human bonds are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you show up at work,</v>

290
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when you show for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're new,</v>

291
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>don't expect that people will look out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you and they won't expect you to</v>

292
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>look out for them in seven days.</v>

293
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>It won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can working at a job for a</v>

294
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>few years and you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] sort of the,</v>

295
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 1>the absolute confidence that if you turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>your back,</v>

296
00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you will not get stabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can rely on somebody,</v>

297
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you can give them something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing will go wrong.</v>

298
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 1>You will share the credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one will throw you under the bus if</v>

299
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that in a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong,</v>

300
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it takes,</v>

301
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but I know that's more than a week and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's less than seven years,</v>

302
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and the marines fundamentally understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that before anyone is willing to put</v>

303
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves out for another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to have self confidence,</v>

304
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>real self confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be confident in yourself and</v>

305
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:27.070
<v Speaker 1>your own ability before you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help another.</v>

306
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're insecure at all about your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

307
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it's an oxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a paradox,</v>

308
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>How am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I overcome my confidence?</v>

310
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my self confidence and we all have ego</v>

311
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>issues at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

312
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>we all do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

313
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm not confident in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't help another.</v>

314
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradox because then we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to look out for us before we're</v>

315
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>willing to help our peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

316
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.120
<v Speaker 1>This is what management is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

317
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>The drill instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school they are,</v>

318
00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>there are parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there for one reason and one</v>

319
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>reason only to help us feel strong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>good about ourselves.</v>

320
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.420
<v Speaker 1>But look at the way we talk to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

321
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 1>A look at the look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A budget's been cut and so what do you</v>

322
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>get told?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you guys to do more with less,</v>

323
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're told.</v>

324
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you guys to do more with less.</v>

325
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what it told by our clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by our bosses,</v>

326
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>by our parents.</v>

327
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 1>That's like your parents telling you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young.</v>

329
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I know you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>

330
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not as smart as the other kids.</v>

331
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

332
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to do more with less,</v>

333
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need to be telling people is I</v>

334
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:33.320
<v Speaker 1>need you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to do more with what you</v>

335
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>You have capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have strength,</v>

337
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you have talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have compatibility.</v>

338
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I need you to do more with what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

339
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 1>We don't celebrate what we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We criticized for what we don't have.</v>

340
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the responsibility of management</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take us under their wing and help us</v>

341
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:56.201
<v Speaker 1>understand our own value to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close your eyes and think back to high</v>

342
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:02.951
<v Speaker 1>school and think of that one teacher who</v>
<v Speaker 1>took you under their wing and cared for</v>

343
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you and looked after you and helped you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that you are capable of more</v>

344
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 1>than you thought you were and you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

345
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You probably are the person you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in some part because of that</v>

346
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the name?</v>

348
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the name of the teacher.</v>

349
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the name.</v>

350
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

351
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can point to anybody and you can tell</v>

352
00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:29.610
<v Speaker 1>me that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

353
00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:31.680
<v Speaker 1>tell me the names of all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers you have that day.</v>

354
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Can't remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya.</v>

355
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.880
<v Speaker 1>This is the power of those who teach us</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

356
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.450
<v Speaker 1>We will literally carry their names</v>
<v Speaker 1>around with us for the rest of our</v>

357
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:44.050
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to be that person?</v>

358
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to be the person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now,</v>

359
00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>30 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years from now,</v>

360
00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I can do this exercise with somebody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell me your name.</v>

361
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

362
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the power of helping others</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize their own strengths.</v>

363
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 1>This is what management and leadership</v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be doing.</v>

364
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be caring for us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping us realize our own value.</v>

365
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have anybody who reports to your</v>

366
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility is not to make them</v>

367
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>meet the deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're responsibility is not to make</v>

368
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>sure that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you say,</v>

369
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you're responsibility is to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they understand their own</v>

370
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 1>strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own value,</v>

371
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and that they are way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more talented than they think they</v>

372
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way they will learn that is</v>

373
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>that you put them in situations in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fail.</v>

374
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And you hold them and you support them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you give them talent and you give</v>

375
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:36.530
<v Speaker 1>them skills and you'd give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>education and you watch their backs and</v>

376
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>if they fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to get back up.</v>

377
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And if they follow the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you character them to get back up.</v>

378
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And if they fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to get back up until</v>

379
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>they figured out themselves cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

380
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It's your responsibility to help others</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it to others.</v>

381
00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Responsibility to help you find yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the amazing thing is as soon as you</v>

382
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 1>start feeling confident in your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

383
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

384
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It's called trust in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give medals to people who were</v>

385
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>willing to sacrifice themselves so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>others may gain.</v>

386
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.460
<v Speaker 1>In business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are willing to give bonuses to people</v>

387
00:18:10.461 --> 00:18:12.500
<v Speaker 1>who will sacrifice others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that we may gain,</v>

388
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.680
<v Speaker 1>we have it backwards and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>complain about how we don't love our</v>

389
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 1>jobs and we complain about how the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>is suffering and we can plan about how</v>

390
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:24.560
<v Speaker 1>budgets are being cut and we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>complain and complain and complain and</v>

391
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:28.460
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we do is blame each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and become more selfish and</v>

392
00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>worried about my pay and my benefits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my this and this is what happens when we</v>

393
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:34.280
<v Speaker 1>are unfulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at the metrics and we say</v>

394
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we are fulfilled,</v>

395
00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:38.840
<v Speaker 1>we don't care about the metrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why when you have a job you love</v>

396
00:18:38.841 --> 00:18:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and you get a call that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll offer you tons more money in great</v>

397
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:42.740
<v Speaker 1>benefits you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested,</v>

398
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>

399
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll give you more.</v>

400
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not the reason I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here because I love it.</v>

401
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm here because I care for the people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with and I'm here because the</v>

402
00:18:55.851 --> 00:19:00.851
<v Speaker 1>people I work with care for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the world I imagine.</v>

403
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

404
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.440
<v Speaker 1>this is the world I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the great thing.</v>

405
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.650
<v Speaker 1>If you take little risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about big things,</v>

406
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.590
<v Speaker 1>little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start doing little things for</v>

407
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:16.120
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amazing anthropological response is</v>

408
00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.910
<v Speaker 1>other people will start doing little</v>
<v Speaker 1>things for others too.</v>

409
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I was walking down the street two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and a guy's backpack was open at a</v>

410
00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:26.770
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell out as he's walking down the street</v>

411
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.220
<v Speaker 1>and I happened to be behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my friend and I just sort of,</v>

412
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.860
<v Speaker 1>we were in mid conversation and in mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation we never even stopped</v>

413
00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.030
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just bend down,</v>

414
00:19:34.031 --> 00:19:36.250
<v Speaker 1>sort of helped him gather his papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't them back to him,</v>

415
00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:38.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of pointed out that his book bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>was his,</v>

416
00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his backpack was unzipped and he said</v>

417
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:41.051
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we walked down.</v>

418
00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

419
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.240
<v Speaker 1>We get to the end of the street and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand at the that we are waiting to</v>

420
00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:48.430
<v Speaker 1>cross the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still talking,</v>

421
00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:52.600
<v Speaker 1>we haven't stopped talking and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of us turns to us and says,</v>

422
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I saw you help that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really cool.</v>

423
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.370
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's great about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy will go do something for someone</v>

424
00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:06.910
<v Speaker 1>else simply because he saw us bend down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pick up paper for someone else.</v>

425
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.970
<v Speaker 1>He will actually go do something for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else because of it.</v>

426
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

427
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.950
<v Speaker 1>he won't give to charity because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees me put a dollar in a cup,</v>

428
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 1>but he will actually help someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he saw someone also helps</v>

429
00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:22.210
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little things hold a door open for</v>

430
00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:23.950
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say thank you to the person holding the</v>

431
00:20:23.951 --> 00:20:25.870
<v Speaker 1>door open for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smile to the Barista.</v>

432
00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Little little things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.090
<v Speaker 1>put your foot in the subway when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>door is closing.</v>

434
00:20:31.091 --> 00:20:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So someone who's running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make it hit the open at the,</v>

435
00:20:33.551 --> 00:20:34.810
<v Speaker 1>at the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go</v>

436
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.740
<v Speaker 1>or pretend you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's the best one,</v>

437
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

438
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't if I saw sorry.</v>

439
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it a little time and a little energy</v>

440
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 1>and you'll find around work that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a little time and a little energy</v>

441
00:20:57.161 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>back to you and you'll give a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more time and a little more energy.</v>

442
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>You go for coffee with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go for a two hour coffee and</v>

443
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you go for a coffee and a lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go for lunch and a dinner.</v>

444
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Then you go for a dinner and a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you sleep over,</v>

445
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd sleep over two nights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go on holiday together and</v>

446
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 1>eventually you get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

447
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes time.</v>

448
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And we can't rush it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

449
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 1>if when we rush it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all fake.</v>

450
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Do things for others and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch how much others do for you.</v>

451
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go get yourself a cup of coffee from</v>

452
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the coffee shop machine in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make one for someone else.</v>

453
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It takes a little extra time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a little extra energy.</v>

454
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>

455
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And here's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will feel so good at the end of the</v>

456
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

457
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.573
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

458
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

459
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you convince someone,</v>

460
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:00.331
<v Speaker 1>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

461
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 1>what are the metrics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you convince a skeptical audience</v>

462
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 1>of this trust metric?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

463
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

464
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't twist anybody's arm to do</v>

465
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 1>something that they don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

466
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the law of diffusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I obey,</v>

467
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as hard as that,</v>

468
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 1>as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you don't need the majority.</v>

469
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Speaker 1>You need those people who believe what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe.</v>

470
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:22.654
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you buy,</v>

471
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 1>when you go sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do some nice things for people,</v>

473
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.080
<v Speaker 1>they may not do something nice back</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they may be,</v>

474
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a world in which you do</v>

475
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>something for somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think you want something from them.</v>

476
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunately the society we've</v>

477
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

478
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's the risk that we keep taking.</v>

479
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying you should keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for somebody who keeps doing nothing</v>

480
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 1>and keeps sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>crapping on you because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at some point you have to be like,</v>

482
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bad,</v>

483
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.001
<v Speaker 1>my bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

484
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And you back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

485
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in helping everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe in it.</v>

486
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

487
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 1>let's do good for everyone in on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

489
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother Teresa,</v>

490
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>who is the poster child for giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessly to all who need at the end of</v>

491
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 1>her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started questioning the existence of God</v>

492
00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated her life serious.</v>

493
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

494
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:14.011
<v Speaker 1>giving to others unabashedly is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>self destructive.</v>

495
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

496
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like going on dates with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you don't like,</v>

497
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you'll eventually click in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

498
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one machine that I found</v>

499
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that really accurately measures trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than any other sort of metric.</v>

500
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>It's called the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good at it.</v>

501
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those feelings,</v>

502
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you get trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one way or the other,</v>

503
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the little risks.</v>

504
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

505
00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm unsure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

506
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the backwards with the dance.</v>

507
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It's dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dance.</v>

508
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

509
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that.</v>

510
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 1>So if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are cynical bastards at your</v>

511
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 1>office who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

512
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't get it,</v>

513
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 1>ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore him,</v>

514
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because eventually you'll get enough.</v>

515
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And those people either come along or</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave or be pushed out,</v>

516
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ostracized.</v>

517
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember when the group starts helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

518
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>they ostracize the ones who refuse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

519
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:12.650
<v Speaker 1>whether they're strong or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weak,</v>

520
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.460
<v Speaker 1>they get ostracized until they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they learn that they cannot</v>

521
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 1>survive without the help of others.</v>

522
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 1>And they learn that the only way others</v>
<v Speaker 1>will help them as if they,</v>

523
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 1>if they help the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

524
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The order matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The order matters.</v>

525
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought of something that,</v>

526
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 1>that sort of is pervasive in our sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital world.</v>

527
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the order matters,</v>

528
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak honestly about what you</v>

529
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

530
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>If you are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do things for people when you want</v>

531
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>something from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ask them what you want from them.</v>

532
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you one little example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny little example.</v>

533
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 1>We've all received emails that go like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>congratulations on all you've been</v>

540
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>We should get coffee sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could do me a favor,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've all received an email like that</v>

00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>and how do we respond to it</v>

<v Speaker 1>What happens if you get the same email</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes like this?</v>

550
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Dear Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping you could vote for me on this</v>

551
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:36.390
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to win some thousand dollar</v>

552
00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>prize for my design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen you in years.</v>

553
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations on all that you've been</v>

554
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should get a coffee sometime.</v>

555
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Kenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different.</v>

556
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we know why you're emailing and it</v>

557
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>comes first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a remarkable impact.</v>

558
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 1>We know that all those pleasantries are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buttering us up to get to what they</v>

559
00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

560
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you come right out with what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

561
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.160
<v Speaker 1>we're actually very grateful for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasantries,</v>

562
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing in human</v>

563
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give someone a cup of coffee.</v>

564
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 1>If you need a favor back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ask them for the favor.</v>

565
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It builds trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust you.</v>

566
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do something nice for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you just something what you</v>

567
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:18.074
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something from me,</v>

568
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I won't trust you and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies do to us,</v>

569
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we did this for you,</v>

570
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>why won't you do this for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

571
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bending down to pick up the papers,</v>

572
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>holding the door open for someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting nothing in return ever.</v>

573
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.160
<v Speaker 1>You do not give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens in new business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

575
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 1>We beat new business is built on</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and so we build the</v>

576
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:39.260
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build the relationship,</v>

577
00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:41.570
<v Speaker 1>build the relationship until we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable to ask for the business.</v>

578
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were only befriending till the point</v>

579
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you felt that I would let down my guard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could ask me for something the</v>

580
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

581
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>You were just waiting for that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

582
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>If you actually want to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

583
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:59.271
<v Speaker 1>you build relationships without wanting</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and that's how you build trust.</v>

584
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You want to know why the marines gave me</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredible access?</v>

585
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

586
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 1>anything you want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

587
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Anything you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

588
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went past sign that said no</v>

589
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 1>observers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no civilians beyond this point.</v>

590
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I take pictures of like,</v>

591
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see some of the pictures.</v>

592
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 1>They're unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

593
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like right in their marines coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me.</v>

594
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>We went out to the crucible and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all like,</v>

595
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like rolling in the dirt and</v>

596
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know going under barb wire and I'm</v>

597
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking either.</v>

598
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.960
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented access access that</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists would be jealous of.</v>

600
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why they gave it to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in all the time that I've been</v>

601
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>visiting with marines and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings with them,</v>

602
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I've never asked for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything and I don't have</v>

603
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 1>anything to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just keep showing up and say,</v>

604
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I help?</v>

605
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And at some point they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I called him and said,</v>

606
00:27:51.031 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I need a little favor cause they know I</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been waiting for the favor.</v>

607
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the time now that I have a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>

608
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 1>They go absolutely whatever you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called human relationships.</v>

609
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Companies don't do business with</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

610
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 1>People do business with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

611
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 1>your company didn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibm as a client,</v>

612
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 1>somebody who likes somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll hire you.</v>

613
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And if they didn't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

614
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

615
00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing roulette.</v>

616
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:15.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're betting that,</v>

617
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole workout,</v>

618
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 1>those are the weak relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

619
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.970
<v Speaker 1>The more we give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it inspires others to give,</v>

620
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 1>but the more selfish we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more others become selfish around</v>

621
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are organizations in which</v>

622
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:35.940
<v Speaker 1>selfish behavior prevails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we see the residual effects,</v>

623
00:28:35.941 --> 00:28:39.000
<v Speaker 1>which is they make decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately screw us.</v>

624
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They destroy our economy because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their selfish behavior.</v>

625
00:28:41.481 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this is what,</v>

626
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

627
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Same in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

628
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

629
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:52.190
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds silly and you said you,</v>

630
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your first question is do I talk</v>

631
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 1>about these things to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will talk to anyone who will listen,</v>

632
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't talk to people who don't</v>

633
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 1>want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is there are some good</v>

634
00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 1>eggs and there are some of them who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had conversions where they were the</v>

635
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 1>bastards who believe in firing people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>screening people to advance their</v>

636
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:13.710
<v Speaker 1>careers and something happens.</v>

637
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I just met a guy recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very senior executive at very,</v>

638
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>very large company and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and he like,</v>

639
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.530
<v Speaker 1>he got like hitting the head or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and he realized,</v>

640
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>holy cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look after people.</v>

641
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they become obsessed with it and</v>

642
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>they start sticking their necks out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just need those champions</v>

643
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>scattered around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I do.</v>

644
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The more I spread this message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sort of it's,</v>

645
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

646
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:38.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

647
00:29:38.811 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>in the cartoons you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole of justice,</v>

648
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the message goes out and they all</v>

649
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:43.451
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

650
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 1>wherever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

651
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd poke their heads up.</v>

652
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It's that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we talk about it,</v>

653
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the more we put it in our work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

654
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because don't forget you're going to</v>

655
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 1>help someone who goes home feeling good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their husband or their wife works in</v>

656
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:57.320
<v Speaker 1>the bank and they're going to talk how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much about they love to,</v>

657
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and that might inspire that person.</v>

658
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

659
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.200
<v Speaker 1>it has all of these residual impacts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

660
00:30:01.201 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that we don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the funny thing about the</v>

661
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we're so proud of the internet</v>

662
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>that we can measure everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

663
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only measure one layer.</v>

664
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

665
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:10.871
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

666
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>what's the impact you're having?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

667
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Is The answer right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

668
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it'll take more than a</v>

669
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will take seven years,</v>

670
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know when it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

671
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how it's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

672
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I can do is,</v>

673
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 1>is do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have no clue how or when.</v>

674
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can measure book sales and I can</v>

675
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Speaker 1>measure how many hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can measure how many people have</v>

676
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 1>watched a ted talk and all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't measure,</v>

677
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ted talk being shown to a room of</v>

678
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 1>50 people and one of those 50 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't buy a book,</v>

679
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't watch a Ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything but goes out and</v>

680
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 1>does something good for somebody else.</v>

681
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I have no way of measuring that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're so proud of the internet</v>

682
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 1>and its ability to measure everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're measuring one layer where we</v>

683
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>used to measure no layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

684
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how people work.</v>

685
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

686
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>it's Gossamer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

687
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 1>it's networked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

688
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and so the answer is don't worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

689
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worry about the people who you can care</v>

690
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you can give to.</v>

691
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And when we reach a critical mass in</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

692
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.220
<v Speaker 1>it will tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

693
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason it is the way it is now is</v>

694
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:15.310
<v Speaker 1>because it tip the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no such thing as massive</v>

695
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>layoffs as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as business strategy prior to</v>

696
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't done.</v>

697
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 1>It was done here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't strategy.</v>

698
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.510
<v Speaker 1>The idea of using layoffs to balance the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books is a relatively new phenomenon</v>

699
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 1>that came for the increase of</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness in the Gordon Gekko greed is</v>

700
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

701
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 1>1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

702
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

703
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was also the same exact period,</v>

704
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the theory,</v>

705
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 1>the theory of shareholder value was put</v>
<v Speaker 1>forwards,</v>

706
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they had all of these people</v>

707
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 1>buying large companies and installing</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional managers to run the</v>

708
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 1>companies that they bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they invested in and they had a</v>

709
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is those professional managers</v>

710
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:51.700
<v Speaker 1>were paid for by the company and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional managers cared for the</v>

711
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 1>employees and the customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the investors said,</v>

712
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>how do we protect our investments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got an idea,</v>

713
00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give them equity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and bonus them based on the</v>

714
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

715
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>And so the shift happened where the ceos</v>
<v Speaker 1>started caring more about the investors</v>

716
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and stop caring about the customers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

717
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Those with theories introduced by some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard professor in the 1980s.</v>

718
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.510
<v Speaker 1>We can push it back the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

719
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.220
<v Speaker 1>We can push it back the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

720
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but we just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's just a,</v>

721
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:22.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

722
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the other day.</v>

723
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Which company was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

724
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the large banks where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholder is Citibank.</v>

725
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Citibank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

726
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Citibank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shareholders voted majority</v>

727
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:36.310
<v Speaker 1>shareholders voted against a fat pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

728
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 1>That's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has never happened even in hard</v>

729
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when the company is doing this,</v>

730
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 1>the shareholders just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sort of a,</v>

731
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cursory thing where they approved the</v>

732
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>$15 million bonus for the CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They voted against it.</v>

733
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 1>It's non binding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sends a shot across the bow</v>

734
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:58.090
<v Speaker 1>saying shareholders now want you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonused if you do something good for</v>

735
00:32:58.701 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the others is us.</v>

736
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

737
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:10.451
<v Speaker 1>is that it's starting to crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's just stick our finger in</v>

738
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.350
<v Speaker 1>the crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 1>make sure that it keeps cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It swung one way.</v>

740
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 1>We can swing it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question was,</v>

741
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 1>can I talk about celebrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment while still asking for</v>

742
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

743
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

744
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 1>to so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

745
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a study on kids who are really,</v>

746
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:30.170
<v Speaker 1>really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an older gifted classes.</v>

747
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Why is it when you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gifted?</v>

748
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 1>When you're stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're special.</v>

749
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:33.104
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

750
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I was told my whole life I was special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not never gifted.</v>

751
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

752
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.290
<v Speaker 1>they took the gifted kids who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly told,</v>

753
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

754
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.530
<v Speaker 1>thanks for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew you'd do well.</v>

755
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the,</v>

756
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you're our best employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

757
00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you're best student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're awesome.</v>

758
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is later in life they</v>

759
00:33:56.591 --> 00:34:00.030
<v Speaker 1>actually suffer because they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of taking risk because they're</v>

760
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.930
<v Speaker 1>very afraid of losing their position on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mantel.</v>

761
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids who were sort of more average,</v>

762
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.600
<v Speaker 1>who constantly are rewarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for their accomplishment,</v>

763
00:34:07.601 --> 00:34:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but for their effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great effort,</v>

764
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.920
<v Speaker 1>really proud of the improvement you</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

765
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:17.190
<v Speaker 1>What they find is they do very well in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life because there's no shelf.</v>

766
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.720
<v Speaker 1>There's always more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more effort,</v>

767
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to reward and</v>

768
00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:27.910
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't hit the goal,</v>

769
00:34:27.911 --> 00:34:29.770
<v Speaker 1>it's that the delta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

770
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:30.970
<v Speaker 1>if it goes backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

771
00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

772
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.070
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't get,</v>

773
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be giving ribbons for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who competes,</v>

774
00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we're teaching people is if</v>

775
00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a medal,</v>

776
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is,</v>

777
00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:44.610
<v Speaker 1>is we start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're creating a generation that's</v>

778
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.990
<v Speaker 1>feeling very hollow and feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:50.830
<v Speaker 1>this sense of entitlement that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>complain about Gen y the entitlement is,</v>

780
00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I've accomplished</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

781
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And the funny things about human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we,</v>

782
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

783
00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.550
<v Speaker 1>the way we feel accomplished is when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>exert energy and time and reach a</v>

784
00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:02.470
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And the more energy and time that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to suffer through,</v>

786
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.560
<v Speaker 1>especially if we suffer together and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get somewhere,</v>

787
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.070
<v Speaker 1>it is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the best jobs you've ever</v>

788
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:13.840
<v Speaker 1>worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the best design?</v>

789
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Was that the best results that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company had because of your,</v>

790
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.660
<v Speaker 1>your project or was it an absolute hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>project that you worked together and you</v>

791
00:35:22.271 --> 00:35:25.240
<v Speaker 1>came out on the other end and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it done at the deadline and you're</v>

792
00:35:25.241 --> 00:35:27.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was amazing.</v>

793
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It was the hell projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the things that we had to go out</v>

794
00:35:30.911 --> 00:35:33.730
<v Speaker 1>of our ways more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things for each other,</v>

795
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things we weren't thinking of doing.</v>

796
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I was wrapping packages I was doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't designers on supposed to do</v>

797
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.863
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 1>this is what produces that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

799
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

800
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:45.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

801
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the thing is about measurement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>destination reward.</v>

802
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we're standing in a big empty</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

803
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're standing in one corner and I</v>

804
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 1>give you a simple instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go to that corner in a</v>

805
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:00.470
<v Speaker 1>straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right off you go.</v>

806
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.410
<v Speaker 1>No big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

807
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Without telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slip a chair in front of you.</v>

808
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go around the chair.</v>

809
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Now you just disobeyed what I told you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

810
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I told you to go to that corner straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

811
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 1>But this is the amazing things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

812
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>which is when we're given a clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>

813
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>we use our own creativity and our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of innovation and our own problem</v>

814
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>solving abilities to overcome obstacles</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the destination.</v>

815
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destination is more important than</v>

816
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the root,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

817
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 1>We are flexible about the route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are obsessed with the destination</v>

818
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 1>reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're standing in the corner together</v>

819
00:36:31.021 --> 00:36:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and I give you a simple instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go somewhere in this room,</v>

820
00:36:33.631 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 1>in a straight line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say to me,</v>

821
00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:36.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do want me to go?</v>

822
00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:36.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

823
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>

824
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Go on a straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you pick a point and you start</v>

825
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 1>walking and without telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a chair in front of you and what</v>

826
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come to a grinding halt and I say,</v>

827
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 1>what'd you stop for?</v>

828
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:46.891
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

829
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you put a chair in front of me or you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a sudden turn,</v>

830
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in another direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

831
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same obstacle.</v>

832
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 1>The differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a clear set of clear</v>

833
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the obstacles become easy to overcome.</v>

834
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>When you don't have a clear destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep coming to a grinding holt.</v>

835
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And what we do in our companies is we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>counting the steps we're taking along</v>

836
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:07.020
<v Speaker 1>the route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're never looking at the</v>

837
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

838
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 1>So companies has made $1 million this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

839
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:13.110
<v Speaker 1>We were only planning on making 800,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like we took 10 steps.</v>

840
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:15.600
<v Speaker 1>We only planning on taking eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going?</v>

841
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 1>No clue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>We count the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is,</v>

843
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 1>is that people want to feel that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort that they're exerting actually</v>

844
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 1>are moving somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so successful measurement,</v>

845
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 1>successful recognition is not just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steps you take.</v>

846
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not just for the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that the effort you exerted moved</v>

847
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 1>us closer to where we're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

848
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And that get two should be some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

849
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 1>My ideal is to live in a world in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of people wake up</v>

850
00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>every single morning inspired to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and fulfilled by the work that they</v>

851
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

852
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the couple of measurements that I use</v>

853
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.520
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the book is selling.</v>

854
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:48.241
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

855
00:37:48.241 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 1>people ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many have you sold?</v>

856
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never asked the publisher because</v>

857
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't care how many I sold.</v>

858
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 1>What I care about is the Amazon rankings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that those are going steady or up</v>

859
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and not plummeting because that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

860
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't have a publicist and I</v>

861
00:38:04.051 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>don't have a marketing strategy on</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

862
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hire one of those companies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell the book for me.</v>

863
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I'm not interested in book</v>

864
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 1>sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in the spreading of an</v>

865
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just used that as a metric to</v>

866
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 1>help me understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I sort of marching in the,</v>

867
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>because the more I preach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it resonating?</v>

868
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.230
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have a couple of these</v>

869
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 1>imperfect measurements that help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand are you going along the way?</v>

870
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just great effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what you achieved because that's</v>

871
00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

872
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:36.801
<v Speaker 1>Our goal is to increase top line</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenues by $50 million for what reason?</v>

873
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is we have to know the</v>

874
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we say,</v>

875
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You took us that much closer.</v>

876
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 1>And if we go to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because we were overcoming an</v>

877
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 1>obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we hadn't gone to the right,</v>

878
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 1>we would've been stuck forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

879
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not always straight lines.</v>

880
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not always straight lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in one direction.</v>

881
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 1>She's pulling the cane out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very,</v>

882
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:02.464
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>

883
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
