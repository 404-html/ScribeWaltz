1
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're going to blame people</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the Shit you've been her blaming</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>them for all the good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to give them credit for</v>

3
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>everything that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even credit for everything,</v>

4
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:20.321
<v Speaker 1>that's great</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is not so simple at black</v>

5
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother beat the shit out of me.</v>

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>She loved me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was freaked out.</v>

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I was going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a source of everything.</v>

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I blamed her for all the beauty in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I blame her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have one have in my life because I</v>

10
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>cherished my wife cause I know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite is.</v>

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I blame her for the capacity to feel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I blame with my insatiable hunger to end</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering for any of you,</v>

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>but I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I suffered a ton.</v>

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>If you'd been the mother I had wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not be the man I'm proud to be.</v>

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>If we can realize that life is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening for us,</v>

16
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.581
<v Speaker 1>not to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game over all the pain and suffering</v>

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know any success program that I've</v>

18
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 2>ever had the good fortune to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be a good book,</v>

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 2>a good set of tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good seminar.</v>

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Almost every single one talks about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>power of goal setting.</v>

21
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a fundamental key to all</v>

22
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 2>lifelong success plans you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine.</v>

23
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>The challenge of course is we hear it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>

24
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 2>we tend to take it just a little bit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>

25
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 2>don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you get yourself in a point where you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard it so often.</v>

27
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>You're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't talk about goal setting and</v>

28
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I know all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

29
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I should make sure my goals are stated</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the positive.</v>

30
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should write them down.</v>

31
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 2>You know I didn't know all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

32
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be careful not to get caught</v>

33
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 2>in that trap called the law of</v>
<v Speaker 2>familiarity.</v>

34
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 2>You know where he gets so used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you begin to take it just a little bit</v>

35
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 2>for granted because fundamentals have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be practiced daily.</v>

36
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the greatest coaches that</v>

37
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you can think of and sports history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>names that come up for me or it names</v>

38
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 2>like Vince Lombardi for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or John Wooden.</v>

39
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 2>What were they known most for teaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals to people that were already</v>

40
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the best at what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

41
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wooden would take a basketball</v>

42
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A kid was the best in the world at what</v>

43
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>he does virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for his age group,</v>

44
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>and he can make a shot from virtually</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and you go,</v>

45
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 2>that's really cute kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get over here and I want you to shoot</v>

46
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 2>400 free throws and gets this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

47
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:21.201
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 2>well let's see you do it or come up here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want to see you shoot 500 bank</v>

49
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 2>shots from five feet.</v>

50
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 2>While I can do that again would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes,</v>

51
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can do it and you're going to</v>

52
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 2>do it every day this many times so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it and the key clutch moments.</v>

53
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 2>You've got to practice fundamentals</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

54
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>He went 11 consecutive national</v>
<v Speaker 2>championships.</v>

55
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Unlike any team in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the power of fundamentals.</v>

56
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>So anytime I do a workshop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime I try and do tapes,</v>

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 2>usually I put a goal setting workshop in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and some of them have some</v>

58
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 2>similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've done one with me before,</v>

59
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 2>he has a chance to do it again and do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more effectively.</v>

60
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 2>And variably when I hear people say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

61
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach me something new.</v>

62
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I know they aren't into mastery because</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition again is the mother of skill.</v>

63
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>You've heard me say that over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

64
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It's because if you want to master</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

65
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do it over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

66
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>And every time I do a goal setting</v>
<v Speaker 2>workshop myself,</v>

67
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I obviously make new distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set up some new goals they change.</v>

68
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So don't take it for granted and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

69
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>these two tapes are on goals and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>short and they're simple and I can do</v>

70
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>that some other time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already know my goals.</v>

71
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Don't get caught in that hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is do the exercises.</v>

72
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're setting goals brand new and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh,</v>

73
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>and for most people they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly defined set of goals.</v>

74
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

75
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now taking taekwondo and I had the</v>

76
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>good fortunate of training with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grand master of taekwondo and the United</v>

77
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is grandmaster June Reed,</v>

78
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 2>and the interesting thing about jewelry</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a master,</v>

79
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>as he taught me something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you taught me to go from the frame of</v>

80
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>mastering simple things over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

81
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>everything he teaches to become a black</v>
<v Speaker 2>belt breaks,</v>

82
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Bam has seven simple moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that interesting?</v>

83
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Now what's interesting is he says that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people never make it to black belt</v>

84
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 2>because they kept coming in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me something new.</v>

85
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them.</v>

86
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>You have to master the fundamentals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you do those and you do them over</v>

87
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be a black belt easily and</v>

88
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't get caught in those traps.</v>

89
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Breakthrough the bonds of your past and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at</v>

90
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 3>world and a whole new way where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand fundamentals must be</v>

91
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 3>practiced daily and you'll do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes.</v>

92
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:27.060
<v Speaker 3>You're not bored by fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get excited about doing the daily</v>

93
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:30.930
<v Speaker 3>things that create the ongoing level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness and joy you want for a</v>

94
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

95
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 3>let's take a quick look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the power of goals?</v>

96
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Why do we talk about him so much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want need to use them?</v>

97
00:04:37.831 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Why are they important?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Answer with goals.</v>

98
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 3>We create the future and advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We create our destiny.</v>

99
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.250
<v Speaker 3>We shape our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

100
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 3>we all have goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we know it or not.</v>

101
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.220
<v Speaker 3>The problem is some people have really</v>
<v Speaker 3>lousy goals and whatever your goals are,</v>

102
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 3>they're affecting you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe your goals are to get through this</v>

103
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the goal is or how to pay the</v>

104
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 3>lousy bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with goals like Vat is they</v>

105
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 3>don't exactly inspire you and get you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump out of bed early in the morning</v>

106
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.840
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to go out today and pay my</v>

107
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:07.674
<v Speaker 3>lousy bills.</v>

108
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Rarely does that really create emotion</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drive inside of you.</v>

109
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Goals can create the power to make us</v>
<v Speaker 3>grow and expand and develop our success,</v>

110
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to have something out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that's compelling enough to draws</v>

111
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done properly and specifically they</v>

112
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.180
<v Speaker 3>transform our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my best and favorite examples is</v>

113
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:30.270
<v Speaker 3>a study that was done in 1953 at Yale</v>
<v Speaker 3>University.</v>

114
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 3>What they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an intensive study where they</v>

115
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Speaker 3>interviewed the graduating class just</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they left school and they asked</v>

116
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:39.750
<v Speaker 3>them a whole series of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the one that was most interesting</v>

117
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:43.170
<v Speaker 3>for me was they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you have a clear,</v>

118
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 3>specific set of goals with a written</v>
<v Speaker 3>plan for their achievement?</v>

119
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interestingly enough,</v>

120
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 3>as you might guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than 3% how to set of written goals</v>

121
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 3>with the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years later in 1973 they</v>

122
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>went back and interviewed the surviving</v>
<v Speaker 2>class members of the class of 53 and</v>

123
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>they interviewed these people to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what were their lives like.</v>

124
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing was the 3% that</v>

125
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 2>had written goals that specifically at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan for their attainment appeared to be</v>

126
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more well adjusted,</v>

127
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>more excited about their life as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>

128
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are subjective.</v>

129
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that's very measurable is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

130
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>The group of people who had written</v>
<v Speaker 2>goals were worth more in financial terms</v>

131
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>than the entire other 97% that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have goals combined.</v>

132
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the power of goal setting.</v>

133
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you in my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has transformed me that you can know</v>

134
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>all the techniques of how to condition</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to succeed,</v>

135
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't know why you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

136
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what it is you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving towards,</v>

137
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>then it's rare that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most out of yourself.</v>

138
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the unique good fortune.</v>

139
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 2>As I began to study some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies for optimum performance,</v>

140
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I was invited to go to Russia and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent over there approximately two</v>

141
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During that time,</v>

142
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I got a chance to explore many aspects</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Russia.</v>

143
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 2>We've got to go to the universities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to chance to meet with some of the</v>

144
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>people who were involved in optimum</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance technologies and in the</v>

145
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 2>process of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found myself on one stretch where I</v>

146
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 2>was on the Trans Siberian railway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's going literally from Moscow all</v>

147
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>the way to Siberia and then back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leningrad again.</v>

148
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about</v>

149
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 3>about a large stretch of land and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time to just think.</v>

150
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.580
<v Speaker 3>During that time I was just starting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop some my personal power.</v>

151
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I really hadn't created my life the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it,</v>

152
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.890
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like there was some</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities out there for me.</v>

153
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I was still living in my 400 square foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>bachelor apartment.</v>

154
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I was still overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still in a position where I really</v>

155
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 3>didn't have my life where I wanted it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of my relationships.</v>

156
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 3>But on that trip for two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

157
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>all I did was set goals and then for</v>
<v Speaker 3>another two or three days,</v>

158
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.320
<v Speaker 3>all I did was design plans and how it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to achieve them.</v>

159
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 3>And I set goals that were well beyond my</v>
<v Speaker 3>present ability or skill.</v>

160
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea how I was going to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>them happen and that's important.</v>

161
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.670
<v Speaker 3>But I operated from a principle that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about and every religion known to</v>

162
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:14.740
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So regardless of what you believe</v>

163
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 3>religiously or spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a common law and that is the power</v>

164
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:24.301
<v Speaker 3>of absolute total belief and faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I operated from the frame that if I</v>

165
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 3>could get inspired enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I found a goal that it was exciting</v>

166
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.830
<v Speaker 3>enough for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would figure out how to make it</v>

167
00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though right now it might seem</v>

168
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.900
<v Speaker 3>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would pull it off and I laid out goals</v>

169
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 3>for my life in virtually every area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

170
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 3>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socially,</v>

171
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 3>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

172
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 3>financially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I chunk down what do I want my life</v>

173
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 3>ultimately and what do I want right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of areas.</v>

174
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:49.241
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

175
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I can make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured I can get control of my</v>

176
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:54.580
<v Speaker 3>emotions and so I set goals about how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to be,</v>

177
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 3>how I wanted to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much joy I wanted to have,</v>

178
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 3>how much passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I would live every single day,</v>

179
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 3>the kind of person I wanted to be as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>

180
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 3>I described my relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I described the woman of my dreams in</v>

181
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 3>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took six pages to describe exactly the</v>

182
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 3>kind of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally,</v>

183
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 3>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socially,</v>

184
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 3>and spiritually I want in my life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically describe her in detail in</v>

185
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>addition to describing how I wanted my</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids to be.</v>

186
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I described everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he might say,</v>

187
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:21.451
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

188
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really creating a lot of</v>

189
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 3>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set goals and I look at them and then</v>

190
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I review them and see if they still make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense to me,</v>

191
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 3>but I did it in detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also did it in the area of finances</v>

192
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 3>and I said some pretty absurd goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided I want to make a quarter of $1</v>

193
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 3>million a year in personal income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the time I was making less than</v>

194
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 3>$3,000 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000 was a good month.</v>

195
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Guess what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came back.</v>

196
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I laid out this plan.</v>

197
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the plan on the back of a map,</v>

198
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 3>but I bought them Russia have it to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>day where I broke down the whole thing.</v>

199
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I show it oftentimes to people in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars so they get an idea where I was</v>

200
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 3>and what I actually created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just by designing the roadmaps necessary</v>

201
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.440
<v Speaker 3>for success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came back and began to implement it.</v>

202
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my plans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to tell you,</v>

203
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 3>it did not work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I achieved over 80% of my goals and</v>

204
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 3>less than 12 months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean massive change.</v>

205
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I went well beyond anything I dreamed</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

206
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I changed myself physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost all the weight.</v>

207
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I changed myself emotionally and develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>the confidence that was necessary.</v>

208
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I changed myself and my relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>massively.</v>

209
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 3>I attracted the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my dreams,</v>

210
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or about a year after that I had decided</v>

211
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to have four kids.</v>

212
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I got three instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a deal.</v>

213
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 3>I was on a roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took myself from totally broke</v>

214
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 3>financially to over a million dollar net</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth and lasts than 12 months.</v>

215
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about massive change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My life changed in every level.</v>

216
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you how much my confidence</v>

217
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.021
<v Speaker 3>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

218
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:46.531
<v Speaker 3>you might go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

219
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 3>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it did my level of confidence,</v>

220
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 3>my level of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ability to create rapport changed</v>

221
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 3>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

222
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:56.570
<v Speaker 3>and I also said finger goals besides my</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal development goals because I'd</v>

223
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 3>felt confident that I could probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish some of the development</v>

224
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 3>within myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like I can control that.</v>

225
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't control the outside world or my</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics or the ability to get things.</v>

226
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.340
<v Speaker 3>That was my hang up at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set goals for things like I was going</v>

227
00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 3>to have a limousine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stretch limousine.</v>

228
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how absurd.</v>

229
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I had a car that was breaking down</v>
<v Speaker 3>continuously at a stretch limousine</v>

230
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>within six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

231
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive change.</v>

232
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't imagine the kind of miracles</v>

233
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 3>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this sounds fluffy and bizarre,</v>

234
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 3>but it really works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when first time I went to</v>

235
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Fiji,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is my favorite place in the</v>

236
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

237
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been everywhere.</v>

238
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I've been to meet most of the major</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries in the world.</v>

239
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 3>This is the most beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing land I've ever been to.</v>

240
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to own a piece of property.</v>

241
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm this specific island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

242
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 3>I never would have thought in a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

243
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 3>The two years later after setting that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal,</v>

244
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't an island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 3>aren't that owned the resort namaly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the top three resorts in</v>

246
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Fiji now.</v>

247
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I go there four times a year with 20 of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my best friends and we all have a blast</v>

248
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.560
<v Speaker 3>and we set our goals there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

249
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>we look at our lives and balance it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have fun.</v>

250
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:01.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's just,</v>

251
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 3>if you were to try to tell me that two</v>
<v Speaker 3>years earlier,</v>

252
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are absolutely insane.</v>

253
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 3>You're nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way.</v>

254
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:08.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

255
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 3>get real and I'm here to tell you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get real,</v>

256
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 3>get intelligent because what's real to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you today is based on your past,</v>

257
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 3>based on your past experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you limit your future based on</v>

258
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 3>your passion are going to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to get the goals that are big</v>

259
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:26.410
<v Speaker 3>enough to drive you to excite you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't stop and go,</v>

260
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 3>how do I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the first step.</v>

261
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 3>The first step is get it down.</v>

262
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 3>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can create your island,</v>

263
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>your paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether that be something emotional</v>

264
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to create like a character</v>

265
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 3>change or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a behavior or habit or whether that's</v>

266
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 3>a business you want to start or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some kind of money you want to</v>

267
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 3>earn or something you want to do for</v>
<v Speaker 3>your children.</v>

268
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 3>And I'm telling you it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The magic that you've heard about and</v>

269
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:52.450
<v Speaker 3>dreamed about is real and it starts with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a simplistic process of taking these</v>

270
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 3>generalized impulses of desire and</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to define them with more</v>

271
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 3>precision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the power of goal setting and we</v>

272
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 3>don't understand totally how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something beyond just what we</v>

273
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're writing something down,</v>

274
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 3>something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You become a creator when you write down</v>

275
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 3>goals and you get clear as to absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you make them happen.</v>

276
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the key that we're going to touch</v>

277
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 3>on here in detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to make sure that you not only</v>

278
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 3>set goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get absolutely clear why you</v>

279
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 3>want them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a fundamental key to</v>

280
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 3>goal setting that changed my life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

281
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:32.101
<v Speaker 3>this purpose is stronger than outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I mean?</v>

282
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the purpose of goals is not</v>

283
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 3>so you get things the purpose of any</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal,</v>

284
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 3>the real reason to set goals is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will make of you as a person.</v>

285
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the end of your life,</v>

286
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 3>all the things that you accumulate are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to make you happy at the end</v>

287
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 3>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you're going to have is who you</v>

288
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 3>become as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment you've created in your life</v>

289
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 3>that you'll never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people in life,</v>

290
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>they go out and set goals and they do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>blindly.</v>

291
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all things that I want to have</v>

292
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 3>in my life and I focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say on things.</v>

293
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing wrong with focusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>on things.</v>

294
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I want you to have as many things as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

295
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 3>That's part of life too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the manifestation process</v>

296
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 3>of creating results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if all you do is focus on getting</v>

297
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may cost you some people in their</v>

298
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 3>desire to get things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have given up their own integrity of who</v>

299
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 3>they want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what they want to create in their</v>

300
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you gotta be careful of that.</v>

301
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to make sure when you set a</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal,</v>

302
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>you know why you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

303
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you might work real hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

304
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 3>to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I a thing oriented,</v>

305
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 3>let's say you want to make $1 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see $1 million only motivates you so</v>

306
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Becoming the kind of person who is able</v>

307
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>to manifest total abundance financially</v>
<v Speaker 3>and physically for themselves and the</v>

308
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>people around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's rather exciting.</v>

309
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Having the freedom that you think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money we'll give you or having the</v>

310
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:51.080
<v Speaker 3>ability to give or having the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things that you think that money will</v>

311
00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 3>give you are having more time.</v>

312
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>That will motivate you a lot more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the money.</v>

313
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem was setting goals is one.</v>

314
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Most people take them for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do it seriously and they</v>

315
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 2>don't do it consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it once a year and I do it at</v>

316
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 2>New Year's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were run under the New Year</v>

317
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They set a goal and they don't even look</v>

318
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 2>at it until a year later and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoops,</v>

319
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I kinda screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they set a new one so they have no</v>

320
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondly,</v>

321
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 2>they don't realize the power of goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take it lightly,</v>

322
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

323
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:18.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

324
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got these goals,</v>

325
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>but they don't make sure that they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it inside their head where it's</v>

326
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>absolutely real for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize that when they set a</v>

327
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now creating something in life.</v>

328
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest challenge I think,</v>

329
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 2>is that these people don't know why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going for their goals.</v>

330
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So the object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal itself,</v>

331
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.070
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the asset for a while.</v>

332
00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:39.904
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

333
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is different for everyone?</v>

334
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:47.740
<v Speaker 3>But you got to find out the reasons I</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe this reasons come first,</v>

335
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.610
<v Speaker 3>answers come second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a big enough reasons to do</v>

336
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:55.030
<v Speaker 3>something to accomplish something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out how to do it.</v>

337
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.250
<v Speaker 3>But if all you do is set up a goal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

338
00:15:57.251 --> 00:15:58.540
<v Speaker 3>oh Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to about it?</v>

339
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.630
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be inspired enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be compelling enough</v>

340
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.910
<v Speaker 3>for you to really create longterm</v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

341
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Every great success I know has figured</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the why behind their goals and</v>

342
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 3>that's their power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in our process on the next tape</v>

343
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:13.271
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we do,</v>

344
00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:16.780
<v Speaker 3>the goal setting workshop itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to spend a good deal of time</v>

345
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:21.100
<v Speaker 3>focusing on why do we want these goals</v>
<v Speaker 3>after we've identified them.</v>

346
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.830
<v Speaker 3>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to go about making it</v>

347
00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:24.160
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

348
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.740
<v Speaker 3>But that's secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to start from the frame that</v>

349
00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:28.990
<v Speaker 3>we can achieve anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as we think of it.</v>

350
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wants pointed out to me a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time ago,</v>

351
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:36.451
<v Speaker 3>that desire in its Latin form means of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father desire or thought.</v>

352
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.610
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

353
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 3>anything that I desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thought process has been given to</v>

354
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>me and with the ability to have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe instantly comes the ability to</v>

355
00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:51.520
<v Speaker 3>achieve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ability is built within us or we</v>

356
00:16:51.521 --> 00:16:53.350
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have the desire in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

357
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.210
<v Speaker 3>So come from that place and watch what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do to create a new reality of</v>

358
00:16:58.211 --> 00:17:00.880
<v Speaker 3>success in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've got a question for you.</v>

359
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you know why goals really work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well?</v>

360
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:06.220
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you what a few of mine</v>

361
00:17:06.221 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

362
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I believe that thoughts are things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever we focus on consistently,</v>

363
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 3>we experience in our life.</v>

364
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.670
<v Speaker 3>You and I know that's true from what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about earlier in this tape</v>

365
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.550
<v Speaker 3>that if I pay attention to one area of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life and I focused on it,</v>

366
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:20.650
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going to be real for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm going to feel.</v>

367
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.530
<v Speaker 3>I also believe that whatever we focus on</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently,</v>

368
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:26.320
<v Speaker 3>that our thoughts are things that as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think so you create,</v>

369
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 3>so your manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so part of goal setting is just by</v>

370
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:32.590
<v Speaker 3>having that focus and again having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent focus.</v>

371
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.860
<v Speaker 3>You can't just set goals one time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never look at them again and really</v>

372
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Speaker 3>expect longterm results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>

373
00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:39.340
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's better than not having any target</v>

374
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least your subconscious mind knows a</v>

375
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:45.010
<v Speaker 3>general direction to move in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the power is doing it consistently</v>

376
00:17:45.011 --> 00:17:48.280
<v Speaker 3>reviewing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but point number one is I really believe</v>

377
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>that if you focus something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll experience it.</v>

378
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you set a goal,</v>

379
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 3>there's an interesting dynamic that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens and that is when you set a goal,</v>

380
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 3>basically you're acknowledging to both</v>
<v Speaker 3>your conscious and subconscious minds</v>

381
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 3>that where you are right now is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you want to be,</v>

382
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 3>which is you begin to notice the</v>
<v Speaker 3>distinctions between where you want to</v>

383
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 3>be and where you are and as you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>that distinction,</v>

384
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.100
<v Speaker 3>your brain becomes dissatisfied and part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what motivates human action is a</v>

385
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 3>sense of dissatisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

386
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're totally comfortable and</v>

387
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 3>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling pleasure,</v>

388
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you're not super motivated and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes to make things happen.</v>

389
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Generally as a generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

390
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 3>when we get dissatisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we got some real power back.</v>

391
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I tell most people in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest traps that most</v>

392
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:40.010
<v Speaker 3>people fall into is called success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a lot of people,</v>

393
00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 3>success is a trap because what happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when they get successful,</v>

394
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes they tend to party.</v>

395
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 3>When they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to ponder and our that</v>

396
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 3>pondering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they make some new</v>

397
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 3>distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dissatisfaction is a power that you want</v>

398
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 3>to take advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not something for you to try and hide</v>

399
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 3>yourself out from there is real power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find some things you want to move</v>

400
00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:03.030
<v Speaker 3>away from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because look,</v>

401
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 3>pressure is what creates human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure intention,</v>

402
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 3>our primary drivers of our actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

403
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never ridiculously simple level.</v>

404
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.960
<v Speaker 3>What makes you want to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it not a certain level of pressure or</v>

405
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 3>tension?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it makes you want to eliminate</v>

406
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.180
<v Speaker 3>during the day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pressure or tension you're buying.</v>

407
00:19:22.181 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 3>It makes you want to get up and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>that action.</v>

408
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 3>What makes you want to make love and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>with somebody?</v>

409
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that creates that feeling.</v>

410
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Learning to manage pressure and tension</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life is probably one of the</v>

411
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 3>basic fundamental lessons we all must</v>
<v Speaker 3>master if we really want to have a</v>

412
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 3>balanced life where we really feel happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and successful,</v>

413
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 3>but learning use pressure and goal</v>
<v Speaker 3>setting is absolutely critical with</v>

414
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:49.110
<v Speaker 3>literally no pressure to go for it.</v>

415
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.550
<v Speaker 3>We have no motivation and so a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of pressure is generated.</v>

416
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 3>When you clearly define what it is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and you see that you aren't there,</v>

417
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 3>it creates a gestalt where your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

418
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:01.201
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want that.</v>

419
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not satisfied where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you begin to have that derive.</v>

420
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Don't hide out from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome it.</v>

421
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Look at it every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pressure isn't necessarily negative.</v>

422
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 3>It can be very positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

423
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.300
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it as a tool for</v>
<v Speaker 3>influencing yourself to take consistent</v>

424
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 3>action towards your success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you all know the metaphor,</v>

425
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean pressures,</v>

426
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:25.530
<v Speaker 3>how diamonds are created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just rocks a gun under intense</v>

427
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 3>pressure and now the turned into a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to use that same metaphor for</v>

428
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 3>yourself and use goals as a way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressuring yourself cause see,</v>

429
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I think about goal setting,</v>

430
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

431
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to like commit to somebody</v>

432
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>else about this thing because then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel all this pressure.</v>

433
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fabulous.</v>

434
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 3>That means you're not going to back out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

435
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I decided a year ago,</v>

436
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 3>I was going to work out every single day</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to exercise.</v>

437
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.690
<v Speaker 3>I realize the best way to make sure I</v>
<v Speaker 3>kept that commitment was number one,</v>

438
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:55.050
<v Speaker 3>understand why I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just salmon,</v>

439
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 3>exercise to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realized in order to accomplish</v>

440
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 3>the level of goals that I have in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

441
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I need an abundance of physical energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrancy,</v>

442
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>so I have something to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have something that can drive me</v>

443
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 3>without that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ended up running out of emotional</v>

444
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 3>gas while I'm continually driving up</v>
<v Speaker 3>this mountain called success.</v>

445
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't want to float down running</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of fuel and I decided I'm going to</v>

446
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 3>keep that up every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And being physically violent requires a</v>

447
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>certain level of exercise.</v>

448
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 3>So I understood why and I linked it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>having better relationships.</v>

449
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I linked it to having more energy for my</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

450
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I linked it to how it feel emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I linked it to my level of physical</v>

451
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 3>vibrancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I linked it to my business success.</v>

452
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I linked it to my ability to contribute</v>
<v Speaker 3>to others,</v>

453
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 3>but we had a lot of motivation going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

454
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 3>But in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I also did is I use pressure and I</v>

455
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 3>went around and on several of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>

456
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 3>specifically on one I do for business</v>
<v Speaker 3>people especially called the power to</v>

457
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 3>influence one for salespeople.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not burger.</v>

458
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 3>I made it really clear that the only way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to succeed was demand more from yourself</v>

459
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 3>and other people would expect and that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had decided and what absolutely exercise</v>

460
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 3>every day of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might reevaluate in the future,</v>

461
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'd do it this year and I've kept it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm telling it to you do so I have</v>

462
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 3>to commit even more.</v>

463
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a way to turn back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you follow me?</v>

464
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Use pressure to your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use committing to certain people,</v>

465
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 3>to your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that will not let you off the</v>

466
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the why sometimes you</v>

467
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 3>don't feel like doing anymore and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only why is hey,</v>

468
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want to not keep my</v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

469
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it takes to get you to follow</v>

470
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Speaker 3>through and create results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this tape today is designed for</v>

471
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:33.181
<v Speaker 3>primarily only one purpose and that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get you clear on the power of goal</v>

472
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 3>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it can do to change you and the</v>

473
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 3>critical element to success and goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is creating a strong enough why</v>

474
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 3>and enough pressure to follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways we can create a strong</v>

475
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 3>enough why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

476
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 3>is not just to write down the positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise.</v>

477
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

478
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I want this goal because it'll give me</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this in my life or I'll be able</v>

479
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 3>to contribute this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in addition,</v>

480
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 3>I've learned to create some of the quote</v>
<v Speaker 3>unquote negative wise,</v>

481
00:22:58.091 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 3>something I would never would have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

482
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:00.341
<v Speaker 3>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

483
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 3>that's been a negative person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I mean specifically is when I</v>

484
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 3>set goals now I not only write down why</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely committed to making that</v>

485
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.901
<v Speaker 3>goal a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also now write down why am I going</v>

486
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 3>to get this and I do it from the frame</v>
<v Speaker 3>of if I don't achieve this,</v>

487
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 3>what would it cost me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I get a list of whys of prices I'd</v>

488
00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 3>have to pay not to have the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause see what we want to do to get</v>

489
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 3>ourselves to succeed is link pleasure to</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the goal and pain to not getting</v>

490
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:28.780
<v Speaker 3>the goal.</v>

491
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 3>That way our brain will be driven to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our resources to make it happen.</v>

492
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I know for some of you it may sound</v>

493
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 3>negative to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what would it cost me if it didn't</v>

494
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think if you understand how the</v>

495
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:43.360
<v Speaker 3>human brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to use the carrot and the stick.</v>

496
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey we're in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do this with anything with ourselves</v>

497
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and if we don't like her goals we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>change them at any time.</v>

498
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Part of the power of goal setting is</v>
<v Speaker 3>flexibility,</v>

499
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 3>not just getting stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause a years ago you set a goal</v>

500
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 3>reevaluating and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on where I am and now my wife,</v>

501
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 3>is that still the right goal for me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the right direction?</v>

502
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I encourage people to set goals no less</v>
<v Speaker 3>than twice a year.</v>

503
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And I have them review their goals in</v>
<v Speaker 3>detail at least once a month and review</v>

504
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 3>their top goals daily.</v>

505
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 3>It is that kind of consistent review</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll keep you on track and produce</v>

506
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 3>those results that you're committed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right now the purpose again today is</v>

507
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>to get you clear and how to unleash this</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

508
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 3>And part of that power is the power of</v>
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>

509
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want things on the positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the power of being dissatisfied?</v>

510
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 3>So here's your exercise for today and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then tomorrow we're going to actually</v>

511
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 3>unleash you into a goal setting</v>
<v Speaker 3>workshop.</v>

512
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 3>And you might want to review and listen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the tape again.</v>

513
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 3>So you're inspired when you go to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that exercise.</v>

514
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Because I want you to really come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and know you're about to create</v>

515
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 3>real results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you start that workshop today,</v>

516
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 3>they'll pull out your success journal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's your assignment.</v>

517
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 3>What I'd like you to do is I want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write down two things.</v>

518
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are some of the areas of your life</v>

519
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 3>you are dissatisfied with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

520
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to feel bad negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

521
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.620
<v Speaker 3>but just be honest with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are some of the areas of your life</v>

522
00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 3>that are not enough?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good enough.</v>

523
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:06.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deserve it to be,</v>

524
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 3>if not where you're committed to having</v>
<v Speaker 3>a b.</v>

525
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Take a look at yourself physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally,</v>

526
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 3>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually,</v>

527
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.480
<v Speaker 3>financially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your relationships.</v>

528
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 3>So the question I want you to ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself is,</v>

529
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 3>what's not good in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I not satisfied with?</v>

530
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And get inspired as you write it down</v>
<v Speaker 3>because whatever you write down,</v>

531
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's number one.</v>

532
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 3>And make a good list of things you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissatisfied with that will create some</v>

533
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 3>pressure inside of you to create some</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful new goals.</v>

534
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.150
<v Speaker 3>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write down what kind of beliefs,</v>

535
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:37.810
<v Speaker 3>what I have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are a couple of additional beliefs</v>

536
00:25:37.811 --> 00:25:41.990
<v Speaker 3>since we've talked about that earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are two or three other beliefs that</v>

537
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:45.380
<v Speaker 3>I would probably need to have in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really set goals and achieve them?</v>

538
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 3>What are two or three new beliefs I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>need the live by in order to really</v>

539
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 3>start achieving my goals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your simple assignment for today.</v>

540
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Just leave today with a focus on getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>big enough wise.</v>

541
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 3>The power of why is the power to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dreams.</v>

542
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll see you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember live with passion</v>

543
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I did and what absolutely exercise every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day of this year.</v>

544
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I might reevaluate in the future but I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it this year and I've kept it and I'm</v>

545
00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:34.600
<v Speaker 3>telling it to you do so I have to commit</v>
<v Speaker 3>even more.</v>

546
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a way to turn back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you follow me?</v>

547
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Use pressure to your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use committing to certain people,</v>

548
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 3>to your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that will not let you off the</v>

549
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

550
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.730
<v Speaker 2>part of the why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't feel like doing it</v>

551
00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>anymore and the only why his hey cause I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to not keep my word.</v>

552
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it takes to get you to follow</v>

553
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:56.790
<v Speaker 2>through and create results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this tape today is designed for</v>

554
00:26:56.791 --> 00:27:01.791
<v Speaker 2>primarily only one purpose and that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get you clear on the power of goal</v>

555
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 2>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it can do to change you and the</v>

556
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:09.600
<v Speaker 2>critical element to success and goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is creating a strong enough why</v>

557
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 2>and enough pressure to follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the ways we can create a strong</v>

558
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 2>enough why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

559
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 2>is not just to write down the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>wise.</v>

560
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

561
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I want this goal because it'll give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this in my life or I'll be able</v>

562
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>to contribute this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in addition,</v>

563
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to create some of the quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquote negative wise,</v>

564
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 2>something I would never would have done</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

565
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:28.921
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

566
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 2>that's been a negative person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I mean specifically is when I</v>

567
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 2>set goals now and only write down why</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely committed to making that</v>

568
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:41.481
<v Speaker 2>goal a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also now write down why am I going</v>

569
00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 2>to get this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do it from the frame of if I don't</v>

570
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 2>achieve this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it cost me?</v>

571
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 2>And I get a list of whys of prices I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to pay not to have the goal.</v>

572
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Cause see what we want to do to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves to succeed is link pleasure to</v>

573
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 2>getting the goal and pain to not getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal.</v>

574
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.620
<v Speaker 2>That way our brain will be driven to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our resources to make it happen.</v>

575
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know for some of you it may sound</v>

576
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:07.380
<v Speaker 2>negative to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what would it cost me if it didn't</v>

577
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

578
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.110
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you understand how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human brain works,</v>

579
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 2>we want to use the carrot and the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey we're in charge,</v>

580
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 2>we can do this with anything with</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and we don't like her goals.</v>

581
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:18.990
<v Speaker 2>We can change them at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the power of goal setting is</v>

582
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 2>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just getting stuck.</v>

583
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Cause a years ago you set a goal where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you evaluating the same based on where I</v>

584
00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>am and now my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that still the right goal for me?</v>

585
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Is that the right direction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I encourage people to set goals no less</v>

586
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:33.450
<v Speaker 2>than twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have them review their goals in</v>

587
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 2>detail at least once a month and review</v>
<v Speaker 2>their top goals daily.</v>

588
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 2>It is that kind of consistent review</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll keep you on track and produce</v>

589
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:45.270
<v Speaker 2>those results that you're committed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now,</v>

590
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.440
<v Speaker 2>the purpose again today is to get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear and how to unleash this power.</v>

591
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.560
<v Speaker 2>And part of that power is the power of</v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

592
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want things on the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the power of being dissatisfied?</v>

593
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.510
<v Speaker 2>So here's your exercise for today and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then tomorrow we're going to actually</v>

594
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.390
<v Speaker 2>unleash you into a goal setting</v>
<v Speaker 2>workshop.</v>

595
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And you might want to review and listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this tape again.</v>

596
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 2>So you're inspired when you go to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exercise.</v>

597
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Because I want you to really come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and know you're about to create</v>

598
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 2>real results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you start that workshop today</v>

599
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out your success journal and here's</v>

600
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:18.240
<v Speaker 2>your assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'd like you to do is I want you to</v>

601
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 2>write down two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

602
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 2>what are some of the areas of your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are dissatisfied with?</v>

603
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to feel bad,</v>

604
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>real negative about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just be honest with yourself.</v>

605
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>What are some of the areas of your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not enough?</v>

606
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what you deserve it to be,</v>

607
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:36.780
<v Speaker 2>if not where you're committed to having</v>
<v Speaker 2>it be.</v>

608
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at yourself physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>

609
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually,</v>

610
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 2>financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

611
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>your relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So question,</v>

612
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 3>I want you to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what's not good in my life?</v>

613
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 3>What am I not satisfied with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And get inspired as you write it down</v>

614
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 3>because whatever you write down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to change.</v>

615
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's number one and make a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>list of things you're dissatisfied with</v>

616
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 3>that will create some pressure inside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to create some powerful new goals.</v>

617
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 3>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write down what kind of beliefs,</v>

618
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:06.390
<v Speaker 3>what I have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are a couple of additional beliefs?</v>

619
00:30:06.391 --> 00:30:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Since we've talked about that earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are two or three other beliefs that</v>

620
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 3>I would probably need to have in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really set goals and achieve them?</v>

621
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 3>What are two or three new beliefs I'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to live by in order to really start</v>

622
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 3>achieving my goals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your simple assignment for today.</v>

623
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Just leave today with a focus on getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>big enough wise,</v>

624
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 3>the power of why is the power to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dreams.</v>
