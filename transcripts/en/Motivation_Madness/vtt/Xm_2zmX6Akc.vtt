1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you differentiate the utility of</v>

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>behavioral slash psychotherapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments for conditions like</v>

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>depression versus medical treatments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing I would say is don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate the utility of medical</v>

5
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is a cat,</v>

6
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It carries with it a very high suicide</v>

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.851
<v Speaker 1>rate and it also levels people out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard on their families and</v>

8
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>so and it and it's physiologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily damaging.</v>

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're in a depressive state</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's severe,</v>

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>you can try an antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll know in a month if it works,</v>

11
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>if it works well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll help you get your life</v>

12
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we could say,</v>

13
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're depressed because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't very well together.</v>

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people are depressed,</v>

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>their life is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't fine because no one's life is</v>

16
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's life is a tragedy,</v>

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes people have their lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

18
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>as much as you could expect anyone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

19
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>They have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an intimate relationship,</v>

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>they have a career that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're qualified,</v>

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>industrious people working hard on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>and really playing a minimum number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>games with themselves and they're</v>

25
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>terribly depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant man that's sometimes that</v>

26
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>will just fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so hooray,</v>

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you were biological entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

28
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>if there's something out there that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you strengthen yourself so that you</v>

29
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>can prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

30
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

31
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone takes antidepressants,</v>

32
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's taking them.</v>

33
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one takes those bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>things without serious consideration.</v>

34
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Half the time I spend with my clients</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are depressed is often the two years</v>

35
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>long attempt to get them to tentatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>try an antidepressant because there are</v>

36
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>so guilty that they're relying on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>external crutch to sort out their lives</v>

37
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>that they can't even tolerate it.</v>

38
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.401
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

39
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>well look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you had diabetes?</v>

40
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to take your insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got stressed.</v>

41
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>He blew out at your weakest point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you get</v>

42
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's something out there that</v>

43
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>might help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like try it for God's sake.</v>

44
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll know in a month and you'd just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop if it doesn't work.</v>

45
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

46
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a multidimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

47
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.681
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>do you have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship?</v>

49
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you pursuing one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a reasonable career or you</v>

50
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>as educated as you are intelligent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have something useful to do with</v>

51
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>your time outside of work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?</v>

52
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Are there other behavioral issues like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep dysregulation and lack of eating</v>

53
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>that are contributing to the pathology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to differentiate all of that</v>

54
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and wherever you can make a behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention so much the better,</v>

55
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with people whose lives</v>

56
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>are so racked that they don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to start.</v>

57
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>They're different than the ones who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in order to say and you say,</v>

58
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this man.</v>

59
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you won't cut your throat in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next month because if your dad,</v>

60
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hard to work with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

61
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>so medical interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

62
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do what it's necessary to get better</v>

63
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>and you leave your pride behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

64
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>If you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that says nothing about the utility</v>

65
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>of the behavioral interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to hit the problem with</v>

66
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.611
<v Speaker 1>everything you have at your disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some antidepressants especially</v>

67
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>especially for people whose lives are</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and who are depressed,</v>

68
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants can be absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous.</v>

69
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So you know when you hear about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical evidence in their favor being</v>

70
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>iffy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because the diagnosis</v>

71
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>of depression isn't very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated.</v>

72
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>It's very different to have a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>life than to be depressed and</v>

73
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants can only help you so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much if you have a terrible life.</v>

74
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.053
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

75
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.063
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

76
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 3>you want to stay inside this little map</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's working.</v>

77
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 3>You want to get from point a to point a</v>
<v Speaker 3>to point b and this is good.</v>

78
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.670
<v Speaker 3>This indicates that you are moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

79
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing it indicates and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second thing it indicates,</v>

80
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.060
<v Speaker 3>which is even more important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll never hear this from</v>

81
00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:08.030
<v Speaker 3>behavioral psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that your map is correct.</v>

82
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.600
<v Speaker 3>So every time you move a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward and something that you want</v>

83
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:12.411
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

84
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:14.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game I'm playing is the right gate.</v>

85
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 3>And so not only does the reward indicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>

86
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:23.300
<v Speaker 3>it indicates that the frame within which</v>
<v Speaker 3>progress is being calculated is the</v>

87
00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 3>right frame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's good because it's the frame</v>

88
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 3>that makes things irrelevant and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want them to stay irrelevant.</v>

89
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.190
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't move forward and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>start to question the frame that's way</v>

90
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.140
<v Speaker 3>worse than merely not moving forward.</v>

91
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 3>You get a bad exam grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

92
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 3>What the hell am I doing in university</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways?</v>

93
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like probably that's not the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place you should go with that piece of</v>

94
00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

95
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

96
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Why is that worse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

97
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your map of view as university student</v>

98
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.480
<v Speaker 3>is a comprehensive representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tells you what you should do every</v>

99
00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:58.100
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of tells you where you're going</v>

100
00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.370
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if something emerges as an anomaly,</v>

101
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you get worse grade than you expected</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you blow that whole map.</v>

102
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:06.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

103
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 3>what have you been doing for the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years?</v>

104
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 3>What kind of high school student were</v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

105
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.350
<v Speaker 3>How clueless are you about how you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>arranging your future?</v>

106
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.900
<v Speaker 3>What's your identity going to be if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be a student,</v>

107
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.850
<v Speaker 3>where are you going to end up in five</v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

108
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a that little grade,</v>

109
00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 3>that bad grade is like a portal through</v>
<v Speaker 3>which snakes can crawl and that's</v>

110
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:26.450
<v Speaker 3>exactly how you respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you open the door too</v>

111
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.141
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

112
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 3>maybe this means that I shouldn't be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

113
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the rules is don't you want to.</v>

114
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You want to constrain the anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 3>event to the minimal necessary domain.</v>

115
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

116
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 3>You want to do that when you're arguing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your partner,</v>

117
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 3>which will do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have an argument,</v>

118
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should never have married you.</v>

119
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.251
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

120
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the first response.</v>

121
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.350
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or here's a really good one.</v>

122
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 3>You've always done that sort of thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you always will.</v>

123
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh good,</v>

124
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the only answer to that is to</v>

125
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 3>hit someone because like you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

126
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Your your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've always been like that.</v>

127
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a chance that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>repaired and none of it is acceptable.</v>

128
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like the person's gonna fight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you right away because what else are</v>

129
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you want to do is you want to</v>

130
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 3>minimize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't rationalization.</v>

131
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.251
<v Speaker 3>You want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

132
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 3>this person did something that disrupted</v>
<v Speaker 3>our joint map.</v>

133
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the smallest possible thing they</v>

134
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 3>could do to put it back together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to know,</v>

135
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to make a plan so you don't do</v>

136
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we need to have a discussion so that</v>

137
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 3>you know that it wasn't a good thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

138
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to go after your whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

139
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say when I come home</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're watching TV,</v>

140
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 3>just come to the door and say hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

141
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>don't you love me?</v>

142
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

143
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:46.971
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

144
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 3>you just have to walk to the door and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like give me a hug or something,</v>

145
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 3>and then that's good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then the other person might be</v>

146
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 3>able to tolerate that much corrective</v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

147
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if you're kind of Nice about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you also understand that they're</v>

148
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 3>probably going to have something equally</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible to say about you in the next 15</v>

149
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 3>minutes because you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something stupid so so you don't wanna</v>

150
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to open the door so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>every possible snake comes crawling</v>

151
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 3>through because that's a pathway to</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression and you actually see that</v>

152
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:20.381
<v Speaker 3>happening in depressed people is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>every small event produces a cascade</v>

153
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 3>through their entire value system and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they end up saying,</v>

154
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just another reason that I should</v>

155
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 3>jump off a bridge and they really see it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

156
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 3>It's really awful because they've got no</v>
<v Speaker 3>defenses.</v>

157
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.604
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

158
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do so well in this course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm going to get a bad mark</v>

159
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>and they or an exam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get bad mark in the course</v>

160
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 3>that's going to screw up my ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>finish my degree.</v>

161
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to get into the field of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my choice.</v>

162
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just another piece of indication</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm useless and that life isn't</v>

163
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

164
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to jump off a bridge and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really depressed,</v>

165
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like each of those things hits you</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the certainty of truth.</v>

166
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's really not good and so you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be careful.</v>

167
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 3>You want to be careful about walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>down that pathway when you make a</v>

168
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:02.151
<v Speaker 3>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

169
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the narrowest framework of</v>

170
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 3>interpretation within which I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand this.</v>

171
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 3>That will require minimal behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 3>change to decrease the probability that</v>

172
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 3>it will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

173
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 3>it's mental hygiene fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

174
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get to that.</v>

175
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>We'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the next question.</v>

176
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>It's because they don't exist in</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation,</v>

177
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 3>so and that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frequently when when you,</v>

178
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>when you hear behavioral accounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive processes,</v>

179
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>they generally only focus on it as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an isolated thing.</v>

180
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

181
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 3>It's scalable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's scalable.</v>

182
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of ways it scalable temporarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you do now is associated</v>

183
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>with what you'll do tomorrow and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what you'll do next week and so</v>

184
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it has to be scalable temporarily and</v>

185
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 3>it's also scalable socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

186
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 3>so it has an effect on you that has an</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on your family that has an effect</v>

187
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 3>on the community and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you don't want to take.</v>

188
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to think through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect of your auction and all those</v>

189
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 3>scaling level simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

190
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 3>but you have mechanisms that allow you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that and we'll see.</v>

191
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that the sense of let's assume</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not lying to yourself</v>

192
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 3>constantly so your head isn't full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and garbage and you have</v>

193
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 3>reasonable relationships with people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

194
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is leaping way ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that your sense of meaningful</v>

195
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 3>engagement with what you're doing is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychophysiological marker,</v>

196
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 3>that you're acting in a way that takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the stacked representations into</v>

197
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 3>account simultaneously because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

198
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.400
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

199
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to figure out where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are and you might think,</v>

200
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means where I am in this room,</v>

201
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this room is not a simple thing,</v>

202
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nested.</v>

203
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a subset of the university that's a</v>

204
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 3>subset of society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a subset of your life.</v>

205
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 3>The room is a complicated thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to figure out where you should be</v>

206
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 3>in the room and you can't do that shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>surely with perception because all you</v>

207
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 3>see is me and some of the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

208
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 3>It's you got this little narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little narrow portal and so you</v>

209
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:17.190
<v Speaker 3>can't really rely on your perceptions to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orient you,</v>

210
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 3>but you do Orient Yourself and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do is you.</v>

211
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 3>It's engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like does this seem meaningful and</v>

212
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 3>deep and engaging?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

213
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Then it's an indication that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>serving multiple masters,</v>

214
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 3>similar caneously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so both maybe both socially and also</v>

215
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 3>temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the sense of meaning is</v>

216
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 3>actually an instinct that orients people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in time and space.</v>

217
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not an EPA phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most fundamental form of</v>

218
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 3>perception and that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic thought that I've ever been</v>

219
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 3>able to derive from psychology is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually could be true.</v>

220
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 3>It could be that the sense of meaning is</v>
<v Speaker 3>an orienting reflex and that would be</v>

221
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 3>wonderful if it was true because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would make it real,</v>

222
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the,</v>

223
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one of the devastating elements of</v>

224
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 3>nihilism is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

225
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 3>who the hell cares what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what differences are going to make in a</v>

226
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 3>million years?</v>

227
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like your sense of meaning is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>an illusion.</v>

228
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

229
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>you're limited creature in a limited</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and nothing you do really matters.</v>

230
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's a powerful argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're an objective</v>

231
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 3>materialist in a reductionist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a killer argument,</v>

232
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 3>but it looks to me like it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually wrong because meaning</v>

233
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 3>looks to me like it's an actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

234
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 3>It does say that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're positioned properly between chaos</v>

235
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 3>and order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

236
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a real so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

237
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to develop that argument</v>

238
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's real,</v>

239
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 3>you want to know that because it gives</v>
<v Speaker 3>you something to stand on.</v>

240
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's as real as pain,</v>

241
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something positive and you need</v>

242
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 3>something positive that you can rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

243
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 3>so and psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

244
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 3>err too much on the side of the subject.</v>

245
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.390
<v Speaker 3>They tend to think that too much of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>is inside of you and too little of you</v>

246
00:12:08.391 --> 00:12:13.391
<v Speaker 3>is outside of you and part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that is because of my clinical</v>

247
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the psychoanalyst man.</v>

248
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 3>They're brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're brilliant or deep.</v>

249
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 3>They grapple with real problems like</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the problems.</v>

250
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 3>When people have real problems and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean profound problems.</v>

251
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 3>They're really profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moral problems or problems of good and</v>

252
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 3>evil really know there are things going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in their family that are so terrible</v>

253
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 3>that well that there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some times fatal,</v>

254
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lie upon,</v>

255
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:45.580
<v Speaker 3>lie upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lie upon lie for decades and decades and</v>

256
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.020
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful</v>

257
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's not exactly inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's out there in the world and lots of</v>

258
00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:04.820
<v Speaker 3>the people that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very famous critic of psychology,</v>

259
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I probably will</v>

260
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 3>criticized the practice of psychology</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite effectively in the believe in the</v>

261
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 3>early sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Myth of mental illness by Thomas</v>

262
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:21.990
<v Speaker 3>says zed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a s zed,</v>

263
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 3>it's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should read it if you're interested</v>

264
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 3>in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read it like it's a classic,</v>

265
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 3>and he basically said most people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in living.</v>

266
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 3>They don't have psychological problem,</v>

267
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 3>and so I've experienced despite my love</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the psychoanalysts,</v>

268
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 3>very frequently what I'm doing as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapist is helping people have a life</v>

269
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 3>that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

270
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 3>and you can parameterize that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

271
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.770
<v Speaker 3>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about some friends that people kind</v>

272
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 3>of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about an intimate relationship with</v>

273
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 3>someone that you can trust that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a future.</v>

274
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 3>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about a career that puts you in a</v>

275
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy somewhere so at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least you've got some possibility of</v>

276
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 3>rising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some possibility of stabilizing yourself</v>

277
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 3>and our schedule and a routine because</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one can live without a routine.</v>

278
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 3>You just forget that if you guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a routine,</v>

279
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I would recommend like you get one going</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you cannot be mentally healthy</v>

280
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>without a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to pick a time to get up</v>

281
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever time you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pick one and stick to it because</v>

282
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:34.351
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you disregulate your circadian</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhythms and they regulate your mood and</v>

283
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 3>eat something.</v>

284
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 3>In the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had lots of clients who have that</v>

285
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 3>anxiety disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hired one client who was literally</v>

286
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 3>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart girl.</v>

287
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.540
<v Speaker 3>She was very little that she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She kind of tried to subsist on like</v>

288
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 3>half a cup of rice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came to me and said,</v>

289
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come home.</v>

290
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 3>All I want to do is watch the same movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over.</v>

291
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:56.564
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

292
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 3>is that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

293
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the art work.</v>

294
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little weird,</v>

295
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 3>but whatever it's familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking for comfort.</v>

296
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.810
<v Speaker 3>So I did an analysis of her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like three quarters of a cup of</v>

297
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 3>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're starving,</v>

298
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 3>eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

299
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she modified her diet and you're all</v>

300
00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:24.490
<v Speaker 3>are anxiety went away and she had some</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

301
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

302
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.630
<v Speaker 3>you got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So schedule.</v>

303
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain will.</v>

304
00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will stabilize your nervous system</v>

305
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.740
<v Speaker 3>when it's a bit of a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing.</v>

306
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.040
<v Speaker 3>You need a career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need something productive to do with</v>

307
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:45.760
<v Speaker 3>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to regulate your use of drugs</v>

308
00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 3>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most particularly alcoholic is that does</v>

309
00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 3>eating a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

310
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.480
<v Speaker 3>any your family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the family,</v>

311
00:15:55.481 --> 00:15:57.310
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents and all that,</v>

312
00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.800
<v Speaker 3>it'd be nice if you all got along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could work on that.</v>

313
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

314
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably need children at some</v>

315
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's life.</v>

316
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what life is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're missing,</v>

317
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may have a good reason to not be</v>

318
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 3>operating on one of those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not mandatory,</v>

319
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.070
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you that if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>operating reasonably well on four,</v>

320
00:16:21.071 --> 00:16:23.740
<v Speaker 3>I think I mentioned six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not operating reasonably well</v>

321
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:28.000
<v Speaker 3>on at least three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you're going to be</v>

322
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.870
<v Speaker 3>psychologically thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's more pragmatic in some sense</v>

323
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 3>than psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

324
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Human beings have a nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's things we need and if we have</v>

325
00:16:40.181 --> 00:16:41.200
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's good.</v>

326
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 3>And if we don't have them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then we feel the lack.</v>

327
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.250
<v Speaker 3>So behaviorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioral psychologists concentrate a</v>

328
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 3>lot more on that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

329
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.320
<v Speaker 3>it's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like strategizing.</v>

330
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Make a career plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to negotiate because</v>

331
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.720
<v Speaker 3>that's bloody important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figuring out how to say what you need,</v>

332
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He figured out how to listen to your</v>

333
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:08.920
<v Speaker 3>partner in particular because if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to them,</v>

334
00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:12.970
<v Speaker 3>they will actually tell you what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and sometimes you can give it to</v>

335
00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 3>them and maybe they'll return the favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you practice that for like 15</v>

336
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:20.020
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then maybe you're constantly giving</v>

337
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.090
<v Speaker 3>each other what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Hooray.</v>

338
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 3>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's two of you under all</v>

339
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:31.121
<v Speaker 3>circumstances and it's better to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>two brains than one because people think</v>

340
00:17:31.991 --> 00:17:33.970
<v Speaker 3>differently because of their temperament</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly.</v>

341
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And so the negotiation is where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom arises and it's part of the</v>

342
00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:42.970
<v Speaker 3>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychological transformation that's</v>

343
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:47.380
<v Speaker 3>attendant on an intimate relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the fundamental purposes of a</v>

344
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.120
<v Speaker 3>longterm intimate relationship.</v>

345
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 4>So we're starting to be able to put the</v>
<v Speaker 4>traits to sort of nail the traits down</v>

346
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 4>to their underlying biology with regards</v>
<v Speaker 4>to neuroticism.</v>

347
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

348
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 4>you're more sensitive to anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's regulated at least in part by the</v>

349
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 4>hippocampus and and generated in part by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Amygdala.</v>

350
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 4>There's another part of the brain called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the [inaudible] aqueduct will gray.</v>

351
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience of pain and pain is quite a</v>

352
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 4>complex phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depression is pain.</v>

353
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Like grief is pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like social isolation is pain.</v>

354
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Like disappointment is pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's anxiety components to that</v>

355
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so neuroticism seems to be something</v>

356
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 4>like threshold for activation in those</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative emotions systems.</v>

357
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 4>So if you're higher in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one unit of uncertainty might produce,</v>

358
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 4>let's say three units of</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychophysiological response.</v>

359
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you're lower in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one unit of uncertainty might produce</v>

360
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 4>one unit of psychophysiological</v>
<v Speaker 4>response.</v>

361
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 4>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously that's a simplified schematic,</v>

362
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 4>but there's variability because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>something unexpected or threatening</v>

363
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 4>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't obvious how upset you should</v>

364
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 4>get one answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what might be a brush it off?</v>

365
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now their answer might be it's a bloody</v>

366
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe and often when something</v>
<v Speaker 4>uncertain or threatening occurs,</v>

367
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 4>you don't have enough information at</v>
<v Speaker 4>your disposal to make a full</v>

368
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 4>determination of the potential impact of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

369
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 4>of the circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's uncertain and so then</v>

370
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Speaker 4>you have to guess at how upset you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be and where you are on the</v>

371
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 4>normal distribution with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 4>trait neuroticism.</v>

372
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 4>Say that sort of determines what your</v>
<v Speaker 4>guests on average is going to be.</v>

373
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 4>So you know the other with</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness say it might say,</v>

374
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how hard should you work?</v>

375
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really difficult question.</v>

376
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to die tomorrow and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably shouldn't work very hard</v>

377
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 4>today at all.</v>

378
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Speaker 4>So one thing you might say is that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree to which you should work hard is</v>

379
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 4>dependent on your assumptions about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stability of the future.</v>

380
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.410
<v Speaker 4>We actually know this to be true because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you put people in wildly uncertain</v>

381
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 4>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they discount the future,</v>

382
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

383
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:07.341
<v Speaker 4>It's only makes sense to store up goods</v>
<v Speaker 4>for future consumption if the future is</v>

384
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 4>likely to be very similar to the past</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the present.</v>

385
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 4>You need a stable society for that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness only works in in a</v>

386
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:17.910
<v Speaker 4>stable society because all you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise,</v>

387
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 4>if you're piling up goods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is Kinda what conscientious people</v>

388
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is leaving them there for the criminals</v>

389
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 4>to take or waiting for the next chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>upheaval to wipe out everything that</v>

390
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 4>you've stored and so even</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness is a kind of guess,</v>

391
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 4>hardworking people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

392
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sacrifice the present for the future.</v>

393
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 4>That's great as long as the future is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be there and you can predict</v>

394
00:20:38.731 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's not going to be there and</v>

395
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Speaker 4>it's unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the right response is take what you</v>

396
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 4>can take right now while the getting's</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

397
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there are troubles with that</v>

398
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:49.181
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

399
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know I'm,</v>

400
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm offering rough rules of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm trying to provide you with some</v>

401
00:20:56.081 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 4>indication of how and why these</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference in value structures exist</v>

402
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.190
<v Speaker 4>because they're are applicable in</v>
<v Speaker 4>different environments.</v>

403
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes in a dangerous social</v>

404
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious that being an</v>

405
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:11.110
<v Speaker 4>extroverted person is a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>because extroverted people,</v>

406
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 4>they stand out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're extroverted and</v>

407
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 4>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

408
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Because not only are they noisy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant and assertive,</v>

409
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 4>they're also colorful and flamboyant and</v>
<v Speaker 4>provocative,</v>

410
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 4>but happens to people is that as they</v>
<v Speaker 4>move towards zero,</v>

411
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 4>positive feedback loops get set up so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're more likely to hit zero,</v>

412
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 4>and as they move away from zero positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>feedback loops get set up so that</v>

413
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 4>they're increasingly more likely to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from zero.</v>

414
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 4>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say a,</v>

415
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe you're in the middle of the</v>

416
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 4>normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you lose your job.</v>

417
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so let's say you're a conscientious</v>

418
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 4>person and we could say just for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sake of argument,</v>

419
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 4>that you lose your job because of mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>layoffs in your company.</v>

420
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 4>So it has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fundamentally,</v>

421
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 4>it's just like luck of the draw</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>

422
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 4>But then what happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

423
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.030
<v Speaker 4>if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

424
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go after yourself pretty hard.</v>

425
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 4>So you're going to add,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're also high in</v>

426
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 4>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to depress you to lose your</v>

427
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you're in a situation where</v>

428
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 4>you just for one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have that many other</v>

429
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 4>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now maybe you should look for them,</v>

430
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:18.520
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you're in a depressed strata</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the economy or you're geographically</v>

431
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 4>located somewhere that makes moving</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult or so on and so forth.</v>

432
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.361
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

433
00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 4>but you lose a job and then you start to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get depressed because of that.</v>

434
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.700
<v Speaker 4>Well then as you start to get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it decreases the probability</v>

435
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to look for a job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also maybe starts to put stress</v>

436
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:37.610
<v Speaker 4>on your family and it also starts to</v>
<v Speaker 4>decrease the probability that you're in</v>

437
00:22:37.611 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 4>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Engage in positive social interaction.</v>

438
00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 4>So now not only are you unemployed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering from economic stress,</v>

439
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 4>but your marriage is starting to suffer</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're starting to isolate yourself</v>

440
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 4>from your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course,</v>

441
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 4>as your marriage suffers in the stress</v>
<v Speaker 4>builds up,</v>

442
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 4>then that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make you more depressed.</v>

443
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to keep you even</v>
<v Speaker 4>farther away from your friends and</v>

444
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 4>that's going to decrease the likelihood</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to have enough</v>

445
00:22:57.251 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 4>positive emotion and enthusiasm to look</v>
<v Speaker 4>for another job.</v>

446
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you want to add a bit of a</v>

447
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:05.230
<v Speaker 4>drinking problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just for fun and you can see that</v>

448
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 4>you can get a spiral going that's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken you down.</v>

449
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's all sorts of things because</v>

450
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.290
<v Speaker 4>lots of times people conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

451
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're unemployed guide,</v>

452
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.900
<v Speaker 4>you go to counseling and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>diagnosis of depression.</v>

453
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about a diagnosis of</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

454
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:26.020
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like the assumption is</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something gone wrong with your</v>

455
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:29.110
<v Speaker 4>psychological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you're unemployed and</v>

456
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're depressed,</v>

457
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 4>it isn't obvious at all that the problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in your head,</v>

458
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

459
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:34.710
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>

460
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 4>If it isn't even obvious that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological problem,</v>

461
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 4>it's just a problem and problems can</v>
<v Speaker 4>take you out.</v>

462
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're unemployed and you're under</v>

463
00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 4>economic stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your marriage is starting</v>

464
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 5>to shake and you're isolating yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>from your friends and you're less likely</v>

465
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:53.540
<v Speaker 5>to be motivated to go look for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can sort of think about that as a</v>

466
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:55.880
<v Speaker 5>depressive spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can also think of it as a</v>

467
00:23:55.881 --> 00:24:00.881
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy in some sense of external</v>
<v Speaker 5>forces that are arguing you into the</v>

468
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 5>ground and we don't tend to</v>
<v Speaker 5>conceptualize psychological disorders</v>

469
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 5>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we should because lots of times when</v>

470
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 5>people are suffering from something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could describe in psychological</v>

471
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 5>terminology and depression is a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>good example of that.</v>

472
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 5>It isn't obvious that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong with them.</v>

473
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Often they are in trouble and there</v>

474
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.661
<v Speaker 5>isn't a category in psychological</v>
<v Speaker 5>diagnosis for client in serious trouble.</v>

475
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 5>But my experience has been almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>without exception,</v>

476
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 5>that the people that come to see me come</v>
<v Speaker 5>to cv because something's gone wrong</v>

477
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 5>with their life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not because they have a psychological</v>

478
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

479
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

480
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 5>there are psychological inadequacies</v>
<v Speaker 5>such as they might be,</v>

481
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 5>are interfering with their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 5>recover or maybe even served as</v>

482
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:47.030
<v Speaker 5>precursors to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

483
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 5>increase the probability of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe.</v>

484
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 5>And so a well functioning personality</v>
<v Speaker 5>has all the micro routines in place.</v>

485
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 5>That's actually something that you help</v>
<v Speaker 5>people with if you're a behavioral</v>

486
00:24:56.631 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 5>therapist because one of the things you</v>
<v Speaker 5>assume if you're a behavioral therapist</v>

487
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 5>is that sometimes the reason people</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't doing things is because they</v>

488
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 5>don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

489
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 5>sometimes maybe the person is depressed</v>
<v Speaker 5>but potentially high functioning.</v>

490
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 5>They got all the damn micro routines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're well socialized,</v>

491
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 5>they're just dormant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to get them awake again and</v>

492
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.560
<v Speaker 5>implementing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes you get someone in your</v>

493
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 5>practice say who's just been neglected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you cannot believe,</v>

494
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The parents never paid any attention to</v>

495
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 5>them or maybe just punish them every</v>
<v Speaker 5>time they did something good.</v>

496
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 5>That's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

497
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't make friends and so they're</v>

498
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really</v>

499
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.540
<v Speaker 5>vague and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

500
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 5>and poorly articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then what you do is you work at</v>

501
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 5>the bottom of the micro routines and get</v>
<v Speaker 5>them to practice building up all these</v>

502
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 5>little attributes that they didn't build</v>
<v Speaker 5>up and you know,</v>

503
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you can think about in</v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of character development is so now</v>

504
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:49.220
<v Speaker 5>maybe understand something about your</v>
<v Speaker 5>own personality.</v>

505
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:49.821
<v Speaker 5>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

506
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 5>what could you do to improve your</v>
<v Speaker 5>personality?</v>

507
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is develop some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>micro routines on the other side of the</v>

508
00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 5>personality distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're disagreeable as hell,</v>

509
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could start learning how to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice things for people and without</v>

510
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 5>actually works by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you take disagreeable people who</v>

511
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:08.240
<v Speaker 5>are depressed and you get them doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice things for other people,</v>

512
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 5>their depression tends to lift.</v>

513
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 5>But then by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're agreeable,</v>

514
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 5>then you should practice doing some</v>
<v Speaker 5>things for yourself and being more tough</v>

515
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 5>minded in your negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can sort of place yourself on</v>

516
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the personality trait,</v>

517
00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 5>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're extrovert.</v>

518
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay man,</v>

519
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 5>learn to spend some time with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

520
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 5>You're low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

521
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 5>try reading a book that's outside of</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

522
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

523
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 5>your sphere of interest now in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

524
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.740
<v Speaker 5>if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you should probably learn how to</v>

525
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:39.720
<v Speaker 5>relax occasionally and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can,</v>

526
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 5>I think partly what you're doing as</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're developing your personality is</v>

527
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.970
<v Speaker 5>not moving the mean much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the average where you know,</v>

528
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 5>where you're located,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're extending the standard</v>

529
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 5>deviation so that you're a bigger bag of</v>
<v Speaker 5>tricks than you were before.</v>

530
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.660
<v Speaker 5>And I think you can practice that</v>
<v Speaker 5>consciously.</v>

531
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're hyper orderly.</v>

532
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well get a dog,</v>

533
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs are messy,</v>

534
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 5>horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

535
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 5>it's just what you need if you're hyper</v>
<v Speaker 5>orderly because they're going to leave</v>

536
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 5>hair everywhere and force you to live</v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

537
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

538
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 5>so and so this is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you right?</v>

539
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:12.470
<v Speaker 5>This is your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this connect collection of routine</v>

540
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 5>sub routines that you've turned into a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy.</v>

541
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 5>And then there's something at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

542
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big question.</v>

543
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 5>Like what the hell should be at the top</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the hierarchy?</v>

544
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 5>Because that's the ultimate question of</v>
<v Speaker 5>unity.</v>

545
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 5>And the clinicians would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

546
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 5>it's the self actualized person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it's the self or something like that,</v>

547
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

548
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the implicit and perhaps explicit</v>

549
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:34.320
<v Speaker 5>ideal that you're aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>

550
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 5>well it does such thing exists that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>would say,</v>

551
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you admire people?</v>

552
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Because that's your answer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

553
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 5>Do you despise people while you like</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people and you don't like others?</v>

554
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 5>You respect some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't respect others while you're</v>

555
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 5>acting out the notion that there's at</v>
<v Speaker 5>least an implicit ideal,</v>

556
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 5>you do the same thing when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>movies,</v>

557
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 5>you know you know who the hero is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know who the bad guy is.</v>

558
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 5>You're acting out the proposition that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of value hierarchy and</v>

559
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of manifestation of it</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's coherent across time.</v>

560
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 5>So you appear to believe that and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know you are driven at least to some</v>

561
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:11.880
<v Speaker 5>degree by your own inner ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you tend to answer the question,</v>

562
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 5>is that real with an affirmative?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't,</v>

563
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 5>there's catastrophic consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nietzsche and the existentialists were</v>

564
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:20.230
<v Speaker 5>very good at detailing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

565
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 5>let your value hierarchy disintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then what?</v>

566
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of it is nihilistic chaos,</v>

567
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 5>who that's not so much fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's the alignment of</v>

568
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 5>nihilistic chaos with the intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 5>desire that someone will come along and</v>

569
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 5>tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

570
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 5>So what happens is if you let this</v>
<v Speaker 5>devolve,</v>

571
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 5>you end up with nihilistic exit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not with nihilistic chaos or the demand</v>

572
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the tyrant to come forward.</v>

573
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 5>And we've had that happen lots of times</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't seem to have gotten that</v>

574
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

575
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:51.901
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

576
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 5>so what happens when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lay out these little routines in the</v>

577
00:28:55.141 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 5>world at different levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this is how your emotions function</v>

578
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 5>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're aiming at something and that</v>

579
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 5>this is an oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why I want to show you this</v>

580
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I show you this.</v>

581
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.460
<v Speaker 5>Assume that it's made out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

582
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 5>It's just a schematic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oversimplification because even if let's</v>

583
00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 5>say that I'm trying to do something as</v>
<v Speaker 5>simple as walking towards the door,</v>

584
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean that the action of walking</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards the door is predicated on the</v>

585
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:32.931
<v Speaker 5>existence of all the sub routines that</v>
<v Speaker 5>enabled me to propel my body across time</v>

586
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 5>and space and like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That took a lot of internal organization</v>

587
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 5>to get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a traumatized now and so you can</v>

588
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:44.560
<v Speaker 5>treat it like it's invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but implicit in any one of these</v>

589
00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:48.670
<v Speaker 5>structures is this entire structure and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you actually see this in therapy very</v>

590
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:50.400
<v Speaker 5>frequently to get.</v>

591
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the last years is this is a good</v>

592
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:55.250
<v Speaker 5>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so no,</v>

593
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty self evident that life is</v>
<v Speaker 5>has got its rat's nest of miseries and</v>

594
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure and maybe you could even</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a categorical statement that life</v>

595
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:05.580
<v Speaker 5>is mostly a rat's nest of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

596
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 5>when you could make a pretty powerful</v>
<v Speaker 5>argument for that,</v>

597
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 5>but then there's a counter question</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

598
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you tried not to make it any</v>

599
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 5>more miserable than it had to be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

600
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Then what then what would it be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and my suspicions are,</v>

601
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:22.300
<v Speaker 5>is that Laura had misery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suspect that most of that misery</v>

602
00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 5>would go away because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary misery that really brings</v>

603
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:26.201
<v Speaker 5>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

604
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

605
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 5>if someone has cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

606
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 5>that sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like.</v>

607
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if only we had done this differently,</v>

608
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 5>then that wouldn't have happened.</v>

609
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 5>But when someone's out like torturing</v>
<v Speaker 5>you in a malevolent way,</v>

610
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 5>or maybe you're doing the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can always ask yourself,</v>

611
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:44.570
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really,</v>

612
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 5>is this really necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this just like a useless add onto the</v>

613
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 5>miseries of life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what disheartens people,</v>

614
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 5>and so even in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

615
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.560
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

616
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 5>if you aren't suffering from self</v>
<v Speaker 5>imposed misery and you're only suffering</v>

617
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 5>from an escapable misery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could handle that and who you</v>

618
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 5>could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could survive.</v>

619
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 5>You could bear it and even maybe without</v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming irredeemably corrupt.</v>

620
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 5>So the goal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>

621
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 5>life is a rat's nest of miseries and</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it has no ultimate meaning.</v>

622
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:18.100
<v Speaker 5>We could say that if we're feeling</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly pessimistic,</v>

623
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 5>but it still leaves one question open,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is if you didn't do everything you</v>

624
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 5>could to make it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how good could you make it be?</v>

625
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.480
<v Speaker 5>And the least answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

626
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 5>it could be tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe not hell,</v>

627
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really believe that that's the most</v>

628
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 5>pessimistic proper statement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The worst case outcome in the worst of</v>

629
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 5>all possible worlds is that your life</v>
<v Speaker 5>could be tragic but not hell,</v>

630
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.380
<v Speaker 5>and that's blood better than hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

631
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.243
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

632
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 5>And you think I could give you an</v>
<v Speaker 5>example of the difference.</v>

633
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 5>You're at your mother's death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

634
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 5>that's tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's another scenario.</v>

635
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 5>You're out of your mother's death bed</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all you,</v>

636
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 5>you and all your idiot siblings are</v>
<v Speaker 5>arguing.</v>

637
00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the difference between tragedy</v>

638
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:02.890
<v Speaker 5>and hell and you might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>tolerate the first circumstance and</v>

639
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 5>maybe it would even bring you closer</v>
<v Speaker 5>together with your family members.</v>

640
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 5>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one can bear that.</v>

641
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.570
<v Speaker 5>You walk away from a situation like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

642
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 5>Sick of yourself and sick of everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>else too.</v>

643
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's often the case that tragic</v>

644
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:20.341
<v Speaker 5>circumstances bring out the dragons</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the stress is high and all those</v>

645
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 5>things that people haven't dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have the energy to repress</v>

646
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the bitterness comes pouring</v>

647
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

648
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 5>seriously man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

649
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 5>So that's actually a good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a rough lesson,</v>

650
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 5>but it's a good hallmark for figuring</v>
<v Speaker 5>out whether or not you're.</v>

651
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 5>You've got yourself adjusted properly</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in relationship to your siblings.</v>

652
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:42.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you all gathered around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bed,</v>

653
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 5>if someone close who was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you manage it?</v>

654
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 5>And if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

655
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 5>well put your life together because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to happen and you should be the</v>

656
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 5>person who's there that can do it and do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it properly.</v>

657
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.180
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe you'd find that it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sort of thing that will undermine</v>

658
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 5>your faith in life itself.</v>

659
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen both of those situations,</v>

660
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ugly,</v>

661
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 5>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ugly situations,</v>

662
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 5>murderously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ugly situations.</v>

663
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 5>And then they're opposite where people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have had terrible things happen to</v>

664
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 5>happen to them as a family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

665
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 5>they pulled together and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they rebuild their damn ship and they</v>

666
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 5>sail away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that seems to me to be a lot better.</v>

667
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.940
<v Speaker 5>That makes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

668
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:27.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the flood comes,</v>

669
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

670
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the same thing.</v>

671
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Question emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

672
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.880
<v Speaker 5>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

673
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 5>you could say</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're this plan.</v>

674
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.730
<v Speaker 5>That's what people usually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how people usually identified.</v>

675
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they have no plan at all and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just in chaos,</v>

676
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like being in the belly of the</v>

677
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 5>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're nihilistic and chaos.</v>

678
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 5>They have no plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just chaos itself.</v>

679
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very dreadful situation for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to be in.</v>

680
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe they conjure together a plan</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's their identity.</v>

681
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.590
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of fragile and they're holding</v>
<v Speaker 5>onto that with,</v>

682
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 5>with everything they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the little stick would that they're</v>

683
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:01.010
<v Speaker 5>floating in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clinging to,</v>

684
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they're identifying really hard</v>

685
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 5>with that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens when you're an idiot</v>

686
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.210
<v Speaker 5>log has that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're identifying really hard with that</v>

687
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 5>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is if something comes up to</v>

688
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:12.280
<v Speaker 5>confront it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

689
00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 5>how do you act when you can't let go</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the plan?</v>

690
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.930
<v Speaker 5>Because you drown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you clean to it rigidly.</v>

691
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 5>Well that's no good because then you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't learn anything.</v>

692
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 5>Then if that's you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a totalitarian,</v>

693
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:25.670
<v Speaker 5>you're going to learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to end up in something</v>

694
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:28.250
<v Speaker 5>that's close enough to hell so that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>won't know the difference and you might</v>

695
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 5>drag everyone along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's happened plenty of times,</v>

696
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:32.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the whole story of the 20th</v>

697
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 5>century.</v>

698
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 5>It happened over and over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it happens in people's states.</v>

699
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 5>It's to happens in their business</v>
<v Speaker 5>organizations.</v>

700
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:42.320
<v Speaker 5>It happens in their cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens in their provinces,</v>

701
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 5>it happens in their states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it happens in their psyches all at</v>

702
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:50.390
<v Speaker 5>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't blame the manifestation of</v>

703
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:52.280
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing on any of those one</v>
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>

704
00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 5>It happens when a society goes down that</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

705
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 5>it goes down everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

706
00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 5>it's not the totalitarians at the top</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the happy people striving to be</v>

707
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 5>free at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that at all.</v>

708
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 5>It's totalitarianism at every single</v>
<v Speaker 5>level of the hierarchy,</v>

709
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 5>including the psychological and so you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to be the thing.</v>

710
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to be in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure,</v>

711
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:14.960
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want to be the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>clings so desperately to the raft that</v>

712
00:35:14.961 --> 00:35:15.950
<v Speaker 5>you can't let go.</v>

713
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 5>When someone comes to rescue you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

714
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.200
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then you think,</v>

715
00:35:21.201 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly what are you?</v>

716
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 5>You're not the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not the plan.</v>

717
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're the thing that confronts</v>
<v Speaker 5>the obstacle,</v>

718
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 5>and I would say that's the categorical</v>
<v Speaker 5>lesson of,</v>

719
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.330
<v Speaker 5>of psychology in so far as it has to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with personal because that's what you</v>

720
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 5>always teach people in psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what sort of</v>

721
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 5>psychotherapist you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're always teaching them the same</v>

722
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the thing that you're not.</v>

723
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 5>You're not the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the thing that can confront the</v>

724
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 5>obstacle to the plant and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know even further that the obstacle is</v>

725
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:56.400
<v Speaker 5>not only an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but opportunity itself within your whole</v>

726
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 5>view of the world can change because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>might think,</v>

727
00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got this planned.</v>

728
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 5>Something came up to object to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's possible that the thing</v>

729
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 5>that's objecting has something to teach</v>
<v Speaker 5>you that will take you to the place</v>

730
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 5>where you develop it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even better plant and it's a nice</v>

731
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 5>framework to use.</v>

732
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you so sure that this is a problem?</v>

733
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Is that the only way that you can look</v>
<v Speaker 5>at it or is it an opportunity?</v>

734
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to be naive and</v>

735
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Speaker 5>optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are some things that's pretty hard</v>

736
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 5>to extract gold from some dragons and</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the death of a family member is a</v>

737
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 5>good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in even in a situation like that,</v>

738
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that it's an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

739
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 5>It's an opportunity for maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

740
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

741
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.350
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty miserable to go to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>digging for gold when someone's falling</v>

742
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 5>into the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

743
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:43.110
<v Speaker 5>if they really love you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

744
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:45.390
<v Speaker 5>that's what they'll want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and second,</v>

745
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 5>you're going to make their death a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>more palatable experience for them.</v>

746
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.610
<v Speaker 5>If you're someone who can be in the room</v>
<v Speaker 5>and be helpful instead of being,</v>

747
00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quivering in the corner and feeling that</v>

748
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 5>the entire world is collapsing in on</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

749
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to be the useful person at the</v>

750
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 5>funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that for a goal?</v>

751
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 5>That's a good goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

752
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 5>You know that you've got yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>together in a situation like that</v>

753
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 5>because you're gonna be active and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to be the person on whose</v>

754
00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 5>shoulder people cry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be a good goal and it's Kinda,</v>

755
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like being naively optimistic.</v>

756
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:17.340
<v Speaker 5>So when I tell you to get your life</v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

757
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:20.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

758
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.720
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

759
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's Pablum for fools.</v>

760
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 5>But it really is something to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reliable person at a funeral.</v>

761
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 5>There's this idea in union psychology</v>
<v Speaker 5>called the circumambulation and you had</v>

762
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:38.870
<v Speaker 5>this idea that you had a potential</v>
<v Speaker 5>future self which would be in potential</v>

763
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 5>everything that you could be and that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>manifests itself moment to moment in</v>

764
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:49.350
<v Speaker 5>your present life by making you</v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in things and the things that</v>

765
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 5>you're interested in.</v>

766
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Are the things that would guide you</v>
<v Speaker 5>along the path that would lead you to</v>

767
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 5>maximal development.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea</v>

768
00:37:58.051 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 5>or a or a mystical idea even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

769
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

770
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 5>It's a really profoundly biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

771
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:06.870
<v Speaker 5>The idea is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

772
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.770
<v Speaker 5>your set up so that you're automatically</v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in those things that was</v>

773
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.610
<v Speaker 5>fully expand you as a well adapted</v>
<v Speaker 5>creature.</v>

774
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing radical about that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How well what else could possibly be the</v>

775
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 5>case unless there's something</v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally flawed about you that is</v>

776
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 5>what the situation would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of interesting to think about</v>

777
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 5>how that would be manifest moment to</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>

778
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:32.250
<v Speaker 5>but the idea is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

779
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 5>your interest is captured by those</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that lead you down the path</v>

780
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 4>of development.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will that better be the case?</v>

781
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's fine.</v>

782
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.790
<v Speaker 4>And so there's some utility in pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things that you're interested in.</v>

783
00:38:43.791 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's the call to adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say so.</v>

784
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 4>And the call to adventure takes you all</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of places.</v>

785
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Now the problem with the call to</v>
<v Speaker 4>adventure is like,</v>

786
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 4>what the hell do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be interested in things that</v>

787
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 4>are kind of warped and bent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and often it's the case that when new</v>

788
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:03.690
<v Speaker 4>parts of people manifest themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>grip their interest,</v>

789
00:39:03.691 --> 00:39:08.691
<v Speaker 4>say they do it very badly in shoddily</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you stumble around like an idiot</v>

790
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:12.190
<v Speaker 4>when you try to do something new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the fool is the precursor</v>

791
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:15.460
<v Speaker 4>to the savior from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the symbolic perspectives.</v>

792
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 4>Because you have to be a fool before you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be a master.</v>

793
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 4>And if you're not willing to be a fool</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can't be a master,</v>

794
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:25.351
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're gonna get it's an error error</v>

795
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 4>ridden process.</v>

796
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's also laid out the old</v>
<v Speaker 4>testament stories because the first</v>

797
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 4>thing that happens to all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal figures when God kicks them</v>

798
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 4>out of their father's house when they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 84,</v>

799
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 4>is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they run into all sorts of trouble.</v>

800
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 4>And some of it's social and some of it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural and some of it's a consequence</v>

801
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 4>of their own moral inadequacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're fools and.</v>

802
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing that's so interesting is</v>

803
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 4>that despite the fact that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>fools,</v>

804
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 4>they're still supposed to go on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>adventure and that they're capable of</v>

805
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 4>learning enough as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving forward on the adventure so that</v>

806
00:39:57.911 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 4>they straightened themselves out across</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

807
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 4>And so it's something like this and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>circumambulation that young talked about</v>

808
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 4>was this continual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll return to this,</v>

809
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 4>this continual circling in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>who you could be.</v>

810
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.580
<v Speaker 4>You might notice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

811
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 4>that there are themes in your life.</v>

812
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go back across your</v>

813
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

814
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have your typical experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of repeats itself and there</v>

815
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 4>might be variation on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a musical theme,</v>

816
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:28.801
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you're circling yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting closer to yourself as you</v>

817
00:40:28.841 --> 00:40:31.420
<v Speaker 4>move across time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the circumambulation.</v>

818
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Now you remember that for a sec because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll go back to it.</v>

819
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that something glimmers</v>

820
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 4>before you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an an interest that's daunting and</v>

821
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 4>you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

822
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:41.980
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're paralyzed.</v>

823
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:42.431
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

824
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 4>how do I know if I should pursue that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a stupid idea,</v>

825
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.280
<v Speaker 4>and the proper response to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>

826
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:52.930
<v Speaker 4>it probably is a stupid idea because</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost all the all ideas are stupid and</v>

827
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:57.400
<v Speaker 4>so the probability that as you move</v>
<v Speaker 4>forward on your adventure that you're</v>

828
00:40:57.401 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 4>going to get it right the first time is</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>

829
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might think,</v>

830
00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:08.230
<v Speaker 4>well maybe I'll just wait around until I</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the right idea and which people do.</v>

831
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're like 40 year old,</v>

832
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 4>13 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not a good idea.</v>

833
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 4>So they wait around until it's waiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Godot until they finally got it</v>

834
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is you're too stupid to</v>

835
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 4>know when you've got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So waiting around isn't going to help</v>

836
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.920
<v Speaker 4>because even if it's the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity manifested itself to you in</v>

837
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Speaker 4>your incomplete form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you would recognize</v>

838
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 4>it as the perfect opportunity is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might even think it's the worst</v>

839
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 4>possible idea that you've ever heard of</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere,</v>

840
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 4>highly likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>highly likely.</v>

841
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you ha.</v>

842
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 4>There's a niche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a niche are called that will will to</v>

843
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:45.710
<v Speaker 4>stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I really liked,</v>

844
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.450
<v Speaker 4>so because he thought of stupidity as</v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

845
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

846
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to take it into account</v>

847
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally and work with it and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so.</v>

848
00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.580
<v Speaker 4>You can take these tentative steps on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your pathway to destiny and you can</v>

849
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:05.150
<v Speaker 4>assume that you're going to do it badly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's really useful because you</v>

850
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 4>don't have to beat yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty easy to do it badly.</v>

851
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is it's way better to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it badly,</v>

852
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 4>the not to do it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the continual message that</v>

853
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 4>echoes through these historical stories</v>
<v Speaker 4>in genesis.</v>

854
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like these are flawed people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have got the hell out of</v>

855
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 4>their house way before they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go out and they stumble around</v>

856
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 4>in tyranny and famine and self betrayal</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

857
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.810
<v Speaker 4>and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

858
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 4>but it's a hell of lot better than just</v>
<v Speaker 4>rotting away at home.</v>

859
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

860
00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 4>So that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so why is that?</v>

861
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:39.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

862
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 4>so you start your path and you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're heading towards your star</v>

863
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 4>and so you go in that direction and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're here,</v>

864
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:52.820
<v Speaker 4>the world looks a particular way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when you move here,</v>

865
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 4>the world looks different and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>different as a consequence of having</v>

866
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 4>made that voyage and so what that means</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that now that thing that glimmers in</v>

867
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 4>front of you is going to have shifted</v>
<v Speaker 4>its location because you weren't very</v>

868
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 4>good at specifying it to begin with and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now that you're a little sharper and</v>

869
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:14.810
<v Speaker 4>more focused than you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to reveal itself with more</v>

870
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 4>accuracy to you.</v>

871
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 4>And so then you have to take a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

872
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like 180 degree reversal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't because you know you've.</v>

873
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've gone this far and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>long ways to get that far,</v>

874
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 4>but that's a lot farther than you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be if you just stayed where you were</v>

875
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:40.580
<v Speaker 4>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it doesn't matter that you</v>

876
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 4>overshoot continually because as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>overshoot,</v>

877
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 4>even if you don't learn what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should've done,</v>

878
00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 4>you're going to continually learn what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't.</v>

879
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Keep doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you learn enough about what you</v>

880
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:59.270
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't keep doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's tantamount at some point to</v>

881
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.610
<v Speaker 4>learning at the same time what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be doing.</v>

882
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.480
<v Speaker 4>So it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like this.</v>

883
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Now what's cool about it though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is that as you progress,</v>

884
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 4>the degree of overshooting starts to</v>
<v Speaker 4>decline,</v>

885
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that we know that there's nothing</v>

886
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 4>hypothetical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you learn a new skill,</v>

887
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 4>like even to play it play a song on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>piano for example,</v>

888
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 4>you overshoot madly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd making all sorts of mistakes to</v>

889
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:29.921
<v Speaker 4>begin with and then the mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 4>disappear.</v>

890
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 4>There's a great ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was about this guy set up a</v>

891
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 4>really advanced computational recording</v>
<v Speaker 4>system in his home and recorded every</v>

892
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:45.780
<v Speaker 4>single utterance his young child made</v>
<v Speaker 4>while learning to speak.</v>

893
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.960
<v Speaker 4>And then he put together the child's</v>
<v Speaker 4>attempts to say certain phonemes and put</v>

894
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 4>them in list and you can hear the child</v>
<v Speaker 4>deviating madly to begin with.</v>

895
00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 4>And then after hundreds and hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>repetitions just zeroing right in on the</v>

896
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:03.430
<v Speaker 4>exact phoneme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

897
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.450
<v Speaker 4>you might not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when kids babble because they start</v>

898
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 4>babbling when they're quite young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they babble every human phoneme</v>

899
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 4>including all sorts of phonemes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>adults can't say,</v>

900
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.410
<v Speaker 4>and then they die into their language so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that after they learn,</v>

901
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 4>say English,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's all sorts of phonemes they</v>

902
00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 4>can no longer here or pronounced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to begin with,</v>

903
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 4>it's all there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really quite interesting,</v>

904
00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 4>but so they see as they learn a</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular language,</v>

905
00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 4>they zero in on the proper way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pronounce that and their errors minimize</v>

906
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 4>and every time you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it is and that's really</v>

907
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 4>useful to know too because it means that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay to wander around stupidly</v>

908
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 4>before you fix your destination.</v>

909
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Now you see that echoed in exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

910
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 4>Because what happens is that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egyptians or the Hebrews escape the</v>

911
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 4>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of whatever you do</v>

912
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 4>personally and psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you escape from your previous set</v>

913
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 4>of stupidly held and ignorant and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stubborn axioms,</v>

914
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like away from that tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

915
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I freed myself from that.</v>

916
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

917
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now I'm on the way,</v>

918
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:08.791
<v Speaker 4>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

919
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 4>Now you're in the desert where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonder around stupidly,</v>

920
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 4>you know and worship the wrong things</v>
<v Speaker 4>until you finally organize yourself</v>

921
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:19.890
<v Speaker 4>morally again and head in the proper</v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

922
00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 4>So that's worth knowing too because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

923
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got rid of a lot of things,</v>

924
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 4>baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excess baggage that I didn't need in my</v>

925
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:29.190
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now everything's okay.</v>

926
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:29.671
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

927
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:32.010
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got rid of a whole set of</v>

928
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 4>scaffolds that were keeping you in place</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though they were pathological.</v>

929
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Now you have nothing and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually turns out to be better than</v>

930
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 4>something pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're still stuck with the problem</v>

931
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 4>of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's well,</v>

932
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:48.880
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly why exodus is structured</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that it is.</v>

933
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 4>It's that you escaped from materiality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hooray.</v>

934
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:53.040
<v Speaker 4>We're no longer slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

935
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 4>well now you're nihilistic and lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessarily an improvement,</v>

936
00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.780
<v Speaker 4>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is the pre.</v>

937
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also useful to know that because</v>

938
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 4>you can also be diluted into the idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>that imagine that you're trying to</v>

939
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 4>become enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which might mean to turn all those parts</v>

940
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 4>of you on that could be turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

941
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:13.760
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just a linear pathway uphill.</v>

942
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just from one success to another.</v>

943
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

944
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like here you are and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing too badly in the first step is a</v>

945
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:21.810
<v Speaker 4>complete bloody catastrophe.</v>

946
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 4>It's worse and then maybe you can pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself together and you hit a new</v>

947
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 4>plateau and then that crumbles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shakes and bang.</v>

948
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 4>It's worse again and so because part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that people don't become</v>

949
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:38.461
<v Speaker 4>enlightened is because it's punctuated</v>
<v Speaker 4>by intermittent deserts essentially by</v>

950
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 4>intermittent catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't know that well,</v>

951
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 4>then you're basically screwed because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go ahead on your movement forward</v>

952
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 4>and you collapse and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

953
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 4>that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I collapsed.</v>

954
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:49.624
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

955
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 4>that's par for the course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not indication that you failed.</v>

956
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just indication that it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard and that when you learn something,</v>

957
00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 4>you also unlearn something and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>you unlearned is probably useful and</v>

958
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 4>unlearning it actually is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

959
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 4>let's say if you have to get out of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad relationship,</v>

960
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.910
<v Speaker 4>it's like not every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not any real.</v>

961
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 4>There isn't any relationship that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred percent bad,</v>

962
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 4>and so when you jump out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe you're in better shape,</v>

963
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 4>but you're still lonesome and</v>
<v Speaker 4>disoriented and you don't know what your</v>

964
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 4>past was and you don't know what your</v>
<v Speaker 4>present is and you don't want know what</v>

965
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 4>your future is.</v>

966
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why people stay with the devil</v>

967
00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:28.180
<v Speaker 4>they know instead of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for the devil they don't know</v>

968
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>

969
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.590
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you're full of faults</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean you have to stop and thank</v>

970
00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 4>God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a really useful thing and the</v>

971
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 4>fact that you're full of faults doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean that you can't learn and so you can</v>

972
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 4>pause it in an ideal and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be wrong about it,</v>

973
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter because what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right about his positing,</v>

974
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:54.610
<v Speaker 4>the ideal moving towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the actual ideal is</v>

975
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 4>conceptualized perfectly well first</v>
<v Speaker 4>surprise,</v>

976
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Speaker 4>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because like what are you going to do?</v>

977
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 4>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't matter that it's</v>

978
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:05.200
<v Speaker 4>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imperfect,</v>

979
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:07.750
<v Speaker 4>it just matters that you do it and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you move forward.</v>

980
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 4>So that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really positive news as far as</v>

981
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned because you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

982
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:13.990
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do it badly.</v>

983
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Anyone can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

984
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 4>that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

985
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 4>So like if you were an efficient person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have just done that but you're</v>

986
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But who cares?</v>

987
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still end up in the,</v>

988
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.470
<v Speaker 4>in the same place and maybe the trip is</v>
<v Speaker 4>even more interesting.</v>

989
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably too interesting.</v>
