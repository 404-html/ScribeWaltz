<v Speaker 1>and this earth is time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to love,</v>

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the moment the human body is born,</v>

4
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it begins dying.</v>

5
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you quite caught that.</v>

6
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the moment the human body is born,</v>

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>it begins dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some happening faster,</v>

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>some happening slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of US help them happy,</v>

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>go faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them prevented from happening</v>

10
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:44.151
<v Speaker 1>sooner than later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coach high coming to you live on the</v>

11
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>field of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many seconds?</v>

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>How many minutes do we waste every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing things that are nowhere near the</v>

13
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>goals and aspirations and passions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have inside.</v>

14
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>How many times are you go through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of a day and realize,</v>

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>did I do anything I set out to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write down those goals each and every</v>

16
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter if there's two goals a day.</v>

17
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>If you can accomplish those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're doing more than just making</v>

18
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>it through the day you are living and</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving your dreams.</v>

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>You know as inspirational speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to just talk to you.</v>

20
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>We want to live that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that in my life as well.</v>

21
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Find time to better yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read,</v>

23
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.540

<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

24
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>that's their date that they put on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left side of the tombstone.</v>

26
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put another date on the right side</v>

27
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.791
<v Speaker 1>of the tombstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that dash in the middle is the most</v>

28
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>important thing on that tombstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is alone.</v>

29
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>That throughout that entire timeframe</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were able to impact and touch others</v>

30
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to leave your mark on this</v>

31
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to build a legacy there.</v>

32
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to have it to where people</v>

33
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>remember who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>

34
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>When you're living for that dash in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

35
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to remember your why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your why.</v>

36
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Why are you here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

37
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>not the why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do something your why,</v>

38
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>your reason for getting up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

39
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>your reason for pushing yourself past</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brink of exertion and given up your</v>

40
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>reason for moving on and and and getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things done in life.</v>

41
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>That dash in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that pushes you.</v>

42
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Just stop for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write down your why.</v>

43
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing this for in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your does it make you cry and that's</v>

44
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>not your why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

45
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>if your why doesn't make you cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's not your why.</v>

46
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Your why should be something so big that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves your family tree.</v>

47
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Your why should be something so big that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes the whole outlook on how</v>

48
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>things are with you and your home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

49
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>your religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your purpose.</v>

50
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Think about your passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about your opportunities and</v>

51
00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that's how you find your purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OPP.</v>

52
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>When ned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why meets up with your passion,</v>

54
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>your opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your purpose,</v>

55
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>then you'll find out the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>day in your life is the day you remember</v>

56
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>why you were born,</v>

57
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>how you can live an easy life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

58
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.470
<v Speaker 2>accomplishing goals and be successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going out in the world and as tough.</v>

59
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>The only way to live an easy life is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically give up on all your dreams and</v>

60
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>aspirations and just sit around doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

61
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Shit that is easy is not worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishing.</v>

62
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Therefore a life that is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even worth living.</v>

63
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in this world is worth having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing unless it means effort,</v>

64
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and difficulty.</v>

65
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Would you listen to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be good.</v>

66
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>You are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of you,</v>

67
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>all your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

68
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 2>everyone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone you care about,</v>

69
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>it's going to die if you love life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not waste time because time is what life</v>

70
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>is made of.</v>

71
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 3>So if you respect and appreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time that you've been given,</v>

72
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out there doing what you want to do,</v>

73
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 3>where you need to be telling yourself is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an acceptable to be seen around the</v>

74
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 3>procrastinate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I no longer wanted to be a loser.</v>

75
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I no longer want to be awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is that I want and I'm</v>

76
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 3>going to work hard and I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

77
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 4>When you want to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as bad as you want to breathe,</v>

78
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 4>then you'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone you lost late morning.</v>

79
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 4>My success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm here to tell you today,</v>

80
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to be willing to give up</v>

81
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 4>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta be willing to work on for</v>

82
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 4>three hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two hours.</v>

83
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 4>If you really want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some days you will have to stay up three</v>

84
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:34.464
<v Speaker 4>days in a row,</v>

85
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 5>but you don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't really want it.</v>

86
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 5>How badly are you wanting success rather</v>
<v Speaker 5>than actually working towards your</v>

87
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 5>dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of you are just thinking about it.</v>

88
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 5>I have high hopes for everybody watching</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

89
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 5>I want to remember your name.</v>

90
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 6>It is not the things we do in life that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we regret on our deathbed.</v>

91
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.560
<v Speaker 6>It is the things we do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not because I assure you I've done a lot</v>

92
00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:14.130
<v Speaker 6>of really stupid things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of them bothered me.</v>

93
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 6>All the mistakes and all the dopey</v>
<v Speaker 6>things and all the times I was</v>

94
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:21.690
<v Speaker 6>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't matter.</v>

95
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 6>Find your passion and in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no matter what you do at work,</v>

96
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 6>what you do in official settings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that passion will be grounded in people.</v>

97
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.420
<v Speaker 6>Pound,</v>
<v Speaker 6>grounded in the relationships you have</v>

98
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:44.421
<v Speaker 6>with people and what they think of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When your time comes</v>

99
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>in the teeth of these stupefying odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you and buy,</v>

100
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>you know ordinariness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right here.</v>

101
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing I can tell you every single</v>

102
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>day of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I trying to find somebody else to</v>

103
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.420
<v Speaker 2>change their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I waited till 39 to get married because</v>

104
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:30.211
<v Speaker 2>I had to wait that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or for happiness was more important,</v>

105
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 2>the Fi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if nothing else,</v>

106
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:38.791
<v Speaker 2>I hope that all of you can find that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of passion and that kind of love in</v>

107
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:41.140
<v Speaker 2>your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

108
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.140
<v Speaker 7>A Journey of a thousand miles begins</v>
<v Speaker 7>with a single step,</v>

109
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.220
<v Speaker 7>so I'm an old Chinese proverb.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most people have heard it or have come</v>

110
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 7>across it at some point and the meanings</v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty straightforward,</v>

111
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.280
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And advocates having the courage to take</v>

112
00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 7>that step towards a goal and that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>huge,</v>

113
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 7>and making that decision to move forward</v>
<v Speaker 7>towards something you want,</v>

114
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 7>but it's what happens immediately</v>
<v Speaker 7>following that first step that I'm</v>

115
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 7>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What happens when the journey's be gone</v>

116
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 7>and it's you and your goal in all of a</v>
<v Speaker 7>sudden you realize how long that road</v>

117
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Speaker 7>ahead really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now this is a turning point for a lot of</v>

118
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:41.851
<v Speaker 7>people and those who can succeed or able</v>
<v Speaker 7>to take their daunting,</v>

119
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.920
<v Speaker 7>intimidating goal or journey and see it</v>
<v Speaker 7>for what it really is.</v>

120
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 7>Just a bunch of small manageable tasks</v>
<v Speaker 7>strung together.</v>

121
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you look at why people quit,</v>

122
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.900
<v Speaker 7>a lot of the time it's because they were</v>
<v Speaker 7>overwhelmed by their goals and</v>

123
00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 7>ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

124
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 7>let's say you have this wonderful plan</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your head to climb a mountain.</v>

125
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 7>You're thinking about that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 7>being on top,</v>

126
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 7>looking down with pride.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every time you think about it,</v>

127
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 7>your heart starts racing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you pack your stuff,</v>

128
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 7>you make your way down in the base of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the mountain and then you look up</v>

129
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 7>different ballgame right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the entire mountains in front of you and</v>

130
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 7>you realize that that's no small feat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is when people walk away,</v>

131
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 7>when they aren't able to see a challenge</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a sum of tiny steps.</v>

132
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 7>They see it as a crazy impossible task.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like saying you want to be the next</v>

133
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:53.110
<v Speaker 7>Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall</v>
<v Speaker 7>mountain to climb,</v>

134
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 7>like trying to hit a target from a mile</v>
<v Speaker 7>away.</v>

135
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 7>But if you can identify and map out what</v>
<v Speaker 7>you need to conquer in order to become a</v>

136
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 7>better basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a football player,</v>

137
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 7>and begin taking those small steps</v>
<v Speaker 7>improving every day,</v>

138
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 7>that makes dreams real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what gives goals life,</v>

139
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 7>the ability to see your objective not as</v>
<v Speaker 7>a marathon,</v>

140
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 7>but as a series of little 400 meters</v>
<v Speaker 7>stretches,</v>

141
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 7>stepping stones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what your objective is today,</v>

142
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.860
<v Speaker 7>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the end of the week and the end of the</v>

143
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 7>year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then completing them day by day.</v>

144
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:32.050
<v Speaker 7>These little victories,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what gives you a dream life.</v>

145
00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:35.680
<v Speaker 7>It's what gives you momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You feel good about the process</v>

146
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.860
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when things blow up in your face,</v>

147
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 7>which happens every so often on this</v>
<v Speaker 7>little place we call earth,</v>

148
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.770
<v Speaker 7>you'll have that foundation and that</v>
<v Speaker 7>sense of accomplishment to stay focused</v>

149
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.860
<v Speaker 7>because your approach is tangible and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's realistic.</v>

150
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.640
<v Speaker 7>This applies with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Losing a job,</v>

151
00:10:57.641 --> 00:10:58.990
<v Speaker 7>a breakup,</v>
<v Speaker 7>failing a test.</v>

152
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.600
<v Speaker 7>These things that are monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you allow them to be,</v>

153
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can turn into that unclimbable</v>

154
00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:09.121
<v Speaker 7>mountain</v>
<v Speaker 7>or they can roll map a new path for you.</v>

155
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 7>And if you define what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you define success and begin stepping</v>

156
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 7>towards it one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one day at a time,</v>

157
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.230
<v Speaker 7>you'll get where you want to be quicker</v>
<v Speaker 7>than you thought.</v>

158
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 6>What changes our whole life is action.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't we take action?</v>

159
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 6>Fear?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

160
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 6>we got to do to get ourselves to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got to make sure that we push</v>

161
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 6>ourselves through it by making a</v>
<v Speaker 6>decision.</v>

162
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 6>The point in which change happens is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that decision,</v>

163
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.750
<v Speaker 6>every change in your life that you want</v>
<v Speaker 6>will come from something simple.</v>

164
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.340
<v Speaker 6>A decision people are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does it take to change?</v>

165
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.420
<v Speaker 6>Decide</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I persist,</v>

166
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.370
<v Speaker 6>if I continue to try,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I continue to trudge forward,</v>

167
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 6>I succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will persist until I succeed.</v>

168
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 6>I was not delivered under this world in</v>
<v Speaker 6>defeat,</v>

169
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 6>nor does failure course in my veins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded</v>

170
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 6>by my shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am a lion and I refuse to talk,</v>

171
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 6>to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to sleep with the sheet.</v>

172
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 4>Don't be a follower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be a student.</v>

173
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Take advice but not orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take information.</v>

174
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 4>But don't let somebody you know order</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life not to do what someone else</v>

175
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 4>says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take what someone else says.</v>

176
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.690
<v Speaker 4>Processing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about it.</v>

177
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Ponder it makes you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you think,</v>

178
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 4>then it's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when you go take action,</v>

179
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 4>make sure that the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not what somebody told you.</v>

180
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 4>Make sure the action is the product of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own.</v>

181
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 4>What I'm exactly where I wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I realized I've got to commit my</v>

182
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 4>very being to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta I gotta read it.</v>

183
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 4>I got to eat it and until you get there</v>
<v Speaker 4>will never be successful.</v>

184
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you the world is yours.</v>

185
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Bench yourself.</v>

186
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Reinvent yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change your tone and shave so often that</v>

187
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.200
<v Speaker 2>they can never categorize you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is</v>

188
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.120
<v Speaker 2>be self taught and reinvent your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you mentioned it to you'll life</v>

<v Speaker 6>belongs only to you.</v>

191
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.390
<v Speaker 8>Positive Vibes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What my hope is to pick tool,</v>

192
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.820
<v Speaker 8>not</v>

<v Speaker 8>Your life is put in place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If this is just a totally happy place,</v>

<v Speaker 6>not to fail.</v>

197
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.710
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I never want to be that nine to five</v>

198
00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:25.770
<v Speaker 9>person that just lives my entire life</v>
<v Speaker 9>working a nine to five and just be happy</v>

199
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.750
<v Speaker 9>with a modest lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>being secure.</v>

<v Speaker 9>that's all they want and they just want</v>

202
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:32.340

209
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.180

210
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:49.830
<v Speaker 9>The same job for 30 years is not</v>
<v Speaker 9>something I would ever choose to do in</v>

211
00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 9>the society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Know we,</v>

212
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 10>we are tied to go to college and get a</v>
<v Speaker 10>job.</v>

213
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240
<v Speaker 10>That's what we're taught.</v>
<v Speaker 10>If you become a doctor or a lawyer,</v>

214
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 10>you're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know.</v>

215
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 10>But most of the time you still have a</v>
<v Speaker 10>boss,</v>

216
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.060
<v Speaker 10>so have someone you know Tony what to do</v>
<v Speaker 10>and you still have this schedule and you</v>

<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so it's not much different than working</v>

219
00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:14.700
<v Speaker 10>at Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean it's just you're making more</v>

220
00:15:14.701 --> 00:15:17.250
<v Speaker 10>money but you're still on the same exact</v>
<v Speaker 10>situation.</v>

221
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 10>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>working at Mcdonald's is not sinking or</v>

222
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.820
<v Speaker 10>same scenario and making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 10>to have the lifestyle and the freedom to</v>

225
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.880
<v Speaker 10>do what you want when you want.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

226
00:15:29.881 --> 00:15:32.550
<v Speaker 10>it was the most incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>People don't understand it.</v>

227
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.280
<v Speaker 10>You got to work hard at whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whether you're working for someone else</v>

228
00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:36.180
<v Speaker 10>or working for yourself.</v>

229
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.620
<v Speaker 10>And if you want to put that in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 10>you're going to end up being successful.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't be satisfied.</v>

231
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.510
<v Speaker 10>But that's what keeps us going.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

232
00:15:42.511 --> 00:15:47.511
<v Speaker 10>when you become content then whites over</v>
<v Speaker 10>the mentality is what's going to make</v>

233
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 10>things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

234
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 10>is having a mentality of never give up,</v>
<v Speaker 10>keep pushing forward and trying to</v>

235
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 10>accomplish your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And hopefully that you have more goals,</v>

236
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.470
<v Speaker 10>constantly trying to move on to bigger</v>
<v Speaker 10>and better things and trying to improve</v>

237
00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:05.490
<v Speaker 10>ourselves in every area.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You really have to believe what you're</v>

238
00:16:05.491 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 10>doing is working.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

239
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.440
<v Speaker 10>it was very important to believe you</v>
<v Speaker 10>have to believe to achieve.</v>

240
00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:12.210
<v Speaker 10>If you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're not hundred percent confident</v>

241
00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:13.770
<v Speaker 10>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're going to fail.</v>

242
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.540
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>someone who is doing something,</v>

243
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.870
<v Speaker 10>maybe not 100% correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but they truly believe in their mind</v>

244
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.170
<v Speaker 10>that they're doing the best they can</v>
<v Speaker 10>possibly do and they believe what</v>

245
00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 10>they're doing is the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 10>scenario.</v>

246
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 10>I think they're going to have a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 10>success than someone that is doing it</v>

247
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 10>100% right but aren't positive and what</v>
<v Speaker 10>they're doing.</v>

248
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.430
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the mind is the most powerful tool we</v>

249
00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:34.410
<v Speaker 10>have.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And in order to be a winner,</v>

250
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.650
<v Speaker 10>you have to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

251
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's,</v>

252
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.740
<v Speaker 10>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's how you learn.</v>

253
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.040
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one day I may is telling me I better get</v>

254
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.810
<v Speaker 10>out there and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 10>You know one day miss is that you can't</v>

257
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 10>get back.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Always.</v>

258
00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 10>Always look at the positive.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know the glass is always half full.</v>

259
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.920
<v Speaker 10>If you think positive and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 10>the positive,</v>

260
00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:59.050
<v Speaker 10>you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're only going to continue to get</v>

261
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:02.880
<v Speaker 10>better.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it's being positive in every area is</v>

262
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.110
<v Speaker 10>the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

263
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.963
<v Speaker 10>it's a secret to life.</v>

264
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.800
<v Speaker 10>If you're negative about anything you're</v>
<v Speaker 10>going to fail no matter what it is.</v>

265
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.280
<v Speaker 10>You're not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you want to be better.</v>

266
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.930
<v Speaker 10>But that's what you one in every aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like you want to better yourself and</v>

267

<v Speaker 10>goes around.</v>

270
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 10>The most important thing is fight in</v>
<v Speaker 10>life and not give a shit what other</v>

272
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:41.670
<v Speaker 10>That's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And to have that kind of an attitude or</v>

273
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:43.770
<v Speaker 10>mentality is rare.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

274
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.390
<v Speaker 10>people are always concerned about what</v>
<v Speaker 10>other people think,</v>

275
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 10>no matter who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It really doesn't matter what other</v>

<v Speaker 10>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know?</v>

277
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 10>It really doesn't matter if you can have</v>
<v Speaker 10>that kind of mentality is so much</v>

278
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 10>further in life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>People don't like to think they like to</v>

279
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 10>ask.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

280
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 10>they don't like to fake.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And they don't have enough confidence in</v>

281
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 10>their decisions that they make on their</v>
<v Speaker 10>own.</v>

282
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 10>When they get advice from someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that gives them more confidence to</v>

283
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 10>believe that that's going to work.</v>

284
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.140
<v Speaker 9>We should always be trying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

285
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.810
<v Speaker 9>to be better at every aspect in life.</v>

<v Speaker 9>there's a million things in life that we</v>
<v Speaker 9>are,</v>

292
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 9>we,</v>

<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and being able to,</v>

297

<v Speaker 9>when I want to do it.</v>

298
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:50.380
<v Speaker 9>It's just a great feeling.</v>

299
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 11>Whatever it takes to get you to try</v>
<v Speaker 11>harder.</v>

300
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 11>Read Mar,</v>
<v Speaker 11>set your goals and go for it.</v>

301
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 11>Here's the next attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Disease over caution.</v>

302
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

303

<v Speaker 11>Some people never will have much there</v>
<v Speaker 11>too cautious.</v>

304
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 11>Now you can also be too reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but you can also be too cost.</v>

305
00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:19.640
<v Speaker 11>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is called the timid approach to</v>

306
00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:24.641
<v Speaker 11>life</v>
<v Speaker 11>and my caution was always the risk.</v>

307
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.080
<v Speaker 11>Risk used to drive me right up the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I used to say,</v>

308
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:35.081
<v Speaker 11>what if this happened?</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's called the language of the poor.</v>

309
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.860
<v Speaker 11>What if this happens?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And on top of that,</v>

310
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:42.070
<v Speaker 11>if this was to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 11>look at the Phipps ib and I better not</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

313

<v Speaker 11>Then I'll tell you what changed my whole</v>

314
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:53.260

345
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 11>we're almost through.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Hang on.</v>

346
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 11>The next one is pessimism.</v>

347
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.513
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

348
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 11>Pessimism,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the deadly disease of always looking on</v>

349
00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 11>the bad side,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the problem side,</v>

350
00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 11>the difficult side,</v>
<v Speaker 11>checking all the reasons why it can't be</v>

351
00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:49.110
<v Speaker 11>done.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The poor pessimists leads an ugly life.</v>

352
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.760
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't try to figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>

353
00:21:52.761 --> 00:21:56.900
<v Speaker 11>He tries to figure out what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't look for virtue.</v>

354
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.090
<v Speaker 11>He looks for faults and when he finds</v>
<v Speaker 11>him,</v>

355
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.740
<v Speaker 11>he's delighted how ugly</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is.</v>

356
00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:06.260
<v Speaker 11>The poor guy looks through the window,</v>
<v Speaker 11>doesn't see the sunset.</v>

357
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 11>He sees the specs on the window</v>
<v Speaker 11>and this is the poor guy,</v>

358
00:22:14.461 --> 00:22:15.480
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Who rushes up,</v>

359
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.330
<v Speaker 11>takes us to leave of your senses.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This guy rushes up and he says,</v>

360
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.550
<v Speaker 11>I've got five good reasons why it won't</v>
<v Speaker 11>work.</v>

361
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.770
<v Speaker 11>He's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't know.</v>

362
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:24.660
<v Speaker 11>All you need is one.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He's got five</v>

363
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 11>to the pessimists.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The glass is always half m d to the</v>

364
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.520
<v Speaker 11>optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The glass is half full.</v>

365
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.520
<v Speaker 11>Why would the same measure affect</v>
<v Speaker 11>people?</v>

366
00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:45.020
<v Speaker 11>Two different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Answer.</v>

367
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 11>It all depends on how you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Our lives are mostly affected by the way</v>

368
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 11>we think.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Things are not the way they are.</v>

369
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 11>The way we think they are affects us</v>
<v Speaker 11>know.</v>

370
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

371
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.540
<v Speaker 11>There's a subject we don't have time to</v>
<v Speaker 11>get into tonight called better thinking</v>

372
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:09.680
<v Speaker 11>habits.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One of the major things shoaff taught me</v>

373
00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.300
<v Speaker 11>when I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He said,</v>

374
00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:15.290
<v Speaker 11>poor thinking habits keeps most people</v>
<v Speaker 11>poor,</v>

375
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.680
<v Speaker 11>not poor working habits.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Most people work hard,</v>

376
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.790
<v Speaker 11>but they don't think hard.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And shoaff taught me that the mind is</v>

377
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:25.070
<v Speaker 11>like a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a mental factory,</v>

378
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.030
<v Speaker 11>and whatever you think about all day</v>
<v Speaker 11>long pours ingredients into this mental</v>

379
00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:31.010
<v Speaker 11>factory,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's what bill's,</v>

380
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.350
<v Speaker 11>the economic,</v>
<v Speaker 11>social,</v>

381
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 11>financial fabric of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He quoted me a Bible phrase that says as</v>

382
00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:47.711
<v Speaker 11>you think so you become</v>
<v Speaker 11>how awesome.</v>

383
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 11>When he talked about poor thinking</v>
<v Speaker 11>habits,</v>

384
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 11>he had me,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I used to start the day reading the</v>

385
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 11>morning newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

386
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 11>you can leave that or not.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'd get a cup of coffee and read the</v>

387
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 11>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I load up on wars and riots and murders</v>

388
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 11>and stabbings and killings and bank</v>
<v Speaker 11>robberies or muggings and car wrecks and</v>

389
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.430
<v Speaker 11>tragedies.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'd even read the back pages.</v>

390
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 11>I seem to like that stuff for some weird</v>
<v Speaker 11>reason.</v>

391
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 11>I'd load up on all that and then I start</v>
<v Speaker 11>the day.</v>

392
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 11>You can imagine the kind of days I used</v>
<v Speaker 11>to have you walk around on your</v>

393
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:21.920
<v Speaker 11>financial needs.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They call you economic peewee.</v>

394
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

395
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.290
<v Speaker 11>The guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I want to be a great leader.</v>

396
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.740
<v Speaker 11>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The first thing we do is follow him to</v>

397
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:37.960
<v Speaker 11>his house.</v>
<v Speaker 11>When we get there,</v>

398
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.560
<v Speaker 11>we walk in and check his library.</v>

399
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

400
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.891
<v Speaker 11>somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

401
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:50.891
<v Speaker 11>why check his library?</v>
<v Speaker 11>The reason is because what a man reads</v>

402
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:56.801
<v Speaker 11>pours massive ingredients in to his</v>
<v Speaker 11>mental factory and the fabric of his</v>

403
00:24:57.651 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 11>life is built from those ingredients.</v>

404
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.960
<v Speaker 11>You would not believe what some people</v>
<v Speaker 11>have got in their house to read.</v>

405
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.490
<v Speaker 11>You would not believe one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 11>dressed up boards.</v>

406
00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:16.491
<v Speaker 11>I know for a lot of it is trash.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Can you imagine dumping a bale of trash</v>

407
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.370
<v Speaker 11>into this mental factory every day and</v>
<v Speaker 11>coming out with a rich dynamic,</v>

408
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:22.500
<v Speaker 11>positive life?</v>
<v Speaker 11>It can be done.</v>

409
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.000
<v Speaker 11>You might as well try making a cake with</v>
<v Speaker 11>cement.</v>

410
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.630
<v Speaker 11>The kids back in Danbury,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Connecticut High School,</v>

411
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.010
<v Speaker 11>they're asking me questions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One day I'm talking to the kids.</v>

412
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.920
<v Speaker 11>Kids got good questions these days.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One of them said to me,</v>

413
00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:43.440
<v Speaker 11>Mr Rohan,</v>
<v Speaker 11>how do you build the good life?</v>

414
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's simple.</v>

415
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.600
<v Speaker 11>It's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's simple.</v>

416
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.260
<v Speaker 11>Here's how you build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Select the right ingredients,</v>

417
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 11>keep out the wrong ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it starts with thought.</v>

418
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:07.050
<v Speaker 11>Everything starts with thought,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so you must be wise and careful what you</v>

419
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:10.510
<v Speaker 11>think about because that starts</v>
<v Speaker 11>everything.</v>

420
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

421
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:19.120
<v Speaker 11>You gotta be wise and careful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I asked the kids</v>

422
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 11>what would happen if somebody drops</v>
<v Speaker 11>sugar in my coffee?</v>

423
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.431
<v Speaker 11>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

424
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:26.590
<v Speaker 11>you'd be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>

425
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.170
<v Speaker 11>what if somebody dropped strychnine in</v>
<v Speaker 11>my coffee?</v>

426
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.061
<v Speaker 11>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

427
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 11>you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>

428
00:26:33.131 --> 00:26:37.510
<v Speaker 11>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Less than one life is both sugar and</v>

429
00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:42.511
<v Speaker 11>strict nine</v>
<v Speaker 11>you got a big care full.</v>

430
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.580
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what is my worst enemy?</v>

431
00:26:46.581 --> 00:26:48.350
<v Speaker 11>Drops in the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They said,</v>

432
00:26:48.351 --> 00:26:49.190
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you'll be okay.</v>

433
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.710
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what if my best friend,</v>

434
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.720
<v Speaker 11>even by accident drops in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>strychnine?</v>

435
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.471
<v Speaker 11>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

436
00:26:54.471 --> 00:26:55.910
<v Speaker 11>you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>

437
00:26:55.911 --> 00:27:00.911
<v Speaker 11>correct lesson to watch your cough.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You gotta be careful.</v>

438
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Speaker 11>See,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it doesn't matter who hands you the bad</v>

439
00:27:07.971 --> 00:27:10.430
<v Speaker 11>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It doesn't matter where you get the bad</v>

440
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:12.830
<v Speaker 11>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It'll still do its damage on your bank</v>

441
00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:17.831
<v Speaker 11>account wherever you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Mr Shelf gave me one of the greatest</v>

442
00:27:19.091 --> 00:27:20.800
<v Speaker 11>phrases when I first met him when he</v>
<v Speaker 11>said,</v>

443
00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:25.801
<v Speaker 11>gym every day.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Stand guard at the door of your mind.</v>

444
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 11>How important.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Stand guard at the door of your mind</v>

445
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 11>and you decide what goes into your</v>
<v Speaker 11>mental factory.</v>

446
00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:46.750
<v Speaker 11>Don't let anybody just dump anything</v>
<v Speaker 11>they want to in your mental factory</v>

447
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.370
<v Speaker 11>cause you've got to live with the</v>
<v Speaker 11>results.</v>

448
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>here's the last disease and we're</v>

449
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 11>through with this list.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>

450
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 11>we're almost through.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Hang on.</v>

451
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 11>The last subject is very brief,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the last disease,</v>

452
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 11>but this one is deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Engage in this.</v>

453
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 11>When indulgent it even slightly and you</v>
<v Speaker 11>might as well forget the future because</v>

454
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:14.091
<v Speaker 11>it's going to forget you complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 11>crying,</v>

455
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 11>whining,</v>
<v Speaker 11>griping,</v>

456
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 11>a Bible word called murmuring.</v>
<v Speaker 11>See,</v>

457
00:28:20.551 --> 00:28:25.551
<v Speaker 11>that'll ace your future.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Spend five minutes complaining and you</v>

458
00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 11>have wasted five and you may have begun</v>
<v Speaker 11>what's known as economic cancer of the</v>

459
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:33.990
<v Speaker 11>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Surely they will soon haul you off into</v>

460
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 11>a financial desert and there let you</v>
<v Speaker 11>choke on the dust of your own regret.</v>

461
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.880
<v Speaker 11>I hope I said that well so you won't</v>
<v Speaker 11>forget.</v>

462
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.020
<v Speaker 11>It's a deadly disease.</v>

463
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 11>If you don't think it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 11>ask the children of Israel of Old</v>

464
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.310
<v Speaker 11>Testament fame.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Typical of us all their story just</v>

465
00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 11>happened to get in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Story says,</v>

466
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 11>children of Israel were slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 11>God performed a series of dazzling</v>

467
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:04.940
<v Speaker 11>miracles and got him out,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and now they're heading for the promised</v>

468
00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 11>land.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Remember,</v>

469
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 11>the story hadn't for the promise land</v>
<v Speaker 11>tragedy of the story.</v>

470
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.290
<v Speaker 11>They never got their reason from day</v>
<v Speaker 11>one.</v>

471
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.670
<v Speaker 11>They started to complain.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They griped about the water.</v>

472
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.760
<v Speaker 11>They griped about the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They whined and cried and griped about</v>

473
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 11>the food they griped about the</v>
<v Speaker 11>leadership.</v>

474
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 11>They whined and cried because it was too</v>
<v Speaker 11>far,</v>

475
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:35.910
<v Speaker 11>too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 11>too hot,</v>

476
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:38.130
<v Speaker 11>too difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 11>too miserable.</v>

477
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.330
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they widened,</v>

478
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 11>whined and cried for years.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Finally,</v>

479
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 11>God said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've added tip canceled</v>

480
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.950
<v Speaker 11>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The story says they died in the desert,</v>

481
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 11>never got to the promised land.</v>

482
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

483
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.570
<v Speaker 11>Which I think means two things.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Indulge in this long enough.</v>

484
00:30:03.571 --> 00:30:07.890
<v Speaker 11>You get your future cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I guess it also means even God</v>

485
00:30:07.891 --> 00:30:10.080
<v Speaker 11>himself can only take so much,</v>

486
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.203
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

487
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 11>Just be on the lookout of the things</v>
<v Speaker 11>that can destroy all the good you start</v>

488
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.643
<v Speaker 11>the war is on.</v>

489
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

490
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.420
<v Speaker 11>and this evening.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Tomorrow,</v>

491
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.710
<v Speaker 11>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 11>personally,</v>

492
00:30:27.711 --> 00:30:29.060
<v Speaker 11>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 11>economically.</v>

493
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.670
<v Speaker 11>You got to make sure you're winning the</v>
<v Speaker 11>war.</v>
