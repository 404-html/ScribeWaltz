00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I want you to got gathering information</v>
<v Speaker 1>from outside yourself.</v>

2
00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start gathering it from the answer.</v>

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 2>He made a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he paid for his mistake with a lot</v>

4
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 2>of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of tears,</v>

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 2>and there came to a point where he knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should have gotten a divorce,</v>

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 2>but he was stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was stuck in something called</v>

7
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

8
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 2>she's made me so miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pay him back.</v>

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 2>He was stuck and he stayed in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer than he should have because it</v>

10
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 2>began to attack him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It began to affect them psychologically.</v>

11
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 2>He took that same attitude to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships looking for something to</v>

12
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was burned so badly.</v>

13
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 2>He did not want to risk pain again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going in relationships trying to</v>

14
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 2>avoid pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it became two calls,</v>

15
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 2>he would do something to make sure the</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship did not work.</v>

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 2>He would always try and find something</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

17
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>The person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not perfect people,</v>

18
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you look forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find it.</v>

19
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.943
<v Speaker 1>He was stuck</v>

20
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.513
<v Speaker 2>in revenge.</v>

21
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Is he difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure isn't.</v>

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's worthy of character</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

23
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I have to forgive the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>people over and over and over again.</v>

24
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness is a practice worth</v>

25
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>cultivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth experiencing.</v>

26
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>When you forgive somebody for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you perceived that they've done</v>

27
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 1>wrong to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are releasing that animosity,</v>

28
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>that energy that ill will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're harboring inside and it's a</v>

29
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.390
<v Speaker 1>lot more difficult than just merely</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

30
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I once heard somebody say that,</v>

31
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I never met a critic that's doing better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I never met a hater that's doing better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me in that.</v>

33
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my haters.</v>

34
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I love my critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>it would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be amazing if motivation on the</v>

36
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Cape and positive places engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say that.</v>

37
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people speak on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

38
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true and I strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>

39
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people understood what it</v>

40
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>was I was doing at Schafer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there to conduct when you</v>

41
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking moron can wave his arms and keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in tempo.</v>

42
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I was there to push people beyond what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>

43
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an absolute necessity.</v>

44
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I think you become more motivated when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able to transform it and it into</v>

45
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>a positive and sometimes our best</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

46
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm my most motivated by my</v>
<v Speaker 1>critics,</v>

47
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but people who are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people told me,</v>

48
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>who told me I'm too young for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me I can't do what I'm not cut out</v>

49
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That drives me.</v>

50
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Find out the reasons that will make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

51
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Make you walk by faith and not by sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will make you pursue your dream when</v>

52
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>everybody is against you or don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in your number and let me tell</v>

53
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you something that's a lonely feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lonely feeling,</v>

54
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>particularly people that you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for or people that stand to benefit the</v>

55
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or people who should be the number one</v>

56
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:43.501
<v Speaker 1>members in the encouragement club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they end up saying you can't do it,</v>

57
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>and they become members of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discouragement.</v>

58
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts very badly.</v>

59
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have people that you love close to that</v>

60
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>look at you with that look and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you try something else?</v>

61
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you give up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is my life.</v>

62
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I have got to do this.</v>

63
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Everyone tells you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good for you.</v>

64
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to find you all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>

65
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.060
<v Speaker 1>They want you to believe that.</v>
