00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>When you have some goal out here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stretching for and reaching for,</v>

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that takes you out of your comfort zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out some talents and</v>

3
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>abilities you have that you didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had.</v>

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>When the messenger of misery visits you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep you in the gate.</v>

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 2>There are things that you think you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never need to know</v>

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>that you may only need to know one time</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 2>but that could save your life because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that knowledge unless you</v>

9
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>to do something beyond that which you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already mastered,</v>

10
00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you will never grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you looked at at some</v>

11
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>point in time and you decided that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it,</v>

12
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>that you talk yourself out of it.</v>

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You're waiting on your next door</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor to make it happen for you.</v>

14
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 2>It may not happen if you're waiting on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mother or your father.</v>

15
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 2>They may be so ancient in their thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't understand this</v>

16
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that you have and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting on them and they never get done,</v>

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 2>but don't beg average people to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal.</v>

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't beg good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people nominal.</v>

19
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 2>You just are phenomenal and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try phenomenal.</v>

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 2>What reason can you remember that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can call on the chicken restaurant that</v>

21
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 2>can make you get back up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find that reason if you're not where you</v>

22
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not where you want to be,</v>

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have what you want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not where you think you should</v>

24
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 2>be at this particular place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with the system,</v>

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>but it has everything to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you're not making the</v>

26
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to make that dream become a</v>

27
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 2>reality because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be working for somebody else to</v>

28
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 2>make their dreams become a reality.</v>

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is against you or don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in your normal.</v>

30
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lonely feeling.</v>

31
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a lonely feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly people that you're doing it</v>

32
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:55.990
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people take their greatness,</v>

33
00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>take their ideas to the graveyard with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

34
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was easy,</v>

35
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people right now who are</v>

36
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 1>working who don't want to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who hate their jobs,</v>

37
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:14.101
<v Speaker 1>but they keep getting up to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wealthiest place on the planet is</v>

38
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>the graveyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The graveyard,</v>

39
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 1>we will find inventions that we never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever were exposed to.</v>

40
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>

41
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>and never became reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopes and aspirations that were never</v>

42
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>acted upon.</v>

43
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do with your time?</v>

44
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 3>What drives you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greatness as a lot of small things done</v>

45
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:44.491
<v Speaker 3>well day after day after</v>
<v Speaker 3>day after day</v>

46
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>when things don't work out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When things happen that you could not</v>

47
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>anticipate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the reasons that you can think</v>

48
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.244
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>

49
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm only talking to the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to get to the next level of they</v>

50
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.650
<v Speaker 4>life and they're going to boldly walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the next season of their life.</v>

51
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 4>Unapologetically getting rid of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>things people in situations that no</v>

52
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:24.301
<v Speaker 4>longer belong in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of you,</v>

53
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 4>most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so consumed</v>

54
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 4>with everything that's going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

55
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 4>This is the reason you haven't figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>out your own life yet.</v>

56
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.450
<v Speaker 4>Every blog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every website,</v>

57
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 4>every tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every instagram post,</v>

58
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you are so consumed with everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going on in the world.</v>

59
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.740
<v Speaker 4>You're ignoring your own world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can never shy and trying to sit on</v>

60
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 4>someone else's son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can never figure out who you are,</v>

61
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 4>if you're consumed and everything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else is and what they're doing</v>

62
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:15.690
<v Speaker 4>in the moves that they're making because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to chase someone else's</v>

63
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You trying to chase someone else's</v>

64
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle and identity all while</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignoring your own life and your own</v>

65
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 4>path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the vision for your life?</v>

66
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.550
<v Speaker 4>What are the ideas and the dreams for</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life?</v>

67
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 4>What are you supposed to be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who are you?</v>

68
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:37.080
<v Speaker 4>What are your gifts and talents?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is your ultimate destiny and your</v>

69
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:37.914
<v Speaker 4>goals</v>

70
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.800
<v Speaker 4>and you should understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was always going to be your</v>

71
00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 4>family and your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the first ones to try and</v>

72
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 4>talk you out of your vision and your big</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

73
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 4>That's why you supposed to live your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life focused on your intentions and do</v>

74
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 4>your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you allow your self worth to be</v>

75
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:06.590
<v Speaker 4>based on what other people think of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the beginning of the end.</v>

76
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.890
<v Speaker 4>I believe in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stopped believing in me,</v>

77
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to believe in myself any</v>
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>

78
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.160
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that I'm irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one is checking for me and that</v>

79
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean anything to the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you think or believe that about</v>

80
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that I'm going to</v>

81
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 4>believe it about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

82
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 4>the day that you start living your life</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to everybody else's opinion is</v>

83
00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:42.491
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of you guys don't actually know</v>

84
00:05:42.501 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 4>your self worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know yourself.</v>

85
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 4>Value,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in yourself.</v>

86
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Believe in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent of the validation of the</v>

87
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have opinions and feelings about</v>

88
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent of the feedback.</v>

89
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I really think,</v>

90
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 4>and if you get rid of the trash in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

91
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.350
<v Speaker 4>it can be people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>businesses and situations you couldn't</v>

92
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 4>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that you can reach your</v>

93
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 4>full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you</v>

94
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.810
<v Speaker 4>to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you in your career and your</v>

95
00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 4>financial blessings to bypass me.</v>

96
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.490
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never want to be that nine to five</v>

97
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 5>person that just lives my entire life</v>
<v Speaker 5>working a nine to five and just be happy</v>

98
00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.510
<v Speaker 5>with a modest lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

99
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being secure.</v>

100
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:09.630
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all they want.</v>

101
00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 5>They just want a secure lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

102
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 5>own a house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

103
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 5>and be able to retire and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 5>them happy,</v>

104
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just believe that we should always</v>

105
00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 5>be always be pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

106
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.460
<v Speaker 5>to achieve more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's become more,</v>

107
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sit at a job.</v>

108
00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 5>The same job for 30 years is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>something I would ever choose to do in</v>

109
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 5>the society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

110
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are tied to go to college and get a</v>

111
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.720
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're taught.</v>

112
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.820
<v Speaker 5>If you become a doctor or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're successful,</v>

113
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.933
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

114
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 6>most of the time you still have a boss</v>
<v Speaker 6>still have someone you know Tony what to</v>

115
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:49.560
<v Speaker 6>do and you still have a schedule you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to stick to,</v>

116
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's not much different than working</v>

117
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 6>at Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

118
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 6>it's just you're making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're still</v>

119
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 6>working at Mcdonald's or</v>
<v Speaker 6>money,</v>

120
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 6>lifestyle freedom that you want when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>want to know is the most people don't</v>

121
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:13.930
<v Speaker 6>understand that you've got to work hard</v>
<v Speaker 6>at whatever you do,</v>

122
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.910
<v Speaker 6>whether you're working for someone else</v>
<v Speaker 6>or working for yourself.</v>

123
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 6>If you want to put that in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know you're going to end up being</v>

124
00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:22.000
<v Speaker 6>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's what keeps us going.</v>

125
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you become content over</v>

126
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.330
<v Speaker 6>the mentality is what's going to make</v>
<v Speaker 6>things happen.</v>

127
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.550
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is having that mentality and never give</v>

128
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep pushing forward and trying to</v>

129
00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:38.580
<v Speaker 6>accomplish your goals and hopefully you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have more goals constantly trying to</v>

130
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 6>move on to bigger and better things and</v>
<v Speaker 6>find a,</v>

131
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.390
<v Speaker 6>improve ourselves in every area.</v>

132
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 6>You really have to believe what you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing is working.</v>

133
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very important to believe you have</v>

134
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:51.210
<v Speaker 6>to believe to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're doing something you're not</v>

135
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:52.560
<v Speaker 6>hundred percent competent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're doing,</v>

136
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.880
<v Speaker 6>you're going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

137
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 6>someone who is doing maybe not 100</v>
<v Speaker 6>percent correctly,</v>

138
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 6>but they truly believe in their mind</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're doing the best they could</v>

139
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 6>possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they believe what they're doing is</v>

140
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 6>the best possible scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're going to have a lot more</v>

141
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 6>success than someone that is doing it</v>
<v Speaker 6>100 percent right,</v>

142
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 6>but aren't positive and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing,</v>

143
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the mind is the most powerful tool we</v>

144
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 6>have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in order to be a winner,</v>

145
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.280
<v Speaker 6>you have to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

146
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

147
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how you learn.</v>

148
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one day I made him tell him he better</v>

149
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 6>get out there and start busting your</v>
<v Speaker 6>ass,</v>

150
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going forward and never stopped.</v>

151
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 6>Don't miss a day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

152
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 6>one day Mrs can't</v>

153
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.963
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

154
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 6>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Always look at the positive.</v>

155
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the glass is always half full.</v>

156
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 6>If you think positive and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the positive,</v>

157
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 6>you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're only going to continue to get</v>

158
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 6>better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's been positive in every area is</v>

159
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 6>the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the secret to life.</v>

160
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 6>If you're negative about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to fail.</v>

161
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 6>No matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not happy.</v>

162
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.470
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to be better?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you want in every aspect,</v>

163
00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 6>like if you want to better yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 6>every way.</v>

164
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.580
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody else,</v>

165
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 6>and it just what comes around goes</v>
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

166
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.470
<v Speaker 6>The most important thing is to not give</v>
<v Speaker 6>a shit what other people think,</v>

167
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the most important thing to have.</v>

168
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 6>That kind of an attitude and mentality</v>
<v Speaker 6>is rare.</v>

169
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.480
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people are always concerned about what</v>

170
00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:29.400
<v Speaker 6>other people think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no matter who they are,</v>

171
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.660
<v Speaker 6>it really doesn't matter what other</v>
<v Speaker 6>people think,</v>

172
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really doesn't matter if you can have</v>

173
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:39.381
<v Speaker 6>that kind of mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People don't like to think they like to</v>

174
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 6>ask and they don't have enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>confidence in their decisions that they</v>

175
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 6>make on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When they get advice from someone else,</v>

176
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 6>that gives them more competence to</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe that that's gonna work.</v>

177
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.220
<v Speaker 5>We should always be trying to be better</v>
<v Speaker 5>at every aspect in life.</v>

178
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:58.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>whatever it could be.</v>

183
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a million things in life that we</v>

184
00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:09.760
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

185
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.450
<v Speaker 5>I think we should constantly be trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be better in every area.</v>

186
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 5>I kinda liked to just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>when I want to do it is just a great</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling.</v>

191
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 7>What changes our whole life is action.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we take action,</v>

192
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 7>fear or are we going to do to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>ourselves to do it?</v>

193
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you got to make sure that we push</v>

194
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 7>ourselves through.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I'm making a decision,</v>

195
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 7>the point in which change happens is a</v>
<v Speaker 7>decision.</v>

196
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.100
<v Speaker 7>Every change in your life that you want</v>
<v Speaker 7>will come from something simple.</v>

197
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.840
<v Speaker 7>A decision.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People,</v>

198
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.840
<v Speaker 7>what does making change decide</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I persist,</v>

199
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.750
<v Speaker 7>if I continue to try,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I continue to charge forward,</v>

200
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.200
<v Speaker 7>I will succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I will persist until I succeed.</v>

201
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.780
<v Speaker 7>I was not delivered unto this world in</v>
<v Speaker 7>defeat.</v>

202

<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just fair your course in my veins.</v>

203
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.780
<v Speaker 7>I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded</v>
<v Speaker 7>by my shepherd.</v>

204
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.200
<v Speaker 7>I am a lion and I refuse to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to walk,</v>

205
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.840
<v Speaker 7>to sleep with the sheet.</v>

206
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't be a follower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be a student.</v>

207
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Take advice but not orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take information,</v>

208
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but don't let somebody you know order</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life not to do what someone else</v>

209
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take what someone else says.</v>

210
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

211
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Ponder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you wonder.</v>

212
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 2>It makes you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's valuable.</v>

213
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Then when you go take action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that the actions,</v>

214
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 2>not what somebody told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure the action is the product of</v>

215
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:53.014
<v Speaker 2>your own.</v>

216
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 8>I'm exactly where I wanted to be because</v>
<v Speaker 8>I realized I've got to commit my very</v>

217
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:02.450
<v Speaker 8>being to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got to read it.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and until you get there,</v>

219
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.580
<v Speaker 8>once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guarantee you the world is yours.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Invent.</v>

221

<v Speaker 3>Reinvent yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Change your toe shape so often that they</v>

222
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.751
<v Speaker 3>could never categorize you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is</v>

223
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 3>be self taught and reinvent your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you must live.</v>

224
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.773
<v Speaker 3>Your life</v>

225
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 7>belongs to you.</v>

226
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not</v>

227
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 3>everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>is putting in place.</v>

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Happy place this</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

229
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You can only have two things in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons or resolved.</v>

230
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Notice reasons don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>False will always point out reasons on</v>

231
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:44.130
<v Speaker 1>why they are not living their dream on</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're not manifesting their</v>

232
00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 1>greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will always be able to point those</v>

233
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of those things count.</v>

234
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that counts the results</v>
<v Speaker 1>and results don't lie.</v>

235
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell it all judge a tree by the</v>

236
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 1>fruit that it bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the ones that it might talk about,</v>

237
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 1>not the ones that it might wish for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fruit that it actually bears,</v>

238
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the people that are committed are busy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

239
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think that some of us are</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing results in our lives that that</v>

240
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 1>level of commitment brings that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly don't like or find</v>

241
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:25.290
<v Speaker 1>distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take care of yourself.</v>

242
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that as a participant in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

243
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you cannot be committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either committed to mediocrity or</v>

244
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you're committed to greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either committed to being</v>

245
00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:37.710
<v Speaker 1>productive or your committed to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive.</v>

246
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.100
<v Speaker 1>You committed to being happy or you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to being unhappy.</v>

247
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Once I look at how you commit your time</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>

248
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>do an evaluation on how you spend your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

249
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to.</v>

250
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>People that say they have dreams of one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open a business or wanting to do</v>

251
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 1>something differently than what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>now doing.</v>

252
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their jobs are unhappy,</v>

253
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>they're unfulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People said they want to improve their</v>

254
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 1>income level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how they spend their time.</v>

255
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Commitment shows up in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what you do.</v>

256
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.300
<v Speaker 8>You can make the commitment to your</v>
<v Speaker 8>life,</v>

257
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.090
<v Speaker 8>but you know black,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the results that you have and that</v>

258
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:21.690
<v Speaker 8>you're going to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See that power is available to all of</v>

259
00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 8>us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People who look at life,</v>

260
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 8>I want something different for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so most people like to use that</v>

261
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:35.620
<v Speaker 8>language.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't want to commit themselves</v>

262
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:38.380
<v Speaker 8>because commitment means among many</v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

263
00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:41.020
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's feels is acceptable.</v>

264
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.000
<v Speaker 8>If you decided that you want to joe</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

265
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.010
<v Speaker 8>if it becomes it difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if it's inconvenient,</v>

266
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:56.011
<v Speaker 8>so what would your life be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 8>decided to keep your commitments?</v>

267
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.430
<v Speaker 8>One will be like if we decided to keep</v>
<v Speaker 8>our commitments,</v>

268
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.330
<v Speaker 8>but we decided to do the things and we</v>
<v Speaker 8>said that we were going to do,</v>

269
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.490
<v Speaker 8>but we wouldn't even speak it unless we</v>
<v Speaker 8>were going to do it.</v>

270
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.360
<v Speaker 8>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I will do anything.</v>

271
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.350
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Seven days,</v>

272
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 8>you'll feel strong and powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's nothing as powerful as the human</v>

273
00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 8>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't destroy</v>

274
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.250
<v Speaker 8>when you walked the minute you're</v>
<v Speaker 8>dancing to the beat of a different</v>

275
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 8>drummer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't expect people to understand.</v>

276
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.720
<v Speaker 8>Don't expect it to make sense to</v>
<v Speaker 8>anybody.</v>

277
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.990
<v Speaker 8>Why you got to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a good job.</v>

278
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 8>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 8>going,</v>

279
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.720
<v Speaker 8>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't have to</v>

280
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:57.010
<v Speaker 1>look to this day for his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very life of light in its brief</v>

281
00:17:57.011 --> 00:18:00.370
<v Speaker 1>course lie all the realities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>verities of existence,</v>

282
00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the bliss of growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the splendor of action,</v>

283
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the glory of power for yesterday is but</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream and tomorrow is only a vision,</v>

284
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.840
<v Speaker 1>but today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day well lived makes every yesterday</v>

285
00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:15.841
<v Speaker 1>a dream of happiness and every tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vision of hope look well.</v>

286
00:18:16.541 --> 00:18:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this day,</v>

287
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.600
<v Speaker 9>a journey of a thousand miles begins</v>
<v Speaker 9>with a single step from an old Chinese</v>

288
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 9>proverb.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Most people have heard it or have come</v>

289
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 9>across it at some point in the meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Pretty straightforward,</v>

290
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Advocates having the courage to take</v>

291
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 9>that step towards the goal and let's</v>
<v Speaker 9>keep making that decision to move</v>

292
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:56.571
<v Speaker 9>forward towards something you want,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's what happens immediately</v>

293
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 9>following that first step that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 9>interested in.</v>

294
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.010
<v Speaker 9>What happens when the journey's begun</v>
<v Speaker 9>and it's you and your goal in all of a</v>

295
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 9>sudden you realized how long that road</v>
<v Speaker 9>ahead.</v>

296
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 9>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is a turning point for a lot of</v>

297
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:17.311
<v Speaker 9>people and those who can succeed or able</v>
<v Speaker 9>to take their daunting,</v>

298
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 9>intimidating goal or journey and see it</v>
<v Speaker 9>for what it really is.</v>

299
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.230
<v Speaker 9>Just a bunch of small manageable tasks</v>
<v Speaker 9>strung together.</v>

300
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 9>You know when you look at why people</v>
<v Speaker 9>quit,</v>

301
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.400
<v Speaker 9>a lot of the time it's because they were</v>
<v Speaker 9>overwhelmed by their goals and</v>

302
00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 9>ambitions.</v>

303
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 9>Let's say you have this wonderful plan</v>
<v Speaker 9>in your head to climb a mountain.</v>

304
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 9>You're thinking about that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 9>being on top,</v>

305
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 9>looking down with pride.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Every time you think about it,</v>

306
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 9>your heart starts racing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so you pack your stuff,</v>

307
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 9>you make your way down on the base of</v>
<v Speaker 9>the mountain,</v>

308
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.520
<v Speaker 9>and then you look up</v>
<v Speaker 9>different ballgame right now,</v>

309
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:08.700
<v Speaker 9>the entire mountains in front of you and</v>
<v Speaker 9>you realized that that's no small feat.</v>

310
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 9>That is when people walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when they aren't able to see a</v>

311
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 9>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is the sum of tiny steps.</v>

312
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Speaker 9>They see it as a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>impossible task.</v>

313
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.890
<v Speaker 9>It's like saying you want to be the next</v>
<v Speaker 9>Tom Brady or coby Bryan to tall mountain</v>

314
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 9>to climb,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like trying to hit a target from a mile</v>

315
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 9>away,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but if you can identify and map out what</v>

316
00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:38.600
<v Speaker 9>you need to conquer in order to become a</v>
<v Speaker 9>better basketball player,</v>

317
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.930
<v Speaker 9>football player,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and begin taking those small steps,</v>

318
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 9>improving everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that makes real.</v>

319
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 9>That's what gives schools like</v>
<v Speaker 9>the ability to see your objective not as</v>

320
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:53.550
<v Speaker 9>a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but as a series of little 400 meters</v>

321
00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 9>stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 9>stepping stones.</v>

322
00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.370
<v Speaker 9>You know what your objective is today,</v>
<v Speaker 9>tomorrow,</v>

323
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 9>the end of the week and the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 9>year,</v>

324
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 9>and then completing them day by day.</v>
<v Speaker 9>These little victories.</v>

325
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 9>That's what gives you a dream life.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's what gives you momentum.</v>

326
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.200
<v Speaker 9>You feel good about the process,</v>

327
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 9>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when things blow up in your face,</v>

328
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 9>which happens every so often on this</v>
<v Speaker 9>little place,</v>

329
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:19.380
<v Speaker 9>we call them</v>

330
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.213
<v Speaker 3>birth,</v>

331
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.290
<v Speaker 9>you'll have that foundation and that</v>
<v Speaker 9>sense of accomplishment to stay focused</v>

332
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.410
<v Speaker 9>because you're approaches tangible and</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's realistic.</v>

333
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.150
<v Speaker 9>This applies with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Losing a job,</v>

334
00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 9>a breakup,</v>
<v Speaker 9>failing a test.</v>

335
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.700
<v Speaker 9>These things are monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you allow them to know,</v>

336
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.010
<v Speaker 9>they can turn into that unclimbed bubble</v>
<v Speaker 9>mountain</v>

337
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.410
<v Speaker 9>or they can roadmap a new path for you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and if you define what you want,</v>

338
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.880
<v Speaker 9>you define success and begin stepping</v>
<v Speaker 9>towards it one hour,</v>

339
00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 9>one day at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you'll get where you want to be quicker</v>

340
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:55.924
<v Speaker 9>than you thought.</v>

341
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.540
<v Speaker 3>How you can live an easy life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

342
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing goals and be successful in</v>
<v Speaker 3>going out in the world and as tough.</v>

343
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 3>The only way to live an easy life is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically give up on all your dreams and</v>

344
00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:16.040
<v Speaker 3>aspirations and just sit around doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

345
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The disease is not worth accomplishing.</v>

346
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a life that is easy.</v>

347
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not even worth living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing in this world,</v>

348
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.530
<v Speaker 3>it's worth having or doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it means effort,</v>

349
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.060
<v Speaker 3>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and difficulty.</v>

350
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.040
<v Speaker 3>What you listening to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you listen to be good.</v>

351
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 3>You are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of you,</v>

352
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.380
<v Speaker 3>you or your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your family,</v>

353
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.110
<v Speaker 3>everyone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone you care about.</v>

354
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be if you love life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not waste time because time is what life</v>

355
00:22:53.661 --> 00:22:54.560
<v Speaker 3>is made of,</v>

356
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.660
<v Speaker 10>so if you respect and appreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 10>time that you've been given,</v>

357
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 10>why you out there doing what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 10>do,</v>

358
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.620
<v Speaker 10>where you need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 10>telling yourself is an acceptable to be</v>

359
00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:07.830
<v Speaker 10>sitting around procrastinating and I no</v>
<v Speaker 10>longer wants to be a loser.</v>

360
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.400
<v Speaker 10>I no longer wanted to be offered.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I know what it is that at one and I'm</v>

361
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:12.870
<v Speaker 10>going to work hard and I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 10>it.</v>

362
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.820
<v Speaker 2>When you want to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad as you want to breathe,</v>

363
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.010
<v Speaker 2>then you'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly you lost sleep.</v>

364
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 2>More success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm here to tell you today,</v>

365
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.450
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be willing to give up</v>

366
00:23:26.451 --> 00:23:29.540
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be willing to work for three</v>

367
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:30.650
<v Speaker 2>hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

368
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.130
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some days you will have to stay up three</v>

369
00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:34.964
<v Speaker 2>days in a row,</v>

370
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.710
<v Speaker 11>but you don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you don't really want it.</v>

371
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 11>How badly are you wanting success rather</v>
<v Speaker 11>than actually working towards your</v>

372
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 11>dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 11>A lot of you are just thinking about it.</v>

373
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 11>I have high hopes for everybody watching</v>
<v Speaker 11>this.</v>

374
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 11>I want you to remember your name.</v>

375
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.840
<v Speaker 7>It is not the things we do in life that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we regret on our deathbed.</v>

376
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.520
<v Speaker 7>It is the things we do not because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>assure you I've done a lot of really</v>

377
00:24:11.521 --> 00:24:14.610
<v Speaker 7>stupid things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>None of them bother me.</v>

378
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 7>All the mistakes and all the dopey</v>
<v Speaker 7>things and all the times I was</v>

379
00:24:20.161 --> 00:24:22.170
<v Speaker 7>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't matter.</v>

380
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 7>Find your passion and in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no matter what you do at work,</v>

381
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 7>what you do in official settings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that passion will be grounded in people</v>

382
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 7>grounded in the relationships you have</v>
<v Speaker 7>with people and what they think of you</v>

383
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.410
<v Speaker 7>when you were talking</v>

384
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.940
<v Speaker 3>in the teeth of these stupefying odds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you and I,</v>

385
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinarily are here,</v>

386
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 3>but one thing I can tell you ever single</v>
<v Speaker 3>day of my life trying to find somebody</v>

387
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>else change their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I waited till 39 to get married because</v>

388
00:25:25.711 --> 00:25:30.711
<v Speaker 3>I had to wait that long to find someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her happiness was more important</v>

389
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.090
<v Speaker 3>and if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that all of you can find that</v>

390
00:25:36.091 --> 00:25:40.460
<v Speaker 3>kind of passion and that kind of love in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

391
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.023
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

392
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.300
<v Speaker 12>Most people don't even make a resolution</v>
<v Speaker 12>anymore.</v>

393
00:25:46.301 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 12>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Because they made him from years and</v>

394
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.340
<v Speaker 12>years and years and they know they're</v>
<v Speaker 12>not going to follow through.</v>

395
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:53.740
<v Speaker 12>So after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 12>who wants to disappoint yourself?</v>

396
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.060
<v Speaker 12>Who wants to be upset with yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Why even bother to set a new standard</v>

397
00:25:58.061 --> 00:25:59.950
<v Speaker 12>for this year?</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know it's going to be the same as</v>

398
00:25:59.951 --> 00:26:00.784
<v Speaker 12>last year.</v>

399
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Many of us don't act because we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's approval.</v>

400
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.330
<v Speaker 1>We want everybody to like us and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept us,</v>

401
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us don't do the things that we</v>

402
00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 1>want to do and don't act because of lack</v>
<v Speaker 1>of self confidence.</v>

403
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't believe enough in ourselves.</v>

404
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 12>There's no denying that inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They only thing that's gonna make you</v>

405
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 12>happy and but you're adding the decades</v>
<v Speaker 12>ahead.</v>

406
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 12>It's going to be having you have an</v>
<v Speaker 12>experience where on a regular basis you</v>

407
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 12>feel like your life is making progress,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so it's got to be a vision that's</v>

408
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 12>compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 12>something that you know it's going to be</v>

409
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 12>a gift to make sure that it happens.</v>

410
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>If you want to do anything worthwhile in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

411
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Todd and working to develop myself.</v>

412
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to practice everyday being a</v>

413
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 2>disc jockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

414
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have any job now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

415
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that it's better to be prepared</v>

416
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>for an opportunity and not have one than</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have an opportunity and not be</v>

417
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 2>prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No excuse that.</v>

418
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:12.980
<v Speaker 2>If you decided that you want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it becomes hot and do it hot,</v>

419
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 2>if it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>

420
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 12>beginning of the year we have this</v>
<v Speaker 12>tradition,</v>

421
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:22.210
<v Speaker 12>but it goes beyond tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's something inside of us that makes</v>

422
00:27:22.211 --> 00:27:26.140
<v Speaker 12>us want to make things better and I</v>
<v Speaker 12>think part of it is the calendar gives</v>

423
00:27:26.141 --> 00:27:28.150
<v Speaker 12>us this idea that we could have a fresh</v>
<v Speaker 12>start,</v>

424
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.170
<v Speaker 12>that we can start from fresh and have</v>
<v Speaker 12>this great victory and it's really.</v>

425
00:27:32.171 --> 00:27:35.020
<v Speaker 12>The calendar itself is quite arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's wonderful to use it,</v>

426
00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.710
<v Speaker 12>but if you didn't use it effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 12>let's use the Kennel under served you</v>

427
00:27:38.711 --> 00:27:40.900
<v Speaker 12>today.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let's just see what does it really take</v>

428
00:27:40.901 --> 00:27:43.900
<v Speaker 12>to make this thing happen?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Because there's no denying that inside</v>

429
00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:45.430
<v Speaker 12>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The only thing that's gonna make you</v>

430
00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:48.400
<v Speaker 12>happy and but you're adding the decades</v>
<v Speaker 12>ahead.</v>

431
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.660
<v Speaker 12>It's going to be having you up an</v>
<v Speaker 12>experience where on a regular basis you</v>

432
00:27:52.661 --> 00:27:55.510
<v Speaker 12>feel like your life is making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Just think,</v>

433
00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:56.410
<v Speaker 12>what would your life</v>

434
00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.650
<v Speaker 8>be like if you decided to keep your</v>
<v Speaker 8>commitments?</v>

435
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.810
<v Speaker 8>It is important and the area of</v>
<v Speaker 8>motivating yourself.</v>

436
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Speaker 8>It's important to know why you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 8>it because that mind will say,</v>

437
00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:12.770
<v Speaker 8>why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why go through all this?</v>

438
00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:14.840
<v Speaker 8>This is too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

439
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 8>throw in the towel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not worth it.</v>

440
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.650
<v Speaker 12>If you make the change in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're going to be proud this year and</v>

441
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.460
<v Speaker 12>no amount of money or accolades from</v>
<v Speaker 12>other people can mirror the feeling of</v>

442
00:28:27.461 --> 00:28:30.610
<v Speaker 12>being proud of knowing you've taken back</v>
<v Speaker 12>control of your life or you've taken a</v>

443
00:28:30.611 --> 00:28:33.190
<v Speaker 12>great life to another level because once</v>
<v Speaker 12>you do that,</v>

444
00:28:33.191 --> 00:28:34.630
<v Speaker 12>you have something you can give other</v>
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

445
00:28:34.631 --> 00:28:37.720
<v Speaker 12>Would it be your kids or your friends</v>
<v Speaker 12>and your family and ultimately that's</v>

446
00:28:37.721 --> 00:28:38.170
<v Speaker 12>why it's about.</v>
