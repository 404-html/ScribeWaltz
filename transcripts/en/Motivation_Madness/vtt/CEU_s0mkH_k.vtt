1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>What happened with me with this film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I accepted the film and I was really</v>

2
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>excited to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take this and I love the idea and I</v>

3
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:20.841
<v Speaker 1>was reading it and I've gotten probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks into my preparation for the</v>

4
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.981
<v Speaker 1>film and my father was diagnosed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer and I was like,</v>

5
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first it,</v>

6
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it stunned me and then it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical work of the universe.</v>

7
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.881
<v Speaker 1>I could not believe that this was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film I was working on and I was,</v>

8
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to face,</v>

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father is mortality.</v>

10
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rough for about a week and I got</v>

11
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it together and I decided that we would</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the process of the character who was</v>

12
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:01.641
<v Speaker 1>suffering a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would share my preparation with my</v>

13
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we just started talking about</v>

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and death.</v>

15
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.373
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

16
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>it was some of the most open and</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful conversations that we,</v>

17
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:16.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we'd ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

19
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave him six weeks and he actually,</v>

20
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:28.521
<v Speaker 1>he lived for four months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about three months into the six</v>

21
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I go to see him one day and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

23
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>this shit is embarrassing.</v>

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.261
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

25
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Daddy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

26
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you tell everybody you will be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Six weeks later you still hanging around</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms dot right.</v>

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>It was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

29
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>we got to a place that we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>open and,</v>

30
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and comedically yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really I think I was able to embody</v>

31
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:01.361
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of the loss and also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>redemptive quality of the pain.</v>

32
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:03.224
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

33
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.350
<v Speaker 1>the loss is bound to joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pain and suffering are bound to</v>

34
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

35
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to survive something is</v>

36
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>actually a big part of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that next wave of joy.</v>

37
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>You appreciate the smaller things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Like it was so magnificent for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

40
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 1>my father died on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on November seventh,</v>

41
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was so powerful for me to be</v>

42
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:45.221
<v Speaker 1>cleansed of box office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't need the box office to be</v>

43
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>huge on this film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to win any awards,</v>

44
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

45
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It was the film that I worked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually able to comfortably and</v>

46
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.690
<v Speaker 1>beautifully say goodbye to my father and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that this film embodies a bit of</v>

47
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

48
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>So other people who are experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

49
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:13.831
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to use it in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way and it can potentially be</v>

50
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>helpful and help someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

51
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it was powerful to be cleansed of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishness of the game of numbers and</v>

52
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>awards and all of that type of stuff to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be able to be able to create a</v>

53
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.131
<v Speaker 1>piece of art that legitimately I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>want people to see and hope it can be</v>

54
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>helpful and transformative in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

55
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective?</v>

56
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

57
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is fair play into preventing us</v>

58
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>from grasping perspective though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

59
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fears.</v>

60
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>

62
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>if there was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a concept that I would</v>

63
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>suggest to people to take a daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with his fear.</v>

64
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

65
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with fear is that it lies,</v>

66
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fear tells you,</v>

67
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say that to that girl,</v>

69
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>she's going to know he has you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>and she'll never really be attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you if she knows how much you attracted</v>

71
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that.</v>

72
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we get her is when she walks by.</v>

73
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Ignore her.</v>

74
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

75
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>fear tells you dumb shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

76
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the daily confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>we're with fear has become a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice for me since about three,</v>

79
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I went skydiving in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right as skydiving,</v>

82
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.200
<v Speaker 1>skydiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

83
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Confront with fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.890
<v Speaker 1>So I gotta I gotta stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

85
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all your friends,</v>

86
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out how you.</v>

87
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

88
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>dropped my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is you go out the night</v>

89
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>before and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you take a drink with your friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody says,</v>

91
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should go skydiving tomorrow.</v>

92
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll go skydiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody goes,</v>

95
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

96
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And you go home and you're by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

97
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

98
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

99
00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they was drunk too,</v>

100
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

101
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 1>so maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they not,</v>

102
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

103
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to do it.</v>

104
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So then that night you're laying in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and you just keep,</v>

105
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.720
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep imagining over and over again</v>

106
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>jumping out of an airplane and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why you would do that.</v>

107
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're laying there and you have the</v>

108
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>worst night's sleep of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to hope that your</v>

109
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>friends were drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

110
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So you wake up the next day and you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and you said where you were going</v>

111
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>to meet and everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

112
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.853
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

113
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

114
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.861
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool,</v>

115
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:07.371
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

116
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.204
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

117
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get in a van and you don't know</v>

118
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>that your friends had the same night</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had.</v>

119
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're pretending like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

120
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

121
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>my uncle's a navy seal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be great.</v>

122
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

123
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

124
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>And your stomach is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat.</v>

125
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>And everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to be the only punk</v>

126
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't jump out of this airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get there and then you have the</v>

127
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>safety brief and you're standing there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guys will tell you what the</v>

128
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>chute doesn't open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen is you're doing,</v>

129
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you will help with while working out</v>

130
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.900
<v Speaker 1>the shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shoe wouldn't open,</v>

131
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do a thing and what you do is</v>

132
00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 1>your first jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're attached to a guy who,</v>

133
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to walk you out.</v>

134
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:54.561
<v Speaker 1>So you go and you get there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an airplane and nobody's stopping.</v>

135
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get onto the airplane and you're</v>

136
00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's extra because you sit</v>

137
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>in on some dude's lap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stranger,</v>

138
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you sit on his lap and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make small talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

140
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.721
<v Speaker 1>So you deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>

141
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd be jumping with people all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

142
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.904
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

143
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just want to make sure you</v>

145
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.851
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got kids,</v>

146
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got people you need to see.</v>

147
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Just want to make sure he series right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get in there,</v>

148
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>so everything's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fly and you go up,</v>

149
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you go up and you go up and you go up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,000 feet and you notice there's a,</v>

150
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.450
<v Speaker 1>a light is red and it's yellow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

151
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now the light's red.</v>

152
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So then you start thinking at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light's going to go green if you</v>

153
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

154
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And you wait and it goes yellow and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light goes green and somebody opens the</v>

155
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:48.580
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that moment you realize you've</v>

156
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 1>never been in a freaking airplane with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door open,</v>

157
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.143
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

158
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terror.</v>

159
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

160
00:07:56.251 --> 00:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

161
00:07:58.961 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

162
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror,</v>

163
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror.</v>

164
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go and then you know,</v>

165
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were smart,</v>

166
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you sat in the back so you don't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

167
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people start going out of the</v>

168
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:17.881
<v Speaker 1>airplane and you go and the guy walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up to the end of the thing and</v>

169
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:24.631
<v Speaker 1>you're standing and your toes are on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge and you're looking out down to</v>

170
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.560
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

171
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.453
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm three.</v>

172
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And they say one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

173
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and he pushes you on to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people grab one three,</v>

174
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go</v>

175
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and you fall out of the airplane and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one second you realize that it's the</v>

176
00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:55.191
<v Speaker 1>most blissful experience of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your flying right?</v>

177
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like you actually are Kinda held a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit by the wind and then you</v>

179
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 1>start and you start falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fallen,</v>

180
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's zero fear.</v>

181
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You realize that the point of maximum</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger is the point of minimum fear.</v>

182
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.140
<v Speaker 1>It's Boulez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bliss and you're flying,</v>

183
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're doing it.</v>

184
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And then 20 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 seconds,</v>

185
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.610
<v Speaker 1>40 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have enough time to just kind of</v>

186
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

187
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.070
<v Speaker 1>That's that building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like.</v>

188
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

189
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.740
<v Speaker 1>You start doing all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lesson for me was,</v>

190
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.680
<v Speaker 1>why were you scared in your bed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night before?</v>

191
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Why did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need that fear for?</v>

192
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Just don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you scared in your bed?</v>

193
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen hours before you jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you scared in the car?</v>

194
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Why could you not enjoy breakfast with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

195
00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you need to fear is fear of</v>

196
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:04.100
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nowhere even near the airplane.</v>

197
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything up to the stepping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually no reason to be scared.</v>

198
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>It only just ruins your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

199
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in that moment,</v>

200
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.960
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden where you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified is the most blissful</v>

201
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.050
<v Speaker 1>experience of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God placed the best things in life</v>

202
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of your maximum fear.</v>

203
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.830
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best things in life.</v>

204
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

205
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my experience with,</v>

207
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with sky diving and fear and practically</v>

208
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:44.200
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like that take.</v>

209
00:10:44.201 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to this.</v>

210
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I can sell that better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can sell it back.</v>

211
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.260
<v Speaker 1>When you decide to do something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

212
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.140
<v Speaker 1>like how does it work practically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you call your wife and be like,</v>

213
00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I might be dead tomorrow right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the promise.</v>

214
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I made a drug promise you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>

215
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had such a mystical,</v>

216
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 1>powerful spiritual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew home and got my sons and I went</v>

217
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:17.041
<v Speaker 1>back and 10 days later my son's jumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

218
00:11:17.861 --> 00:11:19.640
<v Speaker 1>That was a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it.</v>

219
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It makes me stand out because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

220
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one.</v>

221
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:27.260
<v Speaker 1>So Jayden went first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Jaiden wants to do everything first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

223
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sons are going to have this crazy</v>

224
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:34.850
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Jaden went out of the airplane</v>

225
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.713
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

226
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My oldest son Trey goes up and he goes</v>

227
00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:46.351
<v Speaker 1>out of the airplane and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could potentially be the worst.</v>

228
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I have African American parenting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

229
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like both my sons just fell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an airplane.</v>

230
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I told them to.</v>

231
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear again,</v>

232
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

233
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>So I told the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

234
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see them go out,</v>

235
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>but I also want to see them land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

236
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:08.434
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

237
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So this time we went out and we did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight bullet and I just went straight</v>

238
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass them.</v>

239
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.873
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

240
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.583
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

241
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the bullish straight past,</v>

242
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.010
<v Speaker 1>pulled his shoot late,</v>

243
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.543
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

244
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>pull the shoot late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>landed and then videoed them coming</v>

245
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like they had the same thing,</v>

246
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the same experience with the fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that I'm telling you,</v>

247
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>the confrontation with fear is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute,</v>

248
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 1>a magical way of facing the things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do in this life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>feeling and an energy,</v>

298
00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

299
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:20.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

300
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.570
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful way to help relieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some little touch of suffering,</v>

302
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when people see me or the fresh</v>

303
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:33.320
<v Speaker 1>prince and even during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies that I made while I was</v>

304
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 1>making the fresh prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was the fresh prince during the</v>

305
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>winter and then the summers were bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys</v>

306
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.173
<v Speaker 3>pendants,</v>

307
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like,</v>

308
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it really captured a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

309
00:15:48.461 --> 00:15:49.000
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

310
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>

311
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:55.891
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love being able to make people smile</v>

312
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.000
<v Speaker 1>and sheer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 1>over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also am going to boldly go to new</v>

314
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:04.080
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

315
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even something,</v>

316
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.770
<v Speaker 1>something like the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

317
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the two screenplays in front of me</v>

318
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.330
<v Speaker 1>for the independent state two and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide squad.</v>

319
00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>So I had to choose between the two of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those and even the choice of going to</v>

320
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.010
<v Speaker 1>suicide squad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know nothing about the qualities of the</v>

321
00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:27.520
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the choice of trying to go forward</v>

322
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.700
<v Speaker 1>versus clinging and climbing backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:34.420
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to aggressively go forward and</v>

324
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 1>do new things and create and hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>be able to stumble upon a new hay day.</v>

<v Speaker 3>also the struggle with his death.</v>

357
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Because the other thing is that we live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a time where people show these</v>

358
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:24.610
<v Speaker 3>curated sides of them because I think of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same fair,</v>

359
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

361
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.030

<v Speaker 1>but he wants to hear all of that.</v>

362

<v Speaker 1>for me is laughing is the elixir and</v>

370
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>that was another thing that my father</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me.</v>

371
00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:02.090
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was joking all the way up to the end,</v>

372
00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 1>like laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to laugh at</v>

373
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me the beautiful part is that</v>

374
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.770
<v Speaker 1>that's my natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a color on the spectrum.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

377
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.460
<v Speaker 1>when I'm looking at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying to find why that's</v>

378
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:26.890
<v Speaker 1>funny and it's been really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helpful in,</v>

379
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>in this experience and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just a this point in my life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>a really that beautiful Christmas flavor</v>
<v Speaker 1>was know,</v>

396
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.850
<v Speaker 1>just a little touch outside of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:20:09.851 --> 00:20:14.851
<v Speaker 1>so you get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to deal with real subjects and</v>

398
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>real topics and real loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it touches just that New</v>

399
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.320
<v Speaker 1>York Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit outside of the,</v>

400
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how excruciating it would be if you</v>

401
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>dealt with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

402
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.260
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard rated our loss,</v>

403
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.051
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

404
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I just love going into that realm of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.550
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

406
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the mystical to be able to take a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

407
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>real human issues.</v>

409
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.140
<v Speaker 3>So you're talking about real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt it was the most related.</v>

410
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.410
<v Speaker 3>You be really</v>

411
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.780
<v Speaker 2>like I felt there was no filter there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wondered for somebody who could</v>

412
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 2>choose to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that something special that drove</v>

413
00:20:58.661 --> 00:20:59.494
<v Speaker 2>you to this?</v>

414
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

415
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.300
<v Speaker 1>when I first read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:21:02.301 --> 00:21:03.500
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first read it,</v>

417
00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:05.240
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:10.241
<v Speaker 1>you read a screenplay and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing in a movie,</v>

419
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.141
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:12.974
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

421
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.210
<v Speaker 1>the two most important things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for is one is the universally</v>

422
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.640
<v Speaker 1>relatable concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

423
00:21:19.641 --> 00:21:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So just at its core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first say it,</v>

424
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 1>when you say one line about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you connect to people you know,</v>

425
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.841
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:21:29.841 --> 00:21:31.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ones I've ever had with</v>

427
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.260
<v Speaker 1>something with like I am legend,</v>

428
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.120
<v Speaker 2>the last man on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:21:36.121 --> 00:21:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Security</v>

430
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.650
<v Speaker 2>is actually right here,</v>

431
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like when you,</v>

432
00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:47.480
<v Speaker 1>when you just have that one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:21:47.481 --> 00:21:50.420
<v Speaker 1>and with this it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bit heavier,</v>

434
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was a guy trying to put his life</v>
<v Speaker 1>back together after an extreme loss.</v>

435
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people can relate to that.</v>

436
00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:01.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an extremely relatable idea.</v>

437
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I flipped to the last 10 pages</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ending,</v>

438
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

439
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a movie that has lots of twists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turns,</v>

440
00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:14.960
<v Speaker 1>but then even within the last 10 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still another surprise when you</v>

441
00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:18.890
<v Speaker 1>can send people out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a movie theater with another</v>

442
00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:20.690
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

443
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.170
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically there's been times I've</v>

444
00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:28.100
<v Speaker 1>sent people out of the movie theater and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surprise in the last 10 minutes is</v>

445
00:22:28.101 --> 00:22:29.180
<v Speaker 1>that the movie wasn't good,</v>

446
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just want to avoid that surprise.</v>

447
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.840
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid that one.</v>

448
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.790
<v Speaker 1>but with this one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has such an interesting turn in,</v>

450
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:42.220
<v Speaker 1>in the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

451
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:43.054
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

452
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fun screenplays I've</v>

453
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:45.980
<v Speaker 1>ever read.</v>

454
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing movies at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still?</v>

455
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're rich.</v>

456
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.190
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we say,</v>

457
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.170
<v Speaker 2>cock up your foot back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cock up my foot and rock back,</v>

458
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.210
<v Speaker 2>getting you out of bed to still go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this thing.</v>

459
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

460
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy</v>

461
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 1>connecting with people and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

462
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

463
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I have a mission statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every year,</v>

464
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.640
<v Speaker 1>for probably the past 10 years I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out a mission statement for</v>

465
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:24.140
<v Speaker 1>myself and for the last few few years</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mission statement has stayed the</v>

466
00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:26.030
<v Speaker 1>same and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.120
<v Speaker 1>it's been improved lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

468
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go into something,</v>

469
00:23:31.491 --> 00:23:36.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for how the quality of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece could potentially improve lives,</v>

470
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's all along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when you make the movie and how</v>

471
00:23:40.821 --> 00:23:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process and you know,</v>

472
00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:44.091
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

473
00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 1>the concept of lives runs through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center of everything I do.</v>

474
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

475
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>the way to improve lives is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually improve yourself.</v>

476
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that,</v>

477
00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning when I,</v>

478
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 1>when I get out of the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't fixed everything in the world</v>

480
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

481
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 1>So there's always something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this film I read an interesting</v>

482
00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:12.340
<v Speaker 1>quote for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

483
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.380
<v Speaker 1>sit hearth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Gotama,</v>

484
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

485
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

486
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good people have to get out of the bed</v>

487
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 1>every day and try to empty the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a ladle.</v>

488
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was a new,</v>

489
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 1>that was profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I paused for a second and I said,</v>

490
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is a ladle?</v>

491
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

492
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I touched it on my ipad is later.</v>

494
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a big spoon,</v>

495
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 1>spoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoon,</v>

496
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 1>a soup spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

497
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 1>why you assume smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So try to empty the ocean with a soup</v>

498
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 1>spoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.870
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mentality of how you,</v>

500
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you wake up everyday to try to do good</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

501
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:57.301
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

502
00:24:57.301 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really driven by continually trying</v>

503
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:02.830
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>love as many people as effectively as,</v>

506
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.290
<v Speaker 1>as possible with this mystery of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been given.</v>
