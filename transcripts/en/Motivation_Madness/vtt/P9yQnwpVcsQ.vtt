1
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one thing that disciplined</v>

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>definitely does help you with is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you get things done and when you</v>

3
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you actually do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:22.574
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you have more success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have more success and sometimes a</v>

7
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>big part of success is just not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lazy and just doing it,</v>

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>just get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like 90 percent of it is just</v>

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there and start working.</v>

10
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not going to feel perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>If I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I only worked out when I felt good,</v>

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a fat fuck because there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of days I don't want to do it.</v>

13
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much the same with everybody</v>

14
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>that if that actually gets good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you get,</v>

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be those days you pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and they're the,</v>

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>they're probably going to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous than the days you don't.</v>

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the benefit of discipline in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes has always been that through</v>

18
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>discipline I get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>

19
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I always say that I'm like the most lazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined person I know because I</v>

20
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>but I always do.</v>

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>One of the big problems is sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing the work and you,</v>

23
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:21.681
<v Speaker 1>you gotta an pressfield talks about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the most concise and beautiful way</v>

24
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>and he labels it like an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls it resistance,</v>

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you have to sit down and you</v>

26
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>have to overcome resistance and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro goes to work and it doesn't matter</v>

27
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you have kids.</v>

28
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a pro and you go to work and that</v>

29
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:43.231
<v Speaker 1>and that just it puts it in your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is what I do and this is when</v>

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you have pride in that and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in front of that keyboard and</v>

31
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.681
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

32
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look down the count,</v>

33
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fuck a thousand words today.</v>

34
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I put a thousand words and you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

35
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the work and out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

36
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>gems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blossom,</v>

37
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>little things.</v>

38
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>But you might have a day where you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>write nothing but dog shit.</v>

39
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show up again tomorrow and tomorrow out</v>

40
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>of that dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a flower emerge.</v>

41
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way to develop real,</v>

42
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really develop your potential 100</v>

43
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>percent in anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's as an author or even as a</v>

44
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of creativity in martial</v>

45
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be a great striker,</v>

46
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>you have to be creative because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

47
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop patterns or execute</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are,</v>

48
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to be perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that life is hard,</v>

49
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>something you're supposed to shield from</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

50
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

51
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I've had this conversation with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends because,</v>

52
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that I know that's interesting</v>

53
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>how to fucked up life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

54
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but now we have kids and the last thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want is our kids to have a fucked up</v>

55
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

56
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>So we put our kids in these good</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

57
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We live in these nice neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody eats healthy and there's no</v>

58
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking domestic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody seems it's so different</v>

59
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>than all of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about it,</v>

60
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>me and Brian Calendar actually talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

61
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

62
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>we all had fucked up childhoods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody we know had fucked up</v>

63
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>childhoods and they're all interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want my kids to be boring,</v>

64
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but I also want them to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

65
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you approach that?</v>

66
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I think you get involved is what I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen to do is get my kids involved in</v>

67
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

68
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give them the opportunity to pursue</v>

69
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>difficult things and understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>through pursuing these difficult things,</v>

70
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>like in accomplishing stuff like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something about yourself,</v>

71
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you learn that you have this ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of you to overcome,</v>

72
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>get obsessed with life improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find things that you enjoy doing.</v>

73
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>They're difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do them and get better.</v>

74
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>It seems so simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a ridiculous idealistic</v>

75
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's effective.</v>

76
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need some form,</v>

77
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>some amount of pride and some amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego to get good at things in the first</v>

78
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>place because it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive notion because you have</v>

79
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>to have a belief in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able,</v>

80
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first,</v>

81
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>when you start out at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your white belt,</v>

82
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Speaker 1>like I remember being a white belt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>

83
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fucking never going to get good at</v>

84
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to suck forever.</v>

85
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>But to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

86
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at people who are better than</v>

87
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to have sucked at one point in</v>

88
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:09.851
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

89
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.470
<v Speaker 1>this guy be somewhere along the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tunnel.</v>

90
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to keep going.</v>

91
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>and that takes ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ego drives,</v>

93
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 2>you know you to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me To be successful.</v>

94
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Egos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's driving you?</v>

95
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:28.640
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you let it go too</v>
<v Speaker 2>far and you know everything,</v>

96
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:30.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything takes balance.</v>

97
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a dichotomy and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every part of you has a dichotomy.</v>

98
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get so into the physical aspects</v>

99
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 2>of things that you end up like doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of steroids and going crazy and</v>

100
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 2>ruining your health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>

101
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 2>The other end of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you can sit around and play video games</v>
<v Speaker 2>and turned into a</v>

103
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding is a great example of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you start lifting weights</v>

104
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.541
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

105
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be stronger and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a little bit bigger.</v>

106
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:56.751
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at that,</v>

107
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I got a muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

108
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>this is cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you keep going and then you</v>

109
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some guys get so fucking crazy they</v>

110
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>won't stop until they have 22 inch arms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to have thighs that are so</v>

111
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to walk like they're,</v>

112
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>they've got a barrel in between their</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and you know,</v>

113
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't help but they just take</v>

114
00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it to some completely unhealthy place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

115
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

117
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just the nature of trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at something.</v>

118
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.450
<v Speaker 1>You've got to recognize what's good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is just fucking insane.</v>

119
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>For some people especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just experiencing way too much</v>

120
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:34.010
<v Speaker 1>pressure and that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's just a,</v>

121
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>an imbalanced and perspective and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it's in like a,</v>

122
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom wants,</v>

123
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>her daughter does gymnastics with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and we were talking about um,</v>

124
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.200
<v Speaker 1>kids killing themselves where she used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

125
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 1>She still live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

126
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the really wealthy tech areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of San Francisco and a bunch of</v>

127
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>kids that went to school with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter that were like 15,</v>

128
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're jumping off bridges and shit.</v>

129
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an epidemic and they were trying to</v>

130
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're literally calling it</v>

131
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Affluenza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That these affluent kids and their</v>

132
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>families are literally worth a billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

133
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.240
<v Speaker 1>everybody's super rich and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>having this insane pressure like before</v>

135
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>high school and in high school to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League schools and to get four</v>

136
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:19.784
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

137
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not having any fun and they're</v>

138
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>not experienced in life and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any hope.</v>

139
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And their parents are all on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills and they're just killing</v>

140
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves for some people out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't feeling good.</v>

141
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just fucking struggled more,</v>

142
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>you get over that struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel better.</v>

143
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I swear by it,</v>

144
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I felt shitty myself and then force</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to work out.</v>

145
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Then after I get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

146
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent guarantee.</v>

147
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.750
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to break momentum</v>
<v Speaker 1>to momentum.</v>

148
00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Momentum or momentum.</v>

149
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Momentum is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Momentum.</v>

150
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.480
<v Speaker 1>When I get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I get on a good groove of</v>

151
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.310
<v Speaker 1>working out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like after I'm done working out,</v>

152
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to get in there again.</v>

153
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to work out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the good momentum,</v>

154
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>but then there's that bad momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get injured or something like</v>

155
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>that and you can't do anything for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and then to try to get</v>

156
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>that kickstart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant motor up again.</v>

157
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get momentum.</v>

158
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit food and then by the end of the day</v>

159
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>your body's in a crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're body's just processing all this</v>

160
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:27.671
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and if you're eating a big like</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit lunch filled with nonsense,</v>

161
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>like your body's got to process all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

162
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>and so at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose your willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when 5:00,</v>

164
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>6:00 rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be tired,</v>

165
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a healthy lunch and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're,</v>

166
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you're properly fueled and then you also</v>
<v Speaker 1>have positive people in your life,</v>

167
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>everyone's motivated by the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

168
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck you thing is,</v>

169
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>just go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just force yourself to do it.</v>

170
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you feel like shit because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ate lunch,</v>

171
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>then your lunch was filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

172
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dummy,</v>

173
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>don't eat shitty lunch tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

174
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Try a nice salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a salad with some salmon and see how you</v>

175
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:03.801
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like,</v>

176
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel way better today at 6:00 dot.</v>

177
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your decision making will be better</v>

178
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand how significant</v>

179
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these little decisions,</v>

180
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the.</v>

181
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the path for the rest of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence on earth,</v>

182
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>and if you decide to go to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheetos,</v>

183
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:21.240
<v Speaker 1>chocolate chip cookie route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

184
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're just making a shit path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're carving and your fucking path</v>

185
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>through broken rocks and glass and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the way to go.</v>

186
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what else doesn't exist in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day life,</v>

187
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>a place where it's okay to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually okay to be a man.</v>

188
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to have man thoughts like</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is so,</v>

189
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Speaker 1>so toned down and neutered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like human resources and corporate</v>

190
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>life has watered down people's natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior to the point where people are</v>

191
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>just dying on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in these fucking cubicles</v>

192
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>rotting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just freaking the fuck out.</v>

193
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Having all these thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can entertain having to pretend to</v>

194
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>be someone there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not all day long putting on</v>

195
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>this bullshit way of talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fake way of thinking.</v>

196
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got a subscribe to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous policies their</v>

197
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>company wants to enforce and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a robot and you get out of there and you</v>

198
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 1>just want to scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this fear of discomfort.</v>

199
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>People have this extreme feeling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind when it comes to their</v>

200
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 1>associations with exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to avoid discomfort.</v>

201
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.990
<v Speaker 1>They feel like anytime exercise is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something to be avoided,</v>

202
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:34.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

203
00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to strain,</v>

204
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times this association that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have is about the beginnings of</v>

205
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.990
<v Speaker 1>getting in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about once you're actually fit</v>

206
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 1>because once you're actually fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise is something you look forward</v>

207
00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:47.020
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

208
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.670
<v Speaker 1>It's an alleviation of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

209
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I can't get a workout in,</v>

210
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I look at my schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

211
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.090
<v Speaker 1>ah Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any time for a workout,</v>

212
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.340
<v Speaker 1>which means I'm not going to get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>good feeling,</v>

213
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and so instead of looking at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

214
00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go grant and sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good.</v>

215
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to feel relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm</v>

216
00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:10.660
<v Speaker 1>not going to feel even appreciative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my appreciation of things.</v>

217
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.370
<v Speaker 1>It gets enhanced greatly after exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel better.</v>

218
00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I can take things in for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are rather than,</v>

219
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the weather was,</v>

220
00:10:20.561 --> 00:10:25.240
<v Speaker 1>sensory data that I'm getting from any</v>
<v Speaker 1>event is just one more distraction that</v>

221
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.510
<v Speaker 1>gets in my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

222
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.920
<v Speaker 1>and know that that's a lot of times how</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at things if I'm overstressed or</v>

223
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.910
<v Speaker 1>if I'm working too much like our bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

224
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

225
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 1>their associations are to avoid anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's uncomfortable.</v>

226
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's so illogical because when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at comfort and you look at success</v>

227
00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:50.581
<v Speaker 1>and progress and the eventual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feelings of accomplishment and of</v>

228
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.240
<v Speaker 1>getting past certain hurdles and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like how you feel about life,</v>

229
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those are connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort.</v>

230
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Discomfort is your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is like discomfort and,</v>

231
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and not being happy and content with</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain situations in life or certain</v>

232
00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:10.030
<v Speaker 1>feelings in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are massive,</v>

233
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.230
<v Speaker 1>massive motivators and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing at,</v>

234
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.670
<v Speaker 1>at facilitating change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet our instinct is to avoid those</v>

235
00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>and just sit on the couch and watch some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking reality show about dudes who</v>

236
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:29.201
<v Speaker 1>make moonshine with our jaw open bazaar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

237
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:31.480
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get,</v>

238
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 1>when I get like really disciplined and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

239
00:11:35.171 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get really consistent with my</v>

240
00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:40.120
<v Speaker 1>workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I feel,</v>

241
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel momentum.</v>

242
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's like a push behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

243
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:45.441
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

244
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:45.881
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:47.920
<v Speaker 1>like after I get out of the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a really good workout.</v>

246
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:48.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

247
00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:50.590
<v Speaker 1>now I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it all the time now.</v>

248
00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking forward to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

249
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:57.421
<v Speaker 1>And it makes resistance much weaker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes my motivation and my discipline</v>

250
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is based on just the</v>

251
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 1>consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about recently on the podcast.</v>

253
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:11.010
<v Speaker 1>like blowing something off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just not like blowing off a of</v>

255
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>an exercise that you planned is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad for you physically.</v>

256
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>It's also bad mentally because then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>option is now available.</v>

257
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 1>The option to fuck off is available and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it before and you're probably</v>

258
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>going to do it again and you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>mediocre results.</v>

259
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Not just in that aspect of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe in all aspects of your life</v>

260
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 1>because I think that option to fuck off</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you embrace it,</v>

261
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>that is a pathway that you might choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to dealing with conflict</v>

262
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>in your personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with business decisions,</v>

263
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>dealing with career decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an uncomfortable decision that you</v>

264
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:49.981
<v Speaker 1>might be faced with when you maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to make a change as far as what</v>

265
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>your pathway is in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do it instead you fuck off</v>

266
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.310
<v Speaker 1>and that the inclination to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that gathers momentum as well.</v>

267
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.090
<v Speaker 1>The inclination to be disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That comes with momentum too and I think</v>

268
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>both things like you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a path,</v>

269
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>the path of the healthy person or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>path of the fuck off like this is not</v>

270
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>like your body is like a race car that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can juice up yourself.</v>

271
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you can add the fat tires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can add the improve suspension.</v>

272
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 1>You can beef up the horsepower in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>

273
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>You could do all that yourself or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could just choose to have this shitty</v>

274
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>body that's always falling apart on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're essentially ecosystems,</v>

275
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>

276
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 1>we're in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This weird consciousness that has all</v>

277
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>this resistance and has all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclination towards comfort and fucking</v>

278
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:43.591
<v Speaker 1>off and blowing things off is what is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge of making all these things happen</v>

279
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that keep this ecosystem healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like if earth itself had</v>

280
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>like a shitty manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 1>if there was a manager of a natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager of earth that was like,</v>

282
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares if it rains?</v>

283
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's let you know I'm,</v>

285
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop growing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit anymore.</v>

286
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's all stupid anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

287
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's literally like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

288
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>just blow it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

289
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's just kill all the life will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all going to die eventually.</v>

290
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun only lasts 7 billion years.</v>

291
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 3>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the perspective a lot of people</v>

292
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.750
<v Speaker 3>take with Adrian where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

293
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:23.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to age.</v>

294
00:14:23.151 --> 00:14:24.860
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

295
00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:25.850
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

296
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is to age better.</v>

297
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is to increase your health</v>

298
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:33.530
<v Speaker 3>span,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

299
00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 3>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know is possible like that can.</v>

300
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some of these like centenarians</v>

301
00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:40.950
<v Speaker 3>and Supercentenarians I've seen that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

302
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 100 years old and they're like</v>

303
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:48.230
<v Speaker 3>riding bikes and racing and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're old,</v>

304
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.100
<v Speaker 3>they're very old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're experiencing got a</v>

305
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 1>very good quality of and experiencing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of life that these other people</v>

306
00:14:55.191 --> 00:15:00.191
<v Speaker 1>that don't exercise feel they physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel their own body diminishing and they</v>

307
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>just feel it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

308
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting your time.</v>

309
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You're out there running around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no we're not because this experience</v>

310
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like no one's under the</v>

311
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:14.591
<v Speaker 1>illusion that you're gonna live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are enhancing the experience</v>

312
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that you're currently involved in right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you are alive.</v>

313
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do experience this life.</v>

314
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>But do you experience this life</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimally?</v>

315
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it as enjoyable as it can be?</v>

316
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And we all know that there's a spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that enjoyability,</v>

317
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 1>like we've all had times in our life</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's not been so great and then</v>

318
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>times in a life where everything came</v>
<v Speaker 1>together like what a fucking great day,</v>

319
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like make more of those.</v>

320
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you could make more of those and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole things better.</v>

321
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think when that whole thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

322
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>it affects everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You touch everybody that's around you,</v>

323
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody you come in contact with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in turn,</v>

324
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds so grandiose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>

325
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 1>in turn can affect the entire race of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

326
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered if the depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people see in mass today,</v>

327
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:05.830
<v Speaker 1>there's so much depression that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a ca.</v>

328
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a common trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a common condition.</v>

329
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he suffers from depression.</v>

330
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she suffers from depression.</v>

331
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:15.851
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

332
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:17.040
<v Speaker 1>he's got herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

333
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

334
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a common thing.</v>

335
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered or I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering more and more recently,</v>

336
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.940
<v Speaker 1>it really hit me when have you ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Heimos Arctic adventure?</v>

337
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.090
<v Speaker 1>This guy lives in this incredibly remote</v>
<v Speaker 1>area of the Arctic National Wildlife</v>

338
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Refuge in the Alaskan interior and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in this really small log cabin</v>

339
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.950
<v Speaker 1>and he hunts and gathers and that's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does and he's very smart.</v>

340
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not a dummy at all and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been up there.</v>

341
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>He lives with his wife and his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He raised children up there and it's</v>

342
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

343
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 1>There's some dark moments and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they lived like this from the</v>

344
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:00.940
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they had children up there and</v>

345
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>they lost their two year old baby in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking canoe.</v>

346
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they tipped over in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a canoe and lost their kid and it's</v>

347
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:13.660
<v Speaker 1>like it's really intense when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>revisit the site and leave flowers and</v>

348
00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:16.480
<v Speaker 1>it was like 30 years ago and they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>several children since then.</v>

349
00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:20.050
<v Speaker 1>But this moment is still like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense moment of loss for them where</v>

350
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:25.051
<v Speaker 1>they lost their baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this fucking guy is very happy and</v>

351
00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:28.840
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart and very connected and very</v>

352
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:33.250
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he firmly believes that human</v>

353
00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:38.251
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we evolved and developed and were</v>

354
00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:41.590
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherers that there's a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewards,</v>

355
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 1>there's reward systems that are set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the human body,</v>

356
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 1>inside the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

357
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.320
<v Speaker 1>the very being that we embody that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get met in today's society and it's one</v>

358
00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>of the things that's causing depression.</v>

359
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's causing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>funk that people are in is that we're</v>

360
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>living our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us,</v>

361
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>at least in these very unfulfilling ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to this office with</v>

362
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>artificial light and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you don't want to do all day</v>

363
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>long and then you get home and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired and on top of that you're eating</v>

364
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're eating potato chips and you're</v>

365
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>drinking soda and your body is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

366
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be out in the fields</v>

367
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to be walking up hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be looking for animals</v>

368
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>or gathering vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be doing all these</v>

369
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 1>things that our body's designed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be in nature and</v>

370
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 1>nature is like a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it literally is a medicine to you,</v>

371
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 1>like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that go,</v>

372
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go fishing,</v>

373
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:38.910
<v Speaker 1>just go fucking hike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

374
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Just go hike up to the top of a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look out,</v>

375
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reward that you get from that</v>

376
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>that is intensely like soul filling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like something about like when I</v>

377
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 1>was in Colorado and there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this area of boulder where you drive up</v>

378
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 1>one of these roads and there's this area</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could park and it was this</v>

379
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 1>incredible view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

380
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.000
<v Speaker 1>These people just park and just go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and just look,</v>

381
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.770
<v Speaker 2>but you get there and you park and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

382
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would see you.</v>

383
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.040
<v Speaker 2>You literally seen the continental</v>
<v Speaker 2>divide.</v>

384
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.490
<v Speaker 2>These snow capped mountains in July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July.</v>

385
00:19:13.491 --> 00:19:16.460
<v Speaker 2>It's covered with snow because those</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains don't give a perspective.</v>

386
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this whole new perspective on it</v>

387
00:19:19.131 --> 00:19:23.030
<v Speaker 2>and I think nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the ease of suffering is always</v>

388
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:23.860
<v Speaker 2>in present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

389
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in president is truly locked</v>

390
00:19:25.821 --> 00:19:27.440
<v Speaker 2>in in presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no suffering.</v>

391
00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 2>There can be pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no suffering.</v>

392
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Suffering isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something created by our own minds</v>

393
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.510
<v Speaker 2>and I think nature is one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to do this because humans,</v>

394
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned,</v>

395
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:39.560
<v Speaker 2>we take cues from our environment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

396
00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:41.750
<v Speaker 2>as I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is always in the present.</v>

397
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this natural presidents of all</v>

398
00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 2>the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything around you.</v>

399
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you get around a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people watching housewives and stressed</v>

400
00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:51.800
<v Speaker 2>about this and popping pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take on that energy too</v>

401
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to lose your president</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because of your surroundings.</v>

402
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this ultimate regrounding</v>
<v Speaker 2>tool where we get back to a present</v>

403
00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:01.360
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.670
<v Speaker 2>and that's such a fucking key element to</v>
<v Speaker 2>human happiness.</v>

405
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.300
<v Speaker 2>And I think the other key element is</v>
<v Speaker 2>having something where we're fighting</v>

406
00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:09.051
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:12.730
<v Speaker 2>having them mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all forces and that forest</v>

408
00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:15.910
<v Speaker 2>needs to have an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to have a reason that it's moving</v>

409
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:18.700
<v Speaker 2>in a certain direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think with all of our meats and</v>

410
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 2>all of our needs met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

411
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.870
<v Speaker 2>where we don't have to hunt for food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to acquire everything.</v>

412
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Everything's relatively easy and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about advancement and all this.</v>

413
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.650
<v Speaker 2>We've lost a lot of the basic mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the mission to survive and</v>

414
00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:30.880
<v Speaker 2>procreate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:32.650
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we haven't replaced it with any</v>

416
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:36.490
<v Speaker 2>other universal mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think one of the big allures</v>

417
00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:39.610
<v Speaker 2>of these things like wars and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like creating an enemy.</v>

418
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Well at least then you have a mission</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you have a mission,</v>

419
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.530
<v Speaker 2>human beings are happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

420
00:20:44.531 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 2>like a birch and Russell talked about he</v>
<v Speaker 2>but conquest of happiness and he had his</v>

421
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 2>own fucked up attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I bring them up,</v>

422
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.850
<v Speaker 2>people talk about is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as he thought he was into phrenology</v>

423
00:20:53.851 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 2>and he might've been racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

424
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 2>but he was a good philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoked constantly.</v>

425
00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.901
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

426
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>he talked about the happiest person he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew.</v>

427
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>The happiest person he could find was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>groundskeeper on a manner who every day</v>

428
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.630
<v Speaker 2>woke up and was at war with the rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have the guy.</v>

429
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 2>He just declared that the rabbits were</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking enemy.</v>

430
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 2>And he would go out with his gun and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would hunt as many as possible.</v>

431
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go morning till till night and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would kill as many rabbits as he</v>

432
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 2>could because it was the rabbits were</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones eating the hedges and the</v>

433
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 2>flowers and whatever.</v>

434
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So he basically made the rabbits as</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy and struck out every single day to</v>

435
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 2>kill as many rabbits as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that dude,</v>

436
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 2>according to Bertrand Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was happy as fuck.</v>

437
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 2>He had a task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a task,</v>

438
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 2>he had a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

439
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 2>you had a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mission is to destroy the rabbits.</v>

440
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I just have a dog like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I had the happiest dog ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name was Frank Sinatra.</v>

442
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a pit bull that all he lived for</v>

443
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 2>was killing lizards and my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old house,</v>

444
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.690
<v Speaker 2>not the house of it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my old house had this one,</v>

445
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a on a hill and there's this</v>

446
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 2>one wall where these lizards would run</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the wall.</v>

447
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 2>And so frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would literally let him out in the</v>

448
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:04.100
<v Speaker 2>morning and he fucking bolt out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>

449
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 2>like time to go to war.</v>

450
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 2>And he would run and go look for these</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizards.</v>

451
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 2>And he would stand there like Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bravo would just watch it and marvel.</v>

452
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 2>He be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

453
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>this dog does this every day there's doc</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this.</v>

454
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Every day I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he loves to do.</v>

455
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And he would go there and he would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>his paws on the wall.</v>

456
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy?</v>

457
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 2>He would jump up and try to grab a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lizard and occasionally he would get one</v>

458
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.190
<v Speaker 2>and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>

459
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And he would get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go looking for another one.</v>

460
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 2>He would go and he was a pretty big yard</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he would go wandering around the yard</v>

461
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 2>looking for anything else at fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else that was slipping?</v>

462
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.290
<v Speaker 2>It was constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately twice.</v>

463
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I had to take him to the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he got bit by rattlesnakes</v>

464
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.880
<v Speaker 2>because rattlesnakes are slipping to.</v>

465
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he killed the rattlesnakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rattlesnakes fucked him up here.</v>

466
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Like a water balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go the other side of his head.</v>

467
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Both of my dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

468
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have the money to pay for</v>

469
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the serum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super expensive.</v>

470
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 2>It was several thousand dollars to treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for this rattlesnake venom.</v>

471
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Antivenom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

472
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

473
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I was poor?</v>

474
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.910
<v Speaker 2>What if a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole fucked up system like</v>

475
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They inject horses with the Venom and</v>

476
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 2>they'd get the antibodies from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses.</v>

477
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 2>It's this archaic system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my friend Donald Schultz is</v>

478
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 2>working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big snake handler guy.</v>

479
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.820
<v Speaker 2>He's working on ways to innovate around</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it's kind of like a real</v>

480
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 2>backwards system that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you get antivenom?</v>

481
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horse will survive,</v>

482
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>so let's just fucking sorta put the</v>
<v Speaker 2>venom in there and then we'll get the</v>

483
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:31.830
<v Speaker 2>antibodies from the horse and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

484
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>

485
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

486
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a real problem with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are vegans.</v>

487
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 2>If you're a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't use any animal products.</v>

488
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 2>He a bit by a rattlesnake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got two choices.</v>

489
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Compromise your morals or that's a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>but this dog was so goddamn happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had missions,</v>

491
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go out of that yard.</v>

492
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.030
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pleased to me for a walk.</v>

493
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

494
00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 2>see a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't open that door with God.</v>

495
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.310
<v Speaker 2>He's just had his little mission and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you can see that in the people who</v>

496
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.680
<v Speaker 2>are the most unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem aimless.</v>

497
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I here for?</v>

498
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing makes sense.</v>

499
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've even felt it in my own life</v>

500
00:24:11.591 --> 00:24:12.540
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I know what my mission here is for my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mission is to expand human consciousness</v>

502
00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:18.070
<v Speaker 2>to help people be happy.</v>

503
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.420
<v Speaker 2>That's really what I find my greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose in.</v>

504
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.530
<v Speaker 2>But every once in a while I'll get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

505
00:24:23.531 --> 00:24:26.200
<v Speaker 2>fuck people attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone said some fucked up shit</v>

506
00:24:26.201 --> 00:24:26.711
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

507
00:24:26.711 --> 00:24:30.370
<v Speaker 2>people fucking suck for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at that moment that's when I'm</v>

508
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.830
<v Speaker 2>actually impressed because I've lost my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mission.</v>

509
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having a mission like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mission is human consciousness,</v>

510
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.350
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden it's like fuck people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that mission.</v>

511
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.680
<v Speaker 2>They'll figure it out and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed because I've lost my purpose.</v>

512
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to rise above like</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally when something like that</v>

513
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:46.660
<v Speaker 2>happens and realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

514
00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

515
00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you're encountering one diseased</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

516
00:24:50.111 --> 00:24:52.450
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look at the mass of</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

517
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Like when you encounter one diseased</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

518
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.920
<v Speaker 2>it's so like this guy who shot up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nightclub in Orlando,</v>

519
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at one disease individual</v>

520
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.401
<v Speaker 2>and if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

521
00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:04.270
<v Speaker 2>people fucking suck.</v>

522
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Look what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at how many people that are</v>

523
00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:10.720
<v Speaker 2>responding with rainbows on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter pages and love and,</v>

524
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.020
<v Speaker 2>and all the best wishes to those folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got killed and other.</v>

525
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was looking at this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

526
00:25:16.151 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>She was an animal lover who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing people to go to the homes of</v>

527
00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 2>the victims and see if they have pets or</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel.</v>

528
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this beautiful people out there.</v>

529
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>

530
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.090
<v Speaker 2>There's more beautiful pete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

531
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 2>this is what that is out a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just the safest.</v>

532
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 2>The easiest is the happiest time in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like being able to like reach</v>

533
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

534
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 2>and send love to people and have people</v>
<v Speaker 2>send love to you,</v>

535
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's just occasionally you run into</v>
<v Speaker 2>concert in the concert itself,</v>

536
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 2>but the beauty is out there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as dramatic and it doesn't</v>

537
00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:50.490
<v Speaker 2>impose upon us as forcefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

538
00:25:50.491 --> 00:25:52.880
<v Speaker 2>if we just look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's around all the time.</v>

539
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 2>We run into good people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just make eye contact with that</v>

540
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 2>person or that kid is just looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and just create that little smile</v>

541
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

542
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 2>the good of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>

543
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really are love,</v>

544
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being expressed outwardly all the time</v>

545
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's just these other delusions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the way of that.</v>

546
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're oddly attracted to negativity to.</v>

547
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we look at negativity</v>
<v Speaker 2>online or that you run into is like</v>

548
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.200
<v Speaker 2>possibility of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

549
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'll just fucking drums</v>

550
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>beating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>

551
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 2>There's an army on the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming,</v>

552
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>they're coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

553
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's this real impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of batten down the hatches on</v>

554
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 2>really it's just some fucking 36 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old losers sitting in his parents</v>

555
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:35.271
<v Speaker 2>basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

556
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>farting and smelling his own farts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry online.</v>

557
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what a lot of you're</v>

558
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with really sick people,</v>

559
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 2>like people that have just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

560
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>they've not found their path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've not found any happiness.</v>

561
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 2>They have found any fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

562
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 2>They haven't found any growth there just</v>
<v Speaker 2>stifled or rotten and some sort of a</v>

563
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just hasn't really worked for them</v>

564
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lashing out,</v>

565
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 2>lashing out at the world and you run</v>
<v Speaker 2>into one of those people suck and that's</v>

566
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:10.460
<v Speaker 2>the initial response and then the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious response is to look at and be</v>

567
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 2>and have compassion for that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is hard to do and our system isn't</v>

568
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>based upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if you look at the US penal</v>

569
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very much about punishment.</v>

570
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you watched that documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Michael Morton who to invade nest</v>

571
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>where they go to Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a whole different idea of what</v>

572
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:28.230
<v Speaker 2>the penal system is for.</v>

573
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It's about restoring human dignity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivating a change.</v>

574
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Really making change in the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about punishment.</v>

575
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about actually changing that</v>

576
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 2>individual so he doesn't do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you look at the recidivism</v>

577
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Speaker 2>rates between our prisons and Norway's</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons and they're just dramatically</v>

578
00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That impulse to punish immediately,</v>

579
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the healthiest impulse.</v>

580
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That's just gonna create more issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the road.</v>

581
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 2>You're not rehabilitating anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just taking even more broken</v>

582
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 2>people and putting them out in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hoping they're not going to do the</v>

583
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>broken thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

584
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the right impulse is always</v>

585
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:07.320
<v Speaker 2>that compassion and looking to see as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was you.</v>

586
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.020
<v Speaker 2>How all of these fucked up elements of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and choices.</v>

587
00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not overriding the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had choices and all this.</v>

588
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not free of guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at,</v>

589
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 2>look at that like this is the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just made some bad choices and had</v>

590
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:21.280
<v Speaker 2>some tough shit to deal with and</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't overcome it.</v>

591
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 2>The resistance in the video game was</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than his skillset and he wasn't</v>

592
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to choose to work and choose to the</v>

593
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:31.260
<v Speaker 2>positive elements that would allow them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to overcome it,</v>

594
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.203
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

595
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also Norway's dealing with far</v>

596
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:36.730
<v Speaker 2>fewer people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

597
00:28:36.731 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing for them.</v>

598
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's also they don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>conquers mentality that we have.</v>

599
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.250
<v Speaker 2>So we're so wrapped up in success and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also in punishment.</v>

600
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a big aspect of our culture,</v>

601
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 2>like punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean like when anyone does</v>

602
00:28:56.881 --> 00:29:00.000
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that feel like it's</v>

603
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>their job to shame that person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrass that person and an insult,</v>

604
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:06.840
<v Speaker 2>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty crazy to watch when</v>

605
00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:07.830
<v Speaker 2>something goes down.</v>

606
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also counterproductive,</v>

607
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

608
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>and I see that in the people shaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for appropriation,</v>

609
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say for example,</v>

610
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:18.810
<v Speaker 2>someone wears a head dress at a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>

611
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably mildly.</v>

612
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it to mock the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

613
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:23.440
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably like a,</v>

614
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>a mild appreciation and interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this looks cool.</v>

615
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a place and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden they get all</v>

616
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 2>this intense hate and shame and putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff,</v>

617
00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:37.140
<v Speaker 2>all of these intentions on them that</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't true.</v>

618
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to my point about morality,</v>

619
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:41.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not about the act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the intentions of the eye,</v>

620
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 2>but right now we make it all about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

621
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wore this headdress.</v>

622
00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 2>That means you're insulting thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of native Americans.</v>

623
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Speaker 2>You're oppressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're appropriating like,</v>

624
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking wasn't.</v>

625
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I was wearing a fucking Harris'</v>
<v Speaker 2>headdress.</v>

626
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 2>But then all of a sudden that imprint</v>
<v Speaker 2>will create trauma and that trauma will</v>

627
00:29:56.531 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>have a poisonous impact that will make</v>
<v Speaker 2>them feel weird and make them want to do</v>

628
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 2>that to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're in injecting someone</v>

629
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a heat virus,</v>

630
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to then pass on to</v>

631
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:10.330
<v Speaker 2>other people rather than doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>

632
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading the love.</v>

633
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Herpes were contagious positivity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes the other way.</v>

634
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 2>And we have those choices with how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with people.</v>

635
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 2>But more often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we come with this thing to punish and</v>

636
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 2>create more trauma which triggers their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own self judge and their own self hate,</v>

637
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 2>lowers their own self love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're going to pass that off</v>

638
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 2>to kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>

639
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:30.890
<v Speaker 2>people around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

640
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.020
<v Speaker 2>there's just two sets of dominoes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can choose to take to take either</v>

641
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>
