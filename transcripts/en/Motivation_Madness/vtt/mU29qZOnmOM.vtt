1
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the reasons why these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this deep seated anger and</v>

2
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:18.191
<v Speaker 1>resentment is there is a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there that have these lives that are</v>

3
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:23.201
<v Speaker 1>deeply unsatisfying because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another through momentum and</v>

4
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>just through just things falling into</v>
<v Speaker 1>place the way they are and people trying</v>

5
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>to fit their lives around the way these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces have fallen into place,</v>

6
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>there are so many people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>working all day long doing something</v>

7
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that is deeply unsatisfying and almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful to them.</v>

8
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] soul killing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul killing.</v>

9
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck in traffic all day and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stuck in a cubicle after that</v>

10
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they relish the time to take a shit in</v>

12
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and look at their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>they literally do though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a highlight of someone's day.</v>

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>They get in traffic on the way home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get home after that they're</v>

15
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>watching television and they're fucked.</v>

16
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>They have deep debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not like there's this soul</v>

17
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>killing thing is not giving them any</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

18
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

19
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.980
<v Speaker 1>You just sit there and go and you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what people make and you sit there</v>

20
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make quite a lot of money by</v>

21
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>average Joe Standards and still not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in good shape.</v>

22
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So I know people turn around and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>good living,</v>

23
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>really good living and turn around go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just holding my head above water.</v>

24
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>And so you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

25
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're holding your head just barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a person making a third or a</v>

26
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>quarter of what you're making doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about revolutions</v>

28
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>happening in [inaudible] and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down in weird,</v>

29
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative ways.</v>

30
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>You and we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let enough of your society fall into</v>

31
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the loser class for lack of a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

32
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>winners and losers in society.</v>

33
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every society can suck up a certain</v>

34
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>amount of people not able to to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that number gets large enough,</v>

35
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>revolutions happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too,</v>

36
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think the revolution doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have to be violent.</v>

37
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the revolution can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution of action and ideas and I</v>

38
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>think that there's a ton of people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that are probably listening to</v>

39
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>this that would like to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

40
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's make furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't want a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to do something that's not</v>

42
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make furniture,</v>

43
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you make furniture for a living and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel a great satisfaction out of</v>

44
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>that and you sell that furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look man for making furniture feels</v>

45
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>

46
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could cut those corners perfectly</v>

47
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and sand everything down nice and stain</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then it's done and you get</v>

48
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfied and you sell it to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that pays your bills.</v>

49
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That is infinitely more satisfying than</v>
<v Speaker 1>being stuck in some fucking cubicle</v>

50
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>working for someone that you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work for.</v>

51
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Having to have these stupid fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>office meetings,</v>

52
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>talking to people in human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with your supervisor where</v>

53
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>they evaluate your job performance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're not really,</v>

54
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

55
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you really need to be enthusiastic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company,</v>

56
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 1>this company is your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of art do you like fuck,</v>

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>kill me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would way rather do something else.</v>

59
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And I hope they understand that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

60
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's funny about that cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in yet because we've been</v>

61
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>talking about us and podcasting a new</v>

62
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>medium liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

63
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.920
<v Speaker 2>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tell,</v>

64
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rarely like to give advice because you</v>

65
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:04.641
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to,</v>

66
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you want to be responsible for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting on it and having it not turn out</v>

67
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I tell people is two things.</v>

68
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States of America,</v>

69
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.661
<v Speaker 2>the way it's built is built to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry and corporations and companies.</v>

70
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't necessarily mean it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be Microsoft.</v>

71
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.400
<v Speaker 2>It can be you right now you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own brand and the,</v>

72
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about the furniture builder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once upon a time.</v>

73
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>There are huge things in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including needing to get loans and all</v>

74
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>these other things to just start a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

75
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 2>So you're behind the eight ball right</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and the pressures on,</v>

76
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>because if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in debt.</v>

77
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started these podcasts,</v>

78
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>there's no brick or mortar.</v>

79
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you've got just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

80
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 2>the Rogan Tower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit different,</v>

81
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but once upon a time it's like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back of your bedroom and you've got a</v>

82
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>company and it's got a show and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are listening.</v>

83
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 2>If you make your furniture and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have a brick and mortar store,</v>

84
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.250
<v Speaker 2>but you can put a website up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>make it with squarespace or one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things and all of a sudden you</v>

86
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>have a business out of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The freedom,</v>

87
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>the satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to set your own hours.</v>

88
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>And here's the best part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that if you start making a lot</v>

89
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>of money somehow you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have your boss cut your commissions.</v>

90
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new sales guys who made so much money</v>

91
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>that their bosses cut their commissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you can't make more than your</v>

92
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 2>bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>

93
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>when you have your own small business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky's the limit.</v>

94
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>If you make $10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make $10 million.</v>

95
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So I always tell people that if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not always something they can</v>

96
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you do it on the side when you've</v>

97
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>got your regular job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting a small business now in this</v>

98
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>climate that we have right now is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only possible,</v>

99
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not that much of a gamble because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if worst comes to worst,</v>

100
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you didn't invest $100,000 you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have starting at all the time,</v>

101
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at website didn't cost you that</v>

102
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.654
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

103
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>the investment for the tools you may</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had already.</v>

104
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Podcasting is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make business like my buddy says,</v>

105
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>we sell Zeros and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>

106
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never been easier to have a website</v>

107
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or with companies like squarespace,</v>

108
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you can develop a website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could literally build amazing</v>

109
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 2>website and sell your furniture and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a free online store with it and you</v>

110
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 2>put the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these drag and drop user</v>

111
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 2>interfaces.</v>

112
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>You use photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you drag them on their sides and in</v>

113
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:05.974
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

114
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a website,</v>

115
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>so your furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever the fuck you make,</v>

116
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 2>whether you make clothes or you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>designing backpacks or there's,</v>

117
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have interests and they've never pursued</v>

118
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>those interests because they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired from doing some tired warring soul</v>

119
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to go to work and put your</v>

120
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>effort into that and then come home and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then work for yourself.</v>

121
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you what,</v>

122
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part,</v>

123
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of it that once you start</v>

124
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 2>making stuff for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that self motivating,</v>

125
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told somebody to start a podcast</v>

126
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time you get some feedback</v>

127
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 2>email that will kick you in the rear end</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep doing the pipe.</v>

128
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>It becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>

129
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>life is a verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>

131
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>and you have to actually act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by acting you change everything in</v>

132
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>your future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 2>another guy said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great line.</v>

134
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 2>He said with podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not always how many people are</v>

135
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's who they are,</v>

136
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

137
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother's philosophy was always</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should keep walking and</v>

138
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in her era,</v>

139
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>walking and talking Mitt going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking people's hands.</v>

140
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And now you can network like through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and you never really shaking</v>

141
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.770
<v Speaker 1>people's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you may have a podcast with only a</v>

142
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>hundred listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if one of those listeners,</v>

143
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>just some guy somewhere else who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

144
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>this guy's furniture is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever I'm to,</v>

145
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can come and start giving a</v>

146
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>pottery barn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

147
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Things open up in ways that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict because you started doing</v>

148
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.820
<v Speaker 1>something and because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate passion for what you can and</v>

149
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that resonates us feel experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they see,</v>

151
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many artists that</v>

152
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>have discovered online just through</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram or through twitter,</v>

153
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 1>like this isn't sent me to creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

154
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.121
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a,</v>

155
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>in an amazing way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope,</v>

156
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's way more creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there than we realize.</v>

157
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

158
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think they would love to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an opportunity to do something</v>

159
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially like an artist,</v>

160
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>somebody who is an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

161
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a better time to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artist because you could showcase</v>

162
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>your work and look if you send me</v>
<v Speaker 1>something cool and you know,</v>

163
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>he sent it to me on twitter and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably retweet.</v>

164
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Do we treat things all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that takes is someone else has</v>

165
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>to see that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

166
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then took it to do to do it just</v>

167
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>propagates to all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's instagram feeds and all these</v>

168
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>people twitter feeds and next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you've got a business and you're up</v>

169
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and running and it's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy and it's not going to be quick.</v>

170
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>But the job you're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight easier.</v>

171
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul killing one eight easier</v>

172
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>quickie that people think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh how long is it going to take?</v>

173
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you start out doing a</v>

174
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we got turned downloads,</v>

175
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>well that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all were there while I was there.</v>

176
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Once too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we first did it,</v>

177
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

178
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>when Brian and I were first doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and we were doing it on like</v>

179
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Ustream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have 200 viewers and I wasn't</v>

180
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>doing it for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>

181
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I was literally doing it because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had gotten pregnant.</v>

182
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>We had to move from Colorado back to La</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was bummed out and I was like,</v>

183
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I escaped.</v>

184
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I thought I got out of La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in the mountains.</v>

185
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want.</v>

186
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

187
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be back in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell hole.</v>

188
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

189
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>let's do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we started doing podcasts just</v>

190
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>for a goof cause I was doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was all well and good and how it</v>

191
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>tied into your standup so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it started,</v>

192
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>my point is it didn't start out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start out thinking this is</v>

193
00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>going to replace my income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be,</v>

194
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I just did it as a passion project and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think if people have a regular day job,</v>

195
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>if you could just find some one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do as a passion project and</v>

196
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>just keep building on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep at Tepe watering it.</v>

197
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Keep adding fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep giving it attention,</v>

198
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:39.970
<v Speaker 1>keep giving it focus and you can escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can escape and you can be self</v>

199
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be okay.</v>

200
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always ask people when they want to</v>

201
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>start it like a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say something like,</v>

202
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>how many listeners would you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have for you to care what's,</v>

203
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's a magic number that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>different for everybody,</v>

204
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:52.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

205
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's great about what we do that's</v>

206
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>different from broadcasting</v>

207
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 2>is that there is a giant pie of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pretend it's a billion,</v>

208
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>and if you're going to do a podcast on</v>
<v Speaker 2>science fiction comic books from the</v>

209
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>1950 [inaudible] or something that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a narrow audience,</v>

210
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>they'd never put it on television</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

211
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 2>it's too narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will be able,</v>

212
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 2>if you even get 0.001% of that billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>pie,</v>

213
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not only going to be a decent</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people in terms of what you</v>

214
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 2>would think is successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be so enthusiastic</v>

215
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 2>because this is an outlet that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>

216
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like I always tell somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're into Harry Potter,</v>

217
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 2>one of the TV networks given you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's multiple hair,</v>

218
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>potter</v>

219
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.820
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to that.</v>

220
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time magazine just had some top 50</v>

221
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>podcast thing and a buddy of mine who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was angry that he wasn't on,</v>

222
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>sent me some stuff about it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said,</v>

223
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking podcasts on there</v>

224
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>called the Gilmore boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's guys two guys sitting around</v>

225
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Gilmore Girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>Television show.</v>

226
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 1>There's another one called something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Richard Simmons where there is</v>

227
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>finding Richard [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Simmons,</v>

228
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 1>where they're trying to figure out why</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Simmons went into hiding.</v>

229
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>What's so great about that idea though</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

230
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>and you at home can learn this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so great about that idea is that</v>

231
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:12.381
<v Speaker 1>they instantly tied their podcast to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who already had tons of fans,</v>

232
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sit there and go,</v>

233
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who these guys are with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

234
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a huge Richard Simmons Fan.</v>

235
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like instant audience.</v>

236
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's another podcast called guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucked these girls cramp came up with</v>

237
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one that I was using as</v>

238
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>example because these who were the girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>from God's,</v>

239
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>we fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it,</v>

240
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>find the names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

241
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>comedians from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came and they actually going to be</v>

243
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

244
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that was a clever tie in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to,</v>

245
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but I used them as an example because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we just did booked this earlier</v>

246
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina Hutchinson and Corrine,</v>

247
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 1>she's me Crenn Fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they came up with this clever idea</v>

248
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>for the title and it became huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's always top 10.</v>

249
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the top 10 comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

250
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

251
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>well too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a traded.</v>

252
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not stupid.</v>

253
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to do something.</v>

254
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

255
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying it's saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're good,</v>

256
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>it'll stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that Liverpool juicy for you</v>

257
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:08.910
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got these stupid barriers</v>

258
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>they put in their own head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to resist those goddamn</v>

259
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>things cause they don't do you any good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they certainly defined the potential</v>

260
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>for your future in a negative way that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not self serving and it's not even real.</v>

261
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

262
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:19.981
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

263
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you've put this artificial ceiling on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for what you're doing.</v>

264
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>If you hit a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

265
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>that just means you need to regroup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rethink.</v>

266
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that wall's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it comes to something</v>

267
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>like social media or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>

268
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>something where you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting out a piece of art,</v>

269
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>you're putting out something that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>created this no wall as far as like how</v>

270
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>many people are gonna enjoy it or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>far it's going to go.</v>

271
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

272
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And if people don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it better.</v>

273
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>If they like it less fixed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to do it,</v>

274
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

275
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:56.420
<v Speaker 1>this idea that there's no to get past</v>
<v Speaker 1>the starting block today is just</v>

276
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy and it's just this,</v>

277
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>this poor thinking and people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in bad situations.</v>

278
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems is you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your future.</v>

279
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're fucked and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out of that.</v>

280
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no light at the end of the</v>

281
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rainbow,</v>

282
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>and if you feel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that alone can be incredibly defining</v>

283
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and limiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can look at,</v>

284
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>if you look at yourself objectively and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

285
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Connie am fucked here.</v>

286
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm in credit card debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working in a shitty job.</v>

287
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have some ideas.</v>

288
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I need to feed those fucking ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fee.</v>

289
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I need to feed them and water them and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to set aside a certain amount of</v>

290
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>time every day to just try to make those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>

291
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a v</v>

292
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I like visual images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use that in the hardcore history a</v>

293
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:45.780
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These young,</v>

294
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.080
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to find an elephant with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spear and things like that?</v>

295
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the image to die,</v>

296
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what the image I have though for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about.</v>

297
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought it's a little like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a running back in football who takes</v>

298
00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 2>the ball and who goes forward and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no hole,</v>

299
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you run into is the back of your</v>

300
00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:03.060
<v Speaker 2>offensive linemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep hitting,</v>

301
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.400
<v Speaker 2>if a hole is going to open up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

302
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:06.300
<v Speaker 2>you'll squirt through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

303
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:08.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no guarantee in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole will be there.</v>

304
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.430
<v Speaker 2>But there is a guarantee that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not continually smacking at it,</v>

305
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.100
<v Speaker 2>then when it opens up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't be ready.</v>

306
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

307
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

308
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:16.590
<v Speaker 2>You've had a charmed life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

309
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and how well you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

310
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>some of us have failed many times.</v>

311
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I failed at a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I guess what I'm saying is I</v>

312
00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:25.710
<v Speaker 2>remember being a TV reporter at a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>station,</v>

313
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

314
00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:29.370
<v Speaker 2>and I would get out of work at like</v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight and the Sh and the story that I</v>

315
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 2>just spent all day on aired and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>

316
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.170
<v Speaker 2>And I would get out and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

317
00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 2>this is when I still had quite a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

318
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I would sit there and like you like pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hair out and you go,</v>

319
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:39.470
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

320
00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:40.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is horrible.</v>

321
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And I look back on those now and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

322
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you had just given up then,</v>

323
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.900
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the podcast,</v>

324
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know how my wife did a great</v>

325
00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:50.814
<v Speaker 2>thing for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

326
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.620
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd had that company that I just told</v>

327
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>you about what we were trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new media thing and it just fell</v>

328
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.260
<v Speaker 2>apart and like everybody's companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>were starting to do and I wasted a lot</v>

329
00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>of time and a lot of money in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

330
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And she would have been totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>justified in saying,</v>

331
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to Indianapolis,</v>

332
00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:06.630
<v Speaker 2>get a talk radio show job wherever there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are higher.</v>

333
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>But she did and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

334
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.850
<v Speaker 2>each tried to try this next thing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it and here we are.</v>

335
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hadn't tried,</v>

336
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.340
<v Speaker 2>it's that weird thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and folks I tried being a TV report on</v>

337
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:19.560
<v Speaker 2>try B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try all those things and either</v>

338
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:21.870
<v Speaker 2>they're not successful or they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderately successful or they're</v>

339
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:25.650
<v Speaker 2>successful but not enough for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got life is a verb.</v>

340
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.430
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the thing that people that</v>

341
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:31.890
<v Speaker 2>makes people the most sad in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I already have a couple of friends</v>

342
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:34.680
<v Speaker 2>my own age who are there is the regrets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

343
00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:35.514
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

344
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.290
<v Speaker 2>they're not sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They failed.</v>

345
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>They're sorry they didn't try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is there,</v>

346
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.090
<v Speaker 2>some of them are only 50 and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

347
00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:44.400
<v Speaker 2>my my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my window to try is already gone.</v>

348
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And which is wrong too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But folks,</v>

349
00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you will be so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many things that have</v>

350
00:14:48.181 --> 00:14:51.000
<v Speaker 2>happened in my life because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got my first talk radio show</v>

351
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

352
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I was</v>

353
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 1>a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I covered this story.</v>

354
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>There was some big guy showing up at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>local radio station.</v>

355
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>As I was leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a letter to the program director</v>

356
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>just say thanks for having us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

357
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>do I may have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I not mail it?</v>

358
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Do I mainly do it and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I closed my eyes and a male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called me two days later.</v>

360
00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So you want a job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you didn't send that letter?</v>

361
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little things that your life can</v>

362
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>hinge on but if you don't do them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't give fate and opportunity to</v>

363
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 1>intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think here's an important thing to</v>

364
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>failure is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is important.</v>

365
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I think failure teaches you things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn from success.</v>

366
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I think failure gives you an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for self examination and also gives you</v>

367
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>a feeling that is very uncomfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that very uncomfortable feeling helps</v>

368
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you grow that when you feel like shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you screw something up.</v>

369
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Like when I've had bad podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my podcast is always gotten better</v>

370
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I have that bad stand up sets,</v>

371
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I've always gotten better after that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those bad sets motivate you.</v>

372
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a perspective like,</v>

373
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some clear examples of where you</v>

374
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what not to do.</v>

375
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't and don't look at these failures</v>

376
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>as like proof that you suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them as opportunities for</v>

377
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them as opportunities to be</v>

378
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Winston Churchill had a line about</v>

379
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:07.331
<v Speaker 1>reading quotes about how inspirational</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading famous quotes were and he says</v>

380
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>they motivate you for a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways,</v>

381
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 1>including the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's just you or you think</v>

382
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that these people who did so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so incredibly gifted or privileged</v>

383
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 1>from the get go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you realize none of them,</v>

384
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 1>they're more like me than I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes inspirational,</v>

385
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

386
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>You telling your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is inspirational.</v>

387
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to school,</v>

388
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.880
<v Speaker 1>go to this word note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you hate your job,</v>

389
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:32.690
<v Speaker 1>that is like nature telling you to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>something different and it's motivating</v>

390
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:35.840
<v Speaker 1>because the motivation is you might not</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do that soul killing job</v>

391
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:36.381
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

392
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>if you look at someone who's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>

393
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd say if you focus on like Kevin Hart</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that is some very</v>

394
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:46.901
<v Speaker 1>famous and successful comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you see is him now flying around on</v>

395
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 1>private jets wearing a new pair of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneakers every day driving around in</v>

396
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 1>bentleys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see that.</v>

397
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't see him being a young kid in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia,</v>

398
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 1>going to open mic nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratching and clawing Mc Hammer selling</v>

399
00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Speaker 1>the the tapes out of the hatchback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

400
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

401
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a path and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of people like you see an old</v>

402
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 1>person walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

403
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's always been an old person.</v>

404
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Now that was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a baby that became a 90 year</v>

405
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

406
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a progression that you are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessed too.</v>

407
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

408
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 1>that takes place in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes place in author as it takes</v>

409
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>place in comedians and musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a starting point.</v>

410
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And then with time and focus and as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you reevaluate and reassess and</v>

411
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>constantly objectively look at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and then pursue it with</v>

412
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>passion and focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get better at things.</v>

413
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all those things ends up q,</v>

414
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:39.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

415
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>but your life experiences create who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and all those things actually make</v>

416
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 1>you a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

417
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm speaking to the choir here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

418
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but all those things make you a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>formidable person</v>

419
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 2>so that eventually that next endeavor</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

420
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 2>is you're more prepared for and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>more formidable and,</v>

421
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.211
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I like as a 23 year old intern</v>

423
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 2>compared to what I'm like now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm basically a different person.</v>
