00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Only explain to you how you can live an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy life,</v>

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing goals and be successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going out in the world and as tough.</v>

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>The only way to live an easy life is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically give up on all your dreams and</v>

4
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>aspirations and just sit around doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

5
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The diseases is not worth accomplishing.</v>

6
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Therefore a life that is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even worth living.</v>

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in this world is worth having or</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing unless it means effort,</v>

8
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and difficulty.</v>

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Would you listen to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are going to die.</v>

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>All of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all,</v>

11
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

12
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>everyone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone you care about is going to die</v>

13
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>if you love life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not waste time because time is what life</v>

14
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:00.844
<v Speaker 1>is made of.</v>

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 2>If you respect and appreciate the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've been given while you out</v>

16
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 2>there doing what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to be telling yourself is</v>

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 2>acceptable to be sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastinating and I no longer wants to</v>

18
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 2>be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I no longer wanted to be offered.</v>

19
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I know what it is that I want and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work hard and I'm going to get</v>

20
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

21
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 3>When you want to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as bad as you want to breathe,</v>

22
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 3>then you'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody lost sleep more than a lot of</v>

23
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm here to tell you the day if</v>

24
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be willing to give up</v>

25
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be willing to work off for</v>

26
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 3>three hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two hours.</v>

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 3>If you really want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some days you will have to stay up three</v>

28
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.324
<v Speaker 3>days in a row.</v>

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't really want to.</v>

30
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 4>Are you wanting success rather than</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually working towards your dreams?</v>

31
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 4>A lot of you are just thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have high hopes for everybody watching</v>

32
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to remember your name.</v>

33
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 5>It is not the things we do in life that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we regret on our deathbed.</v>

34
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 5>It is the things we do not because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>assure you I've done a lot of really</v>

35
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 5>stupid things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them bother me.</v>

36
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 5>All the mistakes and all the dopey</v>
<v Speaker 5>things and all the time I was</v>

37
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 5>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't matter.</v>

38
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 5>Find your passion and in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no matter what you do at work,</v>

39
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 5>what you do in official settings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that passion will be grounded in people</v>

40
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 5>grounded in the relationships you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>with people and what they think of you.</v>

41
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 5>When your time comes</v>

42

<v Speaker 1>that are here.</v>

44
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.770
<v Speaker 1>One thing I do every single day of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life trying to find somebody else change</v>

45
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

46
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:37.071
<v Speaker 1>I had to wait that long to find someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her happiness was more important,</v>

47
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>and if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that all of you can find that</v>

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 1>kind of passion and that kind of love in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.930

<v Speaker 6>understand why our eyes open and why</v>

51
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:14.991
<v Speaker 6>they see what they do in the short time</v>
<v Speaker 6>before they close forever.</v>
