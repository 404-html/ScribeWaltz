00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>How do you rate yourself on a scale of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to 10 in terms of your physical</v>

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>appearance and turns of your hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take care of yourself?</v>

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowing yourself to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight and out of shape?</v>

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Are you conscious of your health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you watching the food that you take</v>

5
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>into your body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you make a deliberate effort to</v>

6
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it was George Burns is that we</v>

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>cannot help getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to get old and many of</v>

8
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>us get old before our time because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take time to take care of</v>

9
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your environment is a very good</v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>indicator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a scale of one to 10 is it what you</v>

11
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 1>want it to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you find it desirable?</v>

12
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you satisfied the job or career that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're involved in?</v>

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Someone said that 85% of the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>public are unhappy with their jobs.</v>

14
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Are you spending eight hours a day just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing time,</v>

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>doing something that you don't find</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging,</v>

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>that does not make you stretch mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does not stimulate you?</v>

17
00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>That does not inspire you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you don't find a sense of</v>

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that day in and day out,</v>

19
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>it has to affect how you feel about</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

20
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>your level of motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationships.</v>

21
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>What kind of impact is that having on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>

22
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Is it nourishing or is it if toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>does it drain you or does it build you</v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

24
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Ask yourself that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How motivated are you to do something</v>

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your contribution,</v>

26
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>your actions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you giving?</v>

27
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Many people will leave the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a trace.</v>

28
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>No one will know they were here and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact under their name we can put under</v>

29
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>there not used up.</v>

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody know that you came this way?</v>

32
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>What contribution are you giving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you leave?</v>

33
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>What will be different because you came</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

34
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Someone once said that life is our gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us that God has given us and how we</v>

35
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>live our lives is our gift to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of gift are you formulating?</v>

36
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Is this a gift that you like to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and do something else before you</v>

37
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>turn it in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are some of the keys that we can</v>

39
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 1>begin to use to motivate ourselves when</v>
<v Speaker 1>our battery's running low?</v>

40
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't care who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you do at sometime you</v>

41
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 1>are going to get tired at certain time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get in a Rut,</v>

42
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>seem like nothing you do works out</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

43
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it just seems like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't have the wherewithal or the</v>

44
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>will to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

45
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you act like you're punch</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>

46
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>You're just wading through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing time,</v>

47
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>day in and day out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at nondiscriminatory television,</v>

48
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>anything that's all just looking</v>

49
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.343
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

50
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and depress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling powerless,</v>

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>feeling useless and both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

52
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>How do you get yourself out of a Rut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>when you know you can do more of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've been doing and you're not</v>

54
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>doing it and you're discontent with</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are,</v>

55
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you get angry at yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get out of that Rut?</v>

56
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>How do you motivate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we must do is</v>

57
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:26.631
<v Speaker 1>that we must be involved and working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving self mastery.</v>

58
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>You must work on yourself continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never be satisfied with yourself.</v>

59
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Always know that as you invest the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort and time on you,</v>

60
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the greatest ability that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have above animals.</v>

61
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dog can be anything but a dog.</v>

62
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Three can be anything but a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human being.</v>

63
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>You've got unlimited potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put effort on you and by</v>

64
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:54.440
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on you and developing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can transform your life wherever you</v>

65
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 1>are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to work on yourself.</v>

66
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.370
<v Speaker 1>You want to read books that inspire you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motivate you.</v>

67
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.340
<v Speaker 1>You want to listen to tapes over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>

68
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and I suggest that you listen to tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you first get up in the morning,</v>

69
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you want to control the spirit of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

70
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>When you first wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind is operating at 10.5 wave</v>

71
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>cycles per second.</v>

72
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>That's when the subconscious mind is</v>
<v Speaker 1>most impressionable.</v>

73
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you hear in the first 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes when you wake up,</v>

74
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.590
<v Speaker 1>that will affect the spirit of your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're listening to tapes,</v>

75
00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:29.591
<v Speaker 1>listen with relaxed belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing that this can happen for you</v>

76
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.430
<v Speaker 1>and by listening to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to them over and over and over</v>

77
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:38.360
<v Speaker 1>again and you'll get a breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can listen to the same tape for</v>

78
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 1>months and all of a sudden you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something you'd never heard before.</v>

79
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It have a special meaning for you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the same book over again and you'll</v>

80
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 1>find some special inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

81
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't see that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

82
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be involved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing yourself.</v>

83
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't take that kind of</v>

84
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>effort and invest that kind of energy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they will fall prey</v>

85
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>to that conversation within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

86
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.630
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have time.</v>

87
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>You're too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too caught up in the rat race.</v>

88
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

89
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.700
<v Speaker 1>They won't take time to go to lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to take time to go to</v>

90
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't take time to go to classes to</v>

91
00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>improve themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you continue to work on yourself,</v>

92
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you will begin to expand your vision of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

93
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You begin to work towards self mastery.</v>

94
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And you will begin to see it reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in all the dimensions of your</v>

96
00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mental life,</v>

97
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:36.260
<v Speaker 1>your physical life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your social life in your relationships,</v>

98
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>your monetary life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concentrate on developing yourself.</v>

99
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that you will make a</v>

101
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.790
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people have,</v>

102
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.630
<v Speaker 1>and most of us already have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of settlement have you made</v>

103
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 1>with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

104
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 1>when we make settlements out of court</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements,</v>

105
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you've heard them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that you to take something</v>

106
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>less than what you originally wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get had you gone into court.</v>

107
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that you settle outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of court is because you didn't believe</v>

108
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>that you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you made an out of court settlement.</v>

109
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Many of us I'm making in life settlement</v>
<v Speaker 1>with settling for less than what we</v>

110
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>actually deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't feel good about it,</v>

111
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>but we make it work in our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll come up with some kind of excuse</v>

112
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>to make it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of settlement have you made</v>

113
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us settle for less than what we</v>

114
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>want out of relationships because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the courage to change them.</v>

115
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I had a seminar I used to do call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you living together or dine</v>

116
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people are just dying together.</v>

117
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Gladys Knight used to have a song that</v>
<v Speaker 1>says neither one of us want to be the</v>

118
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>first to say good</v>

119
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.123
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>

120
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.350
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is in order to begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find some keys to self motivation to</v>

121
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>drive yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to working on yourself and</v>

122
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>as you work on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel good about yourself and as you</v>

123
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>feel better about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat yourself differently.</v>

124
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Develop a health plan so you can't feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and do well.</v>

125
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have good health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't perform.</v>

126
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health is valuable.</v>

127
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Develop a health plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan that you will follow because this</v>

128
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>is the only vehicle that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry you through this experience called</v>

129
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>life and you want to take good care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because you love you or not.</v>

130
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You care enough about you and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

131
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a health plan and sticking to it,</v>

132
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but you're worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing it again and again and again.</v>

133
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I have lost 22 pounds several times.</v>

134
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

135
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

136
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll always do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love potato chips.</v>

137
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>People who know me know I love m and M,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanuts.</v>

138
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I love peanut butter and jelly</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches.</v>

139
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I love my mother Sweet Potato Pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

140
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not always on my health plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I put it on there sometimes.</v>

141
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is too short to go without sweet</v>

142
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.661
<v Speaker 1>potato pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I go to night,</v>

143
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I want you to slip on supplies and sweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>potato pie.</v>

144
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>My cats get up and watch the smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

145
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:30.481
<v Speaker 1>by phase</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximizing is as you take care of</v>

146
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next key is keys to motivation to</v>

147
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>self motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to live life with energy and</v>

148
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make a conscious effort to</v>

149
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.670
<v Speaker 1>be lively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Him live.</v>

150
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>You either saying hello or goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either own the way or in the way</v>

151
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 1>lead that people alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some folk just walking around looking,</v>

152
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing honey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay away from these people that has</v>

153
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>gone away from them and affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to smile,</v>

154
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you want to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot to be thankful for,</v>

155
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but you watch some of the faces around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you every day</v>

156
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and I tell you some of these faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will put you in a depressed state</v>

157
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to avoid these kinds of</v>

158
00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>faces when you see them coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn your head.</v>

159
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Next thing is that you want to monitor</v>
<v Speaker 1>your inner conversations.</v>

160
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.530
<v Speaker 1>The things that you say to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to watch them and then watching</v>

161
00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take charge.</v>

162
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Friend of mine told me this evening as</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did it excellently,</v>

163
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.650
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to come tonight.</v>

164
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling so depressed and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in anyhow.</v>

165
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.010
<v Speaker 1>See if that was the conversations that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

166
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you really don't feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really don't need to do it.</v>

167
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't really need to read anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget all that.</v>

168
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>That's that inner conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

169
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to worry about trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into your own business.</v>

170
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Forget that you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you lose everything.</v>

171
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:20.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got that in the conversation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped you from doing the things you</v>

172
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:22.250
<v Speaker 1>want to do less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

173
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>How can you possibly think about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational speaker?</v>

174
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the contacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the money.</v>

175
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get up there and your</v>

176
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 1>mind's going to go blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget all that.</v>

177
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.030
<v Speaker 1>You remember that time you got up before</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people and you're panicked.</v>

178
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>You stood up in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set down,</v>

179
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:41.120
<v Speaker 1>don't you remember?</v>

180
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I said Shit Up.</v>

181
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So you got to learn to stand up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself inside yourself and short</v>

182
00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>circuit override that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always going on.</v>

183
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>85% of what that conversation will tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is negative.</v>

184
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will tell you you're tied.</v>

185
00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 1>When you really are not tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will tell you you can't do it.</v>

186
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It will fill you with fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to watch that conversation</v>

187
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 1>and when you find that going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stand up to it and said,</v>

188
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid,</v>

189
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm afraid not to do it and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to let you stop me.</v>

190
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 1>The biggest challenge that you will have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life is you.</v>

191
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's an old African proverb that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

192
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>there's no enemy within the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside can do us no harm.</v>

193
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 1>The next thing that is a key to self</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation is that you've got to ask</v>

194
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:46.400
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want out of life?</v>

195
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you want out of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want out of a job?</v>

196
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you want out of career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do want out of a relationship?</v>

197
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What gives you your life?</v>

198
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know when you got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will make you happy?</v>

199
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>You'll need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to start asking yourself some</v>

200
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I really,</v>

201
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly want?</v>

202
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

203
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to be exact about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be vague.</v>

204
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be happy.</v>

205
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 1>That's too vague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will make you happy?</v>

206
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>How will you know when you got it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero in on it.</v>

207
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Be Exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be specific.</v>

208
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will stimulate that superconscious</v>

209
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.060
<v Speaker 1>mind or the reticular activating system</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your mind that will begin to find</v>

210
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>those things to identify with it.</v>

211
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

212
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and once you begin to determine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you want,</v>

213
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.250
<v Speaker 1>take the time to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't just think about it.</v>

214
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a subjective process that</v>

215
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 1>engages the subconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write it down.</v>

216
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Once you write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it three times a day,</v>

217
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noon,</v>

218
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>and night was that important because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it will do,</v>

219
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it will cost you to focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will cause you to concentrate when</v>

220
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>that other conversation is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what you cannot do,</v>

221
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 1>telling you all of the impossibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the obstacles you're</v>

222
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 1>concentrating will begin to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger vision within yourself and you'll</v>

223
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>start looking for and seeing some new</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

224
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 1>You start creating some openings for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as you begin to read that</v>

225
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>

226
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will make you focus,</v>

227
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that will discipline your Thanki and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get all kinds of creative ideas.</v>

228
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.500
<v Speaker 1>As I talked to you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being involved in this immersion</v>

229
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to create some openings for</v>

230
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get some ideas,</v>

231
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got to feel your gym and flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to think about</v>

232
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some idea you had,</v>

233
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back and I'm going to look</v>

234
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 1>at that again from a different vantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

235
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Not from the level of the problem of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles that I encountered,</v>

236
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but if from a higher vantage point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what?</v>

237
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:08.290
<v Speaker 1>You will begin to see him to know as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have talked to the higher consciousness</v>

238
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 1>within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are powerful that you are a</v>

239
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>miracle worker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that inner conversation has</v>

240
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>conditioned you to believe that you not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you begin to discover the truth</v>

241
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever challenge that you're facing in</v>

242
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're living,</v>

243
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you're facing some challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll begin to know that you are</v>

244
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:32.941
<v Speaker 1>powerful and that your America maker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you begin to write down exactly</v>

245
00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it every day.</v>

246
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.140
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is see yourself there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will you feel once you get there?</v>

247
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.490
<v Speaker 1>What will the experience be like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

248
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.300
<v Speaker 1>What will be different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of person do you have to</v>

249
00:14:50.301 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>become in to get there?</v>

250
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Visualize yourself there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Living the experience.</v>

251
00:14:56.791 --> 00:14:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I ran for state</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative in Columbus,</v>

252
00:14:59.881 --> 00:15:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and I had a lot of people telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

253
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.590
<v Speaker 1>and you got to watch not only the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation within,</v>

254
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but the conversation without telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

255
00:15:08.431 --> 00:15:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You can't possibly when you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

256
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and I went down to the legislature and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw myself.</v>

257
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I knew what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw myself in the chair.</v>

258
00:15:17.761 --> 00:15:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out the chair that I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go in and set up in the</v>

259
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.880
<v Speaker 1>galleries and watch the legislative</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

260
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to the committee meetings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen to legislation being</v>

261
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to write legislation,</v>

262
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.750
<v Speaker 1>how to amend legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start thinking like a legislator.</v>

263
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Got Up everyday dressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like that,</v>

264
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.060
<v Speaker 1>selling myself on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing myself in the legislature.</v>

265
00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Mr Speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the gentleman from the 29th house</v>

266
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:43.590
<v Speaker 1>district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to introduce the bill.</v>

267
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I went into the legislature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked around,</v>

268
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I have the experience of it,</v>

269
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

270
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And when I ran and won against</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming odds,</v>

271
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.550
<v Speaker 1>they were shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won the election even before it was</v>

272
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:59.551
<v Speaker 1>hell because I was living it in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see yourself beyond your</v>

273
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:01.300
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to challenge.</v>

274
00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:05.200
<v Speaker 1>See yourself beyond your challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See yourself with a challenge already</v>

275
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.100
<v Speaker 1>resolved</v>

276
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.960
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that all is well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing yourself in control and in charge</v>

277
00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:15.750
<v Speaker 1>of your destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being healthy and happy.</v>

278
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is it is important in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area of motivating yourself.</v>

279
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.630
<v Speaker 1>It's important to know why you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

280
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.480
<v Speaker 1>because that mine will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother?</v>

281
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Why go through all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is too hard.</v>

282
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw in the towel.</v>

283
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has it ever said that to you before.</v>

284
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you can handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you override that.</v>

285
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Write down five reasons why you deserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

286
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Why do you deserve what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you</v>

287
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

288
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Why do you deserve it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What meaning and value will it bring to</v>

289
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so different about you that you</v>

290
00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:00.761
<v Speaker 1>deserve your goal or this goal and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write down those five reasons,</v>

291
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 1>when you have some down moments and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have them,</v>

292
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 1>when that conversation started talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and it's going to talk to you,</v>

293
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>what you will do is you can pull that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and read it and it will build you</v>

294
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be your rod and your staff to</v>

295
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>conferences you through some challenging</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments because you're going to have</v>

296
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:22.730
<v Speaker 1>some life will knock you between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

297
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It will catch you on the blind side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come out of nowhere,</v>

298
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Steph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't anticipate that will knock the</v>

299
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>wind out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to give up.</v>

300
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

301
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.910
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's important for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on yourself,</v>

302
00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>listening to tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building yourself up,</v>

303
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 1>talking to yourself with power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling and conviction.</v>

304
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Building yourself up day in and day out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's coming.</v>

305
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you life is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

306
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he's doing good now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

307
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had an experience.</v>

308
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I was pursuing my dream and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work on yourself.</v>

309
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was telling people,</v>

310
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I had this big rally I had to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 people there and I said,</v>

311
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you must work on yourself if you want a</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger vision,</v>

312
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>you've got to empower yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously because life,</v>

313
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll catch you on the blind side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after I finished my speech,</v>

314
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I got a rousing standing ovation and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't call the young lady that I was</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a standing ovation and they were</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would to my hotel room and loneliness</v>

347
00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.780
<v Speaker 1>and heartbreak was sitting on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

348
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:05.800
<v Speaker 1>are you coming in now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

349
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you have your larger vision now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's your positive attitude they get on</v>

350
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>in yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you still breathing shut?</v>

351
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

352
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.500
<v Speaker 1>You want your gold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] gold,</v>

353
00:20:24.501 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

354
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out.</v>

355
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 1>You'll be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

356
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to read it.</v>

357
00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:35.251
<v Speaker 1>Get C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

358
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Do the tiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would plug in through the draws in his</v>

359
00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:43.360
<v Speaker 1>hotel trying to find a Gideon Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything I said,</v>

360
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>

361
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:46.220
<v Speaker 1>he'll be y'all where y'all who entered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by flow.</v>

362
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That's why you got to work on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could live.</v>

363
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 1>We'll send you some curves you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipate.</v>

364
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.010
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is that whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to develop technical mastery.</v>

365
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the best at what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to master it.</v>

366
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of of of self motivation is you've</v>

367
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:14.230
<v Speaker 1>got to find something that gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong sense of competence.</v>

368
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>When you've become known for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you develop a reputation of being good</v>

369
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 1>at doing that.</v>

370
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>You set some high personal standards for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

371
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 1>You're not competing with anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just unfolding yourself to be the</v>

372
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 1>best person that you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want to give the best quality</v>

373
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>service that you can give because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a statement about who you are.</v>

374
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.300
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's the key to self</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation is recognize the fact that</v>

375
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get into some slumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognize the fact that you're going to</v>

376
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 1>encounter a great deal of failure in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and goes with the territory,</v>

377
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>but in the face of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be relentless and when you</v>

378
00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 1>want something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can don't expect everybody to say,</v>

379
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:00.191
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

380
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:00.731
<v Speaker 1>We've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

381
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you want this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh great,</v>

382
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 1>we want to give this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're such a nice person.</v>

383
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you gray?</v>

384
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this.</v>

385
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no many doors will be closed in your</v>

386
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:17.390
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many loans that you will want and they</v>

387
00:22:17.391 --> 00:22:18.550
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

388
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough collateral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough credit,</v>

389
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>and most people will give up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to decide that I'm going</v>

390
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 1>to be fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to be tonight and I'm going to</v>

391
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:34.240
<v Speaker 1>go all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be relentless.</v>

392
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how many no's I</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>

393
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I liked something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaiah,</v>

394
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>as Thomas said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's getting ready for a basketball</v>

395
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:40.894
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

396
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to either shoot us in or shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>us out,</v>

397
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to not do anything.</v>

398
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 3>And that's the way to go.</v>

399
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't make a basket unless you shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball.</v>

400
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't hit a home run unless you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a swing at it.</v>

401
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't even take a slang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

402
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I probably won't make it anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the conversation with him.</v>

403
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.350
<v Speaker 1>They probably won't give it to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyhow.</v>

404
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.560
<v Speaker 1>If you want something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be relentless.</v>

405
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got to decide I deserve this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have it,</v>

406
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 1>and you go all out to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That drives you.</v>

407
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is that when you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of life,</v>

408
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be willing to go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

409
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait around for things to be just</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

410
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for things to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for the ideal situation.</v>

411
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It will never be ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will always be a reason.</v>

412
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the children grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

413
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.610
<v Speaker 1>soon as I pay my bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well soon as I get my divorce time,</v>

414
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I get enough money together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what you can,</v>

415
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 1>where you are with what you have and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never be satisfied.</v>

416
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people never take a chance in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

417
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:07.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to take any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want the situation to be ideal.</v>

418
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 1>That would say that's not walking by</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

419
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>That's walking by sight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can see it,</v>

420
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

421
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:15.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

422
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>no glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say,</v>

423
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>if I can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

424
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

425
00:24:19.231 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

426
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 1>If you believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it</v>

427
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:28.890
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

428
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.560
<v Speaker 1>don't be disturbed because no one else</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see it.</v>

429
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is ordinary,</v>

430
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but because you want some different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of results in your life,</v>

431
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be willing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>

432
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.430
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't on reasonable results in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

433
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be willing to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable pot of being unreasonable.</v>

434
00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:53.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't judge according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances,</v>

435
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Potter being unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it because you believe it.</v>

436
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter being unreasonable.</v>

437
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.770
<v Speaker 1>You're like Paulo said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must have the faith to call forth</v>

438
00:25:04.771 --> 00:25:09.771
<v Speaker 1>those things that be not as though they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were as part of being unreasonable.</v>

439
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Most people won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people say,</v>

440
00:25:13.531 --> 00:25:18.531
<v Speaker 1>call me when you get it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll support you.</v>

441
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.220
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is that what are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>keys to stuff?</v>

442
00:25:26.221 --> 00:25:31.221
<v Speaker 1>Motivation that empower you is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to find a cause larger than</v>

443
00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:35.610
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find something that you can contribute</v>

444
00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:38.370
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find something that you can make a</v>

445
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:42.960
<v Speaker 1>difference because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what feeds your larger vision,</v>

446
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.330
<v Speaker 1>part of what gives you a reason for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of what gives you your life</v>

447
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 1>is being able to give something back so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford to give anything you</v>

448
00:25:54.601 --> 00:25:57.750
<v Speaker 1>can't afford not to give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give your time,</v>

449
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.530
<v Speaker 1>give your talent is nothing just to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and lick envelopes.</v>

450
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

451
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of my tithing in the universe.</v>

452
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Once you develop that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that special sense of mission and that's</v>

453
00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:14.440
<v Speaker 1>what you develop when you're part of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger cause,</v>

454
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.680
<v Speaker 1>then yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives you.</v>

455
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't need an alarm clock to get up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

456
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You have special power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go places and folk will like to</v>

457
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:24.960
<v Speaker 1>be around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will know there's something</v>

458
00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:27.600
<v Speaker 1>different about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go in there say,</v>

459
00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:29.310
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's somebody important.</v>

460
00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be near you.</v>

461
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.590
<v Speaker 1>That energy that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness that you will embody</v>

462
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 1>will affect everybody around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is is that you want to</v>

463
00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 1>create a home court advantage for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

464
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be aware of who you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>

465
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.530
<v Speaker 1>so you want to be selective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have friends that will enable use of</v>

466
00:26:57.681 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that help me to grow</v>

467
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are my spiritual friends.</v>

468
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I talked spiritual stuff with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some other friends who are just</v>

469
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>intellectual friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make me grow intellectually.</v>

470
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.980
<v Speaker 1>They make me stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some professional friends.</v>

471
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm a member of the National Speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>Association.</v>

472
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I get together with other speakers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learn from each other and we grow</v>

473
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 1>from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have other friends who are just social</v>

474
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we do just socialize together.</v>

475
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 1>We are looking at a basketball game</v>
<v Speaker 1>together or go out dancing,</v>

476
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's all we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't talk anything serious,</v>

477
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>nothing spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing intellectual.</v>

478
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 1>That's not that kind of relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing heavy up in here.</v>

479
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Have other friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We walked together,</v>

480
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:42.830
<v Speaker 1>that's all we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk together talking about it.</v>

481
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>We're going to lose weight one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying vine for good.</v>

482
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all we do.</v>

483
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So according to the relationships that</v>

484
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:57.120
<v Speaker 1>you develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grow from people and projects and the</v>

485
00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 1>relationships that you develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenton Hanson can enrich your life or</v>

486
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:06.120
<v Speaker 1>they can drain you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know many talented people who had a</v>

487
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>great deal of potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they didn't surround</v>

488
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:13.110
<v Speaker 1>themselves with other people that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire them to transcend themselves,</v>

489
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they never realize that greatness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will end up going to their grave</v>

490
00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 1>with all their good stuff still in him.</v>

491
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So you want to look at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

492
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the people that you're involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you communicate with</v>

493
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.780
<v Speaker 1>most often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to ask yourself the</v>

494
00:28:28.781 --> 00:28:31.270
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I becoming because of this</v>

495
00:28:31.271 --> 00:28:33.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it inspire me?</v>

496
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Am I motivated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I encourage?</v>

497
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Am I driven to develop myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I seeking my own greatness?</v>

498
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.420
<v Speaker 1>What kind of person am I becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this relationship?</v>

499
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

500
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Am I becoming more cynical and negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>about life?</v>

501
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Ask yourself that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is you've got to say yes</v>

502
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:02.541
<v Speaker 1>to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to say yes.</v>

503
00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

504
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes to my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes to me.</v>

505
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make it.</v>

506
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

507
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter how many failures I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

508
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter how many mistakes I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been endured.</v>

509
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter about my defeats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter about what I've done.</v>

510
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

511
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

512
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about the fact that I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hole now.</v>

513
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter about where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

514
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.760
<v Speaker 1>The last chapter to my life has not been</v>
<v Speaker 1>written yet.</v>

515
00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.000
<v Speaker 1>If you judge me now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your judge Mi prematurely,</v>

516
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I haven't exposed all my stuff yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in the process of transforming</v>

517
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in the process of becoming.</v>

519
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had somebody in my life at one time</v>

520
00:29:54.121 --> 00:29:56.220
<v Speaker 1>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are never made,</v>

521
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:01.590

<v Speaker 1>I'll show you what energizes me.</v>

522
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>What motivated me was something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Sinatra said.</v>

523
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.820
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best revenge is massive success.</v>
