1
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Ignore the naysayers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rook you ass off,</v>

2
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>and give back and change the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if not us,</v>

3
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not now when?</v>

4
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>What is the secret to success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long version is that the actually</v>

5
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>always had five rules and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it did.</v>

6
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Always use those five rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those five rooms help it to become</v>

7
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>successful in various different areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I believe that those rules</v>

8
00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>can be applied to almost anyone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

9
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to be a bodybuilding</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

10
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You'll either need to want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor of California or the be an</v>

11
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>action hero or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to excel in whatever you do,</v>

12
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>those rules are for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Now I have to tell you right off the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I always was very intense as a kid.</v>

14
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>That radio was very intense and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hungry.</v>

15
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to be.</v>

16
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always wanted to get to the top.</v>

17
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I never believed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting by.</v>

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Now I have nothing against people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to get by because I think</v>

19
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>there are many roads to happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that we all here like to be</v>

20
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>successful and we are driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why those rules apply to you.</v>

21
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>So my first rule is find your vision and</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow it.</v>

22
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is the most important thing that</v>

23
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>we have a very clear vision of where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go a goal,</v>

24
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>where do we go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can have the best ship in</v>

25
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have the best cruise liner,</v>

26
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 1>but if the captain does not know where</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

27
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>that ship will drift around the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and outdated.</v>

28
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>See and will never end up anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is exactly the way it is in</v>

29
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a goal,</v>

30
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just drift around and you're not</v>

31
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:02.164
<v Speaker 1>going to be happy.</v>

32
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>This is why it is so important to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that vision.</v>

33
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I created that vision in Austria because</v>

34
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I grew up after the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>

35
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>right along with Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lost the Second World War.</v>

36
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and the problem was that everyone was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed because they lost the war,</v>

38
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>that there was alcoholism everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was of course depression,</v>

39
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.030
<v Speaker 1>there was a economic situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was famine,</v>

40
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>there was starvation and all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

41
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And also it was kind of a little place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in narrow.</v>

42
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I felt kind of I wanted to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

43
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:40.711
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to escape and they couldn't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself really do work there in the state</v>

44
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>of the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the factory of the work on the farm</v>

45
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>or the human to follow my father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>footsteps and to become a police</v>

46
00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 1>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see that either.</v>

47
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Some havoc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what my parents wanted me to do.</v>

48
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 1>They wanted me to become a police</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer and to marry a girl by the name</v>

49
00:02:55.751 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>of Heidi</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have a bunch of children and do</v>

50
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>random round like the funk trapp family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sound of music.</v>

51
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the vision of my parents but</v>

52
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Luckily one day in school I watched</v>

53
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the documentary about America and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found myself.</v>

54
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I knew exactly that is where I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up.</v>

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I saw in that</v>

56
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>documentary I just loved every was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

57
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember the tall skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monsters bridges the giant freeway</v>

58
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>is filled with beautiful cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The huge jetliners movie stars,</v>

59
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Muscle Beach and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not wait to get there.</v>

60
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 1>The question was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get there?</v>

61
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>How do I get the America?</v>

62
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just another common thing to do.</v>

63
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Way Back in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one had the money to travel or</v>

64
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one day I was fortunate enough to</v>

65
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:58.081
<v Speaker 1>see a magazine and that magazine showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the path to America and it was a</v>

66
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the cover was is very muscular guy</v>

67
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that was standing there like Hercules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hercules outfit.</v>

68
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>His name was rich park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This rich park was on the cover and I</v>

69
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>remember the cover said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Universe becomes Hercules star.</v>

70
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I read the article as fast as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning about how he grew up in Leeds</v>

71
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor and how it trained five hours a</v>

72
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day and trained and trained</v>

73
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>and trained and lifted weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he finally became Mr. Great</v>

74
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he became Mr. Universe,</v>

75
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>if anyone a second Mr. Universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>title in the third Mr.</v>

76
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.973
<v Speaker 1>Universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>title,</v>

77
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden he landed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome in gender chitter doing Hercules</v>

78
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.240
<v Speaker 1>movies and they made millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

79
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>this money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took embodied themselves,</v>

80
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>that gymnasium chain in South Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became a successful gymnasium owner</v>

81
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and as I read I became more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain about my own future.</v>

82
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>As I read this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so excited,</v>

83
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>so interested and knew exactly that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to become another ridge park.</v>

84
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I know he laid out the blueprint for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

85
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:15.091
<v Speaker 1>Basically I could see myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could visualize myself clearly to be a</v>

86
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>champion and that same stage where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>won the Mr Universe and then to move to</v>

87
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>America thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into movies and then become rich and</v>

88
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had that vision very clearly laid out.</v>

89
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy that I knew exactly where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going from that moment on</v>

90
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>everything that I did.</v>

91
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>No matter how hard I had to grow or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much I had to struggle,</v>

92
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wonderful choice,</v>

93
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I knew what the purpose was and</v>

94
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I found my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simple truth is,</v>

95
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a goal,</v>

96
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>if you don't see a future laid out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you,</v>

97
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you're just floating around without the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

98
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the numbers speak for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

99
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>This is why so many people around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world are unhappy with their jobs.</v>

100
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

101
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>74 percent of the people hate the job</v>
<v Speaker 1>and would like to change jobs,</v>

102
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that only a quarter of the</v>

103
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Americans love the life's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:20.351
<v Speaker 1>that is a very depressing statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always smiled when overlooked the</v>

105
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard I grew up.</v>

106
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I always had a great time.</v>

107
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 1>No matter what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter,</v>

108
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but was in bodybuilding over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the movie,</v>

109
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>so it was this governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in the pumping iron days,</v>

110
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>people ask me in the gym all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you smiling all the time?</v>

111
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to lift 50 tons of weights.</v>

112
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to train five hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I look at the other body bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces and lift the spaces and did look</v>

114
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>kind of depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks sour.</v>

115
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>They're miserable that they have to lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>

116
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>You look miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look happy,</v>

117
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and I tell them always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smiled because I know exactly what the</v>

118
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>every rep that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every set that I do,</v>

119
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>every weight and the lift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get one step closer to turning that</v>

120
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 1>vision of mind and the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming the Mr Universe.</v>

121
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't look weight to lift 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds in the squats.</v>

122
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I could not wait to do another thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit ups.</v>

123
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't wait to do bench press bench</v>
<v Speaker 1>press more girls and I couldn't move my</v>

124
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:23.411
<v Speaker 1>arms anymore because I knew that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>rep got me close to the standing on that</v>

125
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>stage as a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so matter of fact,</v>

126
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>then I lifted weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really feel like I was lifting</v>

127
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was lifting a trophy over</v>

128
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>my head each time I lifted and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all those body builders around me</v>

129
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of people screaming.</v>

130
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you that this patient didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just help me in body building?</v>

131
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>It helped me with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

132
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember in the movie business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deb was many times stunts that they had</v>

133
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got hurt.</v>

134
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That was in pain and agony and that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it over and over again.</v>

135
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I remember one incident specific young</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conan the barbarian.</v>

136
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>There I was crawling on all fours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on rocks,</v>

137
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>over rocks and gravel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding my swords right in front of me</v>

138
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>and us that was crawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cameras followed me.</v>

139
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It was around 30 seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crawl under rocks and gravel,</v>

140
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 1>and eventually after 10 takes my elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knees are bleeding and hurting and</v>

141
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>the director came to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She pushed me and said to me,</v>

142
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mind if we do another take?</v>

143
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I need a closeup of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to them,</v>

144
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind at all.</v>

145
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into as many takes as you want.</v>

146
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>This says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

147
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.041
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

148
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in pain.</v>

149
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>You're bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

150
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

151
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel any pain.</v>

152
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I see is,</v>

153
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:51.271
<v Speaker 1>is the finished scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the finished scene of me crawling</v>

154
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:56.591
<v Speaker 1>on all fours with may sort than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front crawling up and sneaking up behind</v>

155
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>salsa doom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main building of the and movie that</v>

156
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>killed my parents and rising up behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and cutting his head off.</v>

157
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see.</v>

158
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.583
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

159
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.270
<v Speaker 1>crush your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See them driven before you.</v>

160
00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And here the Lemann Foundation of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

161
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I visualized that scene,</v>

162
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>this is why I did not feel that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not care if I was bleeding on my</v>

163
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:32.810
<v Speaker 1>knees because I know that pain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary,</v>

164
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but the film is permanent and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained that to the director.</v>

165
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:41.871
<v Speaker 1>So this is why I tried to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always discover your vision and the rest</v>

166
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:43.064
<v Speaker 1>will follow.</v>

167
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my second,</v>

168
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>my second rule is never ever think</v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

169
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to accomplish anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think big.</v>

170
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to go and shoot for the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest challenge most people have</v>

171
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>is because they think small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why people think small and</v>

172
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>why did you choose small little goals is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're afraid to fail.</v>

173
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>They know that if you shoot for big</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

174
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>then the chances of failing of very high</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're afraid of failing is one of</v>

175
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the most common things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why people are frozen by the book make a</v>

176
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>moving live because they're scared of</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing.</v>

177
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

178
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about failing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of life.</v>

179
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go going when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and how far can you fall?</v>

180
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the ground that's as far as I</v>

181
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 1>can fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know something that the only time</v>

182
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:43.791
<v Speaker 1>you really considered the failure is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall and you don't get up,</v>

183
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but if you get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never considered a failure.</v>

184
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>So I never considered myself a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always considered myself a window even</v>

185
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>though I fell every so often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always got up and I always move</v>

186
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.823
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

187
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Speaker 1>This is the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had any patients of course,</v>

188
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>thinking small because in German we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a saying,</v>

189
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shahn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

190
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that if it was something</v>

191
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go all out and do it.</v>

192
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was not just the case in</v>

193
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just want to be a bodybuilding</v>

194
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:17.920
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be the greatest bodybuilder</v>

195
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:20.600
<v Speaker 1>four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wondered if the muscle,</v>

196
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>the muscle of all times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most definition.</v>

197
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most trophies,</v>

198
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.660
<v Speaker 1>the most world championship titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to be the best in the same</v>

199
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 1>as Jose movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just think about being in</v>

200
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

201
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be a movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to have above the title</v>

202
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to become the highest paid</v>

203
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:42.260
<v Speaker 1>entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically wanted to be another John</v>

204
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that?</v>

205
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the same as in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just want to go and be in</v>

206
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>politics and end the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.040
<v Speaker 1>raised for city council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

208
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the said sound bites.</v>

209
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.420
<v Speaker 1>What's Nega city council?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

210
00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:04.490
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that guy?</v>

211
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.410
<v Speaker 1>May or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to be schwartzenegger running for</v>

212
00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:09.870
<v Speaker 1>governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just any governor,</v>

213
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.770
<v Speaker 1>but governor of the greatest state in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of California.</v>

214
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.480
<v Speaker 1>That was the important thing.</v>

215
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I give you an example of big thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>big when that became governor wanted to</v>

216
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>rebuild cody corneas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient infrastructure.</v>

217
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has been living off</v>

218
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure that was built in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties and it drives me</v>

219
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.810
<v Speaker 1>absolutely insane that America hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>started rebuilding that infrastructure.</v>

220
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we invested in new roads or new transit</v>

221
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>on schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in energy or anything like that for</v>

222
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of cars that we have,</v>

223
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>nine America have four times as many as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had in the sixties,</v>

224
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>so therefore we should be having four</v>
<v Speaker 1>times as many freeways,</v>

225
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.980
<v Speaker 1>four times as many tunnels for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many bridges and orders,</v>

226
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is why I wanted to get our act</v>

227
00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:03.950
<v Speaker 1>together and do the upgrading least in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

228
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So when I talk about infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really want to just fix roads and</v>

229
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 1>fixing close some holes in the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to build massive free on top of</v>

230
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:16.190
<v Speaker 1>freeways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to build the first high speed</v>

231
00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:19.700
<v Speaker 1>rail in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to build what bridges and</v>

232
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.080
<v Speaker 1>tunnels were on ramps and off ramps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see literally cranes</v>

233
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>there was no excuse for us to get stuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>in traffic and there was no excuse</v>

235
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.490
<v Speaker 1>really to send your kids in overcrowded</v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms and schools and there was</v>

236
00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:39.491
<v Speaker 1>also no excuse that Los Angeles has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 year old sewage system that's</v>

237
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:40.790
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

238
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 1>at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course some of the legislators looked</v>

239
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:49.010
<v Speaker 1>at me like I was absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mentor told him this vision.</v>

240
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>They were willing to spend maybe $5</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars,</v>

241
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:55.010
<v Speaker 1>which of course is petty cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can be to what my vision was,</v>

242
00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.450
<v Speaker 1>but so some politicians hip hop to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big picture because they didn't</v>

243
00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:04.760
<v Speaker 1>really ever travel outside California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they haven't really seen big</v>

244
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't really seen big</v>

245
00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:09.540
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure all over the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States or maybe in Asia,</v>

246
00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:14.030
<v Speaker 1>in China or in Korea or in Brazil or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries or here in Australia</v>

247
00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:16.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they haven't seen that.</v>

248
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the other politicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>that simply don't have a vision of the</v>

249
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.030
<v Speaker 1>future past the next election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a common one.</v>

250
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Politicians of all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is.</v>

251
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It was my job as governor to motivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and to take them into.</v>

252
00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>To see the traffic jams in Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to see the overcrowded classrooms</v>

253
00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:39.410
<v Speaker 1>and to see all the problems that be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to keep pushing and pushing the</v>

254
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.410
<v Speaker 1>pump them up enough that eventually this</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

255
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the big picture and eventually Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Republicans came together.</v>

256
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It'd be invested $60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

257
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>You'll be billed California</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>

258
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>the biggest investment of our state in</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years.</v>

259
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we did because we had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big vision and everyone bought in on</v>

260
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>this big vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>

261
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>never think small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think big.</v>

262
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.920
<v Speaker 1>My third role is ignore the naysayers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is natural that we have the</v>

263
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 1>big vision and big dreams and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>big goals that people are gonna say</v>

264
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can be done.</v>

265
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's impossible or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you this all the time,</v>

266
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but I want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever let them stop you from</v>

267
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:34.811
<v Speaker 1>dreaming and from shooting for the Gore</v>
<v Speaker 1>because eliminators simply those words,</v>

268
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 1>no impossible and it can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

269
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>in each one of my careers when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it's impossible,</v>

270
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's possible when someone said</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be done.</v>

271
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I heard it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when someone said no,</v>

272
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:53.990
<v Speaker 1>then I heard loud and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

273
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>so this is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a big believer of what Nelson</v>

274
00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Mandela said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

275
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:04.571
<v Speaker 1>it always seems to be impossible until</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone does it and that's exactly</v>

276
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to beat that one.</v>

277
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>That does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to break the new records and I</v>

278
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do something that no one else</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever done.</v>

279
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's what you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever be worried about that.</v>

280
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Someone hasn't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about how many times my</v>

281
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.380
<v Speaker 1>career would have stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My career would have ended if I would</v>

282
00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>have listened to the naysayers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

283
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it started right away when I was 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and I became a bodybuilder</v>

284
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 1>right after it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

285
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a world champion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding.</v>

286
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to be missed or universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They immediately said,</v>

287
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in Austria in Australia can</v>

288
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 1>become a ski champion or bicycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion or something like that,</v>

289
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 1>but bodybuilding is an American sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about it.</v>

290
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.990
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then men,</v>

291
00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to move to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said again,</v>

292
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will never be able to do that.</v>

293
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 1>You have no money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your by yourself.</v>

294
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And then when I wanted to go into show</v>
<v Speaker 1>business after I won 13 world</v>

295
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>championship titles in bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

296
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm want to the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a hercules.</v>

297
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to get into movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I met those agents and managers in</v>

299
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>studio executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reaction was</v>

300
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.370
<v Speaker 1>so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be what?</v>

301
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Leading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

302
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

303
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.293
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

304
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with your body with your</v>

305
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

306
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you overdeveloped your gigantic.</v>

307
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You're like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

308
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what the news thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new trend is?</v>

309
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.110
<v Speaker 1>His little guys like Dustin Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Pachino.</v>

310
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen does set a new sex symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sonia,</v>

311
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your accent.</v>

312
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me the chills.</v>

313
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Just listening to your German bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on now,</v>

314
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

315
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary when you talk.</v>

316
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>have you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this year is,</v>

318
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen an international</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

319
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Stop the German accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen.</v>

320
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your name,</v>

321
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the Schnitzel or something like</v>

322
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:12.991
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

323
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I can see that name already up there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the billboard years and people are going</v>

324
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 1>to storm the theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie houses because what's starting</v>

325
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>to move it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

326
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I can see that already.</v>

327
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said to me and says,</v>

328
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.070
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about that.</v>

329
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You're a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your body building champion,</v>

330
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:35.410
<v Speaker 1>why don't you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or health food store or something like</v>

331
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can help with that.</v>

332
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And then it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

333
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some little pots like maybe playing a</v>

334
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.930
<v Speaker 1>bouncer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean did your body perfect or maybe a</v>

335
00:18:44.931 --> 00:18:47.620
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I have a good idea.</v>

336
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:51.010
<v Speaker 1>But you accent the Nazi officer now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really great for you.</v>

337
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I called my buddies over at Hogan's</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes.</v>

338
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would probably use someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>

339
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's when they said imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every way I turned.</v>

340
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.511
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

341
00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:03.670
<v Speaker 1>it won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen and forget</v>

342
00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:06.430
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I did not listen.</v>

343
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't listen because I knew if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked hard enough and I've.</v>

344
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I grew up as hard as I did embody</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing five,</v>

345
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.630
<v Speaker 1>six hours a day that I will make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could prove them wrong.</v>

346
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And I started working very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started taking acting classes,</v>

347
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.050
<v Speaker 1>English classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech classes,</v>

348
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.830
<v Speaker 1>dialog classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even accent removal classes.</v>

349
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I ran around all day saying lines like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine wine grows and the binder</v>

350
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.270
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the Austrians and Germans have a</v>

351
00:19:37.271 --> 00:19:41.950
<v Speaker 1>difficult time with the B and w and did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI get it on big stuff.</v>

352
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So it was a fine wine grows on a vine or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sink is made out of zinc and all</v>

353
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.000
<v Speaker 1>those kind of lines is it over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know something.</v>

354
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.630
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I got a little break in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early seventies.</v>

355
00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I remember all of a sudden I got a TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

356
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.570
<v Speaker 1>a little part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another little part and then all of</v>

357
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Speaker 1>a sudden I got a phone call from Lucille</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball to be in her special happy</v>

358
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:09.880
<v Speaker 1>anniversary and goodbye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was with Connie.</v>

359
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I had this six minute scene as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

360
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Missouri that most people don't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between an Italian accent in</v>

361
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the German accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got away with my German accent,</v>

362
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but I played this Italian Mr and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so delighted and then right after that I</v>

363
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:28.180
<v Speaker 1>got that guest starring role in streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of San Francisco with Michael Douglas</v>

364
00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 1>and Karl Malden and then pumping on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay hungry.</v>

365
00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And then of course I landed the big role</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Conan the barbarian.</v>

366
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So finally I got the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big break.</v>

367
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting about it was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as we were finished with the Conan</v>

368
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were out there on a promotion to a</v>

369
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and the director said that the press</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference,</v>

370
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the directors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John [inaudible],</v>

371
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we wouldn't have had what's Watson</v>

372
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 1>that go with those muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have had to build one.</v>

373
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 1>They'll think about that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this huge obstacle to have this</v>

374
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 1>body and all of a sudden the director</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

375
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 1>if he wouldn't have had schwartzenegger</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be this body,</v>

376
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 1>we would have had to build one now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a turn around,</v>

377
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>and then when I did Terminator James</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameron said,</v>

378
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.880
<v Speaker 1>which was really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that I'll be back.</v>

379
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Became one of the most famous movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines in history because of Arnold's</v>

380
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 1>crazy accent because he sounded like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

381
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>So as you see everything that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>naysayers said was a liability became an</v>

382
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.890
<v Speaker 1>asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same as also in my political Korea.</v>

383
00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.230
<v Speaker 1>When I ran for governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately said,</v>

384
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a big mistake.</v>

385
00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:47.000
<v Speaker 1>It won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will lose and all those kinds of</v>

386
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:49.010
<v Speaker 1>things that the rest of course is</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

387
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would have this is my career would</v>

388
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:58.511
<v Speaker 1>have ended up and that was 15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be still yodeling in Austria in</v>

389
00:21:58.551 --> 00:22:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the Alps and that would not be talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

390
00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:04.850
<v Speaker 1>The day the you and the reason why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>here today in talking to you is just</v>

391
00:22:04.851 --> 00:22:07.700
<v Speaker 1>because it did not listen to you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

392
00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:12.200
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just recommend to you very strongly</v>

393
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.750
<v Speaker 1>ignore the naysayers.</v>

394
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Is Brooke your ass off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever stumbled up on success by</v>

395
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:35.131
<v Speaker 1>accident except maybe the guy who found</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold in California,</v>

396
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.300
<v Speaker 1>but don't ever think that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

397
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never want to fail because you</v>

398
00:22:41.631 --> 00:22:45.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't work hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always believed no stone unturned.</v>

399
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Work your butt off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I always believed.</v>

400
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 1>The middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do,</v>

401
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Brooke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooke,</v>

402
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Brooke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Mohammed Ali,</v>

403
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 1>one of my great heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a great line in the seventies when</v>

404
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.420
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was asked how many sit ups you</v>

405
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:01.010
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

406
00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I started counting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only when it starts burning,</v>

407
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it starts burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it starts counting.</v>

408
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.510
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you a champion.</v>

409
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what area you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No pain,</v>

410
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.190
<v Speaker 1>no gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is one of my rules,</v>

411
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.320
<v Speaker 1>which is broke your butt off if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't apply that rule,</v>

412
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.360
<v Speaker 1>all the other rules won't mean anything.</v>

413
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives me absolutely nuts when people</v>

414
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:34.160
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to work out who got</v>

415
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.140
<v Speaker 1>that many times I don't know if I'm too</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke out or I have worked so hard all</v>

416
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.100
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>

417
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I cannot work out anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

418
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I cannot read another book or I improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself or I don't have time or whatever.</v>

419
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Work so hard that I cannot really</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve my business or I can grow as a</v>

420
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:55.240
<v Speaker 1>person or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell of it?</v>

421
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean today is 24 hours.</v>

422
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 1>You sleep six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have 18 hours left.</v>

423
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some of you out there</v>

424
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:05.631
<v Speaker 1>that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

425
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asleep actually eight hours,</v>

426
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's asleep fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get bogged down with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff here.</v>

428
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Listening to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to the United States.</v>

429
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:23.291
<v Speaker 1>I remember that I trained five hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day every day and it was managing a</v>

430
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:28.751
<v Speaker 1>construction business and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick layer and I went to college also</v>

431
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and that took acting classes from 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night to 12,</v>

432
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.130
<v Speaker 1>midnight of that in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day I did that.</v>

433
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I did not worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that at 24 hours and I didn't</v>

434
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 1>want to waste one single hour because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe Ted Turner said,</v>

435
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 1>was one of the great under Brunner's who</v>
<v Speaker 1>started CNN and so on.</v>

436
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early to bed early to rise.</v>

437
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Grew up like hell and advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I believe.</v>

438
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can climb that ladder of success</v>

439
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.920
<v Speaker 1>with your hands in your pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must work your ass off.</v>

440
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.063
<v Speaker 1>It said simple.</v>

441
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 1>My fifth and last rule is don't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

442
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>give something back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your mark in the world.</v>

443
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we all have an obligation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something for our community,</v>

444
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 1>something for our state and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our country.</v>

445
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:32.410
<v Speaker 1>We must show good cause to this greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ourselves because we all know that</v>

446
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:35.720
<v Speaker 1>in the end we will be judged not by how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much we made,</v>

447
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>the how much we give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever since America greeted maybe dope</v>

448
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>moms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had this sense of responsibility</v>

449
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and I felt obligated to give something</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to America because I know that</v>

450
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 1>everything that I have accomplished is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of America.</v>

451
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.450
<v Speaker 1>If it's my body building career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is my show,</v>

452
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Business Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my political career,</v>

453
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>the money they've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great family that I have.</v>

454
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 1>All of this is because of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to recognize the fact that</v>

455
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 1>America did not become the land of</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in this great country by</v>

456
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:10.274
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

457
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.150
<v Speaker 1>No in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people work tirelessly in America.</v>

458
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 1>People fought and died to make it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>land of freedom and opportunity in the</v>

459
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>land of liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it is our responsibility.</v>

460
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 1>If we want to keep it the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the world to grow up for that</v>

461
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 1>and to give something back to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

462
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

463
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're in Australia or if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>China or in Japan or in Italy,</v>

464
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all have to give something back to</v>

465
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 1>your country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

466
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you from the love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words of my father in law,</v>

467
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Sargent Shriver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who started the peace corps,</v>

468
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>job corps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal aid to the poor during the Kennedy</v>

469
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:56.960
<v Speaker 1>and during the Johnson Administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the number one public servant</v>

470
00:26:56.961 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that he always inspired me to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>public servant.</v>

471
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He was one of my heroes.</v>

472
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>He's said at Yale University of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>commencement speech.</v>

473
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.880
<v Speaker 1>He said to the students here at Miro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had down that mirror that makes you</v>

474
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 1>always look at yourself and you will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to look beyond that mural and you</v>

475
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 1>will see the millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that need your help.</v>

476
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 1>And I saw those millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

477
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I tried to take every</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that I could give something</v>

478
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started training special Olympians.</v>

479
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.730
<v Speaker 1>People did went intellectually</v>
<v Speaker 1>handicapped to help them with weight</v>

480
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 1>lifting and power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became the national power lifting</v>

481
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 1>coach and the torch torchbearer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special Olympics,</v>

482
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 1>then laid on a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Simon Wiesenthal Center to fight</v>

483
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.210
<v Speaker 1>prejudice so we don't have the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening again.</v>

484
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we had during the Second World War,</v>

485
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:55.410
<v Speaker 1>during the Nazi Reich,</v>

486
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.153
<v Speaker 2>ed,</v>

487
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I joined also the president's council on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness that became the chairman or the</v>

488
00:28:04.271 --> 00:28:09.271
<v Speaker 1>President Bush from 1990 to 1993 a to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German and to promote health and</v>

489
00:28:10.061 --> 00:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>fitness in all 50 states at Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All 50 states.</v>

490
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I started afterschool programs for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most vulnerable children for inner city</v>

491
00:28:17.381 --> 00:28:20.530
<v Speaker 1>children to make them be able to say no</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drugs,</v>

492
00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:25.360
<v Speaker 1>no to gangs and violence and to say yes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to education and yes,</v>

493
00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the life and every single time I reached</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and I gave something back,</v>

494
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I felt fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing made me happier.</v>

495
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I would rather play chess with an eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old kid in an afterschool program</v>

496
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.380
<v Speaker 1>or play golf around the golf with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>special Olympian and go down another red</v>

497
00:28:43.631 --> 00:28:47.240
<v Speaker 1>carpet of a movie premiere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have nothing against movies or to</v>

498
00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:50.950
<v Speaker 1>give something back to me is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than just to think about</v>

499
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:51.784
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

500
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joy of giving back was so great that</v>

501
00:28:55.901 --> 00:29:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I decided to become a public show</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulltime and determined by back.</v>

502
00:29:00.401 --> 00:29:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I should walk away from my career as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>

503
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.710
<v Speaker 1>After they're finished promoting</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminated three,</v>

504
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I jumped into the race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the governor's race in California,</v>

505
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and that ran for governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though my friends advised me</v>

506
00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:15.550
<v Speaker 1>not to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

507
00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you understand that you would lose</v>

508
00:29:18.851 --> 00:29:23.770
<v Speaker 1>now this 20 to $30,000,000 a movie that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting paid and they will only</v>

509
00:29:23.771 --> 00:29:28.771
<v Speaker 1>pay you $178,000 as governor year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

510
00:29:28.931 --> 00:29:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care because I knew that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that I've made and the being</v>

511
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.940
<v Speaker 1>that position in the first place to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>this money is because of America.</v>

512
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It was time to give something back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I became governor.</v>

513
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even take the $178,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give it back to the taxpayers because</v>

514
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:48.540
<v Speaker 1>it was petty cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the last thing I needed</v>

515
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.080
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you that</v>

516
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.140
<v Speaker 1>that those seven years were the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting and the most rewarding and the</v>

517
00:29:58.141 --> 00:30:03.141
<v Speaker 1>most gratifying years of my life to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long to solve problems and to</v>

518
00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:09.201
<v Speaker 1>serve the people was absolutely heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the best job I've ever had,</v>

519
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but they also knew that eventually it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come to an ent enough to two</v>

520
00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:17.610
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did come to an end,</v>

521
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but then he came to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that didn't come to an</v>

522
00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:24.720
<v Speaker 1>aunt and was not finished was my desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a public servant and just to have</v>

523
00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:28.380
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I continued to grow for</v>

524
00:30:28.381 --> 00:30:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Special Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I continued to grow on</v>

525
00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:35.610
<v Speaker 1>fighting my fitness crusade and</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling around the world to promote</v>

526
00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:40.020
<v Speaker 1>health and fitness and this is why I</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to support afterschool programs</v>

527
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and be even started the Watson institute</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Southern California</v>

528
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.200
<v Speaker 1>to continue to inspire students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders around the world.</v>

529
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.500
<v Speaker 1>To find solutions to complicated issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to give back to make the world a</v>

530
00:30:54.841 --> 00:30:57.600
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because.</v>

531
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tell you</v>

532
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>that I was very fortunate that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>great heroes,</v>

533
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.020
<v Speaker 1>great heroes that they could look up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mentioned two of them,</v>

534
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed Ali and Sargent Shriver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father in law,</v>

535
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's other great heroes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gorbachev,</v>

536
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela,</v>

537
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>great leaders like Mother Teresa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chancellor Kohl and Churchill,</v>

538
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and the list goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

539
00:31:24.391 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 1>this people had such an impact on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

540
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 1>single handedly changed the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

541
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:32.790
<v Speaker 1>if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go up at Jeff.</v>

542
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I meet him,</v>

543
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm in all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

544
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:41.090
<v Speaker 1>he grew up on the communism and he rose</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom of the rank,</v>

545
00:31:41.091 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 1>straight up to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can president of the Soviet Union,</v>

546
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the most powerful people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

547
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.960
<v Speaker 1>and he was the lead of the Communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>Party and Benny wasn't a top position.</v>

548
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 1>He realized that the system was broken.</v>

549
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you do when you at the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader of the Communist Party and do</v>

550
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 1>realize that the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that communism doesn't work well.</v>

551
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:07.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

552
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>did he dismantled communism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the courage that it takes.</v>

553
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Guts did it takes to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the Gorbachev completely</v>

554
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>transformed his country with class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows to give his people for the first</v>

555
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:25.030
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and dance through perestroika,</v>

556
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.360
<v Speaker 1>reforming Russia's economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't wait for the next president.</v>

557
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 1>He didn't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He simply said,</v>

558
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 1>if not me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who and if not now,</v>

559
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I feel very strongly,</v>

560
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 1>all of us need to have an embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of spirit.</v>

561
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 1>We all can create change whether it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a neighborhood or in our local</v>

562
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 1>schools or in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can be big,</v>

563
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be as little as just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to a school kit that has problems</v>

564
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 1>reading and teaching kids how to read or</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do math.</v>

565
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:06.130
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to just work on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should also work on we,</v>

566
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 1>not just me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also remember that lead a truly full</v>

567
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:16.070
<v Speaker 1>live you must give back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must leave the world a better place</v>

568
00:33:16.071 --> 00:33:21.071
<v Speaker 1>than you found it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is it is up to us.</v>

569
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean those rules that I've given you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Important rules,</v>

570
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but giving back is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important rules.</v>

571
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that if you follow all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rules,</v>
