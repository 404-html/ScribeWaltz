1
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Old Chinese proverb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people have heard it or have come</v>

2
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>across it at some point in the meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty straightforward,</v>

3
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And advocates.</v>

4
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Having the courage to take that step</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal and that's cute and I'm</v>

5
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>making that decision to move forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something you want,</v>

6
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's what happens immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>following that first step that I'm</v>

7
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the journey's be gone</v>

8
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's you and your goal in all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you realize how long that road</v>

9
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>ahead really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a turning point for a lot of</v>

10
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those who can succeed or able to</v>

11
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:01.851
<v Speaker 1>take their daunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidating goal or journey and see it</v>

12
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>for what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a bunch of small,</v>

13
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>manageable tasks strung together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>when you look at why people quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the time it's because they were</v>

15
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by their goals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitions.</v>

16
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have this wonderful plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your head to climb a mountain.</v>

17
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on top,</v>

18
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>looking down with pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you think about it,</v>

19
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>your heart starts racing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you pack your stuff.</v>

20
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>You make your way down in the base of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain and then you look up</v>

21
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>different ballgame right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire mountains in front of you and</v>

22
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you realize that that's no small feat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is when people walk away,</v>

23
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>when they aren't able to see a challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the sum of tiny steps.</v>

24
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>They see it as a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible task.</v>

25
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying you want to be the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall</v>

26
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>mountain to climb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to hit a target from a mile</v>

27
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can identify and map out what</v>

28
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>you need to conquer in order to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better basketball player or football</v>

29
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>player and begin taking those small</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps improving every day,</v>

30
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>that makes dreams real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives goals life.</v>

31
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>The ability to see your objective not as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marathon,</v>

32
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but as a series of little 400 meters</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches,</v>

33
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>stepping stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what your objective is today,</v>

34
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the week and the end of the</v>

35
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then completing them day by day.</v>

36
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>These little victories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives your dream life.</v>

37
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's what gives you momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel good about the process.</v>

38
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things blow up in your face,</v>

39
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>which happens every so often on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>little place call earth,</v>

40
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you'll have that foundation and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of accomplishment to stay focused</v>

41
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>because you're approaches tangible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's realistic.</v>

42
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.160
<v Speaker 1>This applies with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losing a job,</v>

43
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.510
<v Speaker 1>a breakup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing a test.</v>

44
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.150
<v Speaker 1>These things that are monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you allow them to be,</v>

45
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can turn into that unclimbed double</v>

46
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they can roll the map a new path for</v>

47
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you define what you want,</v>

48
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you define success and begin stepping</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards it one hour,</v>

49
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.120
<v Speaker 1>one day at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get where you want to be quicker</v>

50
00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:35.750
<v Speaker 1>than you thought.</v>
