00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Have you accepted that where you are is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to be?</v>

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>You've already lost,</v>

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 2>but something else bronc inside me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something brewing inside me.</v>

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I wanted it to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was determined to be unique.</v>

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I was driven to think big and dream big.</v>

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 3>We are being raised in a generation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that come up with every excuse in</v>

7
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:35.361
<v Speaker 3>the book as to why they are not winning</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

8
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Other reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not winning.</v>

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 3>It's time you get off to a pity party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop complaining about being out of</v>

10
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 3>shape when you never go to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped looking at your stomach.</v>

11
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 3>When you get out of the shower and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body and complaining about the way you</v>

12
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 3>look when you're eating everything in</v>
<v Speaker 3>sight and never gone to the gym.</v>

13
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel sorry for yourself.</v>

14
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem</v>

15
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't work hard enough.</v>

16
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I never want to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it didn't work hard enough.</v>

17
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 4>I always believed leaving no stone</v>
<v Speaker 4>unturned.</v>

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 4>It's necessary to know that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't see it,</v>

19
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 4>that everybody won't join you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's necessary to know that,</v>

20
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of people like to complain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to do anything about</v>

21
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 4>their situation that you are an uncommon</v>
<v Speaker 4>breed.</v>

22
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to know within yourself that I</v>

23
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 4>can do this even if no one else sees it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

24
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 4>I must see it for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very important for you to believe</v>

25
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 2>that you are the one.</v>
