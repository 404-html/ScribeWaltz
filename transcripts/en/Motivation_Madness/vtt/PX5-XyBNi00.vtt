1
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Seventy years ago I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a third as long as the country</v>

2
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>has been around and when I was in high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

3
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I really only had two things on my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls and cars and and it wasn't doing</v>

4
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>very well with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll talk about cars,</v>

5
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>but let's just imagine that when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished,</v>

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let each one of you pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the car of your choice.</v>

7
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Pick it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any color,</v>

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be tied up with a bow and it</v>

10
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>will be at your house tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

11
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the catch?</v>

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>And the catch is that it's the only car</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get in your lifetime.</v>

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Now what are you going to do knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the only car you're ever</v>

14
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>going to have it and you love that car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take care of it by you</v>

15
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>cannot believe.</v>

16
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'd like to suggest,</v>

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get only one car in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lifetime,</v>

18
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>but you only get one body and one mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all you're going to get and</v>

19
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.001
<v Speaker 1>that body and mind feels terrific now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to last you a lifetime.</v>

20
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Most important thing is to decide what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be able to define which ones you</v>

21
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>can come to an intelligent decision on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which ones are beyond your capacity</v>

22
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>to evaluate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be right about</v>

23
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

24
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>You only have to be right about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

25
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>A couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met Bill Gates on July fifth,</v>

26
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

27
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 1>We were out in Seattle and bill said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have a computer.</v>

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

29
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>he said you can do your income tax on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

31
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any income.</v>

32
00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

33
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep track of your portfolio.</v>

34
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only have one stock.</v>

35
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:04.984
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

36
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change everything.</v>

37
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>will it change whether people chew gum?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

39
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.891
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:19.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll change what kind of gum they show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

42
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>well then I'll stick of chewing gum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston computers.</v>

43
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>You</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to understand all kinds of</v>

44
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.560
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of businesses I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

45
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's thousands of opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

46
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I did understand the Bank of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be able to,</v>

48
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to understand some given</v>

49
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ted Williams wrote a book called the</v>

50
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>science of hitting and in science of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>

51
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he's got a diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows him at the plate and he's got the</v>

52
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>strike zone divided into 77 squares each</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of a baseball.</v>

53
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I only swing at pitches in the sweet</v>

54
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he shows there and he has what his</v>

55
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>batting average would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 400.</v>

56
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>If he had to swing it low outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitches.</v>

57
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>But still in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the strike zone is average,</v>

58
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>would be 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the most important thing and</v>

59
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>hitting is waiting for the right pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he was at a disadvantage because of</v>

60
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>the account was all in two or one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or so on.</v>

61
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Even if that ball was down where he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>only going about 2:30,</v>

62
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>he had to swing at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In investing,</v>

63
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no called strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Control Microsoft.</v>

64
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>That man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your name and any,</v>

65
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>any stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Motors,</v>

66
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't have to swing at nobody's</v>

67
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>gonna call me out on called strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only get a strike called if I swing at</v>

68
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>a pitch and mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can wait there and look at</v>

69
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>thousands of companies day after day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>only when I see something I understand</v>

70
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>and what I liked the price at which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling.</v>

71
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Then if I swing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

72
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>if I headed fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I miss it,</v>

73
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

74
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an enormously advantageous game</v>

75
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's a terrible mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing,</v>

76
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to have an opinion on</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

77
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>You only have to have an opinion on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few things.</v>

78
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told students if when they got out</v>

79
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>of school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a punch card with 20 punches on</v>

80
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>it and that's all the investment</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions they got to make in their</v>

81
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would get very rich because they</v>

82
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>would think very hard about each one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't need 20 right decisions to</v>

83
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>get very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably do it over time.</v>

85
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry too much about the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

87
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>If you understand some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses that are coming along and can</v>

88
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>spot things on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can spot on Amazon,</v>

89
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a tremendous accomplishment what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos has done,</v>

91
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and I tip my hat to him.</v>

92
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>He's a wonderful businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy too,</v>

93
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but can I have anticipated that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the success and 10 others wouldn't</v>

94
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good enough to do that,</v>

95
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

96
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that I don't have to form an opinion on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Amazon.</v>

98
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did form an opinion on the Bank of</v>

99
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 1>America and I formed an opinion on Coca</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cola.</v>

100
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola has been around since 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>86.</v>

101
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>There's one point 8 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point 8 billion,</v>

102
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>eight ounce servings of Coca Cola</v>
<v Speaker 1>products sold every day.</v>

103
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Now if you take one penny and get one</v>
<v Speaker 1>penny extra,</v>

104
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>that's $18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars a day and 18 million</v>

105
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>times 365 is 7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven hundred 30 billion or 6 billion,</v>

106
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>$570,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So annually,</v>

107
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred $70,000,000 from one penny.</v>

108
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you think coca cola is worth a penny</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you know Joe's Cola?</v>

109
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

110
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>and I've got about 127 years of history</v>
<v Speaker 1>would indicate it.</v>

111
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So those are the kinds of decisions I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to make and you may have an</v>

112
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:54.211
<v Speaker 1>entirely different field of expertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I would have probably much more up</v>

113
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>to date in terms of the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses that seeing above.</v>

114
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

115
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you can get very rich if you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the few of them and</v>

116
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 2>understand their future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you two share?</v>

117
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>What makes this friendship so satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 2>for both of you?</v>

118
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we both certainly share a</v>

119
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:17.381
<v Speaker 2>curiosity about the world and we come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from two different but related worlds.</v>

120
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had probably spent about 10 hours</v>

121
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>of this one hour visit that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheduled on July fifth,</v>

122
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>1991.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mother had to talk him into it and</v>

123
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't halfway.</v>

124
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't gotten no place in terms of</v>

125
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>our eventual agenda just in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

126
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.070
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Washington came by and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bills that had to come into the bedroom.</v>

127
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Polar bears we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

128
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>we have fun to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every relationship should have a lot of</v>

129
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>fun and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

130
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 2>and we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

131
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>we find the world and just such an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting place.</v>

132
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 2>So we like to compare notes on it when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we compare notes.</v>

133
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of fun doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the time is,</v>

134
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

135
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a remarkable documentary about</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiring,</v>

136
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 2>which is on Hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it premieres on Gandy 30th</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday.</v>

138
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>You should take time to take a look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

139
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>builds involved in that and you will see</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>

140
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 2>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think becoming Warren Buffett.</v>

141
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's called because it</v>

142
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>took me six years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think</v>

143
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you're doing well on it so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best is yet to come.</v>

144
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happened tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>

145
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Guess Your Dad,</v>

146
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the dinner said,</v>

147
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

148
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 2>what's been the most important quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and you found out that you and</v>

149
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Warren had the same word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

150
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:46.421
<v Speaker 2>I think curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Warren mentioned is a,</v>

151
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 3>an amazing thing where you try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>predict what's going to happen and then</v>

152
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.970
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it doesn't sort of think,</v>

153
00:07:53.971 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

154
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a drug didn't get invented that</v>

155
00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 3>stock to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That approach wasn't popular once.</v>

156
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.050
<v Speaker 3>What is it about my model of the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong,</v>

157
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who could I talk to,</v>

158
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>what could I read?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

159
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.080
<v Speaker 3>and the things that have happened since</v>
<v Speaker 3>1991.</v>

160
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly good things have been amazing and</v>

161
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 3>just so much fun to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A</v>

162
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we read the news and we think,</v>

163
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did Warren think about that?</v>

164
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.240
<v Speaker 2>You both are readers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You both,</v>

165
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you read all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day,</v>

166
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Lauren built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

167
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you're a reader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also do a lot of sort of courses</v>

168
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 2>online as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that have done?</v>

169
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 2>What has that done for your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sense of constantly learning.</v>

170
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead bill.</v>

171
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.160
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredible time to be a learner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was young and I had</v>

172
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.830
<v Speaker 3>the world book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of Warren's products and it</v>

173
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 3>was very good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I always felt like kind of how want</v>

174
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 3>to get into this in more depth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it better today,</v>

175
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 3>the videos that are online and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>courses that you combined with the very</v>

176
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 3>best professors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's phenomenal,</v>

177
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a subject like weather or climate</v>

178
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 3>change or what's going on in economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's known,</v>

179
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 3>what's not known now with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation.</v>

180
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what I need to learn this about</v>
<v Speaker 3>biology,</v>

181
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 3>making vaccines and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with these,</v>

182
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 3>these various diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a phenomenal time to be a</v>

183
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 3>curious person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The information that's out there,</v>

184
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

185
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my biggest problem is that I stay up too</v>

186
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 3>late because I'm reading and then I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit tired the next day.</v>

187
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that you share other</v>

188
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 3>than reading his optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe in America.</v>

189
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have said to me more than once.</v>

190
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would give up a year of my life just</v>

191
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 3>to know what the next 50 is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

192
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even for now.</v>

193
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Why'd you pick for number that came to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me</v>

194
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 4>is just fascinating what's happened just</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my lifetime,</v>

195
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

196
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.990
<v Speaker 2>in the six years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't mention one thing about</v>

197
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Speaker 2>reading a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was at the library here at Columbia.</v>

198
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I wish I spent probably more time than</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other student I,</v>

199
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I lived there practically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I pulled the book out there,</v>

200
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.910
<v Speaker 2>happened to be who's doing an American</v>
<v Speaker 2>that taught me something about my</v>

201
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.490
<v Speaker 2>professor Benjamin Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked up and I went to the</v>

202
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:32.590
<v Speaker 2>library and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to look more,</v>

203
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.970
<v Speaker 2>learn more about this because I learned</v>
<v Speaker 2>this over here.</v>

204
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.310
<v Speaker 2>That changed my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

205
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:42.311
<v Speaker 2>we own Geico now because of a librarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>directing me to some other book and then</v>

206
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.890
<v Speaker 2>following through on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the chance I,</v>

207
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I read about one fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pace the bill does,</v>

208
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but I still spend five or six hours a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day reading.</v>

209
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:55.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

210
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you can learn so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I particularly love biography just to,</v>

211
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to live the lives of.</v>

212
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:05.090
<v Speaker 2>These people have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>so extraordinary.</v>

213
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>The lessons and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.140
<v Speaker 2>the discouragements they face just</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about it.</v>

215
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't get enough of reading at.</v>

216
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 2>What surprises you most about bill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

217
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what really surprised me</v>

218
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just found so many things to connect</v>

219
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>on that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 2>he didn't try to sell me a computer.</v>

221
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably the only sale he didn't</v>

222
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:33.410
<v Speaker 4>make all the computer changed my life</v>

223
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 2>for the better in a big way</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsequently.</v>

224
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he,</v>

225
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had the same curiosity that,</v>

226
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.620
<v Speaker 2>and the other word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have used his focus when the focus</v>

227
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 2>is no question if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

228
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>both of us got to where we are in a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big way because of focusing.</v>

229
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What surprises you about Warren?</v>

230
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I was so</v>

231
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.220
<v Speaker 3>amazed that he comes to investing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this broad model of the world.</v>

232
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 3>So one of the first questions he asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>me was a,</v>

233
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft's a small company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibm's this huge company.</v>

234
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Why can you do better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they beat you at the software</v>

235
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 3>game that you're playing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always,</v>

236
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 3>every day I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

238
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 3>what advantage do we have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we do.</v>

239
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 3>But nobody ever asked me that question</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've talked about the economics of</v>

240
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 3>software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very,</v>

241
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 3>a different and special thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he could relate it to things that</v>

242
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 3>he'd seen and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand banking why some get</v>

243
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 3>ahead and some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he was able to put that in very</v>

244
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 3>clear terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I found somebody whose model was</v>

245
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 3>rich enough that it helped me understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I really wanted to know and</v>

246
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 3>we could laugh about things that were a</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprise to us.</v>

247
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I'd say his humility and his sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humor really stood out in this</v>

248
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 3>incredible way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he enjoys what he does and he</v>

249
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 3>shares that with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even,</v>

250
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I ask questions that are pretty</v>

251
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 3>naive that he's probably been asked 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

252
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 3>he's very nice about it took me a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time to figure this out,</v>

253
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's how it works.</v>

254
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I tried bill out with some non</v>
<v Speaker 3>transmitted dies and I'd read about them</v>

255
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>in scientific American or someplace and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are only two people in the world</v>

256
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 3>and the history of these dice that</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually figured it out while I was</v>

257
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 3>trying to take their money from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one was the leading symbolic logic</v>

258
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other was a drunk who didn't</v>

259
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:30.580
<v Speaker 3>really know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask the wrong question.</v>

260
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 3>But bill said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>

261
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.500
<v Speaker 3>You choose first and the game was over</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

262
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 3>You taught him not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't teach him,</v>

263
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>but you brought him into a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciation of bridge.</v>

264
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can play bridge,</v>

265
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but the family is very big on games as</v>
<v Speaker 3>family with very,</v>

266
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 3>very big on games and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

267
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 3>and so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

268
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we played bridge together and we played</v>

269
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 3>in China going down rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be looking at.</v>

270
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.410
<v Speaker 3>We had a good time point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

271
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.940
<v Speaker 3>we've got a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to talk to him,</v>

272
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody we want to start up in a,</v>

273
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.560
<v Speaker 3>up in the balcony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll,</v>

274
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:03.640
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

275
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 3>we haven't forgotten you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to see.</v>

276
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 3>But is there a number there that has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>question?</v>

277
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.063
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

278
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start it.</v>

279
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Wherever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

280
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:13.674
<v Speaker 3>Number six.</v>

281
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I thank both of you guys for being here</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

282
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 3>My question is in regards to public</v>
<v Speaker 3>health and vaccinations.</v>

283
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Given our current president's publicly</v>
<v Speaker 3>stated stance against the use of</v>

284
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 3>vaccinations both in this country and</v>
<v Speaker 3>abroad,</v>

285
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 3>how would you recommend that we as</v>
<v Speaker 3>students and future leaders in health</v>

286
00:14:37.181 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 3>sciences best to allocate our resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>to most effectively resist his</v>

287
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 3>alternative fact political philosophy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to the domestic and global</v>

288
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:47.040
<v Speaker 3>public health?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

289
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

290
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>the facts about vaccines are very clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very strong,</v>

291
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 3>which is both a that they're safe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the vaccine schedule has been</v>

292
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:07.211
<v Speaker 3>designed to reduce disease and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more parents that adhere to it,</v>

293
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 3>the more not only their children be</v>
<v Speaker 3>protected,</v>

294
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 3>but you have some kids who are immune</v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient and so unless the kids around</v>

295
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 3>them are protected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it puts those kids at risk and</v>

296
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 3>there are diseases like measles or</v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes that all it takes is a small</v>

297
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 3>cluster and then mostly those diseases</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be coming in from overseas,</v>

298
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 3>but you can get infection and in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>European countries you've had dads</v>

299
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 3>because the kids weren't vaccinated.</v>

300
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the US government is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come out with any negative</v>

301
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 3>statements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There may be a commission,</v>

302
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 3>and fortunately if she look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

303
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:46.560
<v Speaker 3>the facts are quite unequivocal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

304
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 3>we certainly are speaking out in favor</v>
<v Speaker 3>of vaccines.</v>

305
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

306
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

307
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little surprised that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick up for them,</v>

308
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 3>but it's true in every country that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get these rumors and particularly in</v>

309
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 3>today's media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those rumors can get out.</v>

310
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 3>And I had the facts because the rumors</v>
<v Speaker 3>were sort of more salacious or,</v>

311
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

312
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 3>contrary to what you've been told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>type things,</v>

313
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

314
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we'll have a chance if</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary,</v>

315
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 3>to go through the facts again in and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clear positive message from the</v>

316
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the risk is if vaccines,</v>

317
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 3>some have people are scared of having</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccines,</v>

318
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 3>the risk is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

319
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 3>there were engaged right now in polio</v>
<v Speaker 3>eradication.</v>

320
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 3>And the only way that succeeds is to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>95 percent of the kids to have these</v>

321
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 3>vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there we found,</v>

322
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.870
<v Speaker 3>we ran into a form of anti vaccine</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentiment that's even worse than us.</v>

323
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Rumors and that is that to terrorists</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

324
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 3>One in Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boko Haram and another one in Pakistan,</v>

325
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the polar bond said that vaccination was</v>

326
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 3>a US plot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would sterilize women and it was a very</v>

327
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980
<v Speaker 3>bad thing and they took the women who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going out to the children's houses</v>

328
00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 3>in getting these oral drops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oral polio vaccine,</v>

329
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 3>and actually killed a number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so those negative rumors,</v>

330
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 3>the only reason we still have polio</v>
<v Speaker 3>today that were not done is because of</v>

331
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.200
<v Speaker 3>that part of Nigeria that bulk roms</v>
<v Speaker 3>caused armrest in the border areas,</v>

332
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 3>including Baluchistan in Pakistan where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been these anti-vaccine</v>

333
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 3>sentiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

334
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 3>our risk is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

335
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.620
<v Speaker 3>is simply those negative things.</v>

336
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just in rich countries that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we run into this.</v>

337
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:39.370
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely is causes deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If parents don't know,</v>

338
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.400
<v Speaker 3>bring your kids in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get them fully vaccinated and your</v>

339
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 3>drive to eradicate polio is to show that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

340
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be.</v>

341
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 3>It started in 1988 when it already had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been eradicated in the Americas.</v>

342
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 3>So these were the for the US in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

343
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:59.230
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the Americas in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies showed that it could be done.</v>

344
00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 3>And so in 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

345
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 3>well before our foundation was involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rotary and a number of other</v>

346
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 3>organizations said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get rid of this.</v>

347
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's been harder than was expected</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because of these sentiments,</v>

348
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we are in 2016,</v>

349
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 17 last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than 50 cases.</v>

350
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 3>So we are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very close.</v>

351
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so few cases now,</v>

352
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 3>the way that we track where the virus</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

353
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 3>is we go and look at sewage samples and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see because a lot of kids,</v>

354
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get infected and pass along without</v>

355
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 3>getting paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's only through the sewage</v>

356
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>samples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that they're still about four</v>

357
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:41.961
<v Speaker 3>places in Pakistan and Afghanistan and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one place in Nigeria that we,</v>

358
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 3>we haven't gotten there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

359
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next question.</v>

360
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to see a car number one.</v>

361
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.520
<v Speaker 5>Thank you both so much for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My question again,</v>

362
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.410
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>

363
00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:56.600
<v Speaker 5>a little bit on the political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering what you're both most</v>

364
00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:59.450
<v Speaker 5>hopeful about in this new political</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment we have.</v>

365
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.980
<v Speaker 5>And also what you're both most worried</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

366
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 2>you want to take hope are worried more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than.</v>

367
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

368
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm confident that America will move</v>

369
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:14.631
<v Speaker 2>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been no from the time I was born</v>

370
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 2>until now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real GDP per capita in this country</v>

371
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 2>is one of six for one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

372
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever dreamt that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

373
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at what's happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country over 240 years,</v>

374
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

375
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolute miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to Columbia business school,</v>

376
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 2>September 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>51 woman in the class,</v>

377
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country moves forward and uh,</v>

378
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm enormously off.</v>

379
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I say the luckiest person born in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the world was the baby being</v>

380
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 2>born today in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we will go and,</v>

381
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

382
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 2>half the country always is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to somewhat unhappy close to half</v>

383
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:55.110
<v Speaker 2>about the last election.</v>

384
00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 2>But I grew up in a household,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

385
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 2>in the late 1930 [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was very republican.</v>

386
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sisters and I didn't get dessert</v>

387
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.960
<v Speaker 2>unless we said something bad about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt.</v>

388
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was required and I heard all these</v>

389
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 2>apocalyptic views about after his third</v>
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>

390
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no more elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been hearing that all my life and</v>

391
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year after year after year with</v>

392
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 2>occasional hiccups and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an occasional seizure like we had in</v>

393
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 2>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

394
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 2>but this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all profit folks.</v>

395
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:30.684
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

396
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 2>when I came in just think of what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been like in 17,</v>

397
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 2>76,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing here and now we've been the</v>

398
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:39.090
<v Speaker 2>velocity of change and just keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean guys like bill,</v>

399
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't quit,</v>

400
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

401
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 2>he moves on to something like polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mentions 50 cases in the world.</v>

402
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 2>There were more than 50</v>

403
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 6>in the ward where I went when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>teenager to see a friend of my sisters</v>

404
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 6>and they're all these rocking machines</v>
<v Speaker 6>and everything.</v>

405
00:20:55.391 --> 00:21:00.391
<v Speaker 6>They were destined to a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible life was just one ward in Omaha</v>

406
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.660
<v Speaker 6>and now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

407
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 6>that's the yearly total.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thanks.</v>

408
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Initially the as well as currently the</v>
<v Speaker 6>rotary in some,</v>

409
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 6>but people kept working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This world moves forward and it's been</v>

410
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:14.560
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bought my first stock when I was 11 in</v>

411
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.600
<v Speaker 6>April of 19.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forty $2.</v>

412
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 6>100.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't looked at 20,000,</v>

413
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 6>something good must have happened</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's going to keep happening.</v>

414
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you share the optimism.</v>

415
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:27.710
<v Speaker 3>What about concerns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

416
00:21:27.711 --> 00:21:32.711
<v Speaker 3>their optimism is partly that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>American innovation is strong support</v>

417
00:21:35.031 --> 00:21:40.031
<v Speaker 3>for research is by and large bipartisan</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so whether it's health breakthroughs</v>

418
00:21:40.071 --> 00:21:43.340
<v Speaker 3>or even energy breakthroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>

419
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.090
<v Speaker 3>every year that goes by we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have more of those things.</v>

420
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This administration is new enough.</v>

421
00:21:49.821 --> 00:21:52.730
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how their budget</v>
<v Speaker 3>priorities will come out.</v>

422
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are things like foreign aid which</v>

423
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:58.250
<v Speaker 3>is a small part of the budget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 30 billion year,</v>

424
00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:02.420
<v Speaker 3>but that means to us is the biggest that</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time there's new leadership we</v>

425
00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.840
<v Speaker 3>have to go in and articulate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits.</v>

426
00:22:05.841 --> 00:22:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It's well spent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the image that people have in</v>

427
00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:11.750
<v Speaker 3>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so right now I think there's a lot</v>

428
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:16.751
<v Speaker 3>of intensity a to make sure we get that</v>
<v Speaker 3>message out and get both in terms of the</v>

429
00:22:18.141 --> 00:22:22.730
<v Speaker 3>executive branch and the Congress to</v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain amazing things like the</v>

430
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.310
<v Speaker 3>president's malaria initiative or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pepfar,</v>

431
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.660
<v Speaker 3>which is an HIV thing.</v>

432
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.450
<v Speaker 3>These things started under President</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush.</v>

433
00:22:29.451 --> 00:22:33.830
<v Speaker 3>And so our foundation's had a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>working relationship with democratic and</v>

434
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Republican administrations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people wouldn't realize that US</v>

435
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:41.120
<v Speaker 3>foreign aid as a percentage of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>

436
00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:46.121
<v Speaker 3>which is generally how it's measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached its low point in 1999,</v>

437
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the Clinton administration.</v>

438
00:22:49.281 --> 00:22:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it was the</v>

439
00:22:50.631 --> 00:22:53.120
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a mix of the administration and</v>

440
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:54.530
<v Speaker 3>the Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

441
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.090
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

442
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 3>during those Bush years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went up fairly substantially.</v>

443
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Now the economy helped with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these initiatives were really</v>

444
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:07.760
<v Speaker 3>amazing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeful that maintaining or even</v>

445
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:12.350
<v Speaker 3>growing these initiatives will be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>priority when there's a lot of talk</v>

446
00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:15.200
<v Speaker 3>about tax cuts and different spending</v>
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>

447
00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And so it is a bit up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

448
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.380
<v Speaker 3>during these months ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've often made the point that no</v>

449
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.260
<v Speaker 3>matter how big the private contributions</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

450
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.260
<v Speaker 3>sometimes in terms of tiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheer scale,</v>

451
00:23:27.261 --> 00:23:28.130
<v Speaker 3>you need a government.</v>

452
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody asked me today,</v>

453
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Pepfar,</v>

454
00:23:31.881 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this aids program was canceled when</v>

455
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:39.710
<v Speaker 3>private philanthropy and make up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well pepfar's over 5 billion year.</v>

456
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:44.711
<v Speaker 3>That is this one aid program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a phenomenal thing that's saved</v>

457
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 3>a over 10 million lives that's larger</v>
<v Speaker 3>than our foundation,</v>

458
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

459
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 3>the largest in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no possibility the government</v>

460
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 3>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>US,</v>

461
00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 3>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other European donors,</v>

462
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.560
<v Speaker 3>that's $130,000,000,000 here in coal</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uplifting these poor countries in</v>

463
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>health and education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we lose the consensus around</v>

464
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

465
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.040
<v Speaker 3>if people draw inward too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the we will hurt progress and there will</v>

466
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 3>be millions of lives lost because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing that might be mentioned,</v>

467
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is that</v>

468
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 3>the difference between now and 60 or 70</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago in the ability of really</v>

469
00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:30.840
<v Speaker 3>bright people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really innovative,</v>

470
00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:33.420
<v Speaker 3>really energetic people to get financed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do things is,</v>

471
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.420
<v Speaker 3>is dramatically better than than it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that time.</v>

472
00:24:36.421 --> 00:24:40.290
<v Speaker 3>So now if you've got good ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's good ideas right in those crowd</v>

473
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:45.090
<v Speaker 3>and you've got energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's far easier to get financing to move</v>

474
00:24:45.091 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those ideas then you couldn't 50 or 60</v>

475
00:24:48.271 --> 00:24:49.620
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that because of the internet or</v>

476
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.910
<v Speaker 3>crowds crowd sourcing of what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just lots more capital and people more</v>

477
00:24:53.911 --> 00:24:57.670
<v Speaker 3>optimistic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are very optimistic on business,</v>

478
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.250
<v Speaker 3>but better ways to connect the tail</v>
<v Speaker 3>capital and absolutely the idea,</v>

479
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:04.980
<v Speaker 3>it's dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dramatic and willingness to take</v>

480
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:06.120
<v Speaker 3>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

481
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first venture capital stuff is in</v>

482
00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:12.150
<v Speaker 3>the 19 sixties and it's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

483
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were taking outside investment,</v>

484
00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:18.910
<v Speaker 3>we took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

485
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.990
<v Speaker 3>at a valuation of $20,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took a million dollars for five</v>

486
00:25:21.991 --> 00:25:23.040
<v Speaker 3>percent of the company.</v>

487
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it retroactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you had your chance,</v>

488
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you had your chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

489
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.500
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never spent the money.</v>

490
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.960
<v Speaker 3>That is our business was profitable</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

491
00:25:33.961 --> 00:25:36.570
<v Speaker 3>We really didn't need to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we wanted people on our board to</v>

492
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 3>give us advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

493
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.610
<v Speaker 3>there's an episode of Silicon Valley</v>
<v Speaker 3>where all these venture capitalists are</v>

494
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 3>courting this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that really reminded me a lot.</v>

495
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.880
<v Speaker 3>It was like by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was 1984,</v>

496
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.110
<v Speaker 3>there were dozens of venture capitalists</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something that other</v>

497
00:25:55.111 --> 00:25:58.590
<v Speaker 3>countries have tried to duplicate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found a in small part,</v>

498
00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 3>but not nearly as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

499
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.210
<v Speaker 3>this willingness to take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that if you have the failure,</v>

500
00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:05.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not a mark of shame that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

501
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 3>what's your next startup going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard of sacred pumps.</v>

502
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:13.181
<v Speaker 3>He gets his ideas from Silicon Valley</v>
<v Speaker 3>a card,</v>

503
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 3>let's say where the cards are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

504
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.300
<v Speaker 3>number three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the cart right there.</v>

505
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.620
<v Speaker 7>So you started this talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're able to make a model and it won't</v>

506
00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:30.040
<v Speaker 7>accurately predict what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And on the other side of the coin,</v>

507
00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:33.610
<v Speaker 7>I was wondering what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 7>create such well developed predictive</v>

508
00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Speaker 7>technology and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 7>ramifications and implications of that</v>

509
00:26:37.741 --> 00:26:38.574
<v Speaker 7>outcome?</v>

510
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think our predictive,</v>

511
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

512
00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 3>was going to be like an oracle warm</v>
<v Speaker 3>nickname is the oracle of Omaha.</v>

513
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.370
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of times you can predict</v>

514
00:26:55.561 --> 00:27:00.561
<v Speaker 3>things like macro economics because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>involve a emotional sentiment.</v>

515
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a long ways away from that.</v>

516
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 3>The biggest modeling thing I'm involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in as a group that models diseases,</v>

517
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:12.540
<v Speaker 3>so we look at HIV or tuberculosis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

518
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we have to do in terms of</v>

519
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis and drugs to get these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

520
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Once we finished polio will go on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>our next big challenge,</v>

521
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 3>which will take decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I expect we'll be done in my</v>

522
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 3>lifetime is malaria eradication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these models aren't nearly at the</v>

523
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 3>point where they can take human</v>
<v Speaker 3>sentiment into consideration,</v>

524
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.840
<v Speaker 3>into the field of economics at a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic question about what we should have</v>

525
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 3>done differently before the financial</v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>

526
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 3>There really is no consensus whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with the public or inside the</v>

527
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 3>professional economists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They agree that some of the emergency</v>

528
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 3>treatment we did was necessary and</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

529
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was better understood,</v>

530
00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the root causes,</v>

531
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a little disconcerting how</v>
<v Speaker 3>little our models,</v>

532
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:10.971
<v Speaker 3>our understanding a explain how that</v>
<v Speaker 3>imbalanced got so extreme.</v>

533
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are number two?</v>

534
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.280
<v Speaker 7>I'm in school here at Columbia and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>wanted to ask,</v>

535
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.920
<v Speaker 7>you were talking about that you love</v>
<v Speaker 7>reading.</v>

536
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to ask you if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 7>particular book that it changed your</v>

537
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 7>life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the way you think about things and</v>

538
00:28:30.641 --> 00:28:32.170
<v Speaker 7>I also wanted to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

539
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:35.290
<v Speaker 7>what is the thing that you admire the</v>
<v Speaker 7>most about each other?</v>

540
00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.020
<v Speaker 7>Like you build about worrying and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>other way around.</v>

541
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:38.770
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

542
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.690
<v Speaker 2>They sort of touched on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the second question,</v>

543
00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:43.900
<v Speaker 2>but go ahead and maybe want to add to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>books though first changed your life.</v>

544
00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book that changed my life when it was</v>

545
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.710
<v Speaker 2>bio fellow who taught here at Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Graham and I read the book when</v>

546
00:28:50.711 --> 00:28:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 called the intelligent investor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd,</v>

547
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd been interested in investments since</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was maybe seven or eight,</v>

548
00:28:57.581 --> 00:29:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but I'd never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd read every book in the Public</v>

549
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Public Library.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think you were interested in</v>

550
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:08.431
<v Speaker 2>investing when you were seven or eight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was too dumb to get interested</v>

551
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:10.764
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor.</v>

552
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 4>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dad had it</v>

553
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.770
<v Speaker 2>very small investment for and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get on,</v>

554
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I read all the books that he had there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to go to a luxury or whatever it</v>

555
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:23.880
<v Speaker 2>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I went to the public library</v>

556
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:28.881
<v Speaker 2>and read them all and it just was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating subject to me and and but I</v>

557
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what everybody thought and all of</v>

558
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>that at an early age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what Graham wrote made sense.</v>

559
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I just happened to pick that book up at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bookstore in Lincoln,</v>

560
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:44.481
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska to per se did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something about your core</v>

561
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 2>competence that made investing in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect place for you to be?</v>

562
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 2>It certainly wouldn't be a pro football</v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

563
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 2>I loved her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a question of zeroing out the</v>

564
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:58.800
<v Speaker 2>other incompetencies and I was left with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

565
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just allocation of capital.</v>

566
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I was actually wired in a way that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wouldn't be something I would be</v>

567
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:08.030
<v Speaker 2>good at.</v>

568
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>What so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I didn't what way high.</v>

569
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

570
00:30:13.101 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the right temperament for it,</v>

571
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 2>which is much more important than Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got more than 120 points of</v>

572
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sell the rest of somebody else.</v>

573
00:30:21.011 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it investments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

574
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 2>but you do need the right temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it.</v>

575
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be able to think for</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

576
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 2>And getting back to the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier question,</v>

577
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.330
<v Speaker 2>the first question I asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at the businesses,</v>

578
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it important and easy,</v>

579
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 2>what I can determine about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>business?</v>

580
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them don't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Bill is looking for hard questions</v>

581
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.320
<v Speaker 2>that plague society and where intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money may make a difference.</v>

582
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>They may not for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's taking on the tough things.</v>

583
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I take my job is to find easy things.</v>

584
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for one foot bars to step</v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

585
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than eight foot bar to jump over.</v>

586
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.010
<v Speaker 2>But that's not irrational if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking at the investment</v>

587
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But reading is key.</v>

588
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I on the biography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

589
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 2>on the book thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I will tell you a wonderful book</v>

590
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.410
<v Speaker 2>to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you a number of intelligent</v>

591
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 2>investor would obviously if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the investment field,</v>

592
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>but Katharine Graham's autobiography is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a marvelous book and that's absolutely</v>

593
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told by an incredible woman who had an</v>

594
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:31.651
<v Speaker 2>incredible life and then honestly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who you knew very well adjusted</v>

595
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 2>with him and she was a bit reluctant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be assured that she was afraid of</v>

596
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:39.870
<v Speaker 2>me actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book.</v>

597
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.290
<v Speaker 2>But what makes that book so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

598
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 2>it is such a broad range of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

599
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 2>honestly told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you couldn't have nobody in</v>

600
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood could write up a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.790
<v Speaker 2>a scenario that she lived through and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just just see that world develop how</v>

602
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:04.270
<v Speaker 2>she reacted to it and you can learn so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

603
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>My partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Margaret just loves Ben</v>

604
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:06.901
<v Speaker 2>Franklin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

605
00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

606
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.560
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can learn from other people and</v>

608
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.300
<v Speaker 2>their mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find a biography.</v>

609
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It was my favorite part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love biographies,</v>

610
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason you love biographies.</v>

611
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Where is it card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

612
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just come here.</v>

613
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a hard time seeing the card.</v>

614
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 2>So that right here where the hands are</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised.</v>

615
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.640
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

616
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm a senior here at the college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a gates millennium scholar.</v>

617
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>My family over here.</v>

618
00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 3>So I'd like to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what both of you do and a lot of risk</v>

619
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you have to face the fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>of failure without risks.</v>

620
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 3>So I'm asking how did you overcome that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear and what steps did you take to do</v>

621
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

622
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I was very lucky that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in high school,</v>

623
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:08.891
<v Speaker 3>the computer was brought in there and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed a fascination for,</v>

624
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.010
<v Speaker 3>became kind of fanatical about it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

625
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't view it as risky.</v>

626
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I viewed it as this kind of fun hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when I went to college,</v>

627
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.920
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't finish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I spent time</v>

628
00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.020
<v Speaker 3>in Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts,</v>

629
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't sure that would be my life's</v>

630
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now as the chip came along and made it</v>

631
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became very obvious that something</v>

632
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 3>dramatic was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my,</v>

633
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 3>my passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hobby and the area I could start this</v>

634
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:49.601
<v Speaker 3>company right at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution that coincided in a nice way.</v>

635
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 3>And I never felt it was risky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

636
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Microsoft had failed,</v>

637
00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have kids or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go back to school and uh,</v>

638
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finished my degree and go get a job</v>

639
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very risk averse in,</v>

640
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.350
<v Speaker 3>in running the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always made sure we had enough money</v>

641
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:17.351
<v Speaker 3>in the bank to pay everybody for at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least a year if nobody paid us at all</v>

642
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 3>because this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was hiring people who had kids and</v>

643
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 3>families and they were moving to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

644
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 3>And here I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

645
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years old and sort of telling these</v>

646
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:34.470
<v Speaker 3>people I'd be paying their salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was actually very conservative on a</v>

647
00:34:34.471 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 3>financial point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the few arguments I have with</v>

648
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Steve Balmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who came in and played a phenomenal role</v>

649
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:46.020
<v Speaker 3>in the success of the company was how</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people could he hire a [inaudible].</v>

650
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to be so conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I let him go full speed and uh,</v>

651
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out our financial success meant</v>

652
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 3>that we never had a conflict about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

653
00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great to be risk taking,</v>

654
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly when you're young trying</v>

655
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:05.570
<v Speaker 3>out different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fields that aren't very popular that you</v>

656
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:09.280
<v Speaker 3>might enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never got into a position where I</v>

657
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 3>was taking a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually in any meaningful sense.</v>

658
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 3>I was taking a big risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

659
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 3>the risk of you would not do have acted</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you felt the train was leaving</v>

660
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 3>the station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

661
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:20.320
<v Speaker 3>And it was so clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

662
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.890
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

663
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 3>this was going to happen and this was so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much fun.</v>

664
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

665
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I was a fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe in weekends.</v>

666
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe in vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

667
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 3>my mom had to negotiate with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd come once a week for dinner.</v>

668
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter who the guest was.</v>

669
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

670
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>But Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have often said you still tap dance</v>

671
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 2>to work adequate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can paint with your own colors.</v>

672
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:45.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

673
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

674
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm as excited about tomorrow in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what is going to happen if I wasn't</v>

675
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>when I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having a lot of fun when I</v>

676
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm having just as much fun now and,</v>

677
00:35:57.461 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 2>and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was here at Columbia,</v>

678
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I had terrible fairer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was impossible for me to speak in</v>

679
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't able to do it.</v>

680
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I actually read an ad in the New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>

681
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I went down to midtown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>signed up for a course,</v>

682
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 2>gave the guy a check and then stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>payment on the check.</v>

683
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just petrified.</v>

684
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 2>But finally I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you get through,</v>

685
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 2>we're here with me today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your wish I'd stayed afraid of</v>

686
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's another question.</v>

687
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 2>When I got out of the home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I finally decided just had to do it.</v>

688
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 2>So I gave a guy $100 in cash and once I</v>
<v Speaker 2>bartered with other dollars in cash,</v>

689
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I jump off the Grand Canyon to get my</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

690
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.180
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed my life.</v>

691
00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 2>But I would say this don't fear failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything that's turned out,</v>

692
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I got turned down by Harvard is the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing ever happened among others.</v>

693
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Some good things that happened that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed good at the time.</v>

694
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let it eat at you or look back.</v>

695
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Just keep going because you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some things and forgot them.</v>

696
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go forward.</v>

697
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to the back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I back there</v>

698
00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 2>wherever number three is.</v>

699
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.430
<v Speaker 9>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my name is matthew man.</v>

700
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:03.170
<v Speaker 9>I'm a first year at Columbia business</v>
<v Speaker 9>school.</v>

701
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Speaker 9>Both of you had a moment where you went</v>
<v Speaker 9>out on your own and I guess my question</v>

702
00:37:08.751 --> 00:37:11.420
<v Speaker 9>would be if you were to do it all over</v>
<v Speaker 9>again,</v>

703
00:37:11.421 --> 00:37:14.450
<v Speaker 9>you're in our shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What industry would that be in?</v>

704
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.490
<v Speaker 9>Where would you start your own business</v>
<v Speaker 9>today?</v>

705
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

706
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>but one thing I'd be a failure than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else probably.</v>

707
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

708
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had fun when I was in my twenties,</v>

709
00:37:29.391 --> 00:37:30.760
<v Speaker 2>in my thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I made $86,</v>

710
00:37:30.761 --> 00:37:32.320
<v Speaker 2>75,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

711
00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I advise students as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look for the job that you would take if</v>

712
00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you didn't need a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't sleep,</v>

713
00:37:40.431 --> 00:37:41.680
<v Speaker 2>walk through life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't,</v>

714
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.840
<v Speaker 2>don't say it's all going to be great and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this and I'll do that,</v>

715
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just marking time to get to be older</v>

716
00:37:48.251 --> 00:37:50.950
<v Speaker 2>that I've told people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like saving up sex for your old</v>

717
00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:51.784
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

718
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a good idea.</v>

719
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.530
<v Speaker 4>What are you urging them to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll explain.</v>

720
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Guess what I'm talking about</v>

721
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.250
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

722
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 2>you really want to be doing what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>love doing and you can't necessarily</v>

723
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>find it on your first job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

724
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.390
<v Speaker 2>But don't give up before you find it.</v>

725
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.290
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You've had the unique experience a</v>

726
00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.160
<v Speaker 9>because of your curiosity be because of</v>
<v Speaker 9>your involvement in,</v>

727
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.190
<v Speaker 9>in global health.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just see the impact of a lot of other</v>

728
00:38:33.191 --> 00:38:34.510
<v Speaker 9>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

729
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.980
<v Speaker 9>whether it's biomedicine</v>

730
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.040
<v Speaker 3>or whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

731
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 3>a whole range of other things other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer science.</v>

732
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 3>If you were going to drop out of Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

733
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 3>which field would you be most likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to?</v>

734
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the hard sciences and there's</v>

735
00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 3>some phenomenal things that people will</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a chance to be part of a,</v>

736
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I'd still probably pick computer science</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the work in artificial</v>

737
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 3>intelligence today is that a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>profound level,</v>

738
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:09.271
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

739
00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ability not just to play games,</v>

740
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:17.360
<v Speaker 3>but that is a profound milestone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The alphago work that the deep mine</v>

741
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:21.520
<v Speaker 3>people at Google were able to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of technologies and all</v>

742
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 3>the leading companies and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities with Ai,</v>

743
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 3>creation of agents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to read and understand</v>

744
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is going to be phenomenal.</v>

745
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:35.311
<v Speaker 3>So anything connected with that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be an exciting lifetime career.</v>

746
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I also think in energy we have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>imperative to have energy that's</v>

747
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:45.360
<v Speaker 3>reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap and clean and no system available</v>

748
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:49.440
<v Speaker 3>today can provide that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's for rich countries or four</v>

749
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>per poor countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the innovations there will be</v>

750
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 3>profound and there's many paths that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could provide that solution.</v>

751
00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think biology,</v>

752
00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:02.850
<v Speaker 3>it's the most thrilling time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 3>we are going to figure out a obesity</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

754
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even things that are very hard like</v>

755
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.230
<v Speaker 3>depression because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 3>the mind is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

757
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 3>is even more complicated than other</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of the body.</v>

758
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I see this through the lens of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases of the poor,</v>

759
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 3>of the infectious disease where new</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccines,</v>

760
00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 3>new drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are moving faster than ever.</v>

761
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.220
<v Speaker 3>And some of these are platform</v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies like DNA vaccines that are</v>

762
00:40:30.221 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 3>going to give us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that one thing will give us lots</v>

763
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:36.040
<v Speaker 3>and lots of solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so working in that space,</v>

764
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

765
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 3>is phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I say this to my children,</v>

766
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

767
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may not want to do hard sciences.</v>

768
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 3>The one who's picked wants to counsel</v>
<v Speaker 3>patients and,</v>

769
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 3>and be a doctor and even more than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>science piece,</v>

770
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 3>that relationship with patients is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabs her.</v>

771
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>So everybody has their own taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of big impact,</v>

772
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 3>those three higher science problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be at the top for me.</v>

773
00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:04.183
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next,</v>

774
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 3>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right next to number one.</v>

775
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.863
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

776
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.300
<v Speaker 3>thank you guys for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

777
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 3>thank you to Mr Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am also a gates scholar and without</v>

778
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 3>your foundation I'm going to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

779
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.350
<v Speaker 3>many industrial based communities have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been severely affected with higher</v>

780
00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:22.650
<v Speaker 3>levels of unemployment due to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing utilization of automation</v>

781
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.340
<v Speaker 3>which ends up displacing workers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

782
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.980
<v Speaker 3>What do you believe is a possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>solution to unemployment arising from</v>

783
00:41:28.981 --> 00:41:32.760
<v Speaker 3>automation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question because there's a</v>

784
00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 3>lot of about globalization and all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and a lot of other people step</v>

785
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 3>forward and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk about how technology and the</v>

786
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 3>impact technology is having on jobs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the demand for new kinds of skills.</v>

787
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were here in 1800 and conducting</v>

788
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 2>this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody would point out that</v>

789
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.930
<v Speaker 2>eventually tractors would come along</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

790
00:41:54.931 --> 00:41:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and better fertilizer and had that 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people are now employed</v>

791
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 2>on the farm and in a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years it's going to be two or three</v>

792
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are we going to do with all</v>

793
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:05.451
<v Speaker 2>these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

794
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:09.580
<v Speaker 2>the answer is we release them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We Keynes wrote something about it and</v>

795
00:42:09.581 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 2>something called essays on persuasion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote a 1930 about what a more</v>

796
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:17.921
<v Speaker 2>prosperous society would become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any actually postulated that,</v>

797
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 100 years and we're now 87 years old</v>

798
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there would be four to eight times</v>

799
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 2>as much output per capita and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>

800
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't quite get out my get</v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed.</v>

801
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:35.831
<v Speaker 2>But the idea more output per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what the progress is made on</v>

802
00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

803
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 2>that should be harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide is,</v>

804
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 2>is crazy.</v>

805
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean the distribution may be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

806
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but if one person could push a button</v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn out everything we turned out</v>

807
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 2>now is that good for the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are bad for the world.</v>

808
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to figure out how to</v>

809
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:50.640
<v Speaker 2>distribute it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

810
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 2>but you'd free up all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities for everything else.</v>

811
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

812
00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:02.350
<v Speaker 2>everything should be devoted initially</v>
<v Speaker 2>to getting greater productivity.</v>

813
00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But people who fall by the wayside</v>
<v Speaker 2>through no fault of their own,</v>

814
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 2>as the goose lays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden eggs should still get a chance to</v>

815
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:12.440
<v Speaker 2>participate in that prosper me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where government comes in,</v>

816
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Building to add to that.</v>

817
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

818
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.670
<v Speaker 3>the problem of excess is a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem than a problem shortage.</v>

819
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if all the tractors,</v>

820
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.670
<v Speaker 3>computer stopped working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we would have problems of shortage</v>

821
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

822
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.390
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just wouldn't have enough people to,</v>

823
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 3>to make the output a problem of excess</v>
<v Speaker 3>really forced us to look at the</v>

824
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 3>individuals affected and take those</v>
<v Speaker 3>extra resources and make sure that</v>

825
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:44.651
<v Speaker 3>they're directed to them in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reeducation and incomes policies and the</v>

826
00:43:45.391 --> 00:43:49.110
<v Speaker 3>need for labor in terms of smaller class</v>
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>

827
00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:52.140
<v Speaker 3>helping handicap kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaching out to the elderly.</v>

828
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:56.730
<v Speaker 3>The demand for Labor is not at zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever get to that point,</v>

829
00:43:56.731 --> 00:43:59.700
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can shorten the work week and uh,</v>

830
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be just fine with that.</v>

831
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:06.720
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of taking an individual who</v>

832
00:44:06.721 --> 00:44:10.440
<v Speaker 3>during their generation is affected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot to be learned</v>

833
00:44:10.441 --> 00:44:13.140
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of thinking we have to do,</v>

834
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 3>but the macro picture that it enables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

835
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.460
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

836
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.030
<v Speaker 3>is an opportunity number two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

837
00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm urging people at the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a chance and we want to go</v>

838
00:44:25.111 --> 00:44:27.270
<v Speaker 3>back up to the balcony as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

839
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:30.480
<v Speaker 3>so when I see number six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome to six after two.</v>

840
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>

841
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 3>my name is Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to Columbia College and my question</v>

842
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what steps did you think needs to be</v>

843
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 3>taken in order to improve public</v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

844
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 3>particularly in a economically depressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas of the United States?</v>

845
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

846
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.533
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

847
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a super important issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the uh,</v>

848
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.960
<v Speaker 3>dropout rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they've gone down a little bit,</v>

849
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:04.250
<v Speaker 3>they're still very high end and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on income and even kids who</v>

850
00:45:05.591 --> 00:45:09.130
<v Speaker 3>graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them don't enter college or</v>

851
00:45:09.131 --> 00:45:14.131
<v Speaker 3>they do enter college and they end up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>these remedial courses for their reading</v>

852
00:45:14.591 --> 00:45:17.770
<v Speaker 3>or math capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those people have an extremely high</v>

853
00:45:17.771 --> 00:45:22.060
<v Speaker 3>dropout rate from higher education and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can incur debt.</v>

854
00:45:22.061 --> 00:45:26.750
<v Speaker 3>They have a negative experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a long ways to go in</v>

855
00:45:26.751 --> 00:45:30.010
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some very strong points of</v>

856
00:45:30.011 --> 00:45:31.900
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here in New York City,</v>

857
00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:36.460
<v Speaker 3>some of the charter schools are with</v>
<v Speaker 3>even less resources.</v>

858
00:45:36.461 --> 00:45:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Then schools that large doing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal job of educating kids.</v>

859
00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.450
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in Asia who spending way</v>

860
00:45:46.451 --> 00:45:51.070
<v Speaker 3>less of their GDP on education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing a great job educating their</v>

861
00:45:51.071 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 3>kids and it's not just the top 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

862
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:58.191
<v Speaker 3>they're bottom 20 percent is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal in the case of China,</v>

863
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:00.490
<v Speaker 3>South Korea and Singapore.</v>

864
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And so looking at what we've learned in</v>
<v Speaker 3>charter schools in terms of building the</v>

865
00:46:04.391 --> 00:46:06.520
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving teachers feedback,</v>

866
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is good teaching look like?</v>

867
00:46:09.311 --> 00:46:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Do we give teachers a chance to learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>from each other about that interactive</v>

868
00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:16.570
<v Speaker 3>element that makes the subject seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant and important?</v>

869
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.410
<v Speaker 3>There are</v>
<v Speaker 3>great teachers,</v>

870
00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:23.470
<v Speaker 3>but spreading those practices is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been very,</v>

871
00:46:23.471 --> 00:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>very tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'd say it's a,</v>

872
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.120
<v Speaker 3>a top priority and we've taken our</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation has that for our work in the</v>

873
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.990
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Education is,</v>

874
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.170
<v Speaker 3>is the top priority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas outside the US,</v>

875
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

876
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.460
<v Speaker 3>we take on health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough problem because the</v>

877
00:46:39.461 --> 00:46:44.110
<v Speaker 3>institution of education are fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistant to change and people are,</v>

878
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.070
<v Speaker 3>are not yet convinced by various</v>
<v Speaker 3>approaches very easily.</v>

879
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we need to keep at it.</v>

880
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.793
<v Speaker 3>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

881
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
<v Speaker 3>stay in actually putting in more money</v>
<v Speaker 3>into trying to help help models.</v>

882
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up number six.</v>

883
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

884
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.960
<v Speaker 10>first they weren't the time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

885
00:47:02.961 --> 00:47:07.070
<v Speaker 10>I witnessed the role of your foundation</v>
<v Speaker 10>and eliminating polio in India and I'm</v>

886
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.860
<v Speaker 10>really thankful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

887
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.140
<v Speaker 10>my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>my question is more on how to set the</v>

888
00:47:12.141 --> 00:47:15.050
<v Speaker 10>basic level of debate in any,</v>
<v Speaker 10>any public sense.</v>

889
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 10>Like there are many trade of how to</v>
<v Speaker 10>explain climate change policy for people</v>

890
00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:23.690
<v Speaker 10>who are losing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>losing jobs in the coal sector.</v>

891
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.750
<v Speaker 10>How do you balance the current current</v>
<v Speaker 10>short term economic goals with the</v>

892
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:29.903
<v Speaker 10>longterm</v>

893
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 6>peaceful transition to renewable sources</v>
<v Speaker 6>of energy?</v>

894
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good question.</v>

895
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 3>The certain topics are so complicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>like climate change,</v>

896
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.390
<v Speaker 3>that to really get a broad understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a bit difficult.</v>

897
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm particularly when people take any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that complexity and trying and create</v>

898
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Speaker 3>uncertainty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

899
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 3>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

900
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>India's kind of paradigmatic in that</v>

901
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 3>they want to electrify for all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>good reasons having to do with health</v>

902
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 3>and reading at night and a quality of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

903
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 3>And the question of should they delay</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrification,</v>

904
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for climate issues is going to be very</v>

905
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ideal is to innovate in such a way</v>

906
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.840
<v Speaker 3>that they can go full speed ahead on</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrification without emitting the two</v>

907
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 3>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural path of them today,</v>

908
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:32.431
<v Speaker 3>which is coal is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have a lot of cost reduction</v>

909
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:37.801
<v Speaker 3>to do because rich countries may be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to buy premium electricity when you get</v>

910
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 3>to middle income or lower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not going to happen.</v>

911
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy has this allocate these</v>

912
00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:51.571
<v Speaker 3>resources in terms of investing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future and things like research and</v>

913
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 3>investing in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the present.</v>

914
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 3>And when you have a problem like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>financial crisis,</v>

915
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 3>then you do get a little bit of more of</v>
<v Speaker 3>short term thinking.</v>

916
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 3>And I'm hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's better for the world and</v>

917
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:09.661
<v Speaker 3>for the country if we can get back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more of a focus on the</v>

918
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.300
<v Speaker 3>longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have some question from facebook.</v>

919
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Warren central tenant of your investing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to invest for the long term.</v>

920
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 3>And this comes from Brian White who says</v>
<v Speaker 3>how my bill and weren't convinced</v>

921
00:49:21.581 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 3>investors to think beyond short term</v>
<v Speaker 3>returns,</v>

922
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 3>to encourage world changing innovation.</v>

923
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've spent my life trying to convince</v>

924
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:36.050
<v Speaker 6>people on the testing for the longterm</v>
<v Speaker 6>and listen to vinyl,</v>

925
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 6>how to double my money tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd probably have most with the short</v>

926
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 6>term,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's much.</v>

927
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.290
<v Speaker 6>It's much easier to invest for the long</v>
<v Speaker 6>term if you're just talking pure</v>

928
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 6>investment because you know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 6>on in my view,</v>

929
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.450
<v Speaker 6>be very high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably what's going to happen 10,</v>

930
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 6>20 years from now in a major way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't have the faintest idea</v>

931
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 6>what's gonna happen tomorrow or next</v>
<v Speaker 6>week.</v>

932
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:04.510
<v Speaker 6>But you wouldn't get if you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about societal,</v>

933
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:05.591
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

934
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:09.040
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very tough because politicians,</v>

935
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.620
<v Speaker 6>they selections either every two years</v>
<v Speaker 6>or six years.</v>

936
00:50:11.621 --> 00:50:16.570
<v Speaker 6>And the way the way a particular</v>
<v Speaker 6>integrational districts have been</v>

937
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:18.760
<v Speaker 6>organized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>primaries have become more and more</v>

938
00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:23.761
<v Speaker 6>important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's very hard to have a</v>

939
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:27.410
<v Speaker 6>politicians think of something as</v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderful for the country for 20 years,</v>

940
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 6>but will cost</v>

941
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 2>them the election two years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

942
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a basic problem in a democracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets to be more of a problem as,</v>

943
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 2>as we get arraigned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've arranged congressional districts,</v>

944
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 2>so the primary dominates because a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited number of people turned out in</v>

945
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 2>their motive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be on the extremes of both</v>

946
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:46.154
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

947
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy whether you're going to</v>

948
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 2>make an investment in a company or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're going to buy the company.</v>

949
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 2>What are the factors that you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're looking for?</v>

950
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Which test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for durable,</v>

951
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 2>competitive advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for something that has a</v>

952
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:06.120
<v Speaker 2>moat around it for a considerable period</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time and I'm looking for and I'm</v>

953
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enabled management to run it because I</v>

954
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:11.960
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to run it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking for a purchase price</v>

955
00:51:11.961 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 2>that's not excessive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's better to pay a little too much</v>

956
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 2>for something that's a very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>business a than it is to buy some</v>

957
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 2>bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a but really the company,</v>

958
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:21.740
<v Speaker 2>but not much of a future.</v>

959
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.740
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a ability to predict with a</v>

960
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.730
<v Speaker 2>high probability of success the future</v>
<v Speaker 2>of most companies,</v>

961
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 2>so I'm looking for the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the nice thing is if there's</v>

962
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 2>thousands of companies out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't have to be right on a</v>

963
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:40.990
<v Speaker 2>couple of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's exactly the opposite of,</v>

964
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 2>of baseball where you have called</v>
<v Speaker 2>strikes and the pitcher is trying to</v>

965
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:46.190
<v Speaker 2>throw it to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst part of the strike zone for</v>

966
00:51:46.191 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he succeeds in getting into that</v>

967
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:52.940
<v Speaker 2>corner three times and you don't swing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out in investing.</v>

968
00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:54.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an old called strike things.</v>

969
00:51:54.891 --> 00:51:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I can sit there all day and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirming one company after another.</v>

970
00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:03.371
<v Speaker 2>And finally I got one of my sweet spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of you have chosen both wives and</v>

971
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 2>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

972
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm Charlie monger added what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Munger changed my views.</v>

973
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:16.820
<v Speaker 2>He'd be flying them in a huge way in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of looking for the quality</v>

974
00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 2>companies and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

975
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 2>and looking for the ability to make an</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment that would work out well for</v>

976
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 2>five or 10 or 20 years as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that might.</v>

977
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 2>There might be one I called it a cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but investing,</v>

978
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:30.360
<v Speaker 2>whether it was one puff left in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigar,</v>

979
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 2>the cigar was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he picked up these disgusting looking</v>

980
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:36.920
<v Speaker 2>things and got one puff out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went onto another one and that worked</v>

981
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was small scale and it really</v>

982
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 2>doesn't build something satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

983
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept forcing me in the direction of</v>

984
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:45.741
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 2>is this really a business we want to own</v>
<v Speaker 2>for forever?</v>

986
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

987
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we want to get.</v>

988
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

989
00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:54.470
<v Speaker 2>do you want to get associated with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person forever?</v>

990
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:57.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's a great way to look at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bill,</v>

991
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.611
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife,</v>

992
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Melinda has added what?</v>

993
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's four children,</v>

994
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.890
<v Speaker 3>three children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time do I have?</v>

995
00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:16.300
<v Speaker 3>She is your partner and she was there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the philanthropy from day one at</v>

996
00:53:16.301 --> 00:53:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had two partners for Mason.</v>

997
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I had Paul Allen really early days and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then Steve bombers when</v>

998
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>it got bigger and we would not have</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved anything what we without those</v>

999
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.370
<v Speaker 3>partnerships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1000
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 3>when things are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're making big decisions,</v>

1001
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:35.091
<v Speaker 3>having somebody who's really in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you committed a for me.</v>

1002
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have done without that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the foundation.</v>

1003
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Melinda's an amazing partner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She thinks about the people issues</v>

1004
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 3>better than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows when I get over excited about</v>

1005
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 3>the science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can,</v>

1006
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1007
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.640
<v Speaker 3>make sure we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're being realistic about it and it</v>

1008
00:53:53.641 --> 00:53:54.940
<v Speaker 3>makes it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1009
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.210
<v Speaker 3>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1010
00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I went to Europe to world economic form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She went to Nigeria and then this</v>

1011
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 3>weekend we just sat and talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1012
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 3>what did we see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that say about the work we</v>

1013
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 3>should do a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1014
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'd enjoy it without a</v>

1015
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 3>partner in particularly someone amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like her.</v>

1016
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.670
<v Speaker 6>It's more fun with a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm in Charlotte and I've had more fun</v>

1017
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:19.450
<v Speaker 6>working together that neither one of us</v>
<v Speaker 6>would have had individually and we have</v>

1018
00:54:19.451 --> 00:54:21.070
<v Speaker 6>never had an argument after</v>

1019
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.470
<v Speaker 2>being together for 58.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could talk every day.</v>

1020
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what the other guy's going to</v>

1021
00:54:26.051 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got,</v>

1022
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.770
<v Speaker 2>we talked it all out 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you see trolley and he says,</v>

1023
00:54:35.111 --> 00:54:36.400
<v Speaker 2>why haven't you called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd say,</v>

1024
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what you say anyway.</v>

1025
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no question about it.</v>

1026
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.200
<v Speaker 2>What am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shall have a lot of fun together.</v>

1027
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:43.303
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1028
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.363
<v Speaker 2>Let's say number two.</v>

1029
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.813
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

1030
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 7>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my name is molly is anger.</v>

1031
00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 7>I'm a student at Barnard College.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1032
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 7>I guess what I'm basically wondering is</v>
<v Speaker 7>what your main considerations are when</v>

1033
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:59.400
<v Speaker 7>you're choosing where to donate and what</v>
<v Speaker 7>causes to donate to and what the main</v>

1034
00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 7>challenges are that are associated with</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1035
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wholesale it because I made a choice</v>

1036
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:09.300
<v Speaker 6>that I wanted to have a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>well originally my first wife and I</v>

1037
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.540
<v Speaker 6>planned that I would pile up and she</v>
<v Speaker 6>went on pile it.</v>

1038
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:12.800
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

1039
00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:14.580
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was plan number one.</v>

1040
00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 6>But she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she died,</v>

1041
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1042
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.940
<v Speaker 6>in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I had the problem of figuring</v>

1043
00:55:20.941 --> 00:55:25.500
<v Speaker 6>out the best way to distribute what</v>
<v Speaker 6>turned out to be a lot of money and I</v>

1044
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 6>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted some people who had similar</v>

1045
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:32.550
<v Speaker 6>values and similar objectives and what I</v>
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

1046
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 6>but I also want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people would pour in intelligence and</v>

1047
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 6>energy in case of bill and Melinda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of their own funds,</v>

1048
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:44.110
<v Speaker 6>we'll work out a full time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who really saw society as I sought,</v>

1049
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 6>which was at every life is of equal</v>
<v Speaker 6>value in and that if you start with that</v>

1050
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 6>and then you figure what your might be</v>
<v Speaker 6>good at changing whether it's medicine</v>

1051
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 6>or education or early learning or</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it may be.</v>

1052
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 6>A,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1053
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:02.811
<v Speaker 6>that was my answer was that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>wholesale and retail philanthropy would</v>

1054
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 6>drive me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But wholesale,</v>

1055
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:05.603
<v Speaker 2>we are really like</v>

1056
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 3>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.240
<v Speaker 3>For our work at the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the belief in innovation,</v>

1058
00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.030
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1059
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:21.280
<v Speaker 3>both Melinda and I sought Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our question was,</v>

1060
00:56:21.281 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we bring that kind innovation to</v>

1061
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 3>help the world's poorest in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We learned that coming up with new</v>

1062
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 3>vaccines that although you can pay a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have them created,</v>

1063
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.660
<v Speaker 3>the marginal cost comes down to less</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a dollar,</v>

1064
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.900
<v Speaker 3>so great getting a new vaccine for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>main cause of diarrhea or our pneumonia,</v>

1065
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be a phenomenal thing.</v>

1066
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:48.331
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking for these super</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonlinear dramatic things because as you</v>

1067
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:50.890
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>per poor person are compared to</v>

1068
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 3>government funding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>philanthropy is actually quite small and</v>

1069
00:56:55.301 --> 00:57:00.301
<v Speaker 3>yet the funding vaccine projects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government isn't as good as that as</v>

1070
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 3>a philanthropist who assembles a team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And over time it's learning how to do</v>

1071
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 3>that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had models in a Rockefeller</v>

1072
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Foundation was a phenomenal foundation.</v>

1073
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 3>The green revolution is just one of many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they did,</v>

1074
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:17.830
<v Speaker 3>which raised agricultural productivity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and saved,</v>

1075
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 3>avoided hundreds of millions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a starving.</v>

1076
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 3>And so studying the other foundations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have taken these big breakthroughs,</v>

1077
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and created model out of those that was</v>

1078
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 3>very informative to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what we've gone after.</v>

1079
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 3>What's the most important lesson you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned though,</v>

1080
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:38.580
<v Speaker 3>about making investments from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation today that you learned along</v>

1081
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:42.640
<v Speaker 3>the way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1082
00:57:42.641 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1083
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 3>when we started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that just coming up with the</v>

1084
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:51.520
<v Speaker 3>new vaccine or drug alone would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough and that the world would then</v>

1085
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 3>take that and get it out to all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>children of the world.</v>

1086
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1087
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 3>partly through field this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that Melinda did,</v>

1088
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:02.560
<v Speaker 3>looking at the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that delivery system,</v>

1089
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get out to a lot of the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so having to figure out how people</v>

1090
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 3>are hired or how that was funded and</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure this,</v>

1091
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 3>what's called primary health care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1092
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 3>we were drawn into that out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>

1093
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 3>It didn't fit the normal sort of in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lab,</v>

1094
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with this great concoction and</v>

1095
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:27.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet in order to achieve our goals,</v>

1096
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 3>we needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think about those delivery pieces.</v>

1097
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the state of the product</v>

1098
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 3>actually had to be simpler in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to get through that very</v>

1099
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 3>limited delivery capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now we're getting to 86 percent of</v>

1100
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 3>the world's children with vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1101
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:46.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 70 percent when we got started.</v>

1102
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:51.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's good increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still have have 14 percent to go,</v>

1103
00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:56.730
<v Speaker 3>one that have amazing a convening and</v>
<v Speaker 3>persuasive powers as well.</v>

1104
00:58:58.061 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 3>So I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bring something far more to it than</v>

1105
00:59:01.661 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 3>just money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

1106
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.600
<v Speaker 3>they work incredibly hard and do my</v>
<v Speaker 3>three children in their foundations,</v>

1107
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:12.601
<v Speaker 3>but they work incredibly hard at getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>governments involved in vaccines or</v>

1108
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:14.460
<v Speaker 3>whatever it may take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1109
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just as you know,</v>

1110
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
<v Speaker 3>it's an extra dimension that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few people have in the field.</v>

1111
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a hands on travel to Melinda is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and she's holding a little baby.</v>

1112
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean she is actually thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.740
<v Speaker 2>this good needs to be vaccinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a decent chance in education,</v>

1114
00:59:34.741 --> 00:59:36.750
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way about the kid,</v>

1115
00:59:36.751 --> 00:59:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but what I really think is going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pee on me and on head was going,</v>

1116
00:59:39.361 --> 00:59:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1117
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:45.510
<v Speaker 2>there's just a difference in that human</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch that makes a big difference.</v>

1118
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm halfway in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's closer to me number three</v>

1119
00:59:50.401 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 2>and number four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first one,</v>

1120
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.560
<v Speaker 2>then three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then four</v>

1121
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.850
<v Speaker 2>small me at the Columbia business</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

1122
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:01.350
<v Speaker 2>If the current government were to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your advice on immigration or</v>

1123
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:04.080
<v Speaker 2>healthcare reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you recommend to them?</v>

1124
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.343
<v Speaker 4>Lauren?</v>

1125
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on him,</v>

1126
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.900
<v Speaker 2>on immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1127
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this country is built on it.</v>

1128
01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I always say to people through</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>

1129
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.780
<v Speaker 2>let's put it in retroactively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody leaves</v>

1130
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.560
<v Speaker 2>this country and you think about it.</v>

1131
01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:30.820
<v Speaker 6>Overdose before from me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're sitting here in part because</v>

1132
01:00:30.821 --> 01:00:35.680
<v Speaker 6>of two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>George immigrants who in 1939 and August</v>

1133
01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:38.950
<v Speaker 6>signed the most important letter perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the history of the United States and</v>

1134
01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:41.610
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can go to the Internet and go to</v>

1135
01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 6>search thing and</v>

1136
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1137
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:55.160
<v Speaker 2>and just type in Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt 1939.</v>

1138
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.730
<v Speaker 6>Leo's Alard and Albert Einstein to</v>
<v Speaker 6>immigrants came here.</v>

1139
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 6>They both.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They came directly from Germany,</v>

1140
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:07.130
<v Speaker 6>large came from Hungary before that and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they told President Roosevelt that the</v>

1141
01:01:07.921 --> 01:01:12.870
<v Speaker 6>Germans were likely to develop an atom</v>
<v Speaker 6>bomb which was likely to work.</v>

1142
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.680
<v Speaker 6>It's less than a full page and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>better get to work on something fast and</v>

1143
01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:20.820
<v Speaker 6>that the Manhattan project came out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>that and it hadn't been for those two</v>

1144
01:01:20.821 --> 01:01:23.400
<v Speaker 6>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows whether we'd be sitting in</v>

1145
01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:24.234
<v Speaker 6>this room,</v>

1146
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:28.263
<v Speaker 4>immigration,</v>

1147
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.563
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him handle,</v>

1148
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.930
<v Speaker 2>can do Andy Grove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go up and down,</v>

1149
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1150
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:42.990
<v Speaker 2>this country has been built on the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly why?</v>

1151
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 2>By immigrants and you can take them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>any country.</v>

1152
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.480
<v Speaker 6>Pretty good one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they'd come here and they've</v>

1153
01:01:48.481 --> 01:01:51.710
<v Speaker 6>found something that unleash the</v>
<v Speaker 6>potential that the place where they left</v>

1154
01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:54.240
<v Speaker 6>did not have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were the product of it.</v>

1155
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.090
<v Speaker 6>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the question also is about healthcare.</v>

1156
01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:01.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what can you tell us about healthcare</v>

1157
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.760
<v Speaker 6>that you think is important in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the consideration of what might happen?</v>

1158
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you were building a healthcare plan</v>

1159
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.240
<v Speaker 6>for America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would be the elements that you</v>

1160
01:02:12.241 --> 01:02:13.080
<v Speaker 6>would want to</v>

1161
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.413
<v Speaker 4>include?</v>

1162
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no doubt that in order to</v>

1163
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 6>provide decent healthcare,</v>

1164
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:26.420
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of GDP devoted to it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go up over time.</v>

1165
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 3>It's already very high and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some efficiencies to be gained,</v>

1166
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>

1167
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 percent are so number.</v>

1168
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 3>But as society ages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we come up with new things like joint</v>

1169
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:43.140
<v Speaker 3>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organ transplant,</v>

1170
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:45.990
<v Speaker 3>which are going to create lots of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits,</v>

1171
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources overall,</v>

1172
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:50.730
<v Speaker 3>including more government resources for</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>

1173
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:56.510
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a tough problem because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have both access problems today and you</v>

1174
01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:02.400
<v Speaker 3>have costs problems today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1175
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 3>whenever I look at a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this one simple lens which has</v>

1176
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:10.440
<v Speaker 3>those innovation should help here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in this case,</v>

1177
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 3>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it will provide breakthrough drugs</v>

1178
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:16.920
<v Speaker 3>that will save costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you can cure Alzheimer's,</v>

1179
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 3>which we certainly haven't done yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will save on huge longterm care</v>

1180
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>costs.</v>

1181
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:25.830
<v Speaker 3>So we have these chronic diseases that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've made less progress on,</v>

1182
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

1183
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.810
<v Speaker 3>than some of the others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1184
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>the market mechanism to get Pharma to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>after those things.</v>

1185
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 3>And the basic research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those funds,</v>

1186
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I am quite optimistic that we'll have</v>
<v Speaker 3>some advances,</v>

1187
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:42.111
<v Speaker 3>but they'll also give us some very</v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive things that will mean we're,</v>

1188
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 3>we're spending more money against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do hope you know that at some</v>

1189
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:52.281
<v Speaker 3>point that we really are calling on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best minds to look at the incentives for</v>

1190
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:57.480
<v Speaker 3>the breakthroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most efficient system we have here.</v>

1191
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of unhappiness in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country now.</v>

1192
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.400
<v Speaker 3>A stems from the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system isn't delivering.</v>

1193
01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1194
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are saying less government,</v>

1195
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.120
<v Speaker 3>more government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1196
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're being given the</v>

1197
01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.220
<v Speaker 3>depth of education about why it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough that over time will help them a</v>

1198
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 3>vote for the rest of the depth of</v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>

1199
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Let me go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to facebook and just a moment,</v>

1200
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>but where was I promised three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four to six.</v>

1201
01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:31.770
<v Speaker 3>A three is there and six is up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go three,</v>

1202
01:04:31.771 --> 01:04:33.510
<v Speaker 3>six and we'll go to facebook.</v>

1203
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.070
<v Speaker 11>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 11>my name is Josh Schaffer and I'm a</v>

1204
01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:42.071
<v Speaker 11>dental resident at Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 11>My question is for future doctors and</v>

1205
01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 11>dentists of America.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What,</v>

1206
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:48.920
<v Speaker 11>what advice do you have in giving about</v>
<v Speaker 11>having a proper balance of providing</v>

1207
01:04:48.921 --> 01:04:52.010
<v Speaker 11>that health care,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but also mastering the concepts of</v>

1208
01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:53.600
<v Speaker 11>business and economics?</v>

1209
01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it told Gawande is incredible.</v>

1210
01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Author.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1211
01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 3>in the current issue of the New Yorker</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a,</v>

1212
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:12.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the latest in a wonderful articles about</v>

1213
01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the healthcare system and he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the people who do sort of heroic</v>

1214
01:05:16.131 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 3>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like are paid twice as much as the</v>

1215
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:25.110
<v Speaker 3>people who are on an ongoing basis and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great incremental way learning about the</v>

1216
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 3>patient and seeing what works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1217
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a calling to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey though,</v>

1218
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>that part of the system needs to be run</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1219
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 3>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs more resources.</v>

1220
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1221
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's brilliant that he's</v>

1222
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 3>saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also corresponds to what,</v>

1223
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is working in some other countries.</v>

1224
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:46.960
<v Speaker 3>A six.</v>

1225
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 7>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my name is Columbia College.</v>

1226
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 7>So you both have invested a great deal</v>
<v Speaker 7>of money abroad,</v>

1227
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 7>but there is a prevailing belief by some</v>
<v Speaker 7>that there are pressing issues in</v>

1228
01:05:58.271 --> 01:05:59.850
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are poor people here,</v>

1229
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 7>there are sick people here and we should</v>
<v Speaker 7>deal with that first before even</v>

1230
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 7>tackling anything abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what are your thoughts on that?</v>

1231
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:13.210
<v Speaker 6>My own personal thought is that every</v>
<v Speaker 6>life is of equal value and uh,</v>

1232
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.653
<v Speaker 4>in many ways,</v>

1233
01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 6>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have a limited number of dollars,</v>

1234
01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:28.060
<v Speaker 6>you actually can do more for more people</v>
<v Speaker 6>outside the United States.</v>

1235
01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 6>We do have greater resources here for</v>
<v Speaker 6>our 320 million people that exists</v>

1236
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 6>around the world for seven plus billion</v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

1237
01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.490
<v Speaker 6>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>

1238
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.750
<v Speaker 6>you can improve the lot of more people</v>
<v Speaker 6>by intelligently spending a billion</v>

1239
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.900
<v Speaker 6>dollars or any other number,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1240
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.230
<v Speaker 6>in other areas of the world actually</v>
<v Speaker 6>then here.</v>

1241
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:51.280
<v Speaker 6>And I know coming from Omaha and having</v>
<v Speaker 6>the money,</v>

1242
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:52.330
<v Speaker 6>I have people say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1243
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 6>why not spend it all in?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1244
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 6>you grow up hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost done all kinds of things for you.</v>

1245
01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:59.740
<v Speaker 6>And I absolutely acknowledge that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the end,</v>

1246
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.150
<v Speaker 6>if I've got x dollars to spend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can make life better for more people</v>

1247
01:07:04.151 --> 01:07:08.500
<v Speaker 6>if I can have it intelligently allocated</v>
<v Speaker 6>in other parts of the world actually</v>

1248
01:07:08.501 --> 01:07:10.570
<v Speaker 6>than the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that draws a fair amount of</v>

1249
01:07:10.571 --> 01:07:13.260
<v Speaker 6>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I live with because I just.</v>

1250
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.103
<v Speaker 6>What I believe</v>

1251
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.940
<v Speaker 2>all lives have equal value is really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving force behind my foundation.</v>

1252
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won the ovarian lottery when I was</v>

1253
01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:25.810
<v Speaker 2>born in the United States in 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 40 to one against me.</v>

1254
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I was male that now it's 80 to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>against being a male in the United</v>

1255
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 2>States in 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just plain lucky my life had been</v>

1256
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>partnered with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill always said if I had been born a</v>

1257
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:37.200
<v Speaker 2>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have been some animals lunch because</v>

1258
01:07:37.201 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I can't run fast and I can't climb trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

1259
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:44.930
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be saying I allocate capital</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wouldn't work.</v>

1260
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And I was lucky but 79 out of the 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't as lucky as I was at that time.</v>

1261
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:53.783
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead bill.</v>

1262
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Is it</v>

1263
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:59.610
<v Speaker 3>the helping people in other countries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The foreign aid budget of the US is,</v>

1264
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:06.180
<v Speaker 3>is point eight percent of the budget and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be in,</v>

1265
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.330
<v Speaker 3>in the years ahead and discussion about</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're doing it saves lives for</v>

1266
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
<v Speaker 3>typically about a thousand dollars of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life saved and in terms of stability and</v>

1267
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.250
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1268
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 3>eventually being self sufficient and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the world economy.</v>

1269
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.870
<v Speaker 3>There are some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some huge benefits to that.</v>

1270
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 3>So if we were talking about should we</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend 20 or 30 percent overseas?</v>

1271
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:31.641
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1272
01:08:31.641 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>that would be a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>

1273
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 3>But what we're trying to preserve a is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's gotten smarter and</v>

1274
01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.520
<v Speaker 3>smarter all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has proven benefits,</v>

1275
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.740
<v Speaker 3>all of which are things that our</v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation core invests,</v>

1276
01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:47.330
<v Speaker 3>invests in the same things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the polio thing is,</v>

1277
01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.420
<v Speaker 3>is point eight percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm hopeful that in a big world that</v>

1278
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>can remain a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or.</v>

1279
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Let me go to another facebook question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from uh,</v>

1280
01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nadia says,</v>

1281
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:02.660
<v Speaker 3>how might bill and Warren encouraged</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovation,</v>

1282
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 3>particularly among teens and young</v>
<v Speaker 3>adults?</v>

1283
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 3>How do you encourage innovation?</v>

1284
01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a market system</v>

1285
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.500
<v Speaker 2>provides rewards for it yet and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't,</v>

1286
01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an incubator for innovation in</v>

1287
01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>the United States and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken of school.</v>

1288
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Andy Grove can come from Hungary and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean it just welcomes it and thank God,</v>

1289
01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why we have the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity that we have.</v>

1290
01:09:31.561 --> 01:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean the question of how it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>divided as a secondary question and that</v>

1291
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.420
<v Speaker 2>is not good solid as well by the market</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1292
01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but our system is just designed for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at what is happening.</v>

1293
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1294
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure we get the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that back so we would only have five</v>

1295
01:09:48.491 --> 01:09:52.480
<v Speaker 3>minutes left so there's a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands up in the back so please recognize</v>

1296
01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:53.190
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1297
01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:54.640
<v Speaker 12>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 12>my name is Scott here.</v>

1298
01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.720
<v Speaker 12>I'm a senior and the junior school as</v>
<v Speaker 12>men have such great influence.</v>

1299
01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:00.751
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm curious,</v>

1300
01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:03.090
<v Speaker 12>and we touched a little bit about this,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the last question,</v>

1301
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:07.440
<v Speaker 12>but how you deal with reconciling your</v>
<v Speaker 12>convictions with maybe what is believed</v>

1302
01:10:07.441 --> 01:10:10.230
<v Speaker 12>by the public,</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe even a majority considering that</v>

1303
01:10:10.231 --> 01:10:14.580
<v Speaker 12>you have the wealth and power and fame</v>
<v Speaker 12>to make such great things happen</v>

1304
01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:20.670
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1305
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1306
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:27.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the convictions I have a,</v>

1307
01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:30.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love sharing them and talking to</v>

1308
01:10:30.701 --> 01:10:33.760
<v Speaker 3>people and understanding where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

1309
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1310
01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:38.170
<v Speaker 3>I can be overly science centric about</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1311
01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1312
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of clauses that are</v>

1313
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.680
<v Speaker 3>super important that our foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have limited resources,</v>

1314
01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 3>we don't get to go and do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1315
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1316
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:56.621
<v Speaker 3>there's aspects of education in a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the strength of philanthropy is its</v>

1317
01:10:56.951 --> 01:10:58.270
<v Speaker 3>diversity and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1318
01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:02.410
<v Speaker 3>and so just by sharing the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun,</v>

1319
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:07.390
<v Speaker 3>it really can have measurable impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that sets an example for all of</v>

1320
01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:10.300
<v Speaker 3>philanthropy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't happen to believe that,</v>

1321
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my voice should be that much louder than</v>

1322
01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:14.960
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1323
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1324
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these big political donations,</v>

1325
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:19.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least,</v>

1326
01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:21.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1327
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I and worn as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1328
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:28.461
<v Speaker 3>we've chosen not to have that be a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that we're spending our money.</v>

1329
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:31.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a personal choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1330
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money's being saved for,</v>

1331
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.530
<v Speaker 3>not for the megaphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the work of the foundation.</v>

1332
01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 3>We got a podium over certain short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people do not</v>

1333
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:46.490
<v Speaker 6>with a partner like Charlie monger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to worry about my views</v>

1334
01:11:46.491 --> 01:11:49.910
<v Speaker 6>being accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>automatically point out the shortcomings</v>

1335
01:11:49.911 --> 01:11:52.550
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the influence of money in politics.</v>

1336
01:11:52.551 --> 01:11:53.360
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing is,</v>

1337
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.360
<v Speaker 6>is bad news for this country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think citizens united was a terrible</v>

1338
01:11:56.361 --> 01:12:01.361
<v Speaker 6>decision and the idea that somebody can</v>
<v Speaker 6>pour millions and millions of dollars</v>

1339
01:12:04.251 --> 01:12:06.950
<v Speaker 6>into a campaign and in certain cases and</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even be identified,</v>

1340
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.650
<v Speaker 6>I think really kind of</v>

1341
01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.160
<v Speaker 3>goes counter to kind of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the two of you created</v>

1342
01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:16.400
<v Speaker 3>along with blend and others created the</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving pledge.</v>

1343
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.660
<v Speaker 3>How's that going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going?</v>

1344
01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go conducted.</v>

1345
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.210
<v Speaker 3>It really is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philanthropy is kind of where it is.</v>

1346
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:25.941
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1347
01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1348
01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:27.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 3>we love philanthropy of all types and</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the strength American clamp is</v>

1350
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:37.491
<v Speaker 3>actually people with very little who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly generous here though we said,</v>

1351
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.410
<v Speaker 3>for the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are super lucky to have over a billion</v>

1352
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.260
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want a group who are working together</v>

1353
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.100
<v Speaker 3>who are committed to give the majority</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their wealth away to learn from each</v>

1354
01:12:49.101 --> 01:12:50.690
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's worked,</v>

1355
01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.930
<v Speaker 3>what hasn't worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you involve your kids?</v>

1356
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you hire staff?</v>

1357
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And they'll find areas that are working</v>
<v Speaker 3>on together and cooperate,</v>

1358
01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:03.200
<v Speaker 3>but we're not pulling any money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we thought we'd get 20,</v>

1359
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:05.960
<v Speaker 3>25 people together.</v>

1360
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.860
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're at 156.</v>

1361
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So it is a wonderful yearly eventide</v>
<v Speaker 3>made some great people.</v>

1362
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I do think that the quantity and quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>has gone up because we're getting</v>

1363
01:13:18.951 --> 01:13:21.770
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll never be able to measure that in a</v>

1364
01:13:21.771 --> 01:13:25.820
<v Speaker 3>direct way in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're making special efforts in China</v>

1365
01:13:25.821 --> 01:13:30.230
<v Speaker 3>and India because now we have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>welfare and that wasn't there before.</v>

1366
01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their own way,</v>

1367
01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by having a strong philanthropic sector</v>

1368
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:39.350
<v Speaker 3>that will help those countries and</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore help the world was</v>

1369
01:13:39.351 --> 01:13:41.480
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now build an I are having dinner</v>

1370
01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:42.980
<v Speaker 3>actually with the group tonight for</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1371
01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:43.814
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1372
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:49.090
<v Speaker 6>you go back 100 or a hundred 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people got wealthy by making some money</v>

1373
01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:52.850
<v Speaker 6>from the oil refinery are still a mill</v>
<v Speaker 6>and building another one and every Ford</v>

1374
01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:55.150
<v Speaker 6>with Volvo plant them build cars and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then they,</v>

1375
01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.630
<v Speaker 6>it would be from actually from retained</v>
<v Speaker 6>earnings which eventually turned into</v>

1376
01:13:58.631 --> 01:14:01.660
<v Speaker 6>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you can get rich very young just by</v>

1377
01:14:01.661 --> 01:14:06.250
<v Speaker 6>having an idea and you can get that idea</v>
<v Speaker 6>monetize and capitalize in a way that</v>

1378
01:14:06.251 --> 01:14:09.070
<v Speaker 6>you cannot believe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we are particularly interested in</v>

1379
01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:13.330
<v Speaker 6>getting younger people interested in</v>
<v Speaker 6>philanthropy because there will be huge.</v>

1380

1388
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:43.710
<v Speaker 7>to relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm personally given a desire to honor</v>

1389
01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:48.711
<v Speaker 7>myself and respect other individuals</v>
<v Speaker 7>have found it difficult throughout life</v>

1390
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:54.350
<v Speaker 7>to discern which relationships to really</v>
<v Speaker 7>foster and invest in and accept</v>

1391
01:14:54.781 --> 01:14:59.781
<v Speaker 7>challenges from and which to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 7>forgo and abandoned because there are</v>

1392
01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:03.030
<v Speaker 7>more harmful than helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:07.800
<v Speaker 7>so are there any major life lessons that</v>

<v Speaker 7>personal experiences?</v>

1395

<v Speaker 6>the people that you associate with site,</v>

1397
01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.110
<v Speaker 6>it's important to associate with people</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are better than yourself.</v>

1398
01:15:21.111 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 6>And actually the most important decision</v>
<v Speaker 6>met.</v>

<v Speaker 6>would have them be people that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>admire as well as why come,</v>

1411
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.190
<v Speaker 6>they'll do that to that.</v>

1412

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some friends do bring out the best in</v>

<v Speaker 3>and so those,</v>

1416
01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.070
<v Speaker 3>it's good to invest in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendships.</v>

1417
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:11.403
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>

1418
01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.790
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some friends challenge you about things</v>

1419
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.010
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1420
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.991
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:20.960
<v Speaker 3>that level of intimacy is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't invest.</v>

1424
01:16:24.711 --> 01:16:27.620
<v Speaker 3>I'd say in my twenties and thirties as</v>
<v Speaker 3>much as I should have.</v>

1425
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.190
<v Speaker 3>It's really through Melinda and seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>know other people.</v>

1426
01:16:31.191 --> 01:16:32.024
<v Speaker 3>I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1427
01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:37.210
<v Speaker 3>that is really worth the investment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have those people as a,</v>

1428
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.550
<v Speaker 3>you're always there to help them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice versa.</v>
