1
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Life is a manifestation of where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct your energy.</v>

2
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It truly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we should really start with is</v>

3
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>to actually look at energy the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at water.</v>

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>If I took water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I took a watering can and water the</v>

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>garden bed with the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow,</v>

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the flowers grow both right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

7
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>It has no ability to discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the weeds and the flowers.</v>

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Whatever water starts growing and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way as well.</v>

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>If I took energy and I invested it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something negative,</v>

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>it will grow and become more negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I took energy,</v>

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>invested it into something positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will grow and become more positive.</v>

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Energy has no ability to discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>between what's positive and what's</v>

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you invest energy into starts</v>

14
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>to grow and manifest in your life right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

15
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>You are the sum total of where you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been investing your energy throughout</v>

16
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>your entire life.</v>

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So the goal really in life is to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what it is you want,</v>

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your purpose in life?</v>

19
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Who and what's important in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be able to direct energy too.</v>

20
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It's that so that you can manifest that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>So where do we begin with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We begin by understanding how the mind</v>

22
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to say with you,</v>

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>after living 10 years as a celibate monk</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a cloistered monastery in Hawaii,</v>

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>this would probably be the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing I could ever share with</v>

25
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understanding how the mind works from</v>

26
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>amongst perspective of understanding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monk and experience of a month's</v>

27
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've understanding the mind and</v>

28
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>experience at the mine in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

29
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>in my experience of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two things we need to understand</v>

30
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>awareness and the mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's define what they are.</v>

31
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's define awareness as a glowing ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>of light.</v>

32
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>So imagine an ob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glowing ball of light that can float</v>

33
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it awareness and put that</v>

34
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's define the mind.</v>

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's define the minus a vast space with</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different areas.</v>

36
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Within one area of the mind is angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred,</v>

37
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jai happiness,</v>

38
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.164
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

40
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of different things,</v>

41
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.973
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Yo awareness that ball of light can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually move to any area of the mind</v>

43
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you want it to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your awareness,</v>

44
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>this glowing ball of light goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happier of the mind,</v>

45
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>it lights up that particular area of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>You become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become conscious of being happy.</v>

47
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

48
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You're in an area of the mind call</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

49
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>If this ball of light goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>angrier of the mind,</v>

50
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>it lights up that particular area of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

51
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Are you angry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

52
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>You in an area of the mind called</v>
<v Speaker 1>hangar.</v>

53
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And by using your willpower and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>powers of concentration,</v>

54
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>you can actually take your awareness as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well of late to any area of the mind</v>

55
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>that you want to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the most important part where</v>

56
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>your awareness goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where your energy is flowing.</v>

57
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So if your awareness goes to the angrier</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mind,</v>

58
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>your energy is flowing that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually strengthening that particular</v>

59
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>area of the mind.</v>

60
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>So this is the theory of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do a little practical exercise</v>

61
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>to see if this actually works of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>mung talk.</v>

62
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for that they need some audience</v>

63
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>participation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need all of you to sit up straight</v>

64
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>in your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

65
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And put your feet down on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're leaning in your chair,</v>

66
00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>sit forward a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your spine straight,</v>

67
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>roll your shoulders back and keep your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head nicely balanced on top of your</v>

68
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes are closed.</v>

69
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to chat.</v>

70
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold hands until later.</v>

71
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>so take a slow deep breath in with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes closed.</v>

73
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Take a slow deep breath in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slowly exhale.</v>

74
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Then take another slow deep breath in</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

75
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>And then slowly exhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to become aware of the</v>

76
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>chatter that you're sitting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it comfortable?</v>

77
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Is it not comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The temperature of the room?</v>

78
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it cold?</v>

79
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.343
<v Speaker 2>Warm?</v>

80
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>What about your body posture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your spine straight?</v>

81
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Your shoulders roll back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sitting a little bit forward,</v>

82
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>your head nicely balanced on top of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>spine.</v>

83
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Now I want you to become aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most recent wedding that you attended.</v>

84
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember whose wedding it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you happy for the couple</v>

85
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>getting married?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think as much detail as you</v>

86
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>can about the wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what you wore to the</v>

87
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>wedding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what the bride wore?</v>

88
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Did she make a good choice with a dress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was the food at the wedding?</v>

89
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you drink a lot?</v>

90
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Was that good music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you dance?</v>

91
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you do some crazy wedding dance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want you to become aware of the</v>

92
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:35.001
<v Speaker 1>most recent vacation that you went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of vacation was it?</v>

93
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Was it a surfing trip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga retreat.</v>

94
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Holiday shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camping.</v>

95
00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:44.774
<v Speaker 1>Backpacking?</v>

96
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Try and think as much detail as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the vacation.</v>

98
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>What was the weather like where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went?</v>

99
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Was it cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rainy,</v>

100
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humid,</v>

101
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 1>dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snowing?</v>

102
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the favorite hotel you</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed in?</v>

103
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>How was the food land?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spicy.</v>

104
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you get sick eating the food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you shop a lot?</v>

105
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.220
<v Speaker 1>What was one thing you bought on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip that you really liked?</v>

106
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes are still closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to become aware of the room</v>

107
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try and feel the temperature of the</v>

108
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it warm?</v>

109
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.524
<v Speaker 1>Is it cold?</v>

110
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 1>The chair you're sitting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it comfortable?</v>

111
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your spine still straight or you're</v>

112
00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>hunching your shoulders roll back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Slowly open your eyes and you can lean</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in your chat.</v>

114
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for doing that</v>

115
00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:46.040
<v Speaker 1>exercise with me that the exercise is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really to prove two things to you.</v>

116
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 1>One is this a clear separation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and the mind.</v>

117
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Two completely different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second is you can actually take your</v>

118
00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:55.940
<v Speaker 1>awareness and move it to any area of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind you want it to go to.</v>

119
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave me permission,</v>

120
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took your awareness from the room.</v>

121
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I took it to an area of the subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind where the memory of the wedding</v>

122
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>recited and then I took you to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation area of the mine and then back</v>

123
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>to the room again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I know you were thinking about</v>

124
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:08.841
<v Speaker 1>the wedding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I had my eyes open and your eyes were</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed and when to ask questions.</v>

126
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I could see the reactions in your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bride.</v>

127
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Make a good choice with her dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of UN.</v>

128
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you drink too much?</v>

129
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>A few heads went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew you were thinking about the</v>

130
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:27.021
<v Speaker 1>wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>So I took your awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different areas in the mind.</v>

132
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>This happens to all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

133
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>We allow people and things around us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictate where awareness goes in their</v>

134
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do one little exercise again,</v>

135
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>just to emphasize this point because to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me this is really,</v>

136
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>really important and it's the crack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crux of really managing energy in your</v>

137
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you remember your first kiss?</v>

138
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember who it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember his or her name?</v>

139
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember where it took place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back at dad's car.</v>

140
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Behind the garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the experience?</v>

141
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So what was the emotion that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the experience</v>

142
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.590
<v Speaker 1>from a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it wasn't that long ago.</v>

143
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we embarrassed,</v>

144
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>we nervous.</v>

145
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.603
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

146
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the person's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Some people are laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blushing.</v>

148
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the first time someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>you loved,</v>

149
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>someone really close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed away?</v>

150
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember getting a phone call</v>

151
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>being told that this person that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>love has just died?</v>

152
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.990
<v Speaker 1>How did you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the emotions associated with</v>

153
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:56.880
<v Speaker 1>that experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have the blessing of being able</v>

154
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 1>to see the body before they was cremated</v>
<v Speaker 1>or buried?</v>

155
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember standing next to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body wondering how it felt knowing that</v>

156
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll never see this person again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did it feel for you?</v>

157
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the emotions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting?</v>

158
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>In the space is 60 to 90 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take your awareness from an area of</v>

159
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the mind where all of you are smiling or</v>
<v Speaker 1>giggling or slightly embarrassed to an</v>

160
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.450
<v Speaker 1>area of the mine where all of you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely sad and that Saturday just</v>

161
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>feeling the vibration of the rooms has</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely changed,</v>

162
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could take your awareness now to</v>

163
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>an angry area of the mind where you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>get anger,</v>

164
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you get up and you leave and Sarah and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her team would be really upset with me</v>

165
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>and this happens all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

166
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>All Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We allow people and things to dictate</v>

167
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>where awareness goes and because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictate where awareness goes.</v>

168
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That's where our energy flows as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where our energy flows is what</v>

169
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>manifest in our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really the goal in is not really to</v>

170
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>control your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather to control where your</v>

171
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>awareness is going it within your mind.</v>

172
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So don't control your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Control where your awareness goes within</v>

173
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we do that?</v>

174
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>We do that by learning how so your</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual practice or your homework for</v>

175
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>taking away is to control where your</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness goes in your mind throughout</v>

176
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really it.</v>

177
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>How do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learn the fine art of concentration.</v>

178
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's define what concentration is.</v>

179
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I define concentration as the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your awareness on one thing for an</v>

180
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>extended period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can keep my awareness on this</v>

181
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>lady and hold it on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concentrating.</v>

182
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>If I around with my awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ball of light to move away,</v>

183
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting distracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use my willpower and I bring my</v>

184
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.801
<v Speaker 1>awareness back and I hold it on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being able to do that allows me to</v>

185
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people can't concentrate for two</v>

186
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>One is they've never been taught how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate.</v>

188
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Second is they never practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration.</v>

189
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>How many of you growing up here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school have classes on concentration</v>

190
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>every single day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same way you had classes on</v>

191
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on math and science?</v>

192
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I travel all around the world and I</v>

193
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>asked this question and nobody puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hand up.</v>

194
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>How many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were growing up in school,</v>

195
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>we're told to concentrate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

196
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You get tall to concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never get taught how to do it.</v>

197
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was growing up,</v>

198
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I got told to concentrate all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dandapani concentrate on doing your</v>

199
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dandapani concentrate on eating your</v>

200
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody want to show me how to do it?</v>

201
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have kids?</v>

202
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 1>How many of you telling your kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate?</v>

203
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever showed them how to know?</v>

204
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you don't show them how to</v>

205
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would they know how to do it?</v>

206
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to be good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

207
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be really good at</v>

208
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 1>concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to practice it all day.</v>

209
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>People are good at distraction because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they practice all day long.</v>

210
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to concentrate,</v>

211
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>they've just practice distraction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then become really,</v>

212
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we concentrate?</v>

213
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>We concentrate by practicing doing one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing at a time and integrating this</v>

214
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>practice into our everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

215
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I look at my average day and I asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

216
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>what's a reoccurring event in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyday I speak with my spouse.</v>

217
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Every time I speak with my spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give her my undivided attention.</v>

218
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I keep my awareness on her.</v>

219
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 1>It drifts away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring it back,</v>

220
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 1>it drifts away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring it back.</v>

221
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I keep my awareness on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give her my undivided attention.</v>

222
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Now every day I also speak to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients.</v>

223
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So I speak with my clients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speak with my friends,</v>

224
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.380
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I speak with somebody,</v>

225
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I give them my undivided attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm on the phone,</v>

226
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I give the person on the phone my</v>
<v Speaker 1>undivided attention.</v>

227
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I practice doing one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a time.</v>

228
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've clocked about maybe six to eight</v>

229
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 1>hours of practicing concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six months later I become really good at</v>

230
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 months later,</v>

231
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd become really good at concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to become good at something</v>

232
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:56.451
<v Speaker 1>is to take a tool and insert it into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reoccurring event in your life and this</v>

233
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>is the best way to become good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something rather than to create another</v>

234
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>practice in your life.</v>

235
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Just take a tool and insert it into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

236
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.840
<v Speaker 1>into a reoccurring event in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your homework is to give someone or</v>

237
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your undivided attention.</v>

238
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Pick one person in your life for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next one month that you will give your</v>

239
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>undivided attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you speak with that person</v>

240
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 1>can stay completely focused on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your awareness on them.</v>

241
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the day you can go ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a squirrel,</v>

242
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.110
<v Speaker 1>but on just whenever you're speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that person,</v>

243
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>give that person you are and divided</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and you need to practice and</v>

244
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>bill in incremental steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing we need to learn to</v>

245
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 1>develop is how willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right everybody is born with various</v>

246
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Speaker 1>levels of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing we never get taught to do</v>

247
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>is to actually develop willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And willpower is like a muscle.</v>

248
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I call it a mental biceps.</v>

249
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>If I could draw a biceps around my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be my willpower.</v>

250
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>The three ways to develop willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

251
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 1>finish what you begin to finish it well</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond your expectations.</v>

252
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a little bit more than you think</v>

253
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you're able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these three ways require effort</v>

254
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>and that effort is willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

255
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:07.081
<v Speaker 1>So how do I develop willpower?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take these three methods and I apply</v>

256
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it to things that reoccur in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's something that reoccurs in my</v>

257
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>life everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday I sleep.</v>

258
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 1>What a great opportunity to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>willpower.</v>

259
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Before I go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I floss,</v>

260
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I brush my teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on my pajamas,</v>

261
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I wake up in the morning,</v>

262
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I finished the process of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I finish?</v>

263
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:26.430
<v Speaker 1>The process is asleep and then the bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

264
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>So everyday I wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make the bed.</v>

265
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>What's something else I do every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day I have breakfast.</v>

266
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 1>If I have time to make breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have time to eat breakfast.</v>

267
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Then I have time to do the breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 1>dish and put it away.</v>

268
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So finish the process that I begin and I</v>

269
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>bring this into everything that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then throughout the day,</v>

270
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I develop willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more end practices,</v>

271
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the better I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

272
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I have tremendous amount of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After six months,</v>

273
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I've developed a lot of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time my awareness drifts away,</v>

274
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I used that mental muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that willpower to bring my awareness</v>

275
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I used the powers,</v>

276
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the concentration that I've developed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>haul my awareness on what I'm focused on</v>

277
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and because I'm focusing on that where</v>
<v Speaker 1>my awareness goes,</v>

278
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>energy flows in my now my energy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing to.</v>

279
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It's what I want that starts to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

280
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

281
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>to understand there's a separation</v>
<v Speaker 1>between awareness and the mind.</v>

282
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Two completely different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You control where your awareness goes.</v>

283
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You control where your energy is flowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you control what's manifesting in</v>

284
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>your life and use your powers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration and your willpower to hold</v>

285
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:32.080
<v Speaker 1>your awareness on the priorities in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

286
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 1>The next thing we wanted to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to manage energy in our life,</v>

287
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is based on the premise that we</v>

288
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>only have so much energy each day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a finite amount of energy each</v>

289
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each day we have this much energy.</v>

290
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:48.670
<v Speaker 1>We take our energy and we invested into</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and things around us.</v>

291
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 1>We keep investing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investing,</v>

292
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 1>investing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until we have no more energy left,</v>

293
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 1>we get exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually around 11 or 1130 or</v>

294
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to sleep,</v>

295
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I energy builds up again.</v>

296
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>We go out the next day and we invest our</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy into people and things till we</v>

297
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.190
<v Speaker 1>have no more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

298
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing most people don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we never evaluate who and what.</v>

299
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>We're investing our energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I always tell people to treat</v>

300
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>energy the same way you treat money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a finite resource.</v>

301
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be wisely managed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisely,</v>

302
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 1>reallocated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wisely invested.</v>

303
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>No matter how rich you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have so much money,</v>

304
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you spend money,</v>

305
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>most of us think and evaluate what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>investing our money.</v>

306
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And if somebody asks us for $5,000 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000 to invest into a startup or a</v>

307
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would ask questions.</v>

308
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Who would just wouldn't hand them</v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000 we would ask,</v>

309
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 1>what's your plan with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with this</v>

310
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my return on my investment?</v>

311
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a finite resource.</v>

312
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we do the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy before we invest energy into</v>

313
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 1>someone or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we evaluate if that person or</v>

314
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>that thing is deserving of energy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you only have this much</v>

315
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

316
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 1>10% of my energy and I gave it to John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 10% I could have given to my</v>

317
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business,</v>

318
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the things and people that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the law of thermodynamics.</v>

319
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Energy cannot be created or destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be transferred or transformed</v>

320
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>from one thing to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

321
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So I can't create energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I give 10% to John,</v>

322
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I want to know he's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something good with it.</v>

323
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause if it's just going to squander it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather take it and give it to the</v>

324
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>people and things that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it important to manage energy?</v>

325
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest impetus for managing energy</v>

326
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 1>is is death.</v>

327
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Death is the greatest impetus for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage energy.</v>

328
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I realized that life is finite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I only have one life as me.</v>

329
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And regardless of my beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I have one existence and as done</v>

330
00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the piney and what happens after death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure.</v>

331
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.440
<v Speaker 1>We all have different upbringings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different religious beliefs.</v>

332
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Some people say when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to heaven or hell.</v>

333
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Some people say when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's game over.</v>

334
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nothing happens afterwards.</v>

335
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Some people say when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get reincarnated as a man or a woman</v>

336
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.301
<v Speaker 1>and other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

337
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you get reincarnated as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woman may be an insect or an animal,</v>

338
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but no one really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our beliefs and we hold strongly</v>

339
00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one's ever died and gone to</v>

340
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the Selfie,</v>

341
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:11.170
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted it on instagram and say,</v>

342
00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

343
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have an Hashtag Poli Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

344
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So we don't quite know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one definitive thing is that we</v>

345
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>know we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know I have a finite amount of</v>

346
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe life is short,</v>

347
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I,</v>

348
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.510
<v Speaker 1>my life is finite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be extremely clear where to</v>

349
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 1>focus my energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no point learning to concentrate</v>

350
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.550
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

351
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>So along with learning concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to also learn what</v>

352
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:43.040
<v Speaker 1>to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I would recommend as a homework</v>

353
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 1>is to be clear what your purpose in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

354
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 1>One way to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suspend five minutes each morning</v>

355
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>reflecting on what your purpose in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

356
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 1>get to know yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are happy to spend time with</v>

357
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 1>other people and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few people actually make time</v>

358
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 1>to spend time with themselves.</v>

359
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So when you wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a shower,</v>

360
00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:07.861
<v Speaker 1>or go to a quiet place in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and ask yourself questions</v>

361
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want in life?</v>

362
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 1>What's my purpose in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I here?</v>

363
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Why do I love?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I passionate about?</v>

364
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 1>How many people can generally answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is might say,</v>

365
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>this is my purpose in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

366
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 1>very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're clear with your purpose,</v>

367
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what to concentrate on and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to direct your finite amount</v>

368
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>of energy to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing we wanted to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>as energy consumers,</v>

370
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People and things are two of the biggest</v>

371
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>consumers of energy and people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things also give you a lot of energy.</v>

372
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Since the subject is vast and timeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

373
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 1>let's focus on the people that consume</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and how we can deal with them.</v>

374
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I call these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

375
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 1>energy vampires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right?</v>

376
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what a vampire that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baits in the neck and suck the life out</v>

377
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:55.740
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people consume tremendous</v>

378
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>amount of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially speaking.</v>

379
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 1>There are three types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's keep this simple monk simple.</v>

380
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>There are uplifting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are neutral people and they are not</v>

381
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:09.240
<v Speaker 1>uplifting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's define what this is,</v>

382
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>what they are and uplifting person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend five minutes with an uplifting</v>

383
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk away,</v>

384
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel great and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

385
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.200
<v Speaker 1>that was an amazing conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A neutral person.</v>

386
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I spent five minutes with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk away,</v>

387
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm still the same and not uplifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

388
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I spent five minutes with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk away and I go like,</v>

389
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was exhausting,</v>

390
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've probably experienced that in</v>

391
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next question is to ask is</v>

392
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 1>are they an energy vampire in the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to figure this out.</v>

393
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 1>One is I can judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can evaluate right?</v>

394
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Once a judging and evaluating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging is this.</v>

395
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm at a party in New York City in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>penthouse.</v>

396
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 1>There are 200 people in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The door opens.</v>

397
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>This guy walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got white,</v>

398
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 1>choose the purple suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a keen and the top hat.</v>

399
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing a chain with a big clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging off his chest.</v>

400
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I look across the room and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must be a pimp or a drug dealer does</v>

401
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.601
<v Speaker 1>judging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

402
00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just judged.</v>

403
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 1>He was a pimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drug dealer evaluation as this.</v>

404
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I spent 50 occasions with John over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of two years,</v>

405
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 1>49 of those I walk away from and I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

406
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was exhausting.</v>

407
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.100
<v Speaker 1>It's safe for me to evaluate that John</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an energy vampire.</v>

408
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are two types of energy</v>

409
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:17.710
<v Speaker 1>vampire.</v>

410
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>The next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they a transient energy vampire and</v>

411
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>inherently an energy vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

412
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>What's a transient energy vampire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say John is going through a hard</v>

413
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>time in life because his dad is dying of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer for example,</v>

414
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and for three years is it consumes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>

415
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always down.</v>

416
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>You need to uplift him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's feeling very sad.</v>

417
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give him that energy because he's</v>

418
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:39.720
<v Speaker 1>your friend and that's where we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We express compassion,</v>

419
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:40.471
<v Speaker 1>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and love,</v>

420
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>and we support our friends during</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult times.</v>

421
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>What someone who is inherently an energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire is someone who is inherently an</v>

422
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always been this way for decades.</v>

423
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 1>They just haven't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just not an uplifting human</v>

424
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 1>being at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we deal with someone who's</v>

425
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 1>inherently an energy vampire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before I go there,</v>

426
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 1>quick question for all of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you in this room feel like</v>

427
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you have someone who's inherently an</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy vampire in your life?</v>

428
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of people in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 1>So how do we deal with someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently an energy vampire,</v>

430
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My who taught me the best way to do this</v>

431
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Speaker 1>is to practice the art of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>affectionately detached,</v>

432
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but always kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentle,</v>

433
00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 1>sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and loving to its stem.</v>

434
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just say,</v>

435
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>John is inherently an energy vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in New York City.</v>

436
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking down fifth avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see John Walking too.</v>

437
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>

438
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Do I cross the street?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not very nice.</v>

439
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I meet John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Meets me.</v>

440
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you say when two people meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other?</v>

441
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I know what you guys say in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get,</v>

442
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.410
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it going mate?</v>

443
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I say that?</v>

444
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why you don't want us?</v>

445
00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't want to know.</v>

446
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand I'm in the monk</v>

447
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:00.070
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I ask somebody,</v>

448
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell me their entire life story.</v>

449
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a confession time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even ask,</v>

450
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>John asked me,</v>

451
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say I'm doing very well.</v>

452
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I reply,</v>

453
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 1>what a beautiful day in Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

454
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being sincere and being kind.</v>

455
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please excuse me.</v>

456
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I have something really important to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

457
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>My life is finite and I'm very clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my purpose is,</v>

458
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

459
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what do people say at the end</v>

460
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 1>of a conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure meeting you.</v>

461
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Actually it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do lunch.</v>

462
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>
<v Speaker 1>see you later?</v>

463
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to.</v>

464
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Why do we say to the things we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean and ask the questions we don't want</v>

465
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.624
<v Speaker 1>answers to.</v>

466
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say have a wonderful day.</v>

467
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he is inherently an energy</v>

468
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do wish he has a wonderful day.</v>

469
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So the concept of being affectionately</v>
<v Speaker 1>detached is to not engage with someone,</v>

470
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to be kind to be gentle,</v>

471
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:01.870
<v Speaker 1>to be sincere and loving towards them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not engaging with them.</v>

472
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>What's another way to protect yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an energy vampire is to place the</v>

473
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 1>burden of responsibility on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

474
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a client of mine who's a expert</v>

475
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>in social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

476
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>together with him,</v>

477
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>have a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glass of wine.</v>

478
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's catch up for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do dinner.</v>

479
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they want to pick his brain,</v>

480
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get information from him.</v>

481
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.100
<v Speaker 1>And he can sustained us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to have a little bit of</v>

482
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:30.160
<v Speaker 1>his time and his just kind of live this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

483
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>So I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you need to do.</v>

484
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.290
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to tell this person who wants</v>

485
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>to meet with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To read your favorite marketing book,</v>

486
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>read your favorite marketing book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down seven key points and email it</v>

487
00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you received the seven points from</v>

488
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them that you know you want to see</v>

489
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>what stands out to them in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you received these seven key</v>

490
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you email them and say,</v>

491
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 1>let's meet up on this day for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and we can discuss a marketing</v>

492
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>strategy for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for you.</v>

493
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people actually read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and email him the seven key</v>

494
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

495
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you place the burden or</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility on someone they know and</v>

496
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I travel all around the world.</v>

497
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People come up to me and the one to ask</v>

498
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always give them my personal email</v>

499
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:18.501
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell him,</v>

500
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 1>please don't share it with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you put your question down on this</v>

501
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>email and send it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that'll give me time to reflect on</v>

502
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 1>it and they can give you a proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

503
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure I'll put it all down in email</v>

504
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people email me?</v>

505
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Nobody emails me.</v>

506
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Simple little task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

507
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking them to do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meditate,</v>

508
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 1>to read out of one nostril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just send me an email with your</v>

509
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't do it.</v>

510
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So place the burden of responsibility on</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

511
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.810
<v Speaker 1>If you are somebody who's developed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular skill,</v>

512
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you had an expert in a particular niche</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that particular area,</v>

513
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.090
<v Speaker 1>and you find that people want your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want your energy.</v>

514
00:24:57.091 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And the one simple way to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is to place a bet on</v>

515
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:00.670
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn them,</v>

516
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 1>give them a simple task to do and see if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

517
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And if they've fulfilled their tasks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to you,</v>

518
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 1>then go out of your way to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

519
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.970
<v Speaker 1>another thing I want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your spiritual practices to every</v>

520
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate the people in your life.</v>

521
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So go through a process of evaluation</v>

522
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.200
<v Speaker 1>and reallocate your energy between</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who uplift you and people that</v>

523
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>don't evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uplift you.</v>

524
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that I do all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

525
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I want to talk about and a</v>

526
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:31.210
<v Speaker 1>wrap up with is mental energy vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a mental energy vampire?</v>

527
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Mental Energy Vampire is a unresolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional experiences that are sitting</v>

528
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>in our subconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

529
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Most people sub much conscious mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like this.</v>

530
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Indian flower markets is packed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff because people don't resolve stuff</v>

531
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 1>as they go through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

532
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Everything that is one pass through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once pass through your conscious mind in</v>

533
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 1>the form of experience is a resident in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your subconscious mind.</v>

534
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>And all of these experiences have</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion attached to them,</v>

535
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One simple way to deal with unresolved</v>

536
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>emotional experiences to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise called the [inaudible] Tantra,</v>

537
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:07.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a Sanskrit name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it really is is to take a piece</v>

538
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>of paper and write down the problem on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

539
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Every experience has emotion attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

540
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And I want to share with you a quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Tesla,</v>

541
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:16.690
<v Speaker 1>which I think really income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

542
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.250
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates the philosophy that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in or that I was trained in.</v>

543
00:26:21.251 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 1>In the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla says,</v>

544
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:24.440
<v Speaker 1>if you want to find the secrets of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

545
00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 1>think in terms of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency and vibration.</v>

546
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Everything is made up of energy and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrating at a certain frequency.</v>

547
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 1>So if I have an experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has emotion attached to it,</v>

548
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's vibrating in my subconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal is I can't do anything about the</v>

549
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 1>experience because it's already</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

550
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.780
<v Speaker 1>But what I can do to help myself is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove the emotion that's attached to</v>

551
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take a piece of paper,</v>

552
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I write down the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I write down the problem,</v>

553
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>something really interesting happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They experience moves from my</v>

554
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>subconscious mind to my conscious mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm reliving it.</v>

555
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.020
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy,</v>

556
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the emotion actually comes out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

557
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 1>flows through my hands into the piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

558
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Now I crumbled a piece of paper and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn it in a fire.</v>

559
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It could be a garbage can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fireplace.</v>

560
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the fire destroyed any emotion?</v>

561
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't destroy energy.</v>

562
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 1>But what it actually does is transform</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotion and the paper into heat,</v>

563
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>flame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ash,</v>

564
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a whole bunch of different things.</v>

565
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I ever shat</v>
<v Speaker 1>this exercise was with a group of</v>

566
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs in Perth actually about</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ago,</v>

567
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.690
<v Speaker 1>and one of them said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked down to pawnee.</v>

568
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I realized that experiences have emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to them and I realize as well,</v>

569
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 1>when you relive it or you're writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

570
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.200
<v Speaker 1>it goes from your subconscious mind to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscious mind.</v>

571
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 1>But this whole concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emotion comes out of the</v>

572
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flows through your hands into the piece</v>

573
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 1>of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's planted really hard to believe.</v>

574
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I've found painted that's a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>too spiritual.</v>

575
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

576
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.960
<v Speaker 1>So I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have kids?</v>

577
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

578
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foil and six year old.</v>

579
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on father's day on your birthday,</v>

580
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:58.260
<v Speaker 1>did he ever make you cots?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

581
00:27:58.261 --> 00:28:00.050
<v Speaker 1>they do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you describe the codwell?</v>

582
00:28:00.051 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 1>They say you usually go to the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house,</v>

583
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 1>they find an old piece of cardboard draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn it.</v>

584
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:06.810
<v Speaker 1>They stick a bunch of things on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars and,</v>

585
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of ribbons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on our last day on my birthday,</v>

586
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 1>they hand me the con and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it look?</v>

587
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:12.661
<v Speaker 1>They going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

588
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look that great.</v>

589
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's made by a foil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said,</v>

590
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this way.</v>

591
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 1>If you saw it in the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you pay money for it?</v>

592
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

593
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you keep it?</v>

594
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.861
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

595
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I keep every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And asked him why?</v>

596
00:28:24.991 --> 00:28:25.411
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

597
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it's so full of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

598
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you use telling me,</v>

599
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.221
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids?</v>

600
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:33.240
<v Speaker 1>No monk magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because two minutes ago I told you about</v>

601
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 1>putting emotion and a piece of paper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked at me like I was the crazy</v>

602
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now your four year old son knows how</v>

603
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 1>to do this right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's taken a piece of paper,</v>

604
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:43.780
<v Speaker 1>put his emotion in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of paper that you don't want,</v>

605
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 1>a cardboard that you didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put his emotion in it and now he's given</v>

606
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 1>it to you.</v>

607
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 1>And you hold it so you can actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>transfer energy from you.</v>

608
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Emotion from insider view into another</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

609
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have kids and have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those not so attractive drawings at</v>

610
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you keep them?</v>

611
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Why you'd never be able to sell it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody?</v>

612
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You keep it because they're so full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

614
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It's full of emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

615
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>So you can move emotion out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the exercise here is really,</v>

616
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>if you ever find that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>unresolved emotional experiences sitting</v>

617
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>in your subconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming tremendous amount of energy,</v>

618
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>take a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down,</v>

619
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and then burn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an ordinary fire,</v>

620
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.320
<v Speaker 1>how many times do you should do right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

621
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>depending on the emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's an intense experience,</v>

622
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you might have to write about it three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four times if it's not so intense,</v>

623
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe once or twice.</v>

624
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.350
<v Speaker 1>So just to wrap up over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

625
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.280
<v Speaker 1>to know yourself is one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts you can give yourself.</v>

626
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 1>It truly is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

627
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And most people don't really understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

628
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand what they want in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

629
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And therefore find it extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

630
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>What to focus that finite amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy on.</v>

631
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to leave you with two quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One from my group.</v>

632
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 1>The first one is proceed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

633
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proceed with confidence.</v>

634
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Believe in your ability to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in your life because you can.</v>

635
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you manifest something in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

636
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 1>You take your awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you focus it on that thing.</v>

637
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You know how to develop concentration</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you keep your awareness on it.</v>

638
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>When your awareness is on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where your energy is flowing.</v>

639
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>When the energy flows that it starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest in your life and believe in</v>

640
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>your ability to do that and proceed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

641
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

642
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is life is meant to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>live joyously.</v>

643
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It truly is and if you're not happy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

644
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.960
<v Speaker 1>then something needs to be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask most people what do they want</v>

645
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll always say to most people often</v>

646
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be happy.</v>

647
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Happiness should never be pursued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't pursue happiness.</v>

648
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Pursue a lifestyle that results in</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness and that's for me what I do.</v>

649
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I never chase happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pursue a lifestyle where the byproduct</v>

650
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:52.480
<v Speaker 1>or the lifestyle that's happened is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to find out what the lifestyle is,</v>

651
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what my purpose in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

652
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to spend time with myself each</v>

653
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 1>day to find out who and what's important</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

654
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Take that finite amount of energy that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have each day focusing into those things</v>

655
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 1>that starts to manifest in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The byproduct of that is happiness,</v>

656
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to say thank you and I want to</v>
