1
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I had the chance to meet with some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids in the program today.</v>

2
00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Where are you screaming at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I love those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I thought I would do,</v>

4
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>because they gave me a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to say whatever I want,</v>

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is offer you a little bit of</v>

6
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>some observations for your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have five little rules that you can</v>

7
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>follow as you find your spark and bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spark to life.</v>

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>The first is to go after the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

9
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a friend of mine and I,</v>

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>we went for a run in central park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roadrunners organization,</v>

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the weekends.</v>

12
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>They host races and it's very common at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the race they'll have a</v>

13
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>sponsor who will give away something</v>
<v Speaker 1>apples or bagels or something.</v>

14
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And on this particular day when we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the end of the run,</v>

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>there were some free bagels and they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>picnic tables set up.</v>

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And on one side was a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>volunteers on the table were boxes of</v>

17
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>bagels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other side was a long line of</v>

18
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>runners waiting to get their free Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said to my friend,</v>

19
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get a Bagel.</v>

20
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>that line's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>free Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

23
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to wait in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

24
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>free Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

25
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too long.</v>

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I realized that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>two ways to see the world.</v>

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Some people see the thing that they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people see the thing that</v>

28
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>prevents them from getting the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want.</v>

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I could only see the bagels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could only see the line.</v>

30
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And so I walked up to the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leaned in between two people,</v>

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>put my hand in the box and pulled out</v>
<v Speaker 1>two bagels and no one got mad at me</v>

32
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>because the rule is you can go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>

33
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot deny anyone else to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>after whatever they want.</v>

34
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I had to sacrifice choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to choose which Bagel I</v>

35
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got whatever I pulled out,</v>

36
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have to wait in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is is you don't have to</v>

37
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>wait in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do it the way</v>

38
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>everybody else has done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it your way,</v>

39
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you can break the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't get in the way of</v>

40
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>somebody else getting what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rule number one.</v>

41
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Rule number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked this one</v>

42
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 1>in the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something that spread across</v>

43
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Europe and eventually made its way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

44
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Fever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as the black death of child</v>

45
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically what was happening is women</v>

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.800
<v Speaker 1>were giving birth and they would die</v>
<v Speaker 1>within 48 hours after giving birth.</v>

47
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>This black death of childbirth was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ravage of Europe and it got worse and</v>

48
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse over the course of over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a century.</v>

49
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>In some hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was as high as 70 percent of women</v>

50
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>who gave birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would die as a result of giving</v>

51
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was the renaissance.</v>

52
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>This was the time of empirical data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

53
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and we had thrown away things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and mysticism.</v>

54
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>These were men of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were doctors and these doctors</v>

55
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that men of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to study and try and find the</v>

56
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:49.291
<v Speaker 1>reason for this black death of child bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they got to work studying and</v>

57
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:55.201
<v Speaker 1>they would study the corpses of the of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women who had died and in the</v>

58
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>morning they would conduct autopsies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in the afternoon they would go and</v>

59
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>deliver babies and finish their rounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't until somewhere in the mid</v>

60
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds that Dr Oliver Wendell</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holmes,</v>

61
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>father of Supreme Court justice Oliver</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wendell Holmes,</v>

62
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>realized that all of these doctors who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are conducting autopsies in the morning</v>

63
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>weren't washing their hands before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered babies in the afternoon and he</v>

64
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>pointed it out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

65
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>you're the problem.</v>

66
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And they ignored him and called him</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy for 30 years until finally</v>

67
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>somebody realized that if they simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>washed their hands,</v>

68
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>it would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened when</v>

69
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>they started sterilizing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>instruments in washing their hands,</v>

70
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>the black death of child bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

71
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesson here is sometimes your the</v>

72
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.714
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

73
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>We've seen this happen all too recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our new men of science and</v>

74
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.321
<v Speaker 1>empirical studiers and these men of</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance who are smarter than the rest of</v>

75
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>us until the thing collapse and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>blamed everything else except</v>

76
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my point is,</v>

77
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>is take accountability for your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take all the credit in the world</v>

78
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:27.841
<v Speaker 1>for the things that you do right as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you also take responsibility for the</v>

79
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>things you do wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be a balanced equation.</v>

80
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it one way and not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

81
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>You get to take credit when you also</v>
<v Speaker 1>take accountability.</v>

82
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>That's lesson two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lesson three,</v>

83
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>take care of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States Navy seals are perhaps</v>

84
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:52.321
<v Speaker 1>the most elite warriors in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the seals was asked who makes</v>

85
00:05:56.171 --> 00:06:01.171
<v Speaker 1>it through the selection process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is able to become a seal?</v>

86
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And his answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you the kind of person that</v>

87
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>becomes a seal.</v>

88
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you the kind of person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it through buds,</v>

89
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you the kind of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't become seals.</v>

90
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that show up with huge bulging</v>

91
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>muscles covered in tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to prove to the world how tough</v>

92
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them make it through.</v>

93
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preening leaders who like to</v>

94
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>delegate all their responsibility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never do anything themselves,</v>

95
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>none of them make it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

96
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the Star College athletes who've never</v>
<v Speaker 1>really been tested to the core of their</v>

97
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them make it through.</v>

98
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the guys that make it through</v>

99
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>are skinny and scrawny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

100
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>some of the guys that make it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see them shivering out of fear.</v>

101
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

102
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>all the guys that make it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they find themselves physically</v>

103
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>spent emotionally spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have nothing left to give</v>

104
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 1>physically or emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow some way,</v>

105
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.890
<v Speaker 1>they are able to find the energy to dig</v>
<v Speaker 1>down deep inside themselves to find the</v>

106
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help the guy next to them.</v>

107
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>They become seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

108
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you want to be an elite warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about how tough you are.</v>

109
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not about how smart you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about how fast you are.</v>

110
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be an elite warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better to get really,</v>

111
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>really good at helping the person to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left of you and helping the person to</v>

112
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>the right of you because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>people advance in the world.</v>

113
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>The world is too dangerous in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is too difficult for you to think that</v>

114
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you can do these things alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find your spark,</v>

115
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I commend you now who you going to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>for help and what are you going to</v>

116
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>accept?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help when it's offered.</v>

117
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Learn that skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn by practicing,</v>

118
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>helping each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be the single most valuable</v>

119
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 1>thing you ever learned in your entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>life to accept help when it's offered</v>

120
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and to ask for it.</v>

121
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>When you know that you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is when you learn to</v>

122
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>ask for help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll discover that there are people</v>

123
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>all around you who've always wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you.</v>

124
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't think you needed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you kept pretending that you had</v>

125
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>everything under control and the minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

126
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck.</v>

127
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can do this.</v>

128
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>You will find that lots of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>love you will rush in and take care of</v>

129
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that will only happen if you learn</v>

130
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 1>to take care of them</v>

131
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.453
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

132
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Less than four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson Mandela is a particularly special</v>

133
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:57.381
<v Speaker 1>case study in the leadership world</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is universally regarded as a</v>

134
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>great leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take other personalities and</v>

135
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>depending on the nation you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have different opinions about other</v>

136
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nelson Mandela across the world is</v>

137
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:12.081
<v Speaker 1>universally regarded as a great leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actually the son of a tribal</v>

138
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:17.511
<v Speaker 1>chief and he was asked one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you learn to be a great leader?</v>

139
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.740
<v Speaker 1>And he responded that he would go with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father to tribal meetings and he</v>

140
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>remembers to things when his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>would meet with other elders.</v>

141
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.250
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would always sit in a circle and to</v>

142
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>his father was always the last to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will be told your whole life that</v>

143
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you need to learn to be</v>

144
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 1>the last to speak.</v>

145
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I see it in boardrooms everyday of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

146
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Even people who consider themselves good</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders who may actually be decent</v>

147
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>leaders will walk into a room and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem,</v>

148
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm interested in your opinion.</v>

149
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's go around the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too late.</v>

150
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 1>The skill to hold your opinions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself until everyone has spoken does</v>

151
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

152
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>it gives everybody else the feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have been heard.</v>

153
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives everyone else the ability to feel</v>

154
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>that they have contributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two,</v>

155
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you get the benefit of hearing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else has to think before you</v>

156
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>render your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The skill is really to keep your</v>

157
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>opinions to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you agree with somebody,</v>

158
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>don't nod yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you disagree with somebody,</v>

159
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 1>don't not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simply sit there,</v>

160
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>take it all in and the only thing you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do is ask questions so that</v>

161
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you can understand what they mean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they have the opinion that they</v>

162
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must understand from where they are</v>

163
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they have the opinion they have,</v>

164
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>not just what they are saying and at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end you will get your turn.</v>

165
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It sounds easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not practice being the last to</v>

166
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Nelson Mandela did,</v>

167
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number five,</v>

168
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 1>monty python,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

169
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:08.611
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

170
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>three</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the other nerds in the audience.</v>

171
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>There's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>

172
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of all,</v>

173
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a former under secretary of</v>

174
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>defense who was invited to give a speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a large conference about a thousand</v>

175
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:36.171
<v Speaker 1>people and he was standing on the stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his cup of coffee in a Styrofoam</v>

176
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:41.991
<v Speaker 1>Cup giving his prepared remarks but his</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerpoint behind him and he took a sip</v>

177
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>of his coffee and he smiled and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked down at the coffee and then he</v>

178
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>went off script and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 1>last year I spoke at this exact same</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference last year.</v>

180
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I was still the under secretary and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke here last year,</v>

181
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>they flew me here business class and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I arrived at the airport there was</v>

182
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>somebody waiting for me to take me to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel and they took me to my hotel and</v>

183
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>they had already checked me in and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just took me up to my room and the next</v>

184
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>morning I came downstairs and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone waiting in the lobby to greet me</v>

185
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 1>and they drove me to this here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same venue.</v>

186
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>They took me through the back entrance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and took me into the green room and</v>

187
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>handed me a coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cup of coffee in a beautiful ceramic</v>

188
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

189
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm no longer the under secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew here,</v>

190
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a taxi to my hotel and I checked</v>

191
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:36.430
<v Speaker 1>myself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I came down the lobby this morning,</v>

192
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I took another taxi to this venue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in the front door and found my</v>

193
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>way back stage and when I asked someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any coffee?</v>

194
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>He pointed to the coffee machine in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner and I poured myself a cup of</v>

195
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>coffee into this here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Styrofoam Cup.</v>

196
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesson is,</v>

197
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the Ceramic Cup was never meant for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was meant for the position I held.</v>

198
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I deserve a Styrofoam Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this,</v>

199
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 1>as you gain fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you gain fortune,</v>

200
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 1>as you gain position and seniority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will treat you better.</v>

201
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>They will hold doors open for you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will get you a cup of tea and</v>

202
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 1>coffee without you even asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will call you sir and Ma'am and</v>

203
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>they will give you stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that stuff has meant for you.</v>

204
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 1>That stuff has meant for the position</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold.</v>

205
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It has meant for the level that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved of leader or success or</v>

206
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:39.331
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will always deserve a Styrofoam</v>

207
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

208
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Remember that lesson of humility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude.</v>

209
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You can accept all the free stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can accept all the perks.</v>

210
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely you can enjoy them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just be grateful for them and know</v>

211
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:59.071
<v Speaker 1>that they're not for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting off the Esella.</v>

212
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I took the Esella from New York to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC and I got off the train</v>

213
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else and I was walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the platform like everyone else and</v>

214
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:13.831
<v Speaker 1>I walked past general nordies Schwartz</v>
<v Speaker 1>who used to be the chief of staff of the</v>

215
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 1>United States air force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the air force,</v>

216
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and here I did you see a guy in a suit</v>
<v Speaker 1>schlepping his own suitcase down the</v>

217
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:29.611
<v Speaker 1>platform just like me and just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago he was flying on private jets</v>

218
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and eight an entourage and other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried his luggage,</v>

219
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but he no longer held the position and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now he got to drag his own suitcase</v>

220
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.673
<v Speaker 1>and never did it.</v>

221
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Sort of remind me more that none of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve the perks that we get.</v>

222
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.700
<v Speaker 1>We all deserve a Styrofoam Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure meeting you guys this</v>

223
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away by your honesty and</v>

224
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:58.031
<v Speaker 1>your curiosity and your poise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am confident that the future is</v>

225
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>bright despite the fact that America</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like an absolute mess right now.</v>

226
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I am confident that the future is bright</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one reason and one reason only</v>

227
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 1>because you will grow up and you will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>our future.</v>

228
