1
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Be Open to experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be willing to try new things.</v>

2
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Don't have a rigid plan except random</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts of hospitality without judgment or</v>

3
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to wander.</v>

4
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to eat a bad meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>if you don't risk the Bab Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never get the magical one,</v>

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>but are the most important to be humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be grateful.</v>

7
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Be Aware of the fact that you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the stupidest person in the</v>

8
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>room as far as you were the least</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared,</v>

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>at least equipped person to know who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really in charge of what's really going</v>

10
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I made maybe before I started</v>

11
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the human race as a whole</v>

12
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>could and would turn on itself at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

14
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venal petty,</v>

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

16
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's true with all of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in this world,</v>

17
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:06.171
<v Speaker 1>but I need mostly pretty nice people</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the best they can.</v>

18
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Often under very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult conditions.</v>

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I met a lot of very nice people who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done very,</v>

20
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>very bad things that conflict with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply held</v>

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of justice or sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality or acceptable practice or</v>

22
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>religious views.</v>

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of gray areas in travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>but I think that on balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is filled with people doing</v>

26
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>the best they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 1>we love their kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to,</v>

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on a clean shirt every morning and</v>

29
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>live their lives in the little dignity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have access to food and water.</v>

30
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

31
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>just like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uninhibited.</v>

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Creative freedom is something that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been incredibly fortunate to have for</v>

33
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>the better part of my entire television</v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Unlike anyone else I know of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

35
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I've been free to do whatever I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the shows I want,</v>

36
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>anywhere I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with whom I want it in any style I want.</v>

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first I don't know any other way and</v>

38
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>by now I won't have it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is good.</v>

39
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Why settle for less?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the same token,</v>

40
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>when you're given that much freedom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

41
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you have essentially no interference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but support behind you.</v>

42
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you don't want to do is get lazy</v>

43
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and bored and sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

44
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.501
<v Speaker 1>I'd much rather not make tv at all or</v>
<v Speaker 1>make even unsuccessful tv that make</v>

45
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>competent television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to make a conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel or food show at this point.</v>

47
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like shooting corn.</v>

48
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.971
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shot sequence at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of limited a terminology.</v>

49
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>how all of their little pieces work</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have to start and where you</v>

51
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>have to add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I detest competent workman like</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and I'm always very,</v>

53
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Times that we,</v>

54
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

55
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very unhappy with that.</v>

56
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather I'd rather fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

57
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been fired many times by in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking career.</v>

58
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been fired a number of times.</v>

59
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.971
<v Speaker 1>I was not a particularly good chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of problems at various</v>

60
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>points in my career with narcotics.</v>

61
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

62
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I was very deservedly a fired on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of occasions.</v>

63
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

64
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

65
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accepted failure as a chef because I</v>

66
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>was at various times a bad chef or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad person</v>

67
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I fail,</v>

68
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it's because I tried to do something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not succeed or I,</v>

69
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I just was not able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>what I hope to do or wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I tried to do something that is</v>

71
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>clearly in retrospect didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would much rather than that I</v>

72
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>would much rather fail gloriously then</v>
<v Speaker 1>not venture,</v>

73
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
<v Speaker 1>not try.</v>

74
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

75
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in competent making,</v>

76
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stories with,</v>

77
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Speaker 1>with competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at them with some style and</v>

78
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:06.591
<v Speaker 1>originality and some creativity that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me and the people I work</v>

79
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there have been times that,</v>

80
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has resulted in failure,</v>

81
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>a beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

82
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.390
<v Speaker 1>It didn't communicate anything like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to.</v>

83
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Often the story I think I'm going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up being another story entirely</v>

84
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:29.391
<v Speaker 1>that's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very different.</v>

85
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.510
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are other times where I just</v>

86
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:34.321
<v Speaker 1>failed miserably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do with cecily shell again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was not good.</v>

88
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It did not capture the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did not,</v>

89
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't show us anything of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

90
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>it did not live up to its subtlety and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty of its subject.</v>

91
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are,</v>

92
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 1>there are shows where some people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to hate it.</v>

93
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 1>They just don't like the style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's self indulgent.</v>

94
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>They don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of failure.</v>

95
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:01.424
<v Speaker 1>I like</v>

96
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.673
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

97
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Speaker 1>a powerful reaction one way or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

98
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely preferable to me than</v>

99
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>pleasing everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

100
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>if every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I walk into a room where everybody</v>

101
00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>agrees with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that frightening and dismayed and</v>

102
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>pouring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking my answer.</v>

103
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.390
<v Speaker 1>That question stems from my history is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an addict.</v>

104
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot of other addicts look in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror every day and did not see</v>

105
00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:33.231
<v Speaker 1>somebody worth saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even at my worst,</v>

106
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.670
<v Speaker 1>there was a level of vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I look in the mirror and saw</v>

107
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:42.210
<v Speaker 1>somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody deep in there,</v>

108
00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:45.120
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how low I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my circumstances,</v>

109
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a high enough opinion of myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought,</v>

110
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

111
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>it's worth going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people in a similar</v>

112
00:06:56.251 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>situation for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in the mirror and see somebody</v>

113
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>unworthy of good things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and allow themselves or excuse</v>

114
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 1>a downward spiral because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe</v>

115
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 1>in their basic work I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

116
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same drive that allows</v>

117
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 1>me to tell stories in books and on tv</v>
<v Speaker 1>because let's face it,</v>

118
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:36.681
<v Speaker 1>anybody who writes a book or ged with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion that they have a story worth</v>

119
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>telling that people might want to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

120
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>You're really already by definition now</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sort of an aberrant personality and a</v>

121
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:48.300
<v Speaker 1>monster of self regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very reasonable attitude.</v>

122
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I have a unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a story that you will want to</v>

123
00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 1>listen to for 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would any reasonable?</v>

124
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And I might make a living doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might even want to pay for that</v>

125
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the point that I could make a living</v>

126
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>doing that rather than washing dishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

127
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.530
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or preparing meals</v>

128
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes something and I don't know</v>

129
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:16.300
<v Speaker 1>whether that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.760
<v Speaker 1>that's often a very much at odds with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

131
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a functioning well rounded good</v>

132
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.120
<v Speaker 1>person in the conventional sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that kind of vanity and narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self regard,</v>

134
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.910
<v Speaker 1>self importance and cheerful willingness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to examine your and share your feelings.</v>

135
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.893
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

136
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I think Fran Liebowitz said at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

137
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're sharing your feelings,</v>

139
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sharing that's leaking.</v>

140
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>When that book came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was immediately a best seller and it</v>

141
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>changed my life overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overnight.</v>

142
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I was desperately and debt</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't paid my rent on time.</v>

143
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>had owed Amex for 10 years without</v>

144
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>making a single payment owed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The irs hadn't even filed,</v>

145
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>was in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

146
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:13.881
<v Speaker 1>very insecure place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At Age 44.</v>

147
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly people were offering me things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering the opportunities.</v>

148
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I think if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was old enough and I fucked up enough</v>

149
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>already that I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I realize this is a lucky break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was unlikely to get another,</v>

151
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choices</v>

152
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>in that environment was very determined</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not fuck up.</v>

153
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go for easy money.</v>

154
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grab the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not</v>

155
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>give food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>network the show they wanted</v>

156
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 1>and I said no a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what seemed like a lot of money.</v>

157
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Well look what's good for you in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>short run is not necessarily good for</v>

158
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:05.294
<v Speaker 1>you in the long run.</v>

159
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 1>You know you're starting out as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>

160
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You've written one book and somebody got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a TV show and somebody offers you a</v>

161
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>million dollars to represent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>antidiarrhea medication.</v>

162
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of money in the short run,</v>

163
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but you're always going to be that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the shits.</v>

164
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm admittedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very contradictory impulses here.</v>

165
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm old school and a lot of ways I think</v>

166
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you should at least know how to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>beef Bourguignon correctly according to</v>

167
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the original recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the degree that anything can be</v>

168
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you should know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.740
<v Speaker 1>some dishes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a conduit or a traditional Italian</v>

171
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>pastas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get really pissy if people riff on</v>

172
00:10:58.711 --> 00:10:59.101
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you put chicken in a carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you lost me,</v>

174
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:07.491
<v Speaker 1>it's unforgivable sin against God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

175
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys who came out of Blues and R and</v>

177
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

178
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.040
<v Speaker 1>who turned out to be Jimi Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>there are people who can riff on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvise on classics and create whole</v>

180
00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:25.060
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful worlds.</v>

181
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And what is authentic is mostly meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>

182
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.490
<v Speaker 1>When the tomato is not authentic Italian</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it came from the new world of</v>

183
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Chinese food is always evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was protective.</v>

184
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>It instinctively hostile to new as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a.</v>

185
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I know too many really creative chefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I understand the changing world.</v>

186
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess is the benchmark for the.</v>

187
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to mess with a classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you making something more dazzling</v>

188
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me and how smart I am?</v>

189
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Or are you in some way improving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is it pleasurable?</v>

190
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Is it chicken Caesar more pleasurable</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a plain Cesar?</v>

191
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I think not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the chicken takes away,</v>

192
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm relentlessly,</v>

193
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>pathologically a punctual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

194
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that comes from all those years</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a chef that is a,</v>

195
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 1>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a cook,</v>

196
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you showed up late as a cook?</v>

197
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 1>You're letting your people down in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tangible way.</v>

198
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else has to physically do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

199
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>do the setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you lose the shift or you get fired</v>

200
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>as a chef cooks and showed up late who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are disorganized.</v>

201
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't keep a lot of stuff going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in their heads.</v>

202
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>They failed and when they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all went down with them.</v>

203
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>So I am a relentlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 1>possibly either unhealthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 1>anal retentive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive,</v>

207
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up after my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm cooking,</v>

209
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm cleaning up after myself constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep things organized.</v>

210
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I write lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep my schedule up to date.</v>

211
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I am never late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as part of that,</v>

212
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>if I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to meet you tomorrow at 12</v>

213
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>minutes after five to see John Wick</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

214
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be there at five.</v>

215
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hanging out across the street,</v>

216
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 1>discreetly observing to see what time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up and I'll be making some very</v>

217
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>important decisions based on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrival time.</v>

218
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a curse and a blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think everything important I ever</v>

219
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that I learned as a,</v>

220
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a dishwasher and as a cook,</v>

221
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up on time,</v>

222
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

223
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay organized and clean up after</v>

224
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 1>yourself or you think about the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work with.</v>

225
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:50.120
<v Speaker 1>You respect the people you work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

226
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the best you can.</v>
