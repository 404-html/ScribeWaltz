1
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're socially shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you're socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious?</v>

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>You go to a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart's beating,</v>

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>why the party is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Because it's judging you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging you.</v>

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's putting you low down the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because that's what a negative</v>

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>judgment is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that interferes with your sexual</v>

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>soul success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you're being harshly</v>

9
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>evaluated by nature itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>So you are confronting that the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos when you go into the social</v>

11
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do?</v>

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You'd like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You hunch over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's low dominance.</v>

14
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to get you very far,</v>

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a logical thing to do in,</v>

17
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of a tyrant.</v>

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'm no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>you look at the king and your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no threat.</v>

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm hunched over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what's happening internally?</v>

21
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>How are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are people thinking about me?</v>

22
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>What are people thinking about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or am I looking stupid?</v>

23
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Am I looking foolish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

24
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate being here,</v>

25
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sweating too much.</v>

26
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>It's all internalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's all self focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

28
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>the eye isn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eye isn't working.</v>

29
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>What do you tell people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

30
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop thinking about yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't,</v>

31
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like don't think of a white</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant,</v>

32
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>white elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white elephant,</v>

33
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>white elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell someone to stop thinking</v>

34
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>about something because they get caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the loop.</v>

35
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>What you do with socially anxious people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

36
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>look at other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>

37
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

38
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell what they're thinking and</v>

39
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

40
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're terribly socialized and</v>

41
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have no social skills and so</v>

42
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the reason they can't go to a party is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they don't even know how to</v>

43
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>introduce themselves.</v>

44
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one ever taught them how to behave.</v>

45
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>And so they're really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates for behavior therapy cause</v>

46
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:05.811
<v Speaker 1>you walk them through the process of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually manifest the procedures</v>

47
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with social</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptability.</v>

48
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>But most people aren't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the ability.</v>

49
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>So if they're really introverted in high</v>
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism,</v>

50
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>they can usually talk quite well to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

51
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>One on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

52
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Because they look at them on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at you,</v>

53
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>it's another thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're ever speaking to a group of</v>

54
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never speak to the group of people that</v>

55
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk to individuals and then they</v>

56
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>reflect for you the entire group because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all in trained.</v>

57
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So you look at one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they broadcast you what everyone's</v>

58
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking and you know how to talk to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

59
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you focus on the person,</v>

60
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>not you push your attention outward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your,</v>

61
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I push your attention outward and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start watching.</v>

62
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Well then all your automatic mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick in and you start being awkward.</v>

63
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause if we're talking and I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

64
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're gonna do next</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to put disjunctions into</v>

65
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a bad chords and the melody</v>

66
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our conversation.</v>

67
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is I'm not paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

68
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the I is the thing at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the pyramid.</v>

69
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing that enables you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win the set of all possible dominance</v>

70
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies is the I pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>

71
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the Egyptians worshiped</v>

72
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why horace was the thing that</v>

73
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.661
<v Speaker 1>rescued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the,</v>

75
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>from the depths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the capacity to pay attention.</v>

76
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you pay attention to most?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

77
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Your right hemisphere signals as</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous.</v>

78
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>It attracts your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this isn't going quite right.</v>

79
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking at that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you look at.</v>

80
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's not going right,</v>

81
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that's the terrible monster that</v>

82
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>might eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the place you get all the</v>

83
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it's useful to have</v>

84
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>discussions with your enemies because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you things you do not</v>

85
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's such a great thing because if</v>

86
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very smart,</v>

87
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.300
<v Speaker 1>there may be a time when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere this,</v>

89
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing you need to know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your enemy will tell you why</v>

90
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you're such a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>on a bunch of other things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>true too.</v>

92
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>But even one thing that's accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

93
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much man.</v>

94
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll do some work on that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have to carry that forward.</v>

95
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's part of the reason again</v>

96
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>why the terrible predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the terrible Predator that</v>

97
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>has the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the person who delivers</v>

98
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>the message you do not want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's rough,</v>

99
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

100
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Life is rough</v>

101
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.290
<v Speaker 2>to move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

102
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've dealt with lots of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have anxiety disorders,</v>

103
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing about people who have</v>

104
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:47.360
<v Speaker 2>anxiety disorders is they are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious to me.</v>

105
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem for me to understand why</v>

106
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:55.490
<v Speaker 2>people have anxiety disorders or why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're depressed or why they have</v>

107
00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 2>substance use problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mystery to me is always why people</v>

108
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Speaker 2>don't have all of those things at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody has a reason to be</v>

109
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:04.370
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

110
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.520
<v Speaker 2>we have the ultimate reason to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious because we know that we're</v>

111
00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:09.440
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and we know that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>

112
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And how you can not be anxious under</v>
<v Speaker 2>those circumstances is a great mystery.</v>

113
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that same thing applies with regards</v>

114
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 2>to depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the same thing applies to some</v>

115
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 2>degree with regards to drug and alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>

116
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 2>As I said last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of reasons to drown your</v>

117
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

118
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Speaker 2>We could refer to the aforementioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and depression not least.</v>

119
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the and the sorts of drugs that</v>

120
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:38.750
<v Speaker 2>people are prone to take our chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that take the aspect of edge off the</v>

121
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

122
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.610
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to back to the issue of,</v>

123
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 2>of of fear being Abraham is self</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious if that's what this commentary</v>

124
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:53.930
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is as he moves forward,</v>

125
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 2>despite that he's self conscious and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows the danger but he moves despite</v>

126
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually the appropriate</v>

127
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:05.171
<v Speaker 2>response in the face of actual non naive</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what constitutes life.</v>

128
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're naive and you move</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

129
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.371
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

130
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.890
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you even know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

131
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no courage in naivety because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what there is to stop</v>

132
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

133
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what dangers you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>apprehend,</v>

134
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 2>but to be aware of what it is that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>

135
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>So to be alert existentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

136
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 2>or to be fully self conscious means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're perfectly aware of your</v>

137
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 2>limitations and how you might be hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to make the decision to move</v>

138
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 2>forward into the unknown in the land of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stranger.</v>

139
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

140
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's one of the secrets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good life and I can say that really</v>

141
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>without fear of contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

142
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I would say because the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on this is very,</v>

143
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear.</v>

144
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>What you do with people who are afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to some degree depressed,</v>

145
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.370
<v Speaker 2>but certainly anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you lay out what,</v>

146
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>what they're anxious about first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in detail,</v>

147
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you're afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what might happen?</v>

148
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you decompose it into small</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

149
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically manageable problems.</v>

150
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the person expose</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to the thing that they're</v>

151
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens isn't that they get</v>

152
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what the clinical literature</v>

153
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>indicates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

154
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>What happens instead is they get braver</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the same thing,</v>

155
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you get less afraid,</v>

156
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the world isn't as dangerous as I</v>

157
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

158
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>silly me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get braver,</v>

159
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 2>that's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is,</v>

160
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the World Damn worlds just as dangerous</v>

161
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 2>as I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe it's even more dangerous than I</v>

162
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that there's something</v>

163
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 2>in me that responds to taking that on as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a voluntary challenge and grows and</v>

164
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>thrives as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no doubt about this.</v>

165
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Even the psychophysiological findings</v>
<v Speaker 2>are quite clear if you,</v>

166
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you impose a stressor on two groups</v>

167
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 2>of people and on one group the stressor</v>
<v Speaker 2>is imposed involuntarily and on the</v>

168
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>other group the stressor is picked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>

169
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 2>The people who pick up the stressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary voluntarily use a whole</v>

170
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 2>different psychophysiological system to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with it.</v>

171
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>They use the system that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with approach and challenge and not the</v>

172
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>system that's a pro associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive aggression and withdrawal and</v>

173
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>the system that is associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge is much more associated with</v>

174
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and much less</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with negative emotion.</v>

175
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It's also much less hard on you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the defensive posturing system,</v>

176
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>the prey animal system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man would not thing kicks in.</v>

177
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 2>It's all systems are go for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

178
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gas is pushed down to the or the</v>

179
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 2>pedal is pushed down to the metal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brakes are on.</v>

180
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You're using future resources that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be storing for future time right</v>

181
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>now in the present to ready yourself for</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency.</v>

182
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

183
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing simple or trivial at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of being called to move</v>

184
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>forthrightly forward into the strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the unknown.</v>

185
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And there's real adventure that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with that.</v>

186
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an exciting thing,</v>

187
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason why people</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel and then also to see yourself as</v>

188
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the sort of creature that can do that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do that on a habitual basis</v>

189
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.490
<v Speaker 2>is also the right kind of tonic for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate this word for your self esteem,</v>

190
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the self esteem has nothing to</v>

191
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>do with feeling good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>

192
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 2>as I already mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't necessarily a reason why a</v>

193
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>priority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just feel good about</v>

194
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can view yourself acting in a</v>

195
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>courageous and forthright manner and</v>
<v Speaker 2>encountering the world and trying to</v>

196
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>improve your lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

197
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>and taking risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 2>in a non naive way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have something that you</v>

199
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 2>can comfort yourself with at night when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wondering what the whole damn</v>

200
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>point of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your few tiled and miserable life.</v>

201
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's necessary because it's often</v>

202
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 2>the case that you wake up at four in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

203
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>or at least sometimes the case that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up at four in the morning when</v>

204
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>things haven't been going that well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder just what the hell the point is</v>

205
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 2>of your few and miserable life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have something real to set</v>

206
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be just rationalizations about</v>

207
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 2>how you're a valuable person among</v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

208
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 2>even though that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good enough.</v>

209
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.360
<v Speaker 2>You need something that's more realistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>to set against that and observing</v>

210
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.480
<v Speaker 2>courage in yourself is definitely one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that that that could help you</v>

211
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 2>sleep soundly at night when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things are destabilized a little</v>

212
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 2>bit around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
