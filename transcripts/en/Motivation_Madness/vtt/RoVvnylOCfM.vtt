1
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And this is probably good human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice,</v>

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>not just entrepreneur and startup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>investor advice.</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>What I learned from Wine Library TV is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the following,</v>

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the true story of Wine Library TV was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day that I thought I was going to</v>

5
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>start it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to do something</v>

6
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>similar to Qvc and I don't know if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a qvc or shopping network in</v>

7
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but QBC and America,</v>

8
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a show and they sell stuff through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV.</v>

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to do the qvc of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>The first episode of that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that camera went on and that light</v>

11
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that this was going to be on</v>

12
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the Internet forever and that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to just pedal wine.</v>

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I decided I wanted to be a value to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in learning about wine because I</v>

14
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>was scared that if I was peddling</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe in that somebody would</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to me at a party and say,</v>

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>do you like this?</v>

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

18
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.354
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

19
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking said it was awesome.</v>

20
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>A one liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a scam artist.</v>

21
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

22
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was very focused on leveling up and</v>

23
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that one great piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice,</v>

24
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>if you want to take anything from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

25
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.841
<v Speaker 1>is we have to start realizing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving and doing things in business</v>

26
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>without expectation of return from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other individual is probably the</v>

27
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>greatest leverage that you could ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>deploy in your business life.</v>

28
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Though it is extremely rare in today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>business environment and it has</v>

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>absolutely been the bedrock of what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed me to win all my engagement,</v>

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>all my selfies right over there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>signing books,</v>

31
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>all the content I have nothing to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a book that I fucking sell once</v>

32
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>every three years for $13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not about monetizing an</v>

33
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

34
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's about building leverage to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand versus sales.</v>

35
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest things that I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on right now in digital media is</v>

36
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have a lot of people doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>branding and marketing.</v>

37
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of people doing sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason so many of you were confused</v>

38
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>by the value of snapchat is because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the digital landscape,</v>

39
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>we now think transactional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's about what's the Roi of</v>

40
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>every piece of content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single action,</v>

41
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the last attribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the conversion rates?</v>

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>It's all become math based and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine because I love sales more than</v>

43
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I promise you these fucking guys,</v>

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Nike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need tagged me on a browser and</v>

45
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>then re cookie me and then travel all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the Internet and pound me with</v>

46
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>banner ads until I gave up and bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I bought it because they fucking market</v>
<v Speaker 1>into me over the last 20 years and I</v>

48
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.801
<v Speaker 1>don't even fucking know why I buy it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is a very important point</v>

49
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>because what we're living through is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time where people are just being very</v>

50
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:49.041
<v Speaker 1>transactional and conversion based when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything continues to get arbitraged.</v>

51
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Another thought that I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people here have gone to the</v>

52
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>life that I've gone to over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months?</v>

53
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I no longer have a laptop or an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now only live through my mobile</v>

54
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people are on that level doing</v>

55
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands.</v>

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot and this is like think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conference.</v>

57
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I really think that this trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that if I came back here in</v>

58
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 50,</v>

59
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the hands in this room</v>

60
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>would go up to that following question</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm completely fascinated by it and</v>

61
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>then for everybody in the room that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>building businesses on the Internet,</v>

62
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>the thought of what's happening in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing page optimization or the Ui and</v>

63
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Ux of your product in a desktop</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment I think is in the beginning</v>

64
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>stages of being disrupted and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I really spent most of my time in</v>

65
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>which is what's the attention arbitrage?</v>

66
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Where do I think your eyes and ears are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be before you do and how do I</v>

67
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>go and land grab and buy up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>property and how do I then deploy and</v>

68
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>build the best houses on that property</v>
<v Speaker 1>through content.</v>

69
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>That is the pattern of my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2006,</v>

70
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I felt this social media thing was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be really big and in 2007,</v>

71
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've laid my foundation and by 2007 and</v>

72
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>eight I invested in facebook and Tumbler</v>
<v Speaker 1>and twitter and things of that nature</v>

73
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and I did quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also use them to tell my story,</v>

74
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>sell my wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do my thing.</v>

75
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I think this is super important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand because I think we also</v>

76
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>decide that things are emerging too</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

77
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>This is not just being first mover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people like to give me credit.</v>

78
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you predicted all this stuff.</v>

79
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>You were sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be on the record forever.</v>

80
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people here recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been predicted.</v>

81
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

82
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:30.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

83
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Domus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've done well is I've moved</v>

84
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>quickly once you actually started using</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

85
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't predict twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't right about snapchat.</v>

86
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snapchat two years ago when I first</v>

87
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>started talking about it already had</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of users.</v>

88
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>There was real people using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not predicting anything.</v>

89
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably very few people in this</v>

90
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>room there are paying as much attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anchor to peach,</v>

91
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>to all these platforms as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not putting all my content or</v>

92
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>all my time and I'm also not crippled by</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting my time and effort into</v>

93
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>platforms before they have a 100 or $200</v>
<v Speaker 1>million users.</v>

94
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you remember that five</v>

95
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four years ago were Social Cam got big?</v>

96
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

97
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>so three nerds.</v>

98
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Social Cam got big for three minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the facebook newsfeed juiced it</v>

99
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>and it had a lot of users and it was hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>for four months,</v>

100
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used it feverish Lee and use it a lot.</v>

101
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>It collapsed and meant nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during that period I learned so much</v>

102
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 1>about mobile video and the cadence of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how people interacted with it that</v>

103
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>when vine came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half later and then</v>

104
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>instagram video and then snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd already put in the work and had the</v>

105
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>learnings from human behavior that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>deployed against the next thing.</v>

106
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 1>There are way too many people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room that do not do actions because</v>

107
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>crippled by the short term results</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus what it means in the long term,</v>

108
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>and this goes to marketing and this goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to running your business and this comes</v>

109
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>down to what I probably want to spend a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few more minutes on right now,</v>

110
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>which is my friends.</v>

111
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in here that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>startup founders.</v>

112
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>That should not be my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are a lot of people in here that</v>

113
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>work at agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should not be.</v>

114
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>They should be probably switched and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice versa and different things.</v>

115
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving me right now in my life is the</v>

116
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>untold depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the untold suicides.</v>

117
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>To just get dark for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun to talk about,</v>

118
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are lacking self awareness in this</v>

119
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:45.281
<v Speaker 1>space in a very substantial way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are about</v>

120
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>to be met with a lot of disappointment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are struggling.</v>

121
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>How many people are an entrepreneur in</v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

122
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys and gals know this isn't easy.</v>

123
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to work for somebody.</v>

124
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you get the blame the boss,</v>

125
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>she and he is an Asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>

126
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>When you're an entrepreneur where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody else behind you,</v>

127
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>it's on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one thing we're not talking about is</v>

128
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>the level of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks they have to build</v>

129
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>fucking Uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks they have to make</v>

130
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable what we've done and I</v>

131
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely want to make sure that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to have real conversations</v>

132
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>making $100,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 year euros.</v>

133
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>That's massively successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to recalibrate what success</v>

134
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>looks like in our space because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing through the branding of what</v>

135
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very impractical,</v>

136
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 1>very high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low return results for so many</v>

137
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's shooting for 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion guys.</v>

138
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>There's like four apps that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like Uber and Instagram,</v>

139
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>like how many fucking billion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies do you think there are?</v>

140
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I really am passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to reframe the conversation</v>

141
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>about the number one thing that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed in my 20 years of my success.</v>

142
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Because let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sucked shit at almost everything.</v>

143
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>What I've done well is I've deployed</v>
<v Speaker 1>self awareness around what I am and I</v>

144
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>know what I am and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I wish I was seven years ago as a</v>

145
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.091
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I had plenty of leverage in the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point.</v>

147
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media movement.</v>

148
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the 20 most follow people</v>

149
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go and raise $40,000,000 to</v>

150
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>build the next facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't raise $50 million dollars to</v>

151
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>build a platform around wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was self aware enough even though I</v>

152
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>had all the opportunity in the world to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build product that I wasn't going to be</v>

153
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:41.471
<v Speaker 1>successful seven years ago I went out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and built a boring digital agency.</v>

154
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I built something practical.</v>

155
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>All My internet friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all a lot of the people can be on the</v>

156
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made fun of me.</v>

157
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go build a big company or</v>

158
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>something grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I built what I knew I could build.</v>

159
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud that over the last four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years I've grown vaynermedia from three</v>

160
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>to $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars a year in revenue,</v>

161
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 1>not fucking valuation</v>

162
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

163
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who gives a shit?</v>

164
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>What I'm way more worried about than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've done is what you're going to</v>

165
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I implore you,</v>

166
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fancy.</v>

167
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievable.</v>

168
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the nicest setup still</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference I've ever seen.</v>

169
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's clap it up for these guys.</v>

170
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:28.094
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable,</v>

171
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking</v>

172
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.460
<v Speaker 1>food trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like sunny and shit.</v>

173
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

174
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>what I did well was I just didn't give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit when I'm.</v>

175
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 1>When I'm old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 40.</v>

176
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.170
<v Speaker 1>When I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>

177
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>like being a good student was the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

178
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I was making $3,000 a weekend selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball cards and getting D's and f's</v>

179
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and everybody thought I was a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the narrative was.</v>

180
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it's reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was in school now making three,</v>

181
00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:05.750
<v Speaker 1>$4,000 a weekend as a 13 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been the next big thing,</v>

182
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through it and I did not succumb</v>

183
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>to the current thing that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in America was the right thing,</v>

184
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:14.900
<v Speaker 1>which was go to the best school you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could go to.</v>

185
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I understood who I was and I went in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>in on my strengths and I employ a lot of</v>

186
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you to do that.</v>

187
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people sitting in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room that want to be the number one CEO</v>

188
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were the seventh employee of</v>

189
00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd much rather be number 41 at</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

191
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>the number one of facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think we're seeing that and so</v>

192
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to stand up here and I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

193
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:43.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that I wish I</v>

194
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>was different at as matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to let's be very matter right now.</v>

195
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that I wish I didn't curse</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage?</v>

196
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't share my content.</v>

197
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't like me because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I didn't do it.</v>

198
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I just can't be anything that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I implore you,</v>

199
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about what school right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what we're all focused on or what</v>

200
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:06.830
<v Speaker 1>your momma wants you to be.</v>

201
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.720
<v Speaker 1>You need to go home from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>

202
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.910
<v Speaker 1>You'll be inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be cool people.</v>

203
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.180
<v Speaker 1>There's interesting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you with the bottom of</v>

204
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:17.330
<v Speaker 1>my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is fundamentally irrelevant if you</v>

205
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Speaker 1>don't know who the fuck you are and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker you can start forcing yourself</v>

206
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 1>to understanding what role you play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one.</v>

207
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Number seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PR,</v>

208
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>marketing product you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be somebody else.</v>

209
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was the quarterback of the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York jets.</v>

210
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if I could accomplish one,</v>

211
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being very realistic.</v>

212
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very transparent with you.</v>

213
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.660
<v Speaker 1>This little seven minute rant that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just came up with.</v>

214
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to reach one person like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not so easy.</v>

215
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:53.831
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have the ego and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>humility at equal ends to figure</v>

216
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I promise you,</v>

217
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>as I've looked across the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've looked at 25,</v>

218
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>50,000 startups at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

219
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I have now spent the last 40 years of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life with the Toyotas and the pepsis and</v>

220
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>the gi biggest brands enrolled myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my inner circle,</v>

221
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the one connection point from corporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>America to startup to vc to</v>

222
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one connection point is self</v>

223
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you start understanding yourself,</v>

224
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>once you start actually executing on who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually are versus who you wish you</v>

225
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things start to change very quickly,</v>

226
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.840
<v Speaker 1>and so the reason I'm passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this as this is always very worldly</v>

227
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 1>advice and is probably historically</v>
<v Speaker 1>always good things to talk about.</v>

228
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I just feel that if any of you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid attention to the macro economic</v>

229
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure of what's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our space right now,</v>

230
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>this nirvana that we've lived through</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the last six or seven years is about</v>

231
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 1>to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>

232
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

233
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I wish it was nirvana forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like everybody else during the down</v>

234
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are able to win are the</v>

235
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>ones that are most in tune with</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

236
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are the most practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

237
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>to make this valuable to you in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

238
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a startup,</v>

239
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>please start understanding how you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make money as soon as possible.</v>

240
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>You're running a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running a business.</v>

241
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Businesses need to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's no money to fund</v>

242
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you based on your last valuation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

243
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>as a human being sitting at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference,</v>

244
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 1>this is all very encompassing and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting,</v>

245
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 1>but start chipping away against what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you want and start really looking</v>

246
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 1>at what you bring to the table because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quicker you figure that out,</v>

247
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the more successful you will have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An number three,</v>

248
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 1>please start understanding how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide value without expectation in</v>

249
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

250
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It is unbelievable to me how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>already tonight we've super five</v>

251
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

252
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 1>eight people giving me something as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

253
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but really expecting something in return</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that give.</v>

254
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Humans can feel that it's not the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and we really need to start thinking</v>

255
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And number four,</v>

256
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 1>understand the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very ironic given my</v>

257
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 1>concerns about where the market's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll end with this in lieu of all of</v>

258
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing that we're living</v>

259
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:25.111
<v Speaker 1>through has just started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consumer web is only 20 years old.</v>

260
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Windows 95 kind of started this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet thing is very new.</v>

261
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we all talk about didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist 10 years ago over the next 10</v>

262
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest companies in the world from</v>

263
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Europe and Asia and us from anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because we are now at scale.</v>

264
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.350
<v Speaker 1>The biggest companies in the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be created over the next 20</v>

265
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>years from zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people sitting in this room</v>

266
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:57.731
<v Speaker 1>right now that are going to build the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next major company and so we are all so</v>

267
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.981
<v Speaker 1>blessed that we are actually human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings during this period where there is</v>

268
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.010
<v Speaker 1>so much upside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much opportunity and so everything</v>

269
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:15.101
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about when you parallel on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ub noxious opportunity and land grab</v>

270
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're able to wire those two things</v>

271
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of good stuff could happen</v>

272
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like that for you.</v>

273
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
