00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't you sometimes wonder why so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants who come to America can build</v>

2
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>a new life and a fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while many of the people who were born</v>

3
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>here are barely surviving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a dream,</v>

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>a defined goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition aside from the pioneers that</v>

5
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>crossed the prairies and the mountains</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach their vision of hope and future</v>

6
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>promises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other amazing examples of how</v>

7
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>ambition has shaped America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Ben Franklin for instance,</v>

8
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>when most people think of Ben Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remember the kite and the lightning</v>

9
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:48.821
<v Speaker 1>bolt and the discovery of electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a lot of people may not know is</v>

10
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:54.491
<v Speaker 1>that Ben Franklin was one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>riders to address self making when</v>

11
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Franklin started poor Richard's Almanac</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1732.</v>

12
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>He used the blank spaces between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crop data and the weather information to</v>

13
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>insert clever bits of moral and</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical advice.</v>

14
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard the saying fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and companies start to stink in three</v>

15
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:14.504
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

16
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of hundreds of Ben</v>

17
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Franklin's comments on life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another was diligence is the mother of</v>

18
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how hard working smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>working people have.</v>

20
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:33.191
<v Speaker 1>All the luck we sometimes hear of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new musical group and overnight</v>

21
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must have been in the right place</v>

22
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>at the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew the right people and a friend to</v>

23
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you've ever watched an interview</v>

24
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>with some of these folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably hear that there</v>

25
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:51.581
<v Speaker 1>overnight success took several years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diligence is the mother of good luck.</v>

26
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to these witticisms,</v>

27
00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:01.501
<v Speaker 1>Ben Franklin gave us three principles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success and ambition that have withstood</v>

28
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>the test of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

29
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 1>happiness doesn't come from big pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of great success,</v>

30
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>but from small advantages hammered out</v>
<v Speaker 1>day by day.</v>

31
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>What Mr Franklin is saying here is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must be happy with what we've got.</v>

32
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>When we're in pursuit of what we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

33
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Often we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

34
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy when I just get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion.</v>

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy when I just land that</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

36
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy when I just have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

37
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy when I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what?</v>

38
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You won't be any happier when you reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goals than you are right now.</v>

39
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham Lincoln said it best,</v>

40
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.810
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be as happy as you make up your</v>

41
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 1>mind to be right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're on your way,</v>

42
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>whether you've already gotten there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be as happy as you make your mind</v>

43
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

44
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being happy on the way doesn't mean you</v>

45
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>can't aim for great things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

46
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>look at everything Franklin accomplished</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his lifetime.</v>

47
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It means that big achievements come one</v>
<v Speaker 1>small advantage at the time.</v>

48
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>It means that you've got to enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

49
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It means that you must enjoy and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride in your little accomplishments.</v>

50
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>It means enjoying who you are becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pursuit of your eager desire.</v>

51
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day,</v>

52
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Ben Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second principal,</v>

53
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:41.641
<v Speaker 1>said that life is plastic within each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us is the power to mold,</v>

54
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>mold ourselves and mold our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is up to each of us to begin this</v>

55
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>molding process with a final product in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

56
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>and it is within our power to work it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inform it every minute,</v>

57
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every month,</v>

58
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By using your mind and your abilities</v>

59
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and your attitude to work a little each</v>
<v Speaker 1>day on molding your life,</v>

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll soon see how magnificent your</v>
<v Speaker 1>power is to gain those small advantages</v>

61
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>each day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little steps it takes to build up to</v>

62
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.180
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Principle number three,</v>

63
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.190
<v Speaker 1>successes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pleasure.</v>

64
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Success is a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what you are doing today isn't</v>

65
00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratifying,</v>

66
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.523
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

67
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>You're really not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are not fulfilled with what you</v>

68
00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 1>are doing today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot possibly be successful.</v>

69
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how many worldly</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessions you may have,</v>

70
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>how many cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many toys,</v>

71
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.590
<v Speaker 1>how much money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not happy with your life as it</v>

72
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot be successful.</v>

73
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that success is a relative term.</v>

74
00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.200
<v Speaker 1>It means different things to different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

75
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>To a school kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success may mean a star on top of his</v>

76
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:06.650
<v Speaker 1>latest test to a homemaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably means that she has a well</v>

77
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 1>run household and a wonderful family to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an outside professional.</v>

78
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely the thrill of closing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major contract or the pride and</v>

79
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:21.741
<v Speaker 1>accepting a performance bonus or being</v>
<v Speaker 1>named the top producing sales person,</v>

80
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing you will hear from</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who is successful is that they</v>

81
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 1>are happy with who they are and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are doing.</v>

82
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>They are happy content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied successes of pleasure.</v>

83
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.080
<v Speaker 1>What have you done today that makes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>day successful?</v>

84
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Think about it and write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If at the end of the day,</v>

85
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you can jot down the things that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it a good day,</v>

86
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>you will soon see patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>

87
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>This really is a good habit to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you can see a of pleasure,</v>

88
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you'll know you're on the road to</v>
<v Speaker 1>success</v>

89
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take note of Mr. Franklin's three</v>

90
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>principles of success and ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

91
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>big achievements come one small</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage at a time,</v>

92
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>one step at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day at a time.</v>

93
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the power to mold your life,</v>

94
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>to make it whatever you want to shape it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reshape it,</v>

95
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>and number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success is measured through pleasure.</v>

96
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>This is the key one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success is measured through pleasure.</v>

97
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be happy along the way.</v>

98
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn to give yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat on the back.</v>

99
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to tell yourself,</v>

100
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of me today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be happy.</v>

101
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.100
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn to enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

102
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>These are really common sense ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're practical and William James</v>

103
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:58.230
<v Speaker 1>agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's another American great.</v>

104
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the most notable philosophers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists in our history and he</v>

105
00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:08.451
<v Speaker 1>founded a philosophy called pragmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be pragmatic is to be practical,</v>

106
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.880
<v Speaker 1>to test the validity of a concept by its</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical results,</v>

107
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.370
<v Speaker 1>to actually question something and rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usefulness by what it can do for</v>

108
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you to hear a method of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

109
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.680
<v Speaker 1>doing something and figuring out if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>even worth your while.</v>

110
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the issues Mr James dealt with in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lifetime was what does it mean to be</v>

111
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 1>a success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A significant person after years of</v>

112
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>palm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this question,</v>

113
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.970
<v Speaker 1>William James described yes as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of two things.</v>

114
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Number one and inner ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is followed persistently with</v>

115
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:54.081
<v Speaker 1>courage and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outer achievement related to that ideal.</v>

116
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to number one and enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

117
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.790
<v Speaker 1>which is followed persistently with</v>
<v Speaker 1>curry.</v>

118
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I take that to mean defining a goal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the resolve to complete it.</v>

119
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 1>No matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it or die.</v>

120
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Promise yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll read the books until your skills</v>

121
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the seminars until you get a</v>

122
00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:24.090
<v Speaker 1>handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it until it makes sense.</v>

123
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Practice it until you've got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give up until you get where you</v>

124
00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:32.430
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However long that is,</v>

125
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.250
<v Speaker 1>step by step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece by piece,</v>

126
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.670
<v Speaker 1>book by book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminar by seminar.</v>

127
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Do it until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it until as a very important</v>

128
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's magic.</v>

129
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It means that you'll never give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't miss the chance to grow,</v>

130
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:53.550
<v Speaker 1>to pay the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you learn,</v>

131
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

132
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>You'll discover some of life's great</v>
<v Speaker 1>treasures when you pay that price.</v>

133
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>William James Second part to success</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with the outer achievement related</v>

134
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:10.300
<v Speaker 1>to that ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need both aspects to really be a</v>

135
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:14.110
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what Dr James Realized about his</v>

136
00:09:14.111 --> 00:09:19.111
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of success was that the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>part is indeed more important.</v>

137
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Then the second going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're working toward your</v>

138
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>inner goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dream,</v>

139
00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:30.880
<v Speaker 1>then success is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you give up your innovation,</v>

140
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>then you can never become successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never will become successful until</v>

141
00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even matter.</v>

142
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the person who's been working on a</v>

143
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>project for 10 years can be successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his own right if he's honestly</v>

144
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>working toward it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything to make himself worthy</v>

145
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>of reaching the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really happy with where he is.</v>

146
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.520
<v Speaker 2>According to the Christian story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first couple,</v>

147
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve were instructed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruitful,</v>

148
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 2>fruitful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce some results,</v>

149
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 2>fruitful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an interesting word.</v>

150
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of denotes abundance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I think,</v>

151
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:16.941
<v Speaker 2>fruitful and abundance and productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think here's what it means to go</v>

152
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 2>to work on producing more than you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself.</v>

153
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing more than you need for</v>

154
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:31.081
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we fulfill that command so</v>

155
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.170
<v Speaker 2>long ago given to be fruitful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be productive,</v>

156
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 2>to produce far more than you need for</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself so that you can bless others</v>

157
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.050
<v Speaker 2>and bless your community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bless your nation.</v>

158
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were enterprise</v>

159
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.010
<v Speaker 2>producing more ideas than you need for</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you could share and give</v>

160
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 2>them all away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce more in terms of substance and</v>

161
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.620
<v Speaker 2>money and treasure and all things</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable to human beings,</v>

162
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.630
<v Speaker 2>far more than you need for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rg laterno story.</v>

163
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:11.160
<v Speaker 2>The man who built the big earth moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

164
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.900
<v Speaker 2>it was his goal to someday give away 90</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of income</v>

165
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 2>giving away far more than anyone could</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine.</v>

166
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.351
<v Speaker 2>Someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

167
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 2>90 percent is enough to give away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

168
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you should have seen the 10 percent that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was left.</v>

169
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once abundance starts to come.</v>

170
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Once someone becomes incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>

171
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing what the numbers turn out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

172
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what it finally totals</v>

173
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.023
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>

174
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.650
<v Speaker 2>so hopefully we'll have guidelines for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you during this weekend so you can turn</v>

175
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the response you've created already by</v>
<v Speaker 2>being here.</v>

176
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:56.891
<v Speaker 2>Then the response by employing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental activity and taking notes,</v>

177
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.120
<v Speaker 2>putting all this through your mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>processes so that you can create this</v>

178
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 2>kind of results when you leave here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next</v>

179
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 2>best way to make the most out of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend is just a few things.</v>

180
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be thankful for what you already have.</v>

181
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.760
<v Speaker 2>This looks like a pretty prosperous</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience already,</v>

182
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.790
<v Speaker 2>so we're already doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is okay,</v>

183
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but what if we could multiply the value</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our productivity by two,</v>

184
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:32.221
<v Speaker 2>by three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by five,</v>

185
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:33.690
<v Speaker 2>by 10?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be valuable?</v>

186
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:35.460
<v Speaker 2>The answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it would,</v>

187
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the mechanism or the inspiration</v>

188
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.170
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it takes to really do</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely well.</v>

189
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.870
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start with Thanksgiving to be</v>

190
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>thankful for what you all ready,</v>

191
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.343
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

192
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.730
<v Speaker 2>we have already solved the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity in this room.</v>

193
00:12:57.371 --> 00:13:00.130
<v Speaker 2>We've probably already solved the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem of survival,</v>

194
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>so we're no longer concerned with just</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity and survival.</v>

195
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Speaker 2>We are perhaps beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that we have gotten beyond that,</v>

196
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.900
<v Speaker 2>no telling what else we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>

197
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>let's be thankful for what we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished up until now,</v>

198
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 2>the years that have brought me here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiences that brought me here.</v>

199
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Starting with my parents who raised me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me an incredible foundation that's</v>

200
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>lasted me all of these years and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentors that I've met along the way.</v>

201
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely the changing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionizing my life,</v>

202
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 2>my income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bank account,</v>

203
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 2>my future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that collectively has brought me</v>

204
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so grateful for the people,</v>

205
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the Association for the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the chance to work in labor,</v>

206
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 2>produced myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that that brought me to this</v>

207
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:49.580
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

208
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 2>this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm grateful for it.</v>

209
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 2>For the countries we represent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have freedom.</v>

210
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this note.</v>

211
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are extraordinary times.</v>

212
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.510
<v Speaker 2>About 11 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the walls came tumbling down in Germany</v>

213
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and it started a wave of democracy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom like the world has ever seen</v>

214
00:14:14.451 --> 00:14:17.810
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like communism was on the</v>

215
00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:21.770
<v Speaker 2>march for so many years in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow of that political philosophy fell</v>

216
00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:25.730
<v Speaker 2>on so many countries that I visited it</v>
<v Speaker 2>even back in those early,</v>

217
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:29.480
<v Speaker 2>early days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now those shadows are beginning to</v>

218
00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:33.750
<v Speaker 2>flee away in the light of democracy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and capitalism is,</v>

219
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.030
<v Speaker 2>is now the order of the day and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a few old dictators left and they</v>

220
00:14:38.031 --> 00:14:40.310
<v Speaker 2>will soon be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the good news.</v>

221
00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:42.560
<v Speaker 2>In our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will all be gone.</v>

222
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 2>That's an incredible thought to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dictators of the past will all be</v>

223
00:14:47.631 --> 00:14:48.464
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

224
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Years and years ago when I went to South</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

225
00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:58.990
<v Speaker 2>almost every country had a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're all gone.</v>

226
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean in that whole hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one left and that's Castro</v>

227
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and he will soon be gone and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qaddafi's will soon be gone and this at</v>

228
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.400
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hussein's will soon be gone and they</v>

229
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 2>will all be gone because now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once this wave of capitalism and freedom</v>

230
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:17.440
<v Speaker 2>and free enterprise and spirituality now</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeping the whole world,</v>

231
00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:21.220
<v Speaker 2>once it started all those years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

232
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.340
<v Speaker 2>it is such an incredible sight to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now have the opportunity to lecture in</v>

233
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.490
<v Speaker 2>East Germany into lecture in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Czechoslovakia and Poland.</v>

234
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time I was in Poland,</v>

235
00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:36.040
<v Speaker 2>we had a bomb scare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was incredible middle of the winter.</v>

236
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

237
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bomb in the place.</v>

238
00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 2>So we all vacated and went out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

239
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I stayed for about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

240
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:45.850
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 minutes while they brought in the</v>

241
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:50.440
<v Speaker 2>sniffing dogs to clear the place and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one left.</v>

242
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Everyone came back in middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter in Poland,</v>

243
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.730
<v Speaker 2>so that means everything is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Rowan,</v>

244
00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 2>teaching capitalism in Moscow and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siberia Novosibirsk.</v>

245
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the few that's been sent to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siberia that came back</v>

246
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm going again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping I get back again.</v>

247
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are extraordinary times,</v>

248
00:16:13.631 --> 00:16:14.800
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

249
00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:17.770
<v Speaker 2>and every other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never been anything like it in</v>

250
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:21.340
<v Speaker 2>the history of the last 6,000 years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race.</v>

251
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:23.950
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are extraordinary times</v>

252
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.640
<v Speaker 2>politically with freedom on the march,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

253
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.030
<v Speaker 2>economically extraordinary times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So make this note,</v>

254
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Jim Rollins view of the 21st century</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented opportunity.</v>

255
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Every field you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every endeavor you want to try,</v>

256
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.600
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented opportunity</v>

257
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with all the challenges that we</v>

258
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 2>faced forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new day.</v>

259
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.720
<v Speaker 2>This is a new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new scene nationally and for</v>

260
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 2>each of us personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like it.</v>

261
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Unprecedented opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

262
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 2>here's number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 21st century keen competition.</v>

263
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>It's called world competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

264
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.010
<v Speaker 2>not just person to person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not company to company,</v>

265
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>not the industry to industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens on the other side of the</v>

266
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it greatly affects us on this side</v>

267
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a world game to play.</v>

268
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 2>This is one of our chances now to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world game.</v>

269
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I travel all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

270
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leave Los Angeles 14 hours later.</v>

271
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five meals,</v>

272
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 2>three movies in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're there.</v>

273
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is easy stuff.</v>

274
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I fly the concord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

275
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>

276
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are extraordinary times.</v>

277
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 2>In about 10 days I'll be down in South</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

278
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela,</v>

279
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.440
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jets fly everywhere and then all</v>

280
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 2>night long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jets fly to our countries,</v>

281
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 2>bringing us goods and services and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits and vegetables from anywhere in</v>

282
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

283
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 2>These are extraordinary times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unprecedented Opportunity,</v>

284
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 2>but keen competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what you need now to really be</v>

285
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 2>successful in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is multiple skills.</v>

286
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully we'll talk about some of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills this weekend.</v>

287
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't be caught now in the 21st century</v>
<v Speaker 2>with just one skill.</v>

288
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 2>If you want to flourish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fruitful.</v>

289
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 2>If you want to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce more than you need for yourself.</v>

290
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Learn more than one skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also my perception now and</v>

291
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>traveling around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be useful to know more than one</v>

292
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

293
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 2>learn more than one language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father spoke German when I was a kid</v>

294
00:18:50.771 --> 00:18:52.060
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never taught me.</v>

295
00:18:52.061 --> 00:18:55.000
<v Speaker 2>My mother was English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she also spoke French,</v>

296
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.420
<v Speaker 2>but she never taught me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have learned three languages at</v>

297
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:02.980
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These extra languages are so useful.</v>

298
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I ask a teacher one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many languages going to child learn?</v>

299
00:19:06.461 --> 00:19:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Here's what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As many as you'll teach them,</v>

300
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 2>they don't lack capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't lack imagination.</v>

301
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:15.100
<v Speaker 2>They certainly don't let curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only lack of teacher,</v>

302
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.880
<v Speaker 2>so if you think learning another</v>
<v Speaker 2>language is sort of passed you by.</v>

303
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Make this note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give it as a gift to your tools.</v>

304
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Another language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then another language.</v>

305
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.060
<v Speaker 2>When I lecture in the Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

306
00:19:31.061 --> 00:19:35.440
<v Speaker 2>they all speak several languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do my seminars in English because they</v>

307
00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:36.490
<v Speaker 2>can all understand English.</v>

308
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 2>In the Scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're required to learn four languages</v>

309
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.390
<v Speaker 2>during your educational process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

310
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 2>they assigned in one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can choose,</v>

311
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 2>so when you finished the educational</v>
<v Speaker 2>process in the Scandinavian countries,</v>

312
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:56.031
<v Speaker 2>you now know for languages which if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in Europe is a great advantage,</v>

313
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great advantage anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning that extra language.</v>

314
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Some of my business colleagues that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>mega millions every year,</v>

315
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>many of them speak more than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

316
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.850
<v Speaker 2>several languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Coles speaks seven languages.</v>

317
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so much fun to travel around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world with Michael because he can talk</v>

318
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 2>to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

319
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 2>He knows all the languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a gift,</v>

320
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 2>a gift to give to your tooth.</v>

321
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

322
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.020
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said all that to say this.</v>

323
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more.</v>

324
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Learn all the disciplines that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>language and skills worthwhile,</v>

325
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.170
<v Speaker 2>the disciplines of good health</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines of staying vital.</v>

326
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.600
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about that just a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

327
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.190
<v Speaker 2>So that's your best advantage for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>21st century.</v>

328
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>So of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be thankful.</v>

329
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Here's the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now to make this weekend.</v>

330
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:55.471
<v Speaker 2>Really powerful for you to be eager to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn and I hesitate to say that because</v>

331
00:20:55.511 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>you know you wouldn't be here if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't eager to learn to pay the price</v>

332
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 2>of time and money and it wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money that was really the expensive part</v>

333
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.370
<v Speaker 2>for this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the time</v>

334
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.110
<v Speaker 2>you haven't made that note before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it now.</v>

335
00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Time is more valuable than money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get more money,</v>

336
00:21:15.081 --> 00:21:17.540
<v Speaker 2>but you can't get more time.</v>

337
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.140
<v Speaker 2>So to ask you for the price for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>seminar,</v>

338
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.100
<v Speaker 2>fairly modest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to ask you for the price in time for</v>

339
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:32.720
<v Speaker 2>the seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly expensive to ask me for three</v>

340
00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

341
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a heavyweight cost for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's exactly the same for you.</v>

342
00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:43.601
<v Speaker 2>Three days is a chunk of time and so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest investment for this weekend is</v>

343
00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:47.300
<v Speaker 2>not the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest investment is the time.</v>

344
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.200
<v Speaker 2>So here's what I want to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want this investment to pay off for</v>

345
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:55.820
<v Speaker 2>you multiplied many times over what will</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seminar be worth?</v>

346
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Not The price it cost to get in and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really the price of time.</v>

347
00:21:59.511 --> 00:22:01.760
<v Speaker 2>It may be worth a thousand times more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

348
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.070
<v Speaker 2>What if I tried to make the seminar</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth just exactly what you paid.</v>

349
00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>That would be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if I tried to make it worth a</v>

350
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 2>thousand times more than you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you?</v>

351
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>That might be easier because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired by ideas that have worked</v>

352
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 2>miracles in my life and I want to share</v>
<v Speaker 2>them with you,</v>

353
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>so I want you to be a lot Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you walk out.</v>

354
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Then when you walked in,</v>

355
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 2>so be eager to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take good notes.</v>

356
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how well you do,</v>

357
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.690
<v Speaker 2>no matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no telling what else you can do.</v>

358
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.740
<v Speaker 2>You know if you're mega rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might become super mega rich.</v>

359
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Right after this weekend</v>

360
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.120
<v Speaker 2>we had the millionaire's club often</v>
<v Speaker 2>invite a billionaire to come talk to us.</v>

361
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.541
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

362
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you guys are doing okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

363
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.120
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your act together.</v>

364
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.370
<v Speaker 2>So no matter how rich you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's possible.</v>

365
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.760
<v Speaker 2>If you can multiply it by two by three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by five,</v>

366
00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:07.860
<v Speaker 2>by 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the right idea,</v>

367
00:23:07.861 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 2>the right inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right collective association here,</v>

368
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 2>this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to give you a good chance.</v>

369
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the next one.</v>

370
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Argue later with all my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we had time to open it up so we</v>

371
00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:22.770
<v Speaker 2>could debate all this stuff right on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

372
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Debate later with all of my ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things I'm going to share with you,</v>

373
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.460
<v Speaker 2>but make this note now debate is</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

374
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have at least two parties</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress to debate good ideas.</v>

375
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Communism said no one party sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see lacking debate.</v>

376
00:23:43.671 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to become tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Power tends to corrupt.</v>

377
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Power tends to corrupt.</v>

378
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So without debate,</v>

379
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 2>you know something can gather far too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much power.</v>

380
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's important and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues I'm going to raise this weekend,</v>

381
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the stuff I'm going to share</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you is up for debate.</v>

382
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Here's why it's up for debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only share with you my point of</v>

383
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>view</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's got to be more than one</v>

384
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 2>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I looked at something from over here</v>

385
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what it looks like to me,</v>

386
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 2>and you were standing over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking back this way at it,</v>

387
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

388
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what it looks like to me now.</v>

389
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:27.410
<v Speaker 2>If I invited you from back over there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up here and look at it from where I</v>

390
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 2>am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

391
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right Mr Allen.</v>

392
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I never looked at it before from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>vantage point,</v>

393
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.140
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I want to do in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers we've got this weekend are</v>

394
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.150
<v Speaker 2>going to gather all of this up and share</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas from our point of view,</v>

395
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but here's what you must remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more than one point of view,</v>

396
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.410
<v Speaker 2>so here's what's important to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>student,</v>

397
00:24:51.411 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 2>not a follower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a student,</v>

398
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 2>not a follower,</v>

399
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.000
<v Speaker 2>and part of being a student is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

400
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:02.650
<v Speaker 2>The idea is once you hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

401
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:05.020
<v Speaker 2>right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could it work for me?</v>

402
00:25:05.021 --> 00:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Not Work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a,</v>

403
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 2>is that a little too heavy or isn't it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient enough?</v>

404
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's useful to debate with</v>

405
00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:17.580
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good debater,</v>

406
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I choose one side,</v>

407
00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care which side to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose,</v>

408
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:23.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pick a side,</v>

409
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.730
<v Speaker 2>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a great debate.</v>

410
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I really heard someone in America was</v>
<v Speaker 2>debating someone in Canada that held a</v>

411
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:37.781
<v Speaker 2>little more liberal position and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American was very conservative and the</v>

412
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 2>American said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every man for himself,</v>

413
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.820
<v Speaker 2>individual individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rugged individualism,</v>

414
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 2>and on the other side the liberal said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

415
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:50.270
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every man for himself said the elephant</v>

416
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 2>is he danced among the chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

417
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty good point.</v>

418
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.360
<v Speaker 2>So whether it's liberal or Conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need both.</v>

419
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.280
<v Speaker 2>In America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Declaration of Independence is</v>

420
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.520
<v Speaker 2>America's great liberal doctrine and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution of the United States is</v>

421
00:26:09.521 --> 00:26:13.810
<v Speaker 2>America's great conservative document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it takes a bit of both,</v>

422
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.940
<v Speaker 2>but to debate the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

423
00:26:17.941 --> 00:26:21.330
<v Speaker 2>if you can't debate with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you must learn to do.</v>

424
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Debate with yourself.</v>

425
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Is it valuable or isn't it valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this idea I've heard a bit off track</v>

426
00:26:29.431 --> 00:26:31.610
<v Speaker 2>or is it on track?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be useful or not?</v>

427
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Be useful</v>
<v Speaker 2>to debate the merits of trying to beat</v>

428
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the merits of putting it into action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So debate is a way to refine a good</v>

429
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:44.500
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone in Congress says,</v>

430
00:26:44.501 --> 00:26:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rest of them say wonderful.</v>

431
00:26:47.531 --> 00:26:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Put it on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone asks three questions and this</v>

432
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:52.211
<v Speaker 2>guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

433
00:26:52.211 --> 00:26:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I withdraw my great idea.</v>

434
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing we didn't try it on</v>

435
00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:03.010
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's why we learned from multiple</v>

436
00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:05.290
<v Speaker 2>voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't become followers.</v>

437
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:09.100
<v Speaker 2>We become students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is to refine ideas that can</v>

438
00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:10.990
<v Speaker 2>change our health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change our income,</v>

439
00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:13.480
<v Speaker 2>change your future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change everything for the better.</v>

440
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Make us more productive to finally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more in productivity than we need</v>

441
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:24.931
<v Speaker 2>for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eager to learn.</v>

442
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good debate.</v>

443
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the last part to make this a</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable weekend.</v>

444
00:27:35.021 --> 00:27:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's to be a good listener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then no,</v>

445
00:27:37.421 --> 00:27:39.220
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

446
00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:42.040
<v Speaker 2>most of our life is going on outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>these four walls.</v>

447
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Speaker 2>You know our businesses out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>our customers are out there and you</v>

448
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.890
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the store we run is out there and our</v>

449
00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:50.080
<v Speaker 2>children are out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are families out there and our</v>

450
00:27:50.081 --> 00:27:51.400
<v Speaker 2>friends are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

451
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Most of the things that involve our life</v>
<v Speaker 2>are out there.</v>

452
00:27:54.101 --> 00:27:58.690
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes when a big part of our life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on out there,</v>

453
00:27:58.691 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a little hard to sort of dismiss</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that for awhile.</v>

454
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Put it into a place where you can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>push it aside for just a little while</v>

455
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and really listened intently and gather</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the information,</v>

456
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.350
<v Speaker 2>but I know you're going to do your best.</v>
