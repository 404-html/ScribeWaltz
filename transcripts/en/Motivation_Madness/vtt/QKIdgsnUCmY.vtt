00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>A messenger of Satan</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buffet</v>

2
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>me less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be exalted above measure.</v>

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you from the subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring partner.</v>

4
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what a sparring partner is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's somebody that you box with in</v>

5
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>preparation for a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you are a fighter,</v>

6
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>a sparring partner is a gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't have a sparring</v>

7
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be ready for the real fight.</v>

8
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>But as foreign partner may hitch made</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts,</v>

9
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>made challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you got hit doesn't mean it</v>

10
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:06.424
<v Speaker 1>was the devil.</v>

11
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to pray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me let me and then I've jumped on</v>

12
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hose figured out.</v>

13
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for this opportunity to share</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word and speak to your people today.</v>

14
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I thank you for what to keep Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tracer,</v>

15
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect what she gave out on her.</v>

16
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>When you get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm blessed because he said anything to</v>

17
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the ability to articulate</v>

18
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>effectively what you have shared with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a profound,</v>

19
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>at that didactic way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people's lives are better because</v>

20
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:51.331
<v Speaker 1>they have shared this moment with Uli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak Lord for that servant heareth in</v>

21
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Jesus' name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

22
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.623
<v Speaker 1>You may be seated.</v>

23
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the movies the other day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

24
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I went to see cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm late,</v>

25
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but I went to see Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>with Sylvester Stallone and Michael B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan and it,</v>

27
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

28
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

29
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

30
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 1>it was a great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just unbelievable movie,</v>

31
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>but the movie's scissors around a young</v>
<v Speaker 1>man with potential</v>

32
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and trying to get semesters stallone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>character to train him to continue the</v>

33
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 1>excellence and the legacy of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessor,</v>

34
00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:45.280
<v Speaker 1>his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the process of training,</v>

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>he is facing a daunting task of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained in adverse environments so that</v>

36
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>when he gets to the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that is thrown at him,</v>

37
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.130
<v Speaker 1>we'll toss him away from the victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will enable him to accomplish what</v>

38
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>he was set out to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to bring it up because</v>

39
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought of it when I read what Paul</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote because Paul is coming to the end</v>

40
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 1>of a summarization of how blessed he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much God has done for him,</v>

41
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>the depth of revelation that he has and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much God has spoken into his life.</v>

42
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>And right on the heels of a dissertation</v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether in the body or in the</v>

43
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot tell us.</v>

44
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I knew a man who saw things that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>not lawful to be uttered and mostly</v>

45
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think that he actually is referring</v>

46
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to cast the light off of himself.</v>

47
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He speaks in third person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in reality he's saying the abundance</v>

48
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>revelation was given to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was given to me.</v>

49
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Look at the abundance that was given to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

50
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I was ministering to somebody the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and it was a young man kind of</v>

51
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>depressed over his relationship with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

52
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And when I begin to talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

53
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you talk to me about what you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

54
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>but you say nothing about what she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

55
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Look at the infrastructure that God put</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around you to subsidize and replace</v>

56
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>what you didn't get.</v>

57
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at all the people who love and feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and care for you,</v>

58
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>and maybe we will never be your father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

59
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>we represent the sum total of God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to get love to you.</v>

60
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Even if he had to bring it in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

61
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And when I got to tell him all of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>assets,</v>

62
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>it balanced against his liability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

63
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>life is a combination of assets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>liabilities.</v>

64
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And we see and we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we crave the assets,</v>

65
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but we are not prepared for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liabilities.</v>

66
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Every advancement will cost you</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you've accomplished.</v>

67
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>You pay the price for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every accomplishment that exist in</v>

68
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every victory and every revelation</v>

69
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>economic blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every kind of physical blessing,</v>

71
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:16.861
<v Speaker 1>every type of emotional blessing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always something that balances</v>

72
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lets you be exalted above measure.</v>

73
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I want you to understand that it is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just God.</v>

74
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>When the blessing comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also God.</v>

75
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>When the buffet or the enemy cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul says,</v>

76
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>this was a gift to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a messenger of Satan</v>

77
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 1>take with me a messenger of Satan was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gif to me.</v>

78
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>My problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's got one.</v>

79
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got something to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick.</v>

80
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You be,</v>

81
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle with,</v>

82
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>it let you wrestle with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be insecurity and can be an</v>

83
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>

84
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be about,</v>

85
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it can be low self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be anger,</v>

86
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it could be everybody has their uniquely</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed devil,</v>

87
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was given to me.</v>

88
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't God gives you or sin a</v>
<v Speaker 1>messenger of say the first of all,</v>

89
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>let me stop there and talk about how I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad to know that if he access me,</v>

90
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>God had to allow it.</v>

91
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

92
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>The good news is he couldn't just come</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me all his old,</v>

93
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>the very fact that he came at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that he had to get permission to get</v>

94
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>near it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's good for me because it lets</v>

95
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.861
<v Speaker 1>me know that God is in control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the devil has not been able to do</v>

96
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.831
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wanted to do in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I live in a controlled environment</v>

<v Speaker 1>of job does,</v>

116
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.580
<v Speaker 1>the Bible said when the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God came around the throat,</v>

117

<v Speaker 1>a Muslim came Satan and he said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Community.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fear of kate do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just walk up on this property.</v>

142
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 1>This is God's property from the crown of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head to the soles of my feet.</v>

143
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.290
<v Speaker 1>This is God's property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

144
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.060
<v Speaker 1>if you 5 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even</v>

145
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>the Mama lists the Lord because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin.</v>

146
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>If the enemy comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to have permission to do it and</v>

147
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was given to me</v>

148
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.460
<v Speaker 1>a messenger of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thorn in my flesh,</v>

149
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.880
<v Speaker 1>a messenger of Satan</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buffet me.</v>

150
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>If God says the Messenger of Satan to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buffet me,</v>

151
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever he is trying to do in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bigger than what he use to buffer it.</v>

152
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:11.561
<v Speaker 1>Lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am saying the big tree,</v>

153
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:16.781
<v Speaker 1>then it's not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting rid of the for the colon is a</v>

154
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:21.981
<v Speaker 1>blessing to keep you from some enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is worse than the corn.</v>

155
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>The thorn is how God treats you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance you,</v>

156
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>to stop you from getting too impressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with yourself.</v>

157
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>He's an to bless you so that if I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>break you anywhere,</v>

158
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>the blessing would go so far in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head that you would give besides</v>

159
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:51.561
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I hate pride above everything</v>

160
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>else in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet I want to bless you.</v>

161
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bless you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to stop you from being proud of</v>

162
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you something that</v>

163
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 1>makes you drop your head.</v>

164
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you this morning about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that makes you drop your head.</v>

165
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.010
<v Speaker 1>When people compliment you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that stops you from really</v>

166
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.520
<v Speaker 1>taking it all live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you know about yourself,</v>

167
00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.050
<v Speaker 1>realize about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some deficiency,</v>

168
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 1>some area of brokenness in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humbles you may not be spiritual</v>

169
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may in fact be a gift from God to</v>

170
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>control your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you common control,</v>

171
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.860
<v Speaker 1>to stop you from being judgmental about</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

172
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of your arrogant demeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God will send a messenger from Satan to</v>

173
00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:49.040
<v Speaker 1>buffet your flesh.</v>

174
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Who in the world would think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>apostle Paul,</v>

175
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.800
<v Speaker 1>who was healing the sick and raising the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead and writing most of the epistles</v>

176
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.810
<v Speaker 1>for the New Testament church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible sees he was getting beat up</v>

177
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up,</v>

178
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preaching,</v>

179
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>laying hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing the sick,</v>

180
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>raising the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but secretly,</v>

181
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in your life.</v>

182
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>You can punch right now somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

183
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.580
<v Speaker 1>You're getting hit right now somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

184
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.390
<v Speaker 1>You're up under attack right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have some of you think the victory is</v>

185
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.330
<v Speaker 1>stop the attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Lord gave me a message this</v>

186
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:43.410
<v Speaker 1>morning to tell you that the attack is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blessing.</v>

187
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mess with you that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess with here today.</v>

188
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll go left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell your neighbor the attack is my</v>

189
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 1>blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sent</v>

191
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>to buffet me.</v>

192
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.160
<v Speaker 1>The word buffet means to be big lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>fist,</v>

193
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 1>something big shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this I never will forget.</v>

194
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.120
<v Speaker 1>It was probably the highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I should say that.</v>

195
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It seems like one of the highlights of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life and ministry church was</v>

196
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Speaker 1>exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim ministry was exploding,</v>

197
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>going five servers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

199
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.940
<v Speaker 1>people getting saved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of</v>

200
00:14:37.941 --> 00:14:42.590
<v Speaker 1>people getting saved every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands more over the television.</v>

201
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.010
<v Speaker 1>People get healed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People being delivered,</v>

202
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.240
<v Speaker 1>people coming out of crutches and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheelchairs and getting touched by the</v>

203
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>power of the Holy Ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Casting demons out of witches,</v>

204
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>screaming and hollering and yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running out the door,</v>

205
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.810
<v Speaker 1>rebuke in the powers of the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to curse me.</v>

206
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 1>There's frequent chicken blood out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the building.</v>

207
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Y'All remember what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rebuke.</v>

208
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>The trick is I remember standing in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>old church and I told them they should</v>

209
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:11.370
<v Speaker 1>have fried them chickens.</v>

215
00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Every time you turned on the TV set it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when the show opened up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my mother in law died and before I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get over it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was running my own revives people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>all backed up on the highway to come to</v>

<v Speaker 1>wet with sweat cloud low top of my</v>

233
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:40.851
<v Speaker 1>mother's bed and told God to heal her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I be this powerful?</v>

234
00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.380
<v Speaker 1>How could I call fly up down from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>habit over here and come over here and</v>

235
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.810
<v Speaker 1>whole somebody who's truly with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

236
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

237
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need economic support and supporting.</v>

238
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:19.840
<v Speaker 1>The Bible says if we don't support</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>

239
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.020
<v Speaker 1>we are less than an infidel that we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to provide,</v>

240
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but we also understand now that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>support is more than money.</v>

241
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.120
<v Speaker 1>So we want to talk about number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to talk about social support.</v>

242
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 1>We want to talk about your social</v>
<v Speaker 1>support around you,</v>

243
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.074
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

244
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 1>your family needs social support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have support?</v>

245
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Everything in this room needs support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

246
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 1>That gets a little boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very important.</v>

247
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.110
<v Speaker 1>You came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the carpet and you didn't see</v>

248
00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:49.030
<v Speaker 1>the concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the carpet means nothing without the</v>

249
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.790
<v Speaker 1>concrete</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

250
00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Have you gotten support around you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do?</v>

251
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.050
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to build a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have support?</v>

252
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.390
<v Speaker 1>You've been telling God you're ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next level.</v>

253
00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Is Your family wedding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you built it a love support to</v>

254
00:18:01.511 --> 00:18:04.750
<v Speaker 1>support you getting ready to run for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress can have your kids handle it?</v>

255
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Have they got the right kind of friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and support,</v>

256
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>but he surrounded this wife had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right support for your next move.</v>

257
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 1>This is why God has given you this at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of the year because you're</v>

258
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>getting ready to go to another level</v>

259
00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.650
<v Speaker 3>and for the level that you can read it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and horn.</v>

260
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't take old support and to new</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels for the level that you're getting</v>

261
00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 3>rid of the coin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to need some social support</v>

262
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.100
<v Speaker 3>to undergird you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not enough to have the vision and</v>

263
00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:40.090
<v Speaker 3>have the dream if you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>support and it's not just about you.</v>

264
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.550
<v Speaker 3>It's about everything that's connected</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

265
00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.510
<v Speaker 3>You want to build a great work for God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but can the kids handle it?</v>

266
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Is it the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right season?</v>

267
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Do they have friends around them that</v>
<v Speaker 3>support your phone use or are you the</v>

268
00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 3>only sane voice in the life of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>family?</v>

269
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.070
<v Speaker 1>So what number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to have social support.</v>

270
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.350
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a couple of things I have</v>

271
00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:07.240
<v Speaker 1>learned in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higher you go,</v>

272
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>the smaller your circle.</v>

273
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.670
<v Speaker 3>People who've got all kind of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know everybody and they run them</v>

274
00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:16.840
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All kind of the people.</v>

275
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I ain't going very high</v>

276
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.870
<v Speaker 3>because if you get too big of a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to stay low.</v>

277
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.080
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to be like a pyramid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up,</v>

278
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.050
<v Speaker 3>the higher you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the smaller your circle.</v>

279
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Now to take the permit and turn it</v>
<v Speaker 3>upside down and the soul gets bigger as</v>

280
00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to fall over.</v>

281
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.510
<v Speaker 3>That means you can't take everybody with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

282
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.880
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be careful who you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take with you.</v>

283
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.780
<v Speaker 3>The higher you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more discriminating you have to be</v>

284
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.450
<v Speaker 3>and who you got to give your time too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we now understand that provision</v>

285
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.640
<v Speaker 3>is blocked just money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's attention,</v>

286
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.220
<v Speaker 3>it's time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interest,</v>

287
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.580
<v Speaker 3>it's affection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing that you have,</v>

288
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.610
<v Speaker 3>we'll run right without you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything that you have requires</v>

289
00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:08.621
<v Speaker 3>more of you and you can afford to fund</v>
<v Speaker 3>every situation you.</v>

290
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that they're not good people.</v>

291
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:18.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just said that you are a limited</v>
<v Speaker 3>resource and some of you are wore out</v>

292
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 3>now cause you aren't too many things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>too many people.</v>

293
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.340
<v Speaker 3>You got to bring your circle for work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is getting ready to take you to,</v>

294
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.493
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

295
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.410
<v Speaker 3>high five somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lord,</v>

296
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>that man is talking in the mood.</v>

297
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.610
<v Speaker 1>The third area that you need is</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual support.</v>

298
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'd come home and support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need social support,</v>

299
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 1>your social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need spiritual support.</v>

300
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you why you need spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>support</v>

301
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.070
<v Speaker 1>because when you let me tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>something until you let me tell you,</v>

302
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you would continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can I tell</v>

303
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.910
<v Speaker 1>every family is dysfunctional in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

304
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would believe that they believe it.</v>

305
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.290
<v Speaker 3>They didn't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who,</v>

306
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.860
<v Speaker 1>but the frustration that we hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always think everybody got something</v>

307
00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:26.694
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't get.</v>

308
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not a only been raised by my mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been so much better if my father</v>

309
00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:32.610
<v Speaker 3>would have been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't hit on a good people with</v>

310
00:21:32.611 --> 00:21:35.250
<v Speaker 3>mothers who are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people with fathers who are</v>

311
00:21:35.251 --> 00:21:36.960
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people with mothers and</v>

312
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:39.150
<v Speaker 3>fathers who are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people were mothers and</v>

313
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:41.010
<v Speaker 3>fathers who live in big houses that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

314
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.890
<v Speaker 3>There are people with mothers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fathers who live in big houses and have</v>

315
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:46.800
<v Speaker 3>phds who are still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who are fine,</v>

316
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.320
<v Speaker 3>who had mothers and fathers and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>phds.</v>

317
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.740
<v Speaker 3>They are good looking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

318
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Every body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>light skin,</v>

319
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 3>dark skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white folks,</v>

320
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.840
<v Speaker 3>but folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown folks,</v>

321
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 3>everybody has secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>effort,</v>

322
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.370
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potluck.</v>

323
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when my comic queasy Mary go kind of</v>

324
00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:11.210
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live,</v>

325
00:22:11.211 --> 00:22:14.760
<v Speaker 3>we have five kids with five new flavor</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a crazy.</v>

326
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.400
<v Speaker 3>The whole house looks like baskin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robbins.</v>

327
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever notice how old are your</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids get?</v>

328
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 3>The harder it is for them to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

329
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 3>very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're small,</v>

330
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 3>they don't have no pagan put on the blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>dress,</v>

331
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.140
<v Speaker 3>put on the blue pants wearing a red</v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt.</v>

332
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Then one day they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't write that check.</v>

333
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.100
<v Speaker 1>The more premium native,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give them more difficult to get it</v>

334
00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and the more that the functions begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and the most secrets the family has</v>

335
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.310
<v Speaker 1>because secrets are equal opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and experiences that we all can share.</v>

336
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.380
<v Speaker 1>The young people today say they all had</v>
<v Speaker 1>little secrets.</v>

337
00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>They say they keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are hilarious,</v>

338
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.210
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they put real on facebook and</v>

339
00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:02.340
<v Speaker 1>commit a new crime because people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

340
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>There are some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep it real,</v>

341
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:14.764
<v Speaker 1>you will lose it</v>

342
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.440
<v Speaker 3>and the reality is you get on my nerves</v>
<v Speaker 3>because just standing there staring at</v>

343
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:23.990
<v Speaker 3>me like you don't like if you said</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you talk to people,</v>

344
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.100
<v Speaker 3>it would be the third World War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keeping it real is destructive.</v>

345
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep her the woman.</v>

346
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

347
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I live on the Cape up woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you got to such a mouth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wondering why you had mood swings.</v>

383
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.920
<v Speaker 3>because you felt worried about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>image that when it's time to wash up,</v>

384
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you're so busy trying to look masculine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have turned salvation,</v>

415
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 1>the work I'm coming to the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are so performance oriented.</v>

416
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You think you have to perform for God</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can see your thoughts so far off?</v>

417
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bible says that is not method before</v>

418
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 1>him with whom we have to do and the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance you have to keep it real.</v>

419
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 1>You been keeping it moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the one person that's safe to keep</v>

420
00:28:55.491 --> 00:28:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it real with and when they can find</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else wrong with it.</v>

421
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Then they attack his methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept asking this guy over and over</v>

422
00:29:09.741 --> 00:29:13.280
<v Speaker 1>and over again to tell the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

423
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I just told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they took him to the first day.</v>

424
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Tell him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

425
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interrogation.</v>

426
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.880
<v Speaker 1>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't even interested in whether</v>

427
00:29:22.881 --> 00:29:27.881
<v Speaker 1>he could see or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were using him to attack Jesus.</v>

428
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Some of you are up in the battle right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and the battle is even about you.</v>

429
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 1>They are using you to attack somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else around you.</v>

430
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>You might be going through a battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even yours,</v>

431
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.180
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

432
00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like you're getting the say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing.</v>

433
00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 1>They could use his mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill his master</v>

434
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.420
<v Speaker 1>and when the enemy is out to assassinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who was a gifted or noise or</v>

435
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:11.970
<v Speaker 1>promising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will always try to use somebody's</v>

436
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are y'all going to talk to me?</v>

437
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care whether he's blind or</v>

438
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 1>whether he could see they don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he got a job but doesn't have a</v>

439
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care whether he has a future.</v>

440
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I doesn't have a future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep asking them the same</v>

441
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way.</v>

442
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get him to say something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can use to attack Jesus.</v>

443
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't care that he's blind or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can see that he's not here.</v>

444
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 1>They are trying to get him to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then the Bible mentions</v>

445
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.190
<v Speaker 1>that Jesus did it on the Sabbath Day.</v>

446
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from the fact</v>

447
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.020
<v Speaker 2>then he healed him on the Sabbath Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They concluded he is a sinner,</v>

448
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 2>a center.</v>

449
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Jesus was washing clothes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or mended fences.</v>

450
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the Sabbath Day.</v>

451
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Jesus had a conversation and he spit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all he did on the Sabbath Day and</v>

452
00:31:25.681 --> 00:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>from that</v>

453
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 2>they said he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sinner.</v>

454
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.473
<v Speaker 2>He is a sinner.</v>

455
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Once people put a name on the how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate you,</v>

456
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>once they give that hate our name and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name is hateable,</v>

457
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.400
<v Speaker 1>they want to find a category to put you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so that they can hate you better.</v>

458
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.520
<v Speaker 1>When I came here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pastor of this church,</v>

459
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.450
<v Speaker 1>the Lord told me to call it the Potter's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house in the early days of the church.</v>

460
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm about to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the early days,</v>

461
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.740
<v Speaker 1>the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new members are coming to me and they</v>

462
00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:09.260
<v Speaker 1>say they want to know what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>church it is,</v>

463

464
00:32:12.351 --> 00:32:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ame Potter's house,</v>

466
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.370
<v Speaker 1>What kind of church is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to God and I prayed about it.</v>

467
00:32:19.371 --> 00:32:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people want a name for the Potter's</v>

468
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:24.110
<v Speaker 1>house they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to know what kind of church it</v>

469
00:32:24.111 --> 00:32:25.580
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord spoke something to me.</v>

470
00:32:25.581 --> 00:32:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I will never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

471
00:32:27.121 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give him no name because it's a</v>

472
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.080
<v Speaker 1>cage fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

473
00:32:31.081 --> 00:32:36.081
<v Speaker 1>fight the name you gave her</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they got amazing that they could</v>

474
00:32:39.581 --> 00:32:40.300
<v Speaker 1>say</v>

475
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 3>that Jesus wasn't God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't hate Jesus.</v>

476
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.520
<v Speaker 3>But when they said Jesus is a sinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no people who wouldn't have hated him,</v>

477
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 3>no hates him off the label that they put</v>
<v Speaker 3>on him.</v>

478
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden Jesus is up under</v>

479
00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:09.021
<v Speaker 1>this cloud of suspicion that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharisees have created around something</v>

480
00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that he set out to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

481
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm really going to dig down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of Y'all with me.</v>

00:33:40.831 --> 00:33:45.831
<v Speaker 3>with it and then did something good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden all hell breaks loose.</v>

488
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:50.310
<v Speaker 3>As you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how in the world could you attack me?</v>

<v Speaker 1>They said he is a sinner.</v>

494
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.960
<v Speaker 1>When they called him a sinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind man said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>does he live in that night?</v>

537
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Speaker 5>Somebody out of place</v>
<v Speaker 5>that turns water into wine.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What are the goodness of Jesus and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that is done for me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.080
<v Speaker 5>Open your mouth</v>
<v Speaker 5>so people don't like y'all Bible</v>

541
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Church.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you think about what God has done</v>

542
00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:18.630
<v Speaker 5>in your life,</v>

543
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 3>mules to the way we wash them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't think it takes all of that.</v>

544
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460
<v Speaker 3>They think that you should come the</v>
<v Speaker 3>church and the pastor says speech and</v>

545
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:46.921
<v Speaker 3>you should sit there and be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is as long as</v>

546
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I speak and you don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sign.</v>

547
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 3>You're not of age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came to the boy's parents,</v>

548
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 3>parents to speak for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the parents said he's away.</v>

549
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.170
<v Speaker 3>He can speak for himself.</v>

550
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 5>You don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some shakes trump praise</v>

551
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.260
<v Speaker 5>y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lord.</v>

552
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 5>If he he'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't limit you.</v>

553
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 5>Bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hallelujah.</v>

554
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Hallelujah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the lamb</v>

555
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:58.430

<v Speaker 5>something that</v>

556
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 5>know</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

557
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:22.470
<v Speaker 5>You</v>
<v Speaker 5>hear that?</v>

558
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 5>A wax,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can laugh at me.</v>

561
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.830
<v Speaker 5>You can make fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can say it doesn't take all of that,</v>

562
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.380
<v Speaker 5>but you want the one that was blind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want the one that was down.</v>

563
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 5>You weren't the one that was suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You weren't the one that was that job.</v>
