<v Speaker 1>until the next season of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unapologetically getting rid of all</v>

4
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>things people in situations that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer belong in their life.</v>

5
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you,</v>

6
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>you're so consumed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everything that's going on in the</v>

7
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reasons you haven't figured</v>

8
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>out your own life yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every blog,</v>

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that's going on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ignoring your own world.</v>

12
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You can never shine trying to sit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's son.</v>

13
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>You can never figure out who you are if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you consumed and everything that</v>

14
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is and what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the moves that they're making because</v>

15
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to chase someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

16
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to chase someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle and identity all while</v>

17
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>ignoring your own life and your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

18
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>What is the vision for your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the ideas and the dreams for</v>

19
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you supposed to be doing?</v>

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your gifts and talents?</v>

21
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>What is your ultimate destiny and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals</v>

22
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>and you should understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was always going to be your</v>

23
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>family and your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first ones to try and</v>

24
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>talk you out of your vision and your big</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

25
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>That's why you supposed to live your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

26
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>focus on your intentions and do your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

27
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you allow yourself worth to be based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what other people think of you?</v>

28
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Is the beginning of the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in me.</v>

29
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>If you stop believing in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to believe in myself any</v>

30
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that I'm irrelevant,</v>

31
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that no one is checking for me and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean anything to the world</v>

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>because you think or believe that about</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

33
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it about myself.</v>

34
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day that you start living your life</v>

35
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>according to everybody else's opinion is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the hand.</v>

36
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Most of you guys don't actually know</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself or you don't know yourself.</v>

37
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe in yourself.</v>

38
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Believe in yourself independent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>validation of the world.</v>

39
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Have opinions and feelings about</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

40
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.300
<v Speaker 1>independent of the feedback.</v>

41
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I really think,</v>

42
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.500
<v Speaker 1>and if you get rid of the trash in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

43
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that can be people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in situations you too couldn't</v>

44
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that you can reach your</v>

45
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.980
<v Speaker 1>full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you</v>

46
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.930
<v Speaker 1>to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you and your career and your</v>

47
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.590
<v Speaker 1>financial blessings to bypass me.</v>
