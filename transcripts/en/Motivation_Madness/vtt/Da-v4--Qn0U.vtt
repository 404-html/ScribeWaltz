1
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mentality is a really simple one and</v>

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>an assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The confidence comes from preparation,</v>

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the game's on the line,</v>

4
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking myself to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I haven't done it thousands of</v>

5
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>times before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So what are prepare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm capable of doing.</v>

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm comfortable doing and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what I'm not comfortable doing it.</v>

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in those moments,</v>

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>if it looks like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cold or not nervous,</v>

10
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>it's because I've done it thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times before.</v>

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So what's one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So that leads me to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of,</v>

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this colby toward this year in Asia is</v>

14
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>we reiterate the Mamba mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk a little bit about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mamba mentality is because that's</v>

16
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>something that's been developing over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say 20 years.</v>

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's been developing for 35 years since</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a little kid.</v>

19
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That Mamba mentality because you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>start working when you got the damn.</v>

20
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started working when you were at</v>

21
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>lower merion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were in Italy,</v>

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>when you were five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're playing NERF nerf</v>

23
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talking to house,</v>

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>talk about the development of the Mamba</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality.</v>

25
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pillars,</v>

26
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the five pillars of this Mamba</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll kind of break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall,</v>

29
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is a very simple one.</v>

30
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mamba mentality simply means trying</v>

31
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>to be the best version of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the mentality means.</v>

32
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It means every day you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become better.</v>

33
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's a constant quest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an infinite quest.</v>

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>So starting at the age of two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started playing the game</v>

35
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always ask questions.</v>

36
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Always tried to get better every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

37
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Learn more than you're asking questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>at two.</v>

38
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was time.</v>

39
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>You'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people,</v>

40
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>like my kids at two could do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

41
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>At two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could dribble a basketball,</v>

42
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I can shoot a basketball and a nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the house and I would go to</v>

43
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>practice with my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would observe my father.</v>

44
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit and watch games with him.</v>

45
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Is He your first coach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.761
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

47
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things I learned by being just</v>
<v Speaker 1>being around the game.</v>

49
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the age of six,</v>

50
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I was already strategizing versus other</v>
<v Speaker 1>six year olds.</v>

51
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just six I figured out six year</v>

52
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>olds couldn't dribble with their left</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

53
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

54
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>a lot of a lot of 12 year olds can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>dribble with their [inaudible] would</v>

55
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>imagine six.</v>

56
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So like I was playing in the six year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old kids,</v>

57
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I would make them dribble with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>left because I knew they couldn't.</v>

58
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And so the dribble off the rear foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd pick it up,</v>

59
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>lay it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again,</v>

60
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>drove off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick it up later.</v>

61
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.610
<v Speaker 1>So at six years old it had 63 points</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

62
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember my,</v>

63
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>so your six year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six year old self could beat,</v>

64
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a 38 year old selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only scored 16 the last game.</v>

65
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

66
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but I could do it with my left toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>

67
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

68
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:52.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

69
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I just constantly looked for things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from.</v>

70
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very observant.</v>

71
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about this love,</v>

72
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>when does it develop what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you like it when you were five or is</v>

73
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it something that kind of gradually not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

74
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.550
<v Speaker 1>it was born.</v>

75
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I was born to play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

76
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And I played a lot of different sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>but nothing brought me the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

78
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>of peace and of escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that the game of basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it an escape when you get on the</v>

80
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>court?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that your zen time?</v>

81
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:27.844
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

82
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you're solid two times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a team working.</v>

83
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I need that escape,</v>

84
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>it's there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

85
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>When I need a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there for me.</v>

86
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to vent and don't dog in the Mama</v>

87
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>comes to stare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

88
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is absolutely everything.</v>

89
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

90
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about trying to get kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be passionate,</v>

91
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think every kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think your situation is the</v>

92
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not every kid is,</v>

93
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>knows they're passionate too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're fine.</v>

94
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do kids find that passion then?</v>

95
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

96
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because you,</v>

97
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you embraced it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think experience,</v>

98
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>we try to put them in different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to expose them to as many things as</v>

99
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>possible and then see if there's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that connects with them,</v>

100
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it does,</v>

101
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to tell them to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>whether it's writing or painting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing,</v>

103
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have that passion,</v>

104
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to tell them they're go</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and do it because it's just fun.</v>

105
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He'd rather do that than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

106
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but as parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our job to just expose them to as</v>

107
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>many things as possible and see which</v>
<v Speaker 1>one they gravitate to the most.</v>

108
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked about kits,</v>

109
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally we were talking about you and</v>

110
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>now you're talking about your kids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their passions.</v>

111
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you kind of feel that passion for</v>

112
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>them and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

113
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>let's go play some basketball or</v>
<v Speaker 1>volleyball or let's go swimming.</v>

114
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>We expose them to all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>they play a lot of different sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of things creatively,</v>

116
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in writing and things like that and</v>

117
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>designing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just sit back and you just watch</v>

118
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>which one they moved to and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>our responsibility as parents to try to</v>

119
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>set them up for success as much as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>

120
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to play basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to find whatever it is that</v>

121
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>they're passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever they feel like their</v>

122
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's what I want them to do.</v>

134
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>defined your passion for basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a story or moment when you said</v>

143
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>game of basketball I've carried over</v>
<v Speaker 1>into life,</v>

144
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like basketball has helped me be a</v>

145
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>better person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better friend,</v>

146
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.510
<v Speaker 1>a better well because there's life</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons that are within the game,</v>

147
00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>like communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like unselfishness,</v>

148
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>like attention to detail and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy and compassion.</v>

149
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Like all those things are in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an athlete,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it helps us become better human human</v>

152
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can apply that toward your</v>

153
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 1>posts,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean you can apply,</v>

157
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was applying that,</v>

158
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even while I was playing just in life</v>

159
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 1>outside of the game and even more so now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:45.461
<v Speaker 1>all those things are or directly learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the game of basketball.</v>

163
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.410
<v Speaker 2>A next step is the next pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Obsessive,</v>

164
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I think a,</v>

165
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people equate that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

166
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colby is obsessive in a lot of things.</v>

167
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing this for what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years now?</v>

168
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Asia tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I've been with you for a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

170
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Speaker 2>the one moment that stands out out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done,</v>

171
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done 800 events.</v>

172
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.510
<v Speaker 2>The one time was 4:00 AM we went up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice at 4:00 AM and that was your</v>

173
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 2>idea to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

174
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 2>all these Nike people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

175
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:19.811
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

176
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:20.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

177
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.070
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not do that.</v>

178
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it at 4:00 AM.</v>

179
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 2>So you've got security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got brand marketing,</v>

180
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 2>sports marketing going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

181
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:25.961
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

182
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:26.201
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

183
00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:26.501
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

184
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:27.191
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

185
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:30.940
<v Speaker 2>let's do it because that's your</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessment is right to me.</v>

186
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 2>It just makes complete sense and not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

187
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to like</v>

188
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 2>see we all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually I'm sleeping at 4:00 AM you're,</v>

189
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>you're working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So talk about that.</v>

190
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

191
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your job is to try to be the best</v>

192
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>basketball player you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

193
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to train,</v>

194
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to train as much as you can,</v>

195
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>as often as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get up at 10 in the morning,</v>

196
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>train at 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

197
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>12 say 12 and Trina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 train for two hours,</v>

198
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:03.314
<v Speaker 1>12 to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

199
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to let your body recover.</v>

200
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recovered,</v>

201
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get back out,</v>

202
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start training and at six train from six</v>

203
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>to eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And now you go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

205
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>eat dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go to bed.</v>

206
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:15.910
<v Speaker 1>You wake up and do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

207
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Those are two sessions right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you wake up at three you train</v>

208
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>at four 46 come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

209
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.091
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

210
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>so now you're back at it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine to 11 right,</v>

211
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

212
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And now all of a sudden you're back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it again.</v>

213
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Two to four and now you're back at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

214
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven to nine.</v>

215
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Look how much more training I have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>by simply starting at four.</v>

216
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you do that and as the years</v>

217
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the separation that you have with your</v>

218
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>competitors and your peers just grows</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger and larger and larger</v>

219
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>and larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by year five or six,</v>

220
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what kind of work</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing in summer,</v>

221
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to catch up cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're five years behind.</v>

222
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense to get up and start</v>

223
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>your day early because you can get more</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in.</v>

224
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that genetic or is that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

225
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>you ingrained in trained yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

226
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>it was just you that for me it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just common sense.</v>

227
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

228
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>if I start earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can train more hours and I know the</v>

229
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>other guys aren't doing it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what their training schedule is.</v>

230
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know if I do this consistently over</v>

231
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the gaps just going to widen and</v>

232
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>widen and widen and widen and widen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't be able to get that bag.</v>

233
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it was just common sense.</v>

234
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I get an advantage?</v>

235
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start earlier.</v>

236
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do that.</v>

237
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 1>When did you start doing that?</v>

238
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>High School.</v>

239
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>High School.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we started,</v>

240
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 1>my first class in high school is seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>at seven 45.</v>

241
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.891
<v Speaker 1>I usually get to the gym around 5:00 AM</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd played before school and then</v>

242
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>school starts and then with you at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM my coach and my coach was show up and</v>

243
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>we'd do all these basketball drills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

244
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So just you and your coach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just me and my coach.</v>

245
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it would just be me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the janitor who's still there today.</v>

246
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

247
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and then I play at lunchtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a medal.</v>

248
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I hooked him up with a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I played during lunch and then</v>

249
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>practice after and then go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do my schoolwork and then watch a bunch</v>

250
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:17.190
<v Speaker 1>of game film and Games on TV and study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>study film.</v>

251
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Was that the only thing you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessed about basketball?</v>

252
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until recently?</v>

253
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until recently.</v>

254
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basketball dominated,</v>

255
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

256
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my entire life more than 30 years when,</v>

257
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

258
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>when I brought it up like what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it genetic or you just learned it?</v>

259
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

260
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 1>how did that idea even come up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's obviously a pillar of</v>

261
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Mamba mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The obsessiveness is just like you said,</v>

262
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get up at four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's get up at six.</v>

263
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>If everybody's going to get up at four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get him in too.</v>

264
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.843
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

265
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you develop that or what do you,</v>

266
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>what do you learn that from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

267
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of what's important</v>

268
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's important to you for whatever</v>

269
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

271
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel good about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I wasn't doing everything I could to</v>

272
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>be the best version of myself.</v>

273
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>If I felt like I left anything on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

274
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would eat away at me.</v>

275
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to look myself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

276
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason why I can retire now and</v>

277
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>be completely comfortable about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know that I've done everything</v>

278
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I could to be the best basketball player</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be.</v>

279
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's where it comes from for</v>

280
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't leave any stone unturned,</v>

281
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but the important thing to understand is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

282
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't short change yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

283
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not cheating anybody but</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

284
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tired.</v>

285
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You're literally this far away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

286
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not go that extra to touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line?</v>

287
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I let them get away with that,</v>

288
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he starts maybe a cheat,</v>

289
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.770
<v Speaker 1>something over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

290
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And not give his best over here and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>give his best over.</v>

291
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Then as years go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be extremely,</v>

292
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to reach his full</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential because he's been taking these</v>

293
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 1>little shortcuts that just add up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>

294
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam add up and you can't let that</v>

295
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our job as teachers,</v>

296
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>as mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as inspires,</v>

297
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it's our responsibility to hold them</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable to those things.</v>

298
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>The funny part is we were were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this kid,</v>

299
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 1>we in the back and coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

300
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I bet you that kid will never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever missed the line again.</v>

301
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that wasn't no way that</v>

302
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that's you being obsessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but teaching obsessiveness because</v>

303
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you got to be.</v>

304
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be obsessive to get to</v>

305
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 1>that level and everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>details don't waste time.</v>

306
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

307
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like whatever you're doing at</v>

309
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that moment is what you're doing at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

310
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's where the obsessiveness</v>

311
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having the attention to detail for this</v>

312
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 1>action that you are performing at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're performing it.</v>

313
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you can have that kind of focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but to have a certain</v>

314
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 1>level of obsession or attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

315
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Moving on to the third pillar is a to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm relentless that we know you for.</v>

316
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see you on TV being relentless,</v>

317
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>first quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second quarter,</v>

318
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>third quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth quarter attack,</v>

319
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

320
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>never letting your teammates slack off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

321
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:20.134
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

322
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>How do you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about what is,</v>

323
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 1>what is the meaning of relentlessness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

324
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is to never to be unyielding.</v>

325
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Never give an inch to anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always going after it.</v>

326
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Always going after all he's going after</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

327
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a challenge that ensues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good.</v>

328
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to see how I stack up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go after and go after it and</v>

329
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:41.284
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get a chance to compete</v>

331
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:48.661
<v Speaker 1>against opponents and you get a chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see where you stack up against them.</v>

332
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>

333
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm not good enough today with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

334
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be good enough the next time I see</v>

335
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>and you get a chance to always measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and um,</v>

337
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fun to do that.</v>

338
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's where relentlessness</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

339
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it something that's also learned or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained or is it something you kind of</v>

340
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 1>learned over time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

341
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>because these things that we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a Mama and tality,</v>

342
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's second nature.</v>

344
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

345
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trained or it's not God given know</v>

346
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.753
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

347
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as well though,</v>

348
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.000
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a year of playing,</v>

349
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:32.600
<v Speaker 1>like when I played basketball in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taller than everybody else and</v>

350
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.580
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

351
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.670
<v Speaker 1>like the age of 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came back to America to play</v>

352
00:14:37.671 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 1>basketball and it was not the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because kids were bigger,</v>

353
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:43.110
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went through a summer of</v>

354
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.650
<v Speaker 1>playing basketball in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't score one point,</v>

355
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.310
<v Speaker 1>it was one league.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't score one point and it was</v>

356
00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:51.050
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

357
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

358
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what to happen.</v>

359
00:14:54.211 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 1>So you bounced back and you keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

360
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>You keep practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep practicing.</v>

361
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it wasn't handed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't score one point,</v>

362
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>not one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not even a free flow.</v>

363
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And you are zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are held 11,</v>

364
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you were playing against 25 year</v>

365
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:06.831
<v Speaker 1>olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

366
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I was playing against 11 grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing against.</v>

367
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

368
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was playing against 11 year olds</v>

369
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.470
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't score one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what was that?</v>

370
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Did that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

371
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.050
<v Speaker 1>it hurt you or you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

372
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it was very embarrassing because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>my father was a Philadelphia basketball</v>
<v Speaker 1>legend.</v>

374
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 1>My uncle was in Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball legend.</v>

375
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And now here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid,</v>

376
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.860
<v Speaker 1>like he's really big knee pads and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around and I can't score it</v>

377
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like really embarrassing.</v>

378
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 1>That drove you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it did.</v>

379
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vowed to be much,</v>

380
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you live for those moments where</v>

381
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you're embarrassed when you're down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People kick,</v>

382
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't let you score.</v>

383
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are the moments that drive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

384
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are the moments that occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

385
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.050
<v Speaker 1>So whatever moments occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

386
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>bad or indifferent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can use those moments to propel me</v>

387
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use those as fuel to,</v>

388
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help me be a better player.</v>

389
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Is there a moment in your Mba career</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you felt like you didn't hit that</v>

390
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:05.750
<v Speaker 1>mark and that was a huge transition for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

391
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like I missed the marks,</v>

392
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the league.</v>

393
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were some of the down moments for</v>

394
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 1>you in basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Losing to the Celtics in the finance in</v>

395
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:16.851
<v Speaker 1>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

396
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.810
<v Speaker 1>that was tough and that hurt me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal at night in the hotel room</v>

398
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 1>after we lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thinking to myself,</v>

399
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I may never win another championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I might've just like,</v>

400
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

401
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard to get back here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not in the car is to win</v>

402
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 1>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I go through that night or being</v>

403
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next morning I wake up and they</v>

404
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 1>start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

405
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I gotta fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where did it go wrong?</v>

406
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Why did we lose or we weren't tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

407
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weren't tough enough.</v>

408
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Whose responsibility is that to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>team?</v>

409
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 1>It's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

410
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 1>So now I have to start figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lead this team differently</v>

411
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that when we get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>finals the next time we were tough and</v>

412
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:01.080
<v Speaker 1>ready for this challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

413
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you bounce back from those</v>

414
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:07.370
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 2008 2008 2008 against the</v>

415
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Celtics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

416
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 1>all of Laker nation was hurt because</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because it was against the</v>

417
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Celtics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

418
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Kid was paint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtics.</v>

419
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 1>He can't lose celtics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

420
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like,</v>

421
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.063
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 1>because also that was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their like 17th right.</v>

423
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 1>For their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their organization.</v>

424
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And only talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about that.</v>

425
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 1>And then you bounced back the next year</v>
<v Speaker 1>against a Orlando,</v>

426
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Orlando or [inaudible] got her revenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Celtics in 2010.</v>

427
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The beating the Celtics feel better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating Orlando?</v>

428
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

429
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

430
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:44.843
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

431
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up such a lakers fan and so like</v>

432
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>the Lakers and Celtics rivalries Hatim</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything hate him.</v>

433
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way I can be on a team</v>

434
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>when a Lakers team that loses to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtics twice.</v>

435
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.383
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

436
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny,</v>

437
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.920
<v Speaker 2>in in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me being here in Asia to a lot of,</v>

438
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.130
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fans are fans of a player and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

439
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:10.060
<v Speaker 2>they loved that player and subsequently</v>
<v Speaker 2>late,</v>

440
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.280
<v Speaker 2>they loved that team that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that player plays for.</v>

441
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.820
<v Speaker 2>But growing up in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you grew up in Philly,</v>

442
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you are a sixers fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

443
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And then if you grew up in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were a lakers fan.</v>

444
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.010
<v Speaker 2>You are also a dodgers fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time you are a rams fan.</v>

445
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 2>You are affiliated with your city and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the city that you hate,</v>

446
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it was your arch enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you a Laker fan,</v>

447
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.480
<v Speaker 2>you just hate the Celtics and you hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>every team,</v>

448
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 2>every team that loses you root for every</v>
<v Speaker 2>team against the Celtics.</v>

449
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

450
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.210
<v Speaker 2>the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to see them do bed.</v>

451
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do batch.</v>

452
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.940
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a dodger fan,</v>

453
00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you just want to see the giants lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

454
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's not necessarily good Karma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

455
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.710
<v Speaker 2>But when you lost to the Celtics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you beat him again.</v>

456
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.100
<v Speaker 2>That moment that that's relentless</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you come get them back,</v>

457
00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:59.500
<v Speaker 2>coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back and you had to come back and</v>

458
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:02.530
<v Speaker 2>beat the case on their court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't give up and then it was there.</v>

459
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.110
<v Speaker 2>It was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that a big moment for you beating,</v>

460
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:06.670
<v Speaker 2>beating the Celtics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was used,</v>

461
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

462
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seen,</v>

463

<v Speaker 1>2008 POW Lamar,</v>

465
00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>like how much we have grown since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time you faced this team.</v>

466
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be any more proud of them.</v>

467
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even about me.</v>

468
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It was about sitting back and watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>us as a group and we just accomplished</v>

469
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:32.680
<v Speaker 1>this amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

470
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.340
<v Speaker 1>now we can all enjoy it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

471
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 2>moving on to the next pillar is to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>resilient.</v>

472
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this time last year you came</v>

473
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

474
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 2>we did a premier for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a movie you did moves and a big,</v>

475
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 2>a big part of that movie was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your injury and coming back to be</v>

476
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 2>resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

477
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.830
<v Speaker 2>take us back to that day against a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix,</v>

478
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:56.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

479
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Your Gear Achilles is golden state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

480
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard,</v>

481
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Achilles injury is the worst</v>

482
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 1>injury for an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the word.</v>

483
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the kiss of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I ruptured my Achilles,</v>

484
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I knew what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew the severity of the injury and I</v>

485
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 1>didn't know if I was going to come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

486
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the locker room you were crying.</v>

487
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

488
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like my career could be over right</v>

489
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get back from that?</v>

490
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about injuries,</v>

491
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spraying their ankles,</v>

492
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.770
<v Speaker 1>dislocate your fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a Kaylee's yeah.</v>

493
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 1>People don't come back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well please don't come back from that to</v>

494
00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Speaker 1>the level they were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

495
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.703
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is,</v>

496
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>how do you get that resilience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you fight that?</v>

497
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did is I went home and I was just</v>

498
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>really angry and I'm angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was angry,</v>

499
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.853
<v Speaker 1>was mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was angry.</v>

500
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I worked so hard for us to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>playoffs and to have a chance to win</v>

501
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:52.960
<v Speaker 1>another championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this happened.</v>

502
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So I had a lot of anger and a then from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anger and then I was sad.</v>

503
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you start feeling bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and then you say,</v>

504
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.913
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

505
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm done being a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

506
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.650
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't sit here and give up.</v>

507
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what,</v>

508
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.850
<v Speaker 1>how long was the cycle from this anger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One night.</v>

509
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>One night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One night.</v>

510
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 1>It was because you started writing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle,</v>

511
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote that,</v>

512
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:20.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

513
00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrote that and then it was,</v>

514
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:22.774
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

515
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:24.971
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

516
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.040
<v Speaker 1>it was one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

517
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 1>then you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a process.</v>

519
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 1>You look at process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

520
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 1>What can I control surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do the surgery,</v>

521
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 1>come out of the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from their physical therapy.</v>

522
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physical therapy piece by piece,</v>

523
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:42.251
<v Speaker 1>by piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by piece,</v>

524
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 1>by piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start running back when a court.</v>

525
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I broke things down into sections</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

526
00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to focus on resting right now.</v>

527
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to focus on moving my toes and</v>

528
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 1>then walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at every challenge at</v>

529
00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>every step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you're able to be</v>

530
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 1>resilient and come back from these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

531
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.473
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

532
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your field in a,</v>

533
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>in sports injuries often happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

534
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

535
00:22:12.821 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most everyday people,</v>

536
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that they can't fathom</v>

537
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 2>because they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that type of resilience</v>

538
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Speaker 2>resistance that they have to face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

539
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>So how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they come back from it?</v>

540
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes people fail in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields and their jobs or at school,</v>

541
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 2>young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a good test score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make the basketball team or</v>

543
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these disappointments.</v>

544
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your advice to young kids to,</v>

545
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

546
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 2>to face the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this adversity.</v>

547
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 2>How do you persevere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

548
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that chemical makeup to fight</v>

549
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all kids do,</v>

550
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.020
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

551
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you every kid,</v>

552
00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:53.030
<v Speaker 1>every person has the ability to put one</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot in front of the other one step at a</v>

553
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:53.571
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

554
00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:55.160
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

555
00:22:55.161 --> 00:22:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to climb Mount Everest is at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the mountain and you look</v>

556
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.830
<v Speaker 1>up and you go in and I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb Mount Everest,</v>

557
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you break it down into sections</v>

558
00:23:04.401 --> 00:23:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and you just one foot in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other one step at a time,</v>

559
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.500
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know you're at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain.</v>

560
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.990
<v Speaker 2>So the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the map,</v>

561
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plan is to set short term goals and</v>

562
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.470
<v Speaker 2>to get there eight to be,</v>

563
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 1>let's see it coming back from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>Achilles.</v>

564
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I came back from the Achilles and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine and then the next year I fractured</v>

565
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 1>my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

566
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go again.</v>

567
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Come back from that next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tear my shoulder.</v>

568
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Here we go again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

569
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>But if I looked at those things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>totality,</v>

570
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>it'd be depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I look at it as just the facts,</v>

571
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it happened,</v>

572
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 1>can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>

573
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Now what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One step at a time,</v>

574
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 1>a Keeley's knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>

575
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Any step of the way you said screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>

576
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Done no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

577
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one know your why.</v>

578
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

579
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 1>as time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there,</v>

580
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm 78 years old and I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering if I could have come back from</v>

581
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 1>this injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to wonder.</v>

582
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to get to that second point.</v>

583
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.331
<v Speaker 1>I want to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

584
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 1>We want to get to that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The critics are out there saying he's</v>

585
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll never come back.</v>

586
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're right.</v>

587
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's find out.</v>

588
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.150
<v Speaker 2>We got to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get there.</v>

589
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Last one to be fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

590
00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:26.770
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that,</v>

591
00:24:26.771 --> 00:24:28.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every young adult,</v>

592
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 2>young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they face their fears,</v>

593
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

594
00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fearless?</v>

595
00:24:34.151 --> 00:24:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Why is that such an important part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mamba mentality?</v>

596
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>

597
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I think the greatest fear that we face</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ourselves.</v>

598
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

599
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:45.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not anything that's external or</v>

600
00:24:45.721 --> 00:24:48.160
<v Speaker 1>anything that's superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the greatest fear you face is</v>

601
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:50.070
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

602
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>we all have dreams and it's very scary</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to accept the dream that you</v>

603
00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:57.600
<v Speaker 1>have and it's secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still to say,</v>

604
00:24:57.601 --> 00:24:59.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>

605
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It's scary because you're afraid that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your heart and soul into it and</v>

606
00:25:04.231 --> 00:25:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how are you going to feel about</v>

607
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

608
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>So being fearless means putting yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and going forward no matter</v>

609
00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:14.310
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>

610
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Not for anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for yourself,</v>

611
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.240
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

612
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.950
<v Speaker 2>when you got to the league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were 18,</v>

613
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.090
<v Speaker 2>did you have any fears before getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there or when you got that right away?</v>

614
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

615
00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had fears that everybody was going to</v>

616
00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:30.910
<v Speaker 1>be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a poor choice,</v>

617
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 1>poor decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't too,</v>

618
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to amount to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was always in the back of my</v>

619
00:25:37.391 --> 00:25:40.000
<v Speaker 1>mind for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

620
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.360
<v Speaker 1>so out of these five pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one do you think comes first?</v>

621
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Be Passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fearless,</v>

622
00:25:47.681 --> 00:25:49.760
<v Speaker 1>relentless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resilient or,</v>

623
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:51.070
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they just come together.</v>

624
00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll know it's this funny thing is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we created the separate pillars,</v>

625
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it's all one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.520
<v Speaker 1>cause it all comes from within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes from within us.</v>

627
00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:03.190
<v Speaker 1>We all experienced these things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>different stages in different points,</v>

628
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:05.020
<v Speaker 1>different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

629
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 1>the key I feel it's just to be aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those moments as they occur.</v>

630
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're aware of a certain fear or um,</v>

631
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Speaker 1>a certain obstacle or challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

632
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You're just aware of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there you can navigate</v>

633
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 1>through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

634
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.610
<v Speaker 1>but I look at more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at them all as one,</v>

635
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.940
<v Speaker 1>one connecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

636
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 1>thing because I think pink</v>

637
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:30.090
<v Speaker 2>being fearless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last one sticks out in my mind a</v>

638
00:26:30.091 --> 00:26:31.590
<v Speaker 2>lot because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

639
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an Asia Asian kits,</v>

640
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they're little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxed in,</v>

641
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.850
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in thought and mentality as opposed to</v>

642
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>western kits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>western kits,</v>

643
00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 2>the lot of the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment.</v>

644
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since a young age in school,</v>

645
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's preaching independence.</v>

646
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Speak your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be creative,</v>

647
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:54.361
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>

650
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also reiterated by teachers,</v>

651
00:26:56.491 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 2>principals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.200
<v Speaker 2>mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and coaches is to bring name to yourself</v>

653
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:05.640
<v Speaker 2>and to be independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be out there and go on your own.</v>

654
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in eastern,</v>

655
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 2>in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the cultures,</v>

656
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>

657
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

658
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go out there and do crazy things.</v>

659
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Don't go out of your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring,</v>

660
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 2>make your family proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

661
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't bring other people attention.</v>

662
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Just do your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it well,</v>

663
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but don't bring attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

664
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of kids are fearful of</v>

665
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 2>going out of this box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

666
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Is there a vice for these kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of times it's a cultural</v>

667
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

668
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how,</v>

669
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>

670
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 2>how did they put themselves out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

671
00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

672
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 1>so you have to dance beautifully in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>box that you are comfortable dancing.</v>

673
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like everybody's box is different.</v>

674
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 1>My box was to be extremely ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the sport of basketball.</v>

675
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You're box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different than mine,</v>

676
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every kid here has her own box.</v>

677
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't mean that your box isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>as beautiful as mine.</v>

678
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has their own.</v>

679
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It's your job to try to perfect it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it as beautiful of a canvas as you</v>

680
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 1>can make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have done that,</v>

681
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.640
<v Speaker 1>then you have lived a successful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have lived with Mamba mentality.</v>

682
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't mean you have to go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and do all of these crazy things.</v>

683
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:17.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to be like this person or that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

684
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you comfortable being?</v>

685
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>What it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you want to do with your</v>

686
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you have that,</v>

687
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.110
<v Speaker 1>then you're trying to live it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best of your ability.</v>

688
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

689
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up in Italy and then moving on</v>

690
00:28:30.801 --> 00:28:34.250
<v Speaker 2>to Philadelphia and then to La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:28:34.251 --> 00:28:35.990
<v Speaker 2>obviously you talk about this box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

692
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.470
<v Speaker 2>So is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that box constantly changing?</v>

693
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Are you trying to get out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort zone even when you were first</v>

694
00:28:45.071 --> 00:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>year of the Mba and then 10th year in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NBA and then even this year,</v>

695
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.720
<v Speaker 2>there's that box that this metaphorical</v>
<v Speaker 2>box you talk about.</v>

696
00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Does that change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

697
00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never looked at it as like,</v>

698
00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just looked at it as</v>

701
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to be one of the best basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>players who have ever played.</v>

702
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the end goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

703
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.590
<v Speaker 2>how do I get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I get there?</v>

704
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:15.591
<v Speaker 2>And every decision I made in my life was</v>
<v Speaker 2>centered around the process of helping</v>

705
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 2>me eventually get there.</v>

706
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had that purpose and once I had</v>

707
00:29:20.271 --> 00:29:22.880
<v Speaker 1>that purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every decision that I made was centered.</v>

708
00:29:22.881 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Around that purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you got there looking back</v>

710
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>upon it now,</v>

714
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

715
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 2>is that your biggest accomplishment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be one team.</v>

716
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you look back upon it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had your goals as a kid,</v>

718
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you're five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to be in the NBA and then</v>

719
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 2>when you're at lower Merion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia and those dreams started to</v>

720
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

721
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

722
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're in the NBA,</v>

723
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you set goals for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk about all the time when you're</v>

724
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 2>young in the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you set personal achievement goals.</v>

725
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win a game and win and win</v>
<v Speaker 2>a championship.</v>

726
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win the MVP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win this,</v>

727
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win back.</v>

728
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 2>And then later on you changed because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

729
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I,</v>

730
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to get a better left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have better three point,</v>

731
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a better free throw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those other personal achievements come</v>

732
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 2>naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're done played your final game,</v>

733
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:21.730
<v Speaker 2>60 points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dropped it on Utah,</v>

734
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Mamba Out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

735
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look back upon it now.</v>

736
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Where do you see yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

737
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 2>did you do everything you wanted to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you become the best,</v>

738
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>best bass player you can ever become?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you become the best?</v>

739
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my vision of what my goal is changed</v>

740
00:30:42.871 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 1>drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I got older,</v>

741
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I like as a kid I said I want to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best ever.</v>

742
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you go through your life and</v>

743
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.580
<v Speaker 1>everything you do is try to be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would be the best?</v>

744
00:30:50.581 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 1>That would be the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you get older you start</v>

745
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 1>understanding that those things are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial things and everybody has a</v>

746
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 1>different opinion about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>

747
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I can win 20 championships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always an opinion on who's the</v>

748
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has different opinions.</v>

749
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.330
<v Speaker 1>And so I started really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

750
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:10.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe important thing is to know how do</v>

751
00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 1>we as a team grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I help my teammates be better?</v>

752
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first change for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got older,</v>

753
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 1>still it became more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

754
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 1>how are you inspiring others to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves?</v>

755
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.610
<v Speaker 1>That is the ultimate championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So won five championships,</v>

756
00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another team won a championship this</v>

757
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.360
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teams going to championship next year.</v>

758
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Those things come and they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with stays is how do you use your</v>

759
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:43.321
<v Speaker 1>passion and use that to inspire somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else to create their passion and then</v>

760
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Speaker 1>how can they pass that on to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

761
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.760
<v Speaker 1>That is true success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

762
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 1>so my goals have changed drastically</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time I was six years old to the</v>

763
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 1>time I was 17 at the time I was 25 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now sitting here at 37.</v>

764
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 2>So now you left the game of basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here in Shanghai.</v>

765
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to end our talk today</v>

766
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.443
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

767
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>we've gone a little bit past our limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think everybody is very happy to</v>

768
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 2>be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think they learned a lot about the</v>

769
00:32:09.431 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 2>member Mamba mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

770
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

771
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 2>what's next for you?</v>

772
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always teaching the game,</v>

773
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.480
<v Speaker 1>teaching the game through various ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

774
00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:22.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do camps and clinics,</v>

775
00:32:22.431 --> 00:32:25.250
<v Speaker 1>we do those things and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also through storytelling,</v>

776
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you,</v>

777
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.130
<v Speaker 1>how can you share stories with the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world that challenges them to</v>

778
00:32:31.131 --> 00:32:35.210
<v Speaker 1>look internally and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to learn things like process and</v>

779
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.180
<v Speaker 1>learn how to navigate the sense of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these things.</v>

780
00:32:38.181 --> 00:32:42.980
<v Speaker 1>How can you infuse into entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a way that pushes our culture and</v>

781
00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:44.470
<v Speaker 1>our society forward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

782
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>those are the questions that I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really intrigued by and that's what</v>

783
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>we'll focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

784
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:50.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koby Bryant.</v>
