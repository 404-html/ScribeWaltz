1
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>When people don't do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because they can't.</v>

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not even because they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It's because of the way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focusing on what I call chunking things.</v>

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>When people don't follow through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what they do.</v>

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who here believes exercise is very</v>

6
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>important but you don't exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly?</v>

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me see a show of hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand more hands than most of</v>

8
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>us want to raise your hand right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who here was really focuses or I should</v>

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>say exercises regularly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Regulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who here does not exercise regularly</v>

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>even though you believe it's important</v>
<v Speaker 1>just beach with.</v>

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what the difference is</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>A person who does not exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly,</v>

16
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I want you to raise your hand and I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to tell me why you don't exercise</v>

17
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>regularly would be truthful.</v>

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>

19
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the top guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

20
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He even knows it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to answer your first.</v>

21
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if feels like he doesn't have the</v>

22
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause time is emotion and he's got so</v>

23
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>many other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is focused on getting results in the,</v>

24
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>adding this to the list seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

25
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other things are very important</v>

26
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess business,</v>

27
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has the time.</v>

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>What's the real reason he doesn't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the way he thinks about</v>

29
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he focuses on what it would take to</v>

30
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does it very differently than someone</v>

31
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>who follows through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about exercising,</v>

32
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:35.301
<v Speaker 1>what's involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

33
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Starts thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get to mile 14 or the London</v>

34
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>marathon and that even the font of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to the 14th mile,</v>

35
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>much less the 25th mile is like beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>my imagination right now.</v>

36
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So he is what I call over chunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not thinking about what he wants.</v>

37
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking about what's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just saw a perfect example.</v>

38
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>He's not even thinking about victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're succeeding.</v>

39
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So the chance of him following through</v>
<v Speaker 1>on something that he associates major</v>

40
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>pain too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you can do something else right</v>

41
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can feel competent or successful.</v>

42
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>APP is chances of falling through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>very limited.</v>

43
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>How many would follow that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Aye.</v>

44
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>His focus is on failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His focuses on pain.</v>

45
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why he isn't following through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

46
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>He's also focused on the 14th mile of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon rather than today's workout.</v>

47
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Which one seems more daunting to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you think of what is,</v>

48
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and here's also what he's thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

49
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking about the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the outcome or result he wants.</v>

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about what it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the do something,</v>

51
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>usually it takes a lot and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to want to do it.</v>

52
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So he's over chunked himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to eat the whale hall</v>

53
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>without taking any smaller bites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems too big for him.</v>

54
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:55.621 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it when later down my friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say later,</v>

56
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with doing it tomorrow is</v>

57
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>when you get to tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow's Today.</v>

58
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow never comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you keep promising yourself,</v>

59
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this do to you emotionally</v>

60
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>when you keep breaking your own promises</v>
<v Speaker 1>with yourself or you keep failing to do</v>

61
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>things that you know are important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it increase your lens?</v>

62
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Some of certainty and confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what it does?</v>

63
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you rode competency in one</v>

64
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.131
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

65
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>it affects the other areas to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me on that.</v>

66
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about your own life experience?</v>

67
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not one area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it starts to be multiple areas.</v>

68
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>It sure does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another reason why somebody has an</v>

69
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:42.301
<v Speaker 1>exercise or do anything is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just chunk it too big a chunk it</v>

70
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>into many details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a perfect example.</v>

71
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>So I asked somebody one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

72
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

73
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>how important is exercises?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>exercise is extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

75
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.451
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

76
00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And tell me why don't you exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>regularly?</v>

77
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I just don't have time.</v>

78
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gives that answer.</v>

79
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That sounds wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me though,</v>

80
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me about how much time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have,</v>

81
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>tell me this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about exercising,</v>

82
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a way of saying what do you</v>

83
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>focus on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this woman says to me,</v>

84
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>well my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

86
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>When I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

88
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>you got to start exercising and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put a gun to the head of your</v>

89
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>children and I will do very horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and hurt them badly.</v>

90
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>If you don't exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you do it?</v>

91
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do it.</v>

92
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

93
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some mafia person came here and said,</v>

94
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't exercise every day,</v>

95
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>how many things you can find a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise everyday no matter what your</v>

96
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>time constraints may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember this,</v>

97
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>remember this change is never a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ability.</v>

98
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It's always a matter of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that again.</v>

99
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Change is never a matter of ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a matter of motivation or</v>

100
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having strong enough reasons.</v>

101
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you could figure out the</v>

102
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.424
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't you?</v>

103
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest part of life and time</v>
<v Speaker 1>management is knowing what you want and</v>

104
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>having enough reasons to follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is one more piece.</v>

105
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>If you make enough reason to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and you'll you want,</v>

106
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but you make the task overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be overwhelmed.</v>

107
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>So I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget what I said,</v>

108
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>let's just say you really going to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising.</v>

109
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do it regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you do it?</v>

110
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

111
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>What's involved with exercising?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's involved with exercise?</v>

112
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.521
<v Speaker 1>What do you focus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

113
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to work out regularly,</v>

114
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

115
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to find a club to join.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

116
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we watch it goes well,</v>

117
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>but you want to know the whole process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

118
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the whole process of what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would take an extra.</v>

119
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:38.771
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

120
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

121
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.391
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to,</v>

122
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to get on the web and search</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like all the exercise places around</v>

123
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>my home and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to look through those and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see which one's probably closest or</v>

125
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>which one is probably the nicest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really know.</v>

126
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So I probably have to search on the web</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like read about it,</v>

127
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>each of them and get a sense and see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of the place.</v>

128
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's never that way.</v>

129
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>They really show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always should have the best</v>

130
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really that nice.</v>

131
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So then I have to get in my car and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to find these places so you don't</v>

132
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>have to google the location and look it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

133
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I drive the I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times instructions are wrong on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>

135
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>So sure enough I get the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even the right place.</v>

136
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And then they have to coldplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's cell phone there.</v>

137
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>If they're called the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write down the directions.</v>

138
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably don't have a pen.</v>

139
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is when you're driving.</v>

140
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And so finally I get a pen and I drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the directions or try to remember</v>

141
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get to the place and now I've got</v>

142
00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>to get a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how you get that ticket?</v>

143
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I gotta go find a parking space</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then find a parking space.</v>

144
00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Then what do I going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go into this place and when you</v>

145
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>go on the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just go look around.</v>

146
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 1>They want to escort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay.</v>

147
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Some salesperson wants to score it me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got to go with the salesperson.</v>

148
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 1>They walked me around and they show me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the locker room and they show me this</v>

149
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and they show me that and they show me</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff and then let's say I</v>

150
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>won't even buy it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get just give him a credit card.</v>

151
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Then when we fill out a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>

152
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>like I'm two years old again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in high school,</v>

153
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>oh come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a break.</v>

154
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And then I fill out the application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to pay him and then they want</v>

155
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>to sell me a 10 million year membership</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just want to try this for six</v>

156
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after all that,</v>

157
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>then they want to take a picture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks worse when you take it,</v>

158
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>then your driver's license plus after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

159
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Now what I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a flash.</v>

160
00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>The car going to work out and what I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do work out,</v>

161
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I had to take off all my clothes and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to hang them up in this tiny little</v>

162
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>walker where my stuff doesn't really fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to get wrinkled.</v>

163
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to fall off and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get wrinkled and be terrible.</v>

164
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So let's say now I do that because now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the first station,</v>

165
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure out which station to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

166
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So now they will probably want to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>me some trainers going to tell me what</v>

167
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Let,</v>

168
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.141
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

169
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:24.974
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

170
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I go to first nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody sitting,</v>

171
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>some sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelly person who gets up and they,</v>

172
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>they got sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All over sudden I gotta take my towel</v>

173
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>and I got to wipe it all off and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I got to adjust the weight and</v>

174
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know what the right way it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

175
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I got adjusted again and get the hassle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of figuring out how to Justin and I</v>

176
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.350
<v Speaker 1>finally do my exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got to wipe the thing off and</v>

177
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 1>then I gotta go find the second station</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there's somebody there,</v>

178
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's all sweaty and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers and they have to like do all</v>

179
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>these one station after station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after station,</v>

180
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>after station.</v>

181
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to go to the locker room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take off my sweaty clothes,</v>

182
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to put in a bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know is going to speak up my</v>

183
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got to go in and take a</v>

184
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>shower and maybe I'll first do a steam</v>
<v Speaker 1>room or something,</v>

185
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm going to see body parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people I don't even want to see.</v>

186
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>And then they're not going to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do my hair now,</v>

187
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>do my makeup all over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start all over my makeup and do the</v>

188
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these little pieces and they're</v>

189
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>going to put on mine now wrinkle clothes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I can't even just leave.</v>

190
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to the front and I ain't got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get my ticket stamps.</v>

191
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to find the car,</v>

192
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>which I forgot where it is and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to shortly the guy and then I</v>

193
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:21.674
<v Speaker 1>dried out.</v>

194
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what it takes to work out</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

195
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>What does it take deed to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean just do it well,</v>

196
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you.</v>

197
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know 12 places.</v>

198
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's go</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

199
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See eating is one chunk.</v>

200
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Exercising is 3,229</v>
<v Speaker 1>where every little step of,</v>

201
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>well I got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about all the consequences and</v>

202
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>the elements and the pieces and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they don't do it.</v>

203
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>They're over chunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you focus,</v>

204
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>you feel what you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are moved to somehow actuate,</v>

205
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>change a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your life when it comes to</v>

206
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>planning your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get your learned to ask three</v>

207
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 1>questions now and the first one is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do and how many</v>

208
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>understand why now say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question one to ask yourself is what</v>

209
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:18.474
<v Speaker 1>do I want?</v>

210
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>What's my outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my result?</v>

211
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>The word R,</v>
<v Speaker 1>p.</v>

212
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>M.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is to get you focused on</v>

213
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The target is not the activity.</v>

214
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>The activity can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what the,</v>

215
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>what's the result I'm after?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you knew exactly what it is you</v>

216
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>really want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you desire,</v>

217
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>what you're really after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity is power.</v>

218
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>The more clear you are in specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

219
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the faster your brain can get you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're generally saying things</v>

220
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:44.941
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want?</v>

221
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I want more money.</v>

222
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a dollar.</v>

223
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you achieve the outcome?</v>

224
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're that general,</v>

225
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're not getting your goal.</v>

226
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You are the way you language your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you think about it,</v>

227
00:09:57.421 --> 00:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you're receiving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

228
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>You know I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to feel a bit better.</v>

230
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

231
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I lost a pound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done because your brain's like a</v>

232
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>servo mechanism and a bomb and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>missile.</v>

233
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 1>The old days you shoot a missile and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>target was going and if you miss the</v>

234
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you missed it.</v>

235
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the missiles not on</v>

236
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>course?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens in locks onto the heat</v>

237
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>signature and wants to do it moves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>follows it.</v>

238
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the way your brain is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it knows the outcome,</v>

239
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:26.790
<v Speaker 1>if it knows the result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so rpm starts with I got another result.</v>

240
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>This is a results planning system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rapid planning method.</v>

241
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it as a results</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning system.</v>

242
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I need to know the result I'm after</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I ever asked myself what to do.</v>

243
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>That takes more time</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth it now for time's sake.</v>

244
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do this with you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now but I'll tell you when I do,</v>

245
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 1>when I've taught this to people and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got full weekend to do this and just</v>

246
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:47.544
<v Speaker 1>give you a picture.</v>

247
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>If I asked you right now to write out</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name,</v>

248
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>your full name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you abbreviate your</v>

249
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>signature but write out your full name</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have cursive.</v>

250
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't do that one time right at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>full name and curse it.</v>

251
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't even use the word cursive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really the word people still use</v>

252
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 1>means in handwriting I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in cursive.</v>

253
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Just write it out in full name because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this later on.</v>

254
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Now if I add you get with a partner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try this later if you want.</v>

255
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to tell you because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to take the time because they</v>

256
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>have such limited time today and I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner say to you with a stopwatch</v>

257
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:17.071
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

258
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

259
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>go and you write it out and you told me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're done,</v>

260
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.093
<v Speaker 1>I go stop.</v>

261
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I write down how long that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you wrote out your</v>

262
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 1>signature and it took five seconds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then say,</v>

263
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write it out.</v>

264
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:30.864
<v Speaker 1>Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

265
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>You told me we didn't stop and I write</v>
<v Speaker 1>down five seconds.</v>

266
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I have to do that 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find in the beginning you'll be,</v>

267
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say six seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making it up.</v>

268
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Every signature is different and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably might get down to as little as</v>

269
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 1>five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like an iphone,</v>

270
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:47.140
<v Speaker 1>you can do it as a digital stopwatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the middle seconds.</v>

271
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Then I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you guys to write every other</v>

272
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>letter in cursive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you write?</v>

273
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Half as many letters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think it would take to</v>

274
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half as much time.</v>

275
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Most of you will take twice as much time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning and then eventually,</v>

276
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is if I do a 10 times</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last two or three,</v>

277
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 1>and this makes no logical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

278
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take the time to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you do this 10 times,</v>

279
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:17.291
<v Speaker 1>10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times,</v>

280
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it on your own.</v>

281
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you the result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In most cases,</v>

282
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 1>even though you're doing half as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

283
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you cut it by two thirds of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something happens when you break</v>

284
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>an whole pattern and you do it fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain over the years has learned</v>

285
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>ways to move more rapidly since when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did your original signature and you'll</v>

286
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>do it in a third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time.</v>

287
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It'll take twice as much at first and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she'll across your third amount of</v>

288
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:38.891
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

289
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you what I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

290
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the system I'm calling a rapid planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

291
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.920
<v Speaker 1>By the time I show it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go,</v>

292
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>this takes more time than just making my</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do list.</v>

293
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 1>It will win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When will it take more time when</v>

294
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you get it in your nervous</v>

295
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll take you less time because your</v>

296
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 1>brain will be thinking and outcomes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not activities and when you think in</v>

297
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.700
<v Speaker 1>terms of outcomes and activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty soon some of the activities and</v>

298
00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll see what lead me to do to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

299
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>You find a better way to get the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

300
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 1>The how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

301
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Three questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question one,</v>

302
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>what is my result?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is my outcome?</v>

303
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 1>What does it I really truly want from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

304
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>If you're going back next week and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say this next week,</v>

305
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.840
<v Speaker 1>what are the most important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What outcomes for me to get this week in</v>

306
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>my business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was right.</v>

307
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Those outcomes are not your action</v>
<v Speaker 1>items,</v>

308
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:30.790
<v Speaker 1>the outcomes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that and nothing else,</v>

309
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll be ahead of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you just keep looking at those</v>

310
00:13:33.401 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>outcomes every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I doing on that outcome?</v>

311
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Your brain will come up with ways to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that outcome.</v>

312
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus on outcomes,</v>

313
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:45.001
<v Speaker 1>not on activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Action for most people activities,</v>

314
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>most people may mistake movement for</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>

315
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>They mistake action items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Introduce for achievement.</v>

316
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 1>We're after the achievement.</v>

317
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you with me on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

318
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a different way of thinking and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think all of you inherently have it,</v>

319
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but if you make this ritualized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the things you've learned this</v>

320
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all great,</v>

321
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't systematize them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll work when you do them.</v>

322
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>But if you systematize them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

323
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>and you see like Mr. Holman here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he goes in and just does it and</v>

324
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>does it make sure it's being done again</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what you've seen chet do or what I</v>

325
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just do it over and over again.</v>

326
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the results are geometric.</v>

327
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get you to systematize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

328
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>whether you do it visually the way I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to show you or not.</v>

329
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.190
<v Speaker 1>So first question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the result from after?</v>

330
00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate result?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want out of this week out of this</v>

331
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.601
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my business,</v>

332
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 1>out of my life for my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to be as what as possible</v>

333
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>when you described that outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that result as well as clear and</v>

334
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>specific as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalities will confuse you so it</v>

335
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>might take you longer than just right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now called So-and-so to think,</v>

336
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>if I'm calling my my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call Gerrick or I'm going</v>

337
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:55.364
<v Speaker 1>to call my brother.</v>

338
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 1>This is what goes through my head before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called always,</v>

339
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>what's my outcome because I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just call them,</v>

340
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I want jerk to feel loved by his dad or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about what for?</v>

341
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 1>How come I got to talk to him about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's out there.</v>

342
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure I get through to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this because I want to guide him and</v>

343
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>moving in this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to be as his father.</v>

344
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just Chit Chat.</v>

345
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think before every phone call</v>

346
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>before every time you're planning your</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and you think before you have any</v>

347
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.861
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

348
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I ask of anyone when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down in the meeting is,</v>

349
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your,</v>

350
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 1>what are your outcomes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the outcomes to this meeting?</v>

351
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 1>First thing I want to know because if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the outcomes,</v>

352
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>guess a lot of meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're done pretty quick because I know</v>

353
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go through all the</v>

354
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sell me on it.</v>

355
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Just that's your outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you want to do it?</v>

356
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock.</v>

357
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how you make a meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

358
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I know a meeting for Dr Number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hours or time.</v>

359
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it takes longer to the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you want,</v>

360
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to get the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's by the way,</v>

361
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>what you see with me on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my time is very,</v>

362
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>it's based on an outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get that outcome.</v>

363
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a damn whether it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right time or not.</v>

364
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I must deliver the outcome.</v>

365
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

366
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>how many like to have your company</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on outcomes,</v>

367
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>results and not activity?</v>

368
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Say I people say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you do,</v>

369
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>you get that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well do you want,</v>

370
00:16:15.911 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I left them an email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left him a voicemail.</v>

371
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I sent them three emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in terms you heard that.</v>

372
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 1>When that happens with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

373
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't show it.</v>

374
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I just like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

375
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll explain our about our culture.</v>

376
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 1>It's about getting the result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can help you if you can't figure</v>

377
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 1>another way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there may be 12 of the things we</v>

378
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:38.810
<v Speaker 1>might want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't have the answer.</v>

379
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody else can give us the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

380
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.880
<v Speaker 1>The outcome was to get this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to leave an email or 12 or three</v>

381
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>voicemails that will not do any of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>any good.</v>

382
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 1>How many faults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

383
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>whether you get the outcome or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you get that result will be</v>

384
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 1>based first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He have clarity.</v>

385
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at any business and if you</v>

386
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 1>want to know what shifts a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shifts your life,</v>

387
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 1>there's one force decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decision making is the force that shapes</v>

388
00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

389
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

390
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you can think of Disney?</v>

391
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>The decisions that you made years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two decisions five,</v>

392
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>10 15 years ago that that decision you</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not have realized at the time,</v>

393
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>but that decision was one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important decisions of your life.</v>

394
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You've made a different decision there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going a different direction in</v>

395
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Speaker 1>your life would be completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

396
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Who can relate to this and made him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say hi,</v>

397
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>secret then is getting darn good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>making more effective decisions?</v>

398
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:40.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

399
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>are we always going to make the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision?</v>

400
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

401
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>No way in a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't have the guts to</v>

402
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>make the tough decisions because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make the right decision.</v>

403
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 1>So they make notices and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

404
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it a true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is the world takes them</v>

405
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So decision making is the power.</v>

406
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's three decisions you're making</v>

407
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 1>every moment of your life and of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and making it right now in this</v>

408
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're watching here on film</v>

409
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:11.010
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might make some decisions because</v>

410
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the environment that's</v>

411
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first decision you're making</v>

412
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:16.510
<v Speaker 1>every moment your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affects your life and businesses.</v>

413
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to focus on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because whenever you focus on,</v>

414
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel so as a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>owner,</v>

415
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 1>every employee you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each day comes in and they make</v>

416
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 1>decisions about what the focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people focus on their own needs.</v>

417
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Some people focus on the customer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs is not going to change the quality</v>

418
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 1>of what your business does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it does,</v>

419
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 1>yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little or completely,</v>

420
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.053
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

421
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Some people focus on what they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>control every day.</v>

422
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Can you predict?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're focusing every day on what you</v>

423
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 1>can't control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to feel about your life</v>

424
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 1>or your business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be overwhelmed.</v>

425
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be frustrated.</v>

426
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're deciding what to focus on.</v>

427
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 1>You can be focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

428
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 1>we're getting into it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the energy,</v>

429
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to get into the meat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

430
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All business is decision making,</v>

431
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>better decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better life.</v>

432
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Or You'd be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

433
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 1>my neighbor's smells after all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping up and down,</v>

434
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 1>notice that focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna experience though.</v>

436
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some people make a decision and then</v>

437
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>they focus on the decision about how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out versus what they</v>

438
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're going to be plenty of</v>

439
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:26.450
<v Speaker 1>decisions that don't work out back.</v>

440
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Probably for your honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us forget them,</v>

441
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>but most of their decisions aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the right decisions if we</v>

442
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 1>make gutsy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the open decision is the ability to</v>

443
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>choose again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So focus is a decision.</v>

444
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in your business.</v>

445
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But here's what we're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pattern of focus at some</v>

446
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:48.010
<v Speaker 1>stages in business is you're gonna learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>today the focus of the entrepreneur and</v>

447
00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 1>the business is increasing sales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased sales,</v>

448
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 1>increased sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they're successful,</v>

449
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 1>they eventually fail because their sales</v>
<v Speaker 1>are increasing.</v>

450
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>But what's not someone telling me what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not profits?</v>

451
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Some people are totally focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>

452
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:02.911
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>

453
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Can you make any company profitable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

454
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can cut enough stuff.</v>

455
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>You can make any company profitable for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while,</v>

456
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.131
<v Speaker 1>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week,</v>

457
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:11.791
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

458
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

459
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.190
<v Speaker 1>At different stages in the business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must change your focus.</v>

460
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a life cycle to a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to make effective</v>

461
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:22.770
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to know where you are on that</v>

462
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>lifecycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make decisions differently for a</v>

463
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 1>teenager than a toddler than a grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>

464
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.920
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing's true in the business and</v>

465
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to control your life,</v>

466
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the way you take controls by making new</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>

467
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:40.410
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like how things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got to do change it and to</v>

468
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 1>change it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make a decision.</v>

469
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders make decisions.</v>

470
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes somebody a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the guts to make the most</v>

471
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>difficult decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else has the guts to make and</v>

472
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 1>they know they're going to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they're wrong,</v>

473
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 1>what will they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll know what they want,</v>

474
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>they see it's not working and they'll do</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

475
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Change it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means don't make another decision,</v>

476
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:03.190
<v Speaker 1>do something new and see if it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the essence of how we grow.</v>

477
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 1>So first assisting controls your life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>

478
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Lots of patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people focus on what they control.</v>

479
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Some focus on what they can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some focus on customers,</v>

480
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some focus on themselves.</v>

481
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>If you let me this whole business about</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting your needs,</v>

482
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you can run a successful business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will be a job because you'll</v>

483
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 1>never be able to sell it because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just meeting your needs.</v>

484
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It demands your attention.</v>

485
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 1>We your connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's giving what you want,</v>

486
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately it's not going to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else what they want so he can't</v>

487
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 1>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't sell your business,</v>

488
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an exit strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a job.</v>

489
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how successful the</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

490
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.850
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't mean you have to sell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

491
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most important decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make in business is ultimately,</v>

492
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to sell this by chose to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to know who,</v>

493
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 1>what I sell this to so that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm value,</v>

494
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 1>not just an income or walking away.</v>

495
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I have this critical mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet I got a multiple of my business and</v>

496
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.520
<v Speaker 1>most people don't have a clear exit</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

497
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.460
<v Speaker 1>They think all come up with that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

498
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start with that end in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

499
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be part of your focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna be successful in your</v>

500
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember,</v>

501
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen has built ca and Hollywood is</v>

502
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 1>largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most successful agency,</v>

503
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Ovitz,</v>

504
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 1>remember that name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put together Nike and Coca Cola and</v>

505
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>these billion dollar deals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually Mike Ovitz went to go sell</v>

506
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 1>that business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd never thought through an exit</v>

507
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 1>strategy and he got almost nothing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the laws prevented him from</v>

508
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:30.610
<v Speaker 1>selling it to a studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to sell it to some of his</v>

509
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 1>employees for pennies on its real value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

510
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Mike found a way to make money later on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in another place off of Disney.</v>

511
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is the guy didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an exit strategy and there was</v>

512
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made lots of money in the end,</v>

513
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 1>didn't get the value focus.</v>

514
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Your first decision is what are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to focus on?</v>

515
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>The second decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minute you focused on something,</v>

516
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you focus on,</v>

517
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy's coming apart,</v>

518
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 1>my industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 1>people are not buying my product or</v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

520
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 1>they're shutting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumers are not spending the money.</v>

521
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to affect your state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

522
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Now should you lie to yourself and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend there aren't challenges?</v>

523
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:05.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to focus</v>

524
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 1>instead on what am I gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the need that's still there in</v>

525
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>any marketplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all one still people buying.</v>

526
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it throughout the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in some simple little business.</v>

527
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're a realtor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your own little real estate</v>

528
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.500
<v Speaker 1>office or you kind of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>salesperson.</v>

529
00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 1>You've got a couple of people that work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you that help you leverage</v>

530
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:25.030
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

531
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Some got simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember years ago I met a woman named</v>

532
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Marty Rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's from the town I grew up in.</v>

533
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>She came and one of my seminars and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she be sitting in front row and I did in</v>

534
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:36.180
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made done 25 seminars.</v>

535
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 1>She was probably at 10 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same seminar in front of low.</v>

536
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the woman who was the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate agent for century 21 in the</v>

537
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>free world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine out of 11 years.</v>

538
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I watched her in good times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money in the worst times,</v>

539
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago,</v>

540
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>she sold more real estate in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's from than the entire multiple</v>

541
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 1>listing service of other agents</v>
<v Speaker 1>combined.</v>

542
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 1>One person now she built into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

543
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It's got a whole team that runs it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still hurt.</v>

544
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>She built the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he do well when it's going</v>

545
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 1>horrible?</v>

546
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when the economy gets terrible</v>

547
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 1>because it gets rid of all those flaky</v>
<v Speaker 1>realtors,</v>

548
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>all those flaky mortgage brokers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many of them.</v>

549
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 1>They got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business was going up and they all</v>

550
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 1>got successful because they're on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend.</v>

551
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.310
<v Speaker 1>When the train crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all left and left me all the</v>

552
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:24.890
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She loves these times,</v>

553
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that's her focus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

554
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely different focus.</v>

555
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>So when you're focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to decide what I'm going to</v>

556
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 1>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you focus on something,</v>

557
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel it.</v>

558
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you think someone tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone screwed you over,</v>

559
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>they took advantage of you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

560
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:42.300
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're all upset and you picture in</v>

561
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>your mind and now you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then later you've got to confront</v>

562
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 1>this person.</v>

563
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 1>You find out it wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's ever had some like this happened?</v>

564
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It felt like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand and say hi.</v>

565
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>But when you focus on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it control you?</v>

566
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes or no?</v>

567
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 1>So just write fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus equals feeling.</v>

568
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel.</v>

569
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 1>And as a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to manage those</v>

570
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 1>feelings and you gotta do it by managing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your focus.</v>

571
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.670
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can lead other people,</v>

572
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>do you have to create a focus for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

573
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>for the organization to be successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

574
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 1>You've got to find yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are people focusing on?</v>

575
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's affecting all the decisions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

576
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you focus on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally get to decision number two.</v>

577
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Decision number two is what does this</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

578
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 1>When you focus on somebody got up to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to meaning.</v>

579
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Is this the end or the beginning?</v>

580
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.660
<v Speaker 1>If you think this is the end of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

581
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:36.890
<v Speaker 1>the end of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of our economy,</v>

582
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.520
<v Speaker 1>are you going to feel differently and</v>
<v Speaker 1>act differently than if you think it's</v>

583
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 1>the beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

584
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.770
<v Speaker 1>See the difference between Joe Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 4 million bucks in 1929 and Joe</v>

585
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy when 180 plus million dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1932 that big a jump,</v>

586
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 1>different focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different meaning when everybody else</v>

587
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>said it was the end and it we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on how to survive.</v>

588
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>He was focusing on how to take market</v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

589
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>He was focusing on what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>

590
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 1>where the meaning for him was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the greatest opportunity of my</v>

591
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 1>lifetime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll never be another time like this</v>

592
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 1>and he made enough money in that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took care of all his heirs after</v>

593
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that for decades to come all because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a different focus in a different</v>

594
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:14.330
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

595
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in an intimate relationship</v>

596
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 1>and you think it's the end of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

597
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>are you going to treat that person the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way as if you think it's the</v>

598
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 1>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no?</v>

599
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's laughing over here.</v>

600
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 1>They know no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

601
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will you do for somebody you love</v>

602
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>what we do for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

603
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they say,</v>

604
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.710
<v Speaker 1>would you take out the trash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

605
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll take up the trash of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else would you like me to do?</v>

606
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it true after three or four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say a five or seven.</v>

607
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take out the trash first.</v>

608
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:47.461
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I look like?</v>

609
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Your janitor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

610
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 1>We don't seem to have same attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

611
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell people,</v>

612
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 1>treat people at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

613
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.690
<v Speaker 1>like it's the beginning and it won't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

614
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's not just your intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

615
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>What if your customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you fell in love with your</v>

616
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your clients more than your</v>

617
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than your company?</v>

618
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 1>If your entire life was about meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>their needs,</v>

619
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 1>if you would do what for your customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

620
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you would do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you love your customers and clients,</v>

621
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you'd do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

622
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>They're going to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people love their customers and</v>

623
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 1>clients as long as they buy from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what they want,</v>

624
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 1>respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

625
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

626
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 1>they don't that the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want clients for life,</v>

627
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 1>not just customers fall in love with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

628
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a different focus isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different meaning and that</v>

629
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 1>creates a different life because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make decisions differently from that</v>

630
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:43.050
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another meaning.</v>

631
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this punishment in my business?</v>

632
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:51.051
<v Speaker 1>Am I being punished by God or am I being</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged or is this actually a gift?</v>

633
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 1>What I'm facing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever meaning you give controls what</v>

634
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:58.020
<v Speaker 1>you feel and what you feel controls the</v>
<v Speaker 1>third decision,</v>

635
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

636
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 1>The minute you give it a meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a feeling.</v>

637
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 1>When you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.120
<v Speaker 1>a feeling you're going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take action,</v>

639
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A whole economy is driven by this.</v>

640
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>People start focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

641
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is going to go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm not going to get what I need.</v>

642
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 1>This might be the end of the way things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

643
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I've been a pull in my reins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better not spend this money I've been</v>

644
00:28:18.881 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 1>or not take any action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

645
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.070
<v Speaker 1>How many know what I'm talking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So decision making is your power.</v>

646
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You want to change your business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about whatever's changed your</v>

647
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 1>business in the past.</v>

648
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee which change your business</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

649
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Some decisions you made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made some decisions that shifted</v>

650
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 1>your business in a radical way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed things in a way that shifted the</v>

651
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>game for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decisions about people,</v>

652
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 1>decisions about products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions about marketing or promotion,</v>

653
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.650
<v Speaker 1>decisions about locations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions about what you're going to</v>

654
00:28:51.651 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 1>offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your offerings,</v>

655
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 1>decisions you want to change your whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

656
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:57.180
<v Speaker 1>You can do it next few days just with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new decisions,</v>

657
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of decisions.</v>

658
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at got to decide which ones will</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the biggest difference today.</v>

659
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you understand where</v>

660
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:08.220
<v Speaker 1>those decisions need to be focused based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on where you are in the lifecycle of</v>

661
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 1>your business and where you are in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal life cycle.</v>

662
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make decisions differently.</v>

663
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You'll look at time differently when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 20 than when you're 30 and when</v>

664
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you're 40 and when you're 50 then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 60 then when you're 70 yes or no,</v>

665
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 1>it'll affect your decisions.</v>
