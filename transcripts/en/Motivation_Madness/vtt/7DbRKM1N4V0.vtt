1
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a terrible experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of mistakes when I was young</v>

2
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you succeed,</v>

3
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>every mistakes become a legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you feel that's just the garbage,</v>

4
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

5
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.043
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

6
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>everybody has great stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had a lot of mistakes,</v>

7
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>everybody have lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But very few people listen to you one</v>

8
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>day where it becomes successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People listened to you say,</v>

9
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are great.</v>

10
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born a normal family</v>

11
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not a good as schooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

12
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I tried to study hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a boy,</v>

13
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my school was not that good at that</v>

14
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I felt looking for jobs,</v>

15
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>looking for joining university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joining good schools.</v>

16
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>But I never give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's one thing I learned</v>

17
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you should have a chance to be</v>

19
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get used to beat,</v>

20
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>get used to feel and get used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted by other people.</v>

21
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Why other people should help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should earn the right to be helped.</v>

22
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So the thing I learned is that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give up.</v>

23
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>My opportunity has not come yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everybody complain,</v>

24
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that is the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought when I was young,</v>

25
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>when I was graduate in the high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>or university,</v>

26
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought Bill Gates took up my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates did all the successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

28
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Larry Ellison from Oracle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

29
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>they took all the wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

30
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>IBM benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we people have no opportunity</v>

31
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and I think our aim too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should aim to support and help the</v>

32
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:41.061
<v Speaker 1>people around me to tiny things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I could be today after</v>

33
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba become today's size.</v>

34
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Not because I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm a smart person,</v>

35
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with a lot of smarter people</v>

36
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.980
<v Speaker 1>and most of the smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always want to do successful</v>

37
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:05.090
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

38
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.950
<v Speaker 1>easy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's not easy to be</v>

39
00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>successful quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

40
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Everything we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we prepare for 10 years.</v>

41
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to be successful,</v>

42
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>we have to win 10 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to be successful,</v>

43
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>we have to work with smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to be successful,</v>

44
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>we should make a lot of mistakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never give up.</v>

45
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make mistake them problem.</v>

46
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>They give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never give up.</v>

47
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>We learn from the stakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think when we're filled their</v>

48
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience that I want to give you a</v>

49
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:51.710
<v Speaker 1>device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to give you,</v>

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this person will be successful,</v>

51
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>not by where his cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it's his fault or the other</v>

52
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he thinks my field,</v>

53
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 1>because of the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has no chance.</v>

54
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Those people who feel always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

55
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 1>it is my fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not do the properly.</v>

56
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I should change care or change you</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

57
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>These guys have opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I learned a lot from those people who</v>

58
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:25.790
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from those people who</v>

59
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 1>made mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from my mistakes.</v>

60
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

61
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>this is my life attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I feel I say,</v>

62
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.090

<v Speaker 1>I will fail when I succeed.</v>

63
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be successful.</v>

65
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>This make me very positive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic and because of so many</v>

85
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the idea.</v>

86
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>After 18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grow from 18 people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give your lot to the others.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we're helping you.</v>

96
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thinking in the past 10 years.</v>

97
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba was born in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Alibaba should not be a Chinese</v>

98
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name the day when I choose the name</v>

99
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba is not a Chinese name.</v>

100
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a Arabic name and Iran's that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran nicknamed Turkey says taking him.</v>

101
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know we're in name,</v>

102
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's the name from Alibaba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1000 when mistakes or Alibaba,</v>

103
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 1>one founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one nights the story.</v>

104
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.820
<v Speaker 1>We want to make this company a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Boeing Chinar enabled the world</v>

105
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>helping the global young company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people.</v>

106
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>As I said that every century there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company for the century.</v>

107
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft was the company of last</v>
<v Speaker 1>century as a great century.</v>

108
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Ivn was a company of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the company of this century,</v>

109
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>21st century and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should not think about Alibaba.</v>

110
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>We should always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make money,</v>

111
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>serve Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have made the money,</v>

112
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 1>serve the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve this century.</v>

113
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.010
<v Speaker 1>This only think in that way we can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

114
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Our company today is big but compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday it was big but compared to</v>

115
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:54.851
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow it is still a tiny company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world changes so fast.</v>

116
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is our thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to make all the Moba be the</v>

117
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:06.171
<v Speaker 1>company of the century.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Greg was 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 45 days.</v>

146
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Now we've reduced from 45 days to 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

147
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but that is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia should have a more than logistics</v>

148
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:16.641
<v Speaker 1>system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be able to deliver within 48</v>

149

<v Speaker 1>hours or 72 hours anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any place or Russia where you place on</v>

00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 1>this should have using technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your opportunity.</v>

152
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Young people logistics terrible and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the chess.</v>

153
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>If were just as good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no chunks.</v>

154
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>We should have [inaudible] or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>payment online,</v>

155
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>online payment today in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mobile phone payment,</v>

156
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to</v>

157
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 2>see a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some beggars on the street.</v>

158
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 2>You are you back money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use difficult mobile phone because</v>

159
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 2>people don't have a pocket of money.</v>

160
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>So we in a rusher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have built up a good payment</v>

161
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.080

<v Speaker 1>alibaba.com this is what we want to do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about Tech College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you one thing.</v>

210
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Why are you worried about the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is because you are a lack of</v>

211
00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:17.910
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lack of imagination.</v>

212
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 1>We don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not have the solution for future,</v>

213
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 1>but there is a solution for future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the solution for future,</v>

214
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.350
<v Speaker 1>but our young people have a solution for</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I find and this wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people don't worry about the</v>

216

217
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>the people worry for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found those six.</v>

218
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Today's successful people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they worry about the future.</v>

219
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>future is the opportunity for everybody,</v>

220
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.380
<v Speaker 1>especially the opportunity for young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because we have nothing to lose,</v>

221
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I tell myself.</v>

222
00:17:05.681 --> 00:17:08.710
<v Speaker 1>18 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 years ago,</v>

223
00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:11.650
<v Speaker 1>we did not have money so we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no money to lose.</v>

224
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no technology loose</v>

225
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 1>and then we say we believe 10 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

226
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 1>e commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet will be powerful if we start to</v>

227
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:30.781
<v Speaker 1>do now</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a lot of success people successful</v>

228
00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:33.760
<v Speaker 1>people don't like technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like Internet.</v>

229
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 1>We started doing 10 20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will be the expert.</v>

230
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.730
<v Speaker 1>10 20 years later we'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think don't worry about the future.</v>

231
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Prepare for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make your own future cloud computing,</v>

232
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>big data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence.</v>

233
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.240
<v Speaker 1>They are new to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are successful,</v>

234
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 1>new to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not successful,</v>

235
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 1>new to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you worry about?</v>

236
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Second thing is don't worry about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things the other people worry about,</v>

237
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 1>especially don't worry about the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and prime minister worry</v>

238
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worry about things you worry about.</v>

239
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 1>We everybody have too many things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>

240
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 1>If you do not worry about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worry too much about the world.</v>

241
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Now today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba should worry about the world.</v>

242
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.130
<v Speaker 1>You should not worry about the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of put these worry about what</v>

243
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you should not worry about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should worry about where you</v>

244
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 1>graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you make a living?</v>

245
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>How can they do something that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

246
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>How can you do something that is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

247
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.810
<v Speaker 1>and helping others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

248
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>don't believe that technology is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take our way.</v>

249
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Human beings jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is going to replace a lot of</v>

250
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:11.680
<v Speaker 1>stupid jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the first,</v>

251
00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:16.681
<v Speaker 1>the technology revolution come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steam machine comp people worry,</v>

252
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.790
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steamer,</v>

253
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>she is going to take our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we a lot of jobs.</v>

254
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.040
<v Speaker 1>After 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steam machine created more jobs way</v>

255
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.400
<v Speaker 1>electricity comps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of companies worry about losing</v>

256
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:39.091
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That electricity created so many jobs at</v>

257
00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:45.101
<v Speaker 1>the Fisher intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will create more jobs.</v>

258
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem is next to 2030 years may</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose credit,</v>

259
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.510
<v Speaker 1>lose a lot of job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is shut period.</v>

260
00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So we people have to learn how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in the artificial intelligent</v>

261
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

262
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.230
<v Speaker 1>why human being can wing machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

263
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.580
<v Speaker 1>they might be stronger deck human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be smart to that human being.</v>

264
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.970
<v Speaker 1>They might be rough faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human being,</v>

265
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but they can never be as wise as human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings because human being,</v>

266
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>we have belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have religion,</v>

267
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>we have a heart,</v>

268
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 1>which machine does not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to be ready for future,</v>

269
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>please</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not follow yesterday's way of</v>

270
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.050
<v Speaker 1>learning and teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not try to memory things harder and</v>

271
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>more because computer can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are the more than you</v>

272
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 1>do not try to calculate to faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the computer can,</v>

273
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:09.061
<v Speaker 1>cal could it much faster than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So try to be creative,</v>

274
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>tried to be innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to be constructive.</v>

275
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.350
<v Speaker 1>These are the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you learn,</v>

276
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 1>you think about is this thing can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>me more creative.</v>

277
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 1>This one can be mum making me more</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative.</v>

278
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.520
<v Speaker 1>This thing can be make me more</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive as do it.</v>

279
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And also I think when other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry,</v>

280
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.020
<v Speaker 1>opportunity comps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them worry.</v>

281
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You should know nobody will and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>can stop this technology revolution.</v>

282
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes.</v>

283
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes.</v>

284
00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So what's the point of a worry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said people's a jet.</v>

285
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever cried in the past 18 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the business internet in China?</v>

286
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't cry because I know quiet does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not make any sense.</v>

287
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Does that help me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If cry can help me,</v>

288
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I would cry every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not have cried.</v>

289
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.460
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't make competitors cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about,</v>

290
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 1>be positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get ready for that.</v>

291
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.440
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from Moscow university cannot a</v>

292
00:22:37.931 --> 00:22:42.931
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you worry the whole,</v>

293
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 nine 9% of people have no future.</v>

294
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positive started do it.</v>

295
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And when people worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open the door,</v>

296
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 1>see what are the worry about and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>

297
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we will work together.</v>

298
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 2>You're a great believer,</v>

299
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:19.470
<v Speaker 3>young people as a c and you spend so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much time with students and with young</v>

<v Speaker 1>And a second is that when you mel young</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

308

<v Speaker 1>people is that also the advice I'd give</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the evening.</v>

318
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I travel last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>867 hours a year in the flood plane in</v>

319
00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:56.710
<v Speaker 1>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working hard.</v>

320
00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>My team working very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 years.</v>

321
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>We work like a normal company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years,</v>

322
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.630
<v Speaker 1>day and night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is free.</v>

323
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy beings.</v>

324
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to think different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do different.</v>

325
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

326
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

327
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 1>if a John said this is the right you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

328
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 1>why you so you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

329
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 1>early days in my company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's some ideas come to my desk.</v>

330
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's is a great idea and I look in every</v>

331
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.500
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's saying it is a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

332
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally through into the rubbish</v>

333
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 1>because everybody say there's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all the other people think of,</v>

334
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.530
<v Speaker 1>if everybody say this is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough.</v>

335
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in that tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and a pickup and see how can we</v>

336
00:26:00.841 --> 00:26:05.841
<v Speaker 1>do in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is to be unique,</v>

337
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.650
<v Speaker 1>to be different and the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my advice and this is also</v>

338
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.450
<v Speaker 1>telling myself every day today is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

339
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow is more tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day off tomorrow is beautiful,</v>

340
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
<v Speaker 1>but most people die tomorrow evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to work very hard every tough</v>

341
00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:34.480
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every tough situation,</v>

342
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.540
<v Speaker 1>problems with meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the training of yourself</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your real challenge is where you leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the college.</v>

350
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The real life starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real exam stats,</v>

351
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the real test of stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>

352
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 1>One thing you got lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

353
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:27.290
<v Speaker 1>if students from Moscow university</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot survive,</v>

354
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>19 9.9% of people in the world cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

355
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Only you have this confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be able to face the challenge</v>

356
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.333
<v Speaker 1>of future.</v>

357
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.343
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

358
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.780
<v Speaker 3>do jack for all these stories for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sponsors.</v>

359
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 3>And now I will turn to the audience and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will have an ability and time to ask</v>

360
00:27:54.911 --> 00:27:59.470
<v Speaker 3>your own questions and I'll appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you formulate them on English.</v>

361
00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:03.670
<v Speaker 3>But if you have some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have someone who can repeat and we</v>

362
00:28:03.671 --> 00:28:06.910
<v Speaker 3>will help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who wants to be first?</v>

363
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

364
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.650

368
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.640
<v Speaker 4>my question is actually a little just</v>
<v Speaker 4>retold rhetorical.</v>

369
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 4>So the times from one market is more</v>
<v Speaker 4>complete and there are times when market</v>

370
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:36.120
<v Speaker 4>is more competitive as an error is it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to keep being confident on yourself</v>

371
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:36.954
<v Speaker 4>and your future.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you formed the Lord Department.</v>

374
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.490
<v Speaker 1>The question is that in the time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market is going to be more competitive,</v>

375
00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.640
<v Speaker 1>how can you keep the confidence for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future?</v>

376
00:28:51.641 --> 00:28:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knock it is never easy.</v>

377
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

379
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:01.681
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm doing business more difficult.</v>

381
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.810

<v Speaker 1>never is a continuum of more difficult.</v>

382
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.740
<v Speaker 1>The confidence is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to do it is that find a</v>

<v Speaker 1>65 million packages per day in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We delivered them.</v>

470
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.100
<v Speaker 1>How many people work here on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>3 million people working on that.</v>

471
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>We never do ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that a high 3 million.</v>

472
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
<v Speaker 1>We help them get the jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you,</v>

473
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:34.090
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinar logistic system was so bad trying</v>

474
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 1>to post same speed like the Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

475
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 1>nobody believe it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you work,</v>

476
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is also a big country.</v>

477
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 1>The only thing is we have a bet more</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

478
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.584
<v Speaker 1>more people,</v>

479
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.593
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

480
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.400
<v Speaker 1>we think it's opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The developer countries,</v>

481
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.200
<v Speaker 1>the logistic cost of the economy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>today 12% of the GDP of the other cost</v>

482
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.220
<v Speaker 1>country and I can China under developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries developing countries,</v>

483
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:28.370
<v Speaker 1>they like six 16%</v>
<v Speaker 1>today because of the Internet we are</v>

484
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.990
<v Speaker 1>able to lower down to seven and 6% this</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on you.</v>

485
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.460
<v Speaker 1>It's your opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>

486
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.110
<v Speaker 1>it's young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

487
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.570
<v Speaker 1>if young people want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be.</v>

488
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk to success.</v>

489
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:58.830
<v Speaker 1>This woe to convincing successful people</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most difficult thing.</v>

490
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.700
<v Speaker 1>We are not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say I want to deliver this thing for</v>

491
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>my city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about the whole rusher</v>

492
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>just in my city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will win if you say I want to build</v>

493
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 1>up a whole logistic for whole rusher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have channels.</v>

494
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would give you money because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody working for same cities where</v>

495
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>you connect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be big.</v>

496
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 1>This is my advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rusher has chest.</v>

497
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.390
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot from Alibaba</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience sharpton.</v>

498
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.903
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

499
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are our,</v>

500
00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.400
<v Speaker 1>our packages delivered every day off our</v>
<v Speaker 1>company alone.</v>

501
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Big then whole us and package hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

502
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 1>We made it happen in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also can make it happen,</v>

503
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about money.</v>

504
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.260
<v Speaker 1>When you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

505
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>where do proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do the right direction,</v>

506
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.090
<v Speaker 1>money will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

507
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have money,</v>

508
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

509
00:38:04.871 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you will never have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do this things delicate,</v>

510
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you really want to do it a made</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

511
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Money will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first question.</v>

512
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Second is have a monopsony.</v>

513
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rusher.</v>

514
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I saw Moscow very beautiful this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much cleaner,</v>

515
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 1>more traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sad,</v>

516
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been to a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

517
00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I think Russia economy should be focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on more private business.</v>

518
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Small Business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sure.</v>

519
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:47.150
<v Speaker 1>We really rely on the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gasoline amage big s he stayed on the</v>

520
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big private company.</v>

521
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 1>We should have more entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dynamic,</v>

522
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.620
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small business and this is what we</v>

523
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the future</v>

524
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.840
<v Speaker 1>business model of 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if we have more small business,</v>

525
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.190
<v Speaker 1>every small business can export thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:17.420
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you,</v>

527
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:18.360
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

528
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Russian commerce and very developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

529
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Ecommerce</v>
<v Speaker 1>today is a tiny infant baby less than a</v>

530
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.420
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ecommerce put together less than 1%</v>

531
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 1>of the total Russia retail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a 12 years ago.</v>

532
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:42.930
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge opportunity,</v>

533
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but don't wait for the monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would do it.</v>

534
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for the SOE.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for the logistic ready.</v>

535
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.110

<v Speaker 1>Ready.</v>

536
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.670

<v Speaker 1>If everything's already why they need to</v>

537
00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:01.810

538
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:06.330

<v Speaker 1>You have no chance because everything's</v>

539
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.980
<v Speaker 1>already you have the chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but get ready for the tough days.</v>

545
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First let me tell you that the language</v>

546
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.280
<v Speaker 1>is very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you speak good English does not</v>

547
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:29.530
<v Speaker 1>mean you will do global business</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge or don't use.</v>

548
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 1>He made a speech here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

549
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Maza dog does not speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

550
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon did not speak Chinese,</v>

551
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but this older two guy made a global</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

552
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.740
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

553
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you're working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the vision.</v>

554
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the belief that you have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the world.</v>

555
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 1>But let me tell you another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language is so important.</v>

556
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It helped me a lot because of artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

557
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 1>In the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

558
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to learn English or Russian</v>

559
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:13.190
<v Speaker 1>or Japanese or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A chip here can check later quickly.</v>

560
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about language.</v>

561
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It's about the culture where you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other language.</v>

562
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.820
<v Speaker 1>You start understand the other culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to appreciate,</v>

563
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.300
<v Speaker 1>respect the other culture where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate respect the other culture.</v>

564
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>You will be respected and appreciated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the others.</v>

565
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Then you can work it out together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned my English by myself when I</v>

566
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:52.511
<v Speaker 1>was child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got to one day English training</v>

567
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:58.091
<v Speaker 1>class all side China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I understand the western</v>

568
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:05.141
<v Speaker 1>culture much more better than those</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese students study outside because</v>

569
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not learning language and learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture</v>

570
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:17.350
<v Speaker 1>where you respect the other culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you appreciate the other culture.</v>

571
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to make friends if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other culture.</v>

572
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 1>You will never make friends if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have friends,</v>

573
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.840
<v Speaker 1>how can you do business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say language helped me a lot,</v>

574
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but most thing helped me is my respect</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the different culture.</v>

575
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could speak Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more I come here,</v>

576
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.230
<v Speaker 1>the more I learn a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked one of the Russian guy,</v>

577
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:03.820
<v Speaker 1>why no rushing through tough and Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>too gentle.</v>

578
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 1>How can they mix together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he asked you a very good,</v>

579
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.830
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this country is so code.</v>

580
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:18.850
<v Speaker 1>We have to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the house is so good weather so we</v>

581
00:44:20.171 --> 00:44:22.790
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.630
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

583
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 1>if you have to everything with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>translator,</v>

584
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.750
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

585
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to write,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

599
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 3>so my question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

600
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Mr Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you created an Alibaba,</v>

601
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:39.410
<v Speaker 3>all the small businesses in China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the small manufacturers is they</v>

602
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:44.541
<v Speaker 3>didn't have access to the global market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right now we have a similar problem</v>

603
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 3>in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wasn't intellectual products,</v>

604
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 3>not was manufactured goods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with commodities,</v>

605
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 3>but with innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with inventions.</v>

606
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this audience is this pool</v>
<v Speaker 3>of scientists and inventors and we have</v>

607
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 3>many more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have millions of talented people</v>

608
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 3>in Russia who are developing a high</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality,</v>

609
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:09.900
<v Speaker 3>creative and innovative technologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But our local market is too small.</v>

610
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.760
<v Speaker 3>It cannot digest and it's a huge waste</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

611
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.770
<v Speaker 3>and this such a shame that all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

612
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 3>technologists are not serving to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities.</v>

613
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:25.250
<v Speaker 3>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you advise us to do in order</v>

614
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:28.530
<v Speaker 3>to give to Russian intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 3>products?</v>

615
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to the global markets.</v>

616
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

617
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of people have a great technology</v>

618
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 1>inventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cannot do a,</v>

619
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Russia is too small market and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>offside market,</v>

620
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>

621
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:51.980
<v Speaker 1>how can do it pops in though with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>others</v>

622
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:57.710
<v Speaker 1>popped into was a company like Alibaba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay home.</v>

623
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are good that invention,</v>

624
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but you may not a good at the marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're good at marketing,</v>

625
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:11.831
<v Speaker 1>normally you're not a good animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people need to work it together.</v>

626
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:18.470
<v Speaker 1>If you have a great invasion or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely strong and good at invention</v>

627
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:24.421
<v Speaker 1>and creative to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must've fine good business people to pop</v>

628
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:28.370
<v Speaker 1>in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finding good.</v>

629
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know little about technology</v>

630
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy we don't use PC.</v>

631
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:45.870
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I can use my pc and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sen receive email and the brows,</v>

632
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to use to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy we all use a mobile phone.</v>

633
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a technology guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know if we,</v>

634
00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>if I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we want to realize our dream,</v>

635
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 1>we must have the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I don't know the technology,</v>

636
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.780
<v Speaker 1>we should invite the best engineers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>science I worked with them or listened</v>

637
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:11.344
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

638
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you should do is always</v>

639
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.600
<v Speaker 2>form a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

640
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:31.870
<v Speaker 1>it is very difficult to make exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>company like Alibaba.</v>

641
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make a company better than</v>

642
00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be difficult to make exact</v>

643
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.040
<v Speaker 1>business model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our model,</v>

644
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I will not say be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very workable our model</v>

645
00:48:51.741 --> 00:48:56.450
<v Speaker 1>because of 18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for the first 10 years,</v>

646
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.700
<v Speaker 1>nobody believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody say Jack,</v>

647
00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:02.360
<v Speaker 1>my stupid crazy too is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never make money.</v>

648
00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:06.350
<v Speaker 1>So the smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich people never be our competitors</v>

649
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.190
<v Speaker 2>that give us chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

650
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:18.750
<v Speaker 2>finding good partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a good team</v>

651
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and always focus on the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are good at.</v>

652
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Focus on the things that you love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the record of partnership.</v>

653
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you a device for those young</v>

654
00:49:40.841 --> 00:49:41.674
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

655
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.030
<v Speaker 2>If you</v>

656
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 to 30 years old,</v>

657
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.820
<v Speaker 1>please find a good boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

658
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:56.780
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily good company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn from the bus.</v>

659
00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to do it while you have 30 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years old.</v>

660
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Try to do something yourself if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to try while you're 40 to 50</v>

661
00:50:10.071 --> 00:50:15.071
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things that you are good at after 20</v>

662
00:50:16.281 --> 00:50:19.730
<v Speaker 1>years of learning is you should do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something or good at where you are.</v>

663
00:50:19.731 --> 00:50:24.731
<v Speaker 1>50 to 60 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spending time supporting young people</v>

664
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixth over 60 are sold.</v>

665
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Spend time with your grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

666
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Is normally a lot of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where you are graduate,</v>

667
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 1>why you just in the university don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about I want resigned from the</v>

668
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 1>school and be under the Bill Gates</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Bill Gates left Harvard.</v>

669
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.770
<v Speaker 1>There's only one bill gates in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

670
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:02.500
<v Speaker 1>When you graduate find a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important.</v>

671

<v Speaker 1>Find a good boss.</v>

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just repeat the question.</v>

686
00:52:36.221 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 3>So every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>

687
00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.000
<v Speaker 3>she said three weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alibaba launch team all in Russia and is</v>

688
00:52:43.001 --> 00:52:47.230
<v Speaker 3>wondering what opportunities there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people in the room to contribute to</v>

689
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:52.290
<v Speaker 3>to Alibaba is team all team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How will you and your team developed</v>

690
00:52:59.221 --> 00:53:00.120
<v Speaker 3>team all here in Russia?</v>

692
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.700
<v Speaker 1>you very much for this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Timo rusher is something that</v>

693
00:53:13.531 --> 00:53:18.531
<v Speaker 1>Web testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally my wish is that she more</v>

694
00:53:20.821 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 1>rusher k in spy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As many people,</v>

695
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 1>as many entrepreneurs as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do the same thing.</v>

696
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 1>We not necessarily want to make Timo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia big.</v>

697
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I hope you understand my seat cause we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want Ali Baba one day become the</v>

698
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:48.000
<v Speaker 1>largest e commerce company in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no,</v>

699
00:53:48.001 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 1>this is my dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not our dream.</v>

700
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:56.210
<v Speaker 1>We won by work held Timo rusher.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lots of things we'll learn from Russia</v>

702
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:03.450
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you share with people so more young</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was having a lunch with our team in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have about 100 colleagues here</v>

716
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 2>and I sat</v>

717
00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:06.380
<v Speaker 1>in 10 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must have 5,000 people in Russia.</v>

718
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:12.670
<v Speaker 1>That means we need at least four foul</v>
<v Speaker 1>than 900 people.</v>

719
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:21.650
<v Speaker 1>These 5,000 people is not to the economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because five people do ecommerce in</v>

720
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:30.831
<v Speaker 1>Russia does not a work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 people kiss support rusher,</v>

721
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.760
<v Speaker 1>sme to do ecommerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 people can help logistic to</v>

<v Speaker 1>So many people keep on asking me,</v>
