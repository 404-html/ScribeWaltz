1
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>this multi-headed snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got this infinity problem.</v>

3
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that little circle down there,</v>

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cut off one head,</v>

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>seven more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the eternal problem of life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is they're there.</v>

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>There is the category of problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and it ain't going anywhere.</v>

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is can you deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole category at the same time?</v>

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how to be in the world is to deal</v>

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>with that category all at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so how did,</v>

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>how did human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they come up with as a</v>

13
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so cool too,</v>

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>because the solution they come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was the heroism that allows you</v>

15
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>to approach what you're terrified by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find that offensive and to</v>

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>learn from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the idea of sacrifice and that</v>

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>was played out by cultures everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including human sacrifice.</v>

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And you think what the hell was up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those crazy bastard so long ago?</v>

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>They were sacrificing to the gods all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but kind of clueless behavior was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned something and please God burned</v>

21
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>something valuable and pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was with that?</v>

23
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>What were they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>they weren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>

25
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>if they were stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here.</v>

26
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>They were not stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

27
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>they lived under a lot harsher</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions than we do.</v>

28
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>So those were some tough people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

29
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then you'd last about 15 minutes.</v>

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to be thinking of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors as stupid,</v>

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>like there's no real evidence that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>much different cognitively than we were</v>

32
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>150,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

33
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

34
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a discovery man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the discovery of the future.</v>

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like the future is actually the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where there is threat and it's</v>

37
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>always going to be there.</v>

38
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make sacrifices in the present so</v>

39
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>that the future is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing right now.</v>

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what your parents are doing when</v>

42
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>they pay money to send you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

43
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>they think you can bargain with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

44
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>You can bargain with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can force stole gratification now</v>

45
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and it'll pay off at a place in time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even exist yet.</v>

46
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wouldn't believe that?</v>

47
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a miracle that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs and it's not like people just</v>

48
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>figured that out overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were champs for Christ's sake.</v>

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Like how are we going to come up with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea like that?</v>

50
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>While it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>we thought about it for 7 million years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

52
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>we got to the point where we could kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of act it out,</v>

53
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know what we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a emerge is like a dream.</v>

54
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It was so the terror of the future is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream and his solution to the terror,</v>

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 1>the dream of the terror of the future is</v>
<v Speaker 1>another dream and it comes out in</v>

56
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.690
<v Speaker 1>mythology and in fantasy and in drama</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you act out the sacrifice and then</v>

57
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a step on the way to full</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

58
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>So we can say sacrifice now instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

59
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we still do it,</v>

60
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it's just not conquer like it used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

61
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>We do abstractly and we all have faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will work,</v>

62
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also set up our society so that</v>

63
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>it'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing about,</v>

64
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a</v>

65
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because I think it's an,</v>

66
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it's an extreme form of cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

67
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>apart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:42.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's minimal ways that you can set up</v>

70
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.981
<v Speaker 1>a society that will work and so one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is that this society has to be set</v>

71
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>up so that your sacrifices will pay off</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you won't work,</v>

72
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and then the society will die.</v>

73
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And so it has to make promises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have to make promises to one</v>

74
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what money is.</v>

75
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Money is a promise that your sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>will pay off in the future.</v>

76
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what money is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if the society is stable,</v>

77
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you can store up your work right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sacrifice your impulses and you</v>

78
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:21.031
<v Speaker 1>can work and you can store up credit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and then you can make the</v>

79
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>future a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but society has to be stable enough to</v>

80
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>allow for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperinflation will do you in.</v>

81
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>So the promise that's implicit in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency is the promise that what you're</v>

82
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>doing now will pay off in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if people don't have that promise,</v>

83
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what they do because in any</v>

84
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

85
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>and say gangs in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time horizon of the gang members</v>

86
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>shrinks rapidly because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really expect to be alive.</v>

87
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Pat Much past 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they get really impulsive and</v>

88
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 1>violent and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell not that's.</v>

89
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the future doesn't matter,</v>

90
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>when it's not real you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you default back to living in the moment</v>

91
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>and you take what you can get right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder because you don't know if</v>

92
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be around in a,</v>

93
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>in a year and you get whatever you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can bloody well get it and</v>

94
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>that's like anarchy that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to live in,</v>

95
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>some people like to live in that state</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're really wired for that,</v>

96
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>

97
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>they're much more comfortable in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

98
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like warrior types,</v>

99
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

100
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just where that stress will just</v>

101
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>the stress of a life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

103
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I've said that some people will tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the purpose of life is to be happy</v>

104
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 2>and those people are idiots and was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of a rough statement.</v>

105
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 2>But I what I meant by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually inspired by a statement</v>

106
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 2>by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>great critic of the Soviet prison</v>

107
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he commented that happiness is</v>

108
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>something that's done in by the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>harsh blow that reality deals you.</v>

109
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

110
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>and I believe this to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many circumstances in life</v>

111
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>where happiness is not only the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>

112
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but also where the expectation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness as a response,</v>

113
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 2>we'll put you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person attempting to be happy in</v>

114
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 2>absolutely the wrong psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

115
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>to be prepared for what must be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are built so to speak,</v>

116
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>to experience a very wide range of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational and emotional states that</v>

117
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 2>only bear a tenuous relationship to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

118
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that human beings inhabit is</v>

119
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:42.491
<v Speaker 2>so complex that are adaptation depends</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a variety of very finally</v>

120
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>differentiated responses and so there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a time to be compassionate and there's a</v>

121
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>time to be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>

122
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 2>and there's a time to be in pain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a time to be anxious and there's</v>

123
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:56.040
<v Speaker 2>a time to be joyous and a time to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied,</v>

124
00:06:56.041 --> 00:07:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and the healthy and well adapted person</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a very wide range of finally</v>

125
00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:05.511
<v Speaker 2>differentiated responses which cannot be</v>
<v Speaker 2>boiled down to a single dimension.</v>

126
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Say happiness versus unhappiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A life is not that simple.</v>

127
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.600
<v Speaker 2>If it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd only have one emotional system</v>

128
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Speaker 2>making happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The focal point of your life trivializes</v>

129
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.920
<v Speaker 2>your experiences because in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard anything as truly important,</v>

130
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you also have to regard it's loss as</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly meaningful,</v>

131
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 2>and that means that to open yourself up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experiences of deep meaning also</v>

132
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:35.460
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously means that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>open yourself up to the possibility of</v>

133
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.210
<v Speaker 2>deep hurt and sore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something strange that I've</v>

134
00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:44.211
<v Speaker 2>observed with my students is that when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>state the proposition tubing clearly</v>

135
00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that life is suffering and that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose of life is not happiness.</v>

136
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.490
<v Speaker 2>They actually experienced that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great relief and the reason I believe</v>

137
00:07:53.491 --> 00:07:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that they experienced in this great</v>
<v Speaker 2>relief is they already know it.</v>

138
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they wouldn't necessarily</v>

139
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:03.330
<v Speaker 2>articulate that their experience has</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught them that life is complex and</v>

140
00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 2>tragic and difficult.</v>

141
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayal of the ideal state of</v>

142
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.250
<v Speaker 2>humanness as happiness is that it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these people.</v>

143
00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:17.280
<v Speaker 2>These young people feel ashamed of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own suffering.</v>

144
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.450
<v Speaker 2>They feel that if they're suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they find their life tragic in its</v>

145
00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 2>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that means that there's something</v>

146
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them and instantly that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it impossible for them to communicate</v>

147
00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:31.740
<v Speaker 2>anything real about their own tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it appears to me that the price</v>

148
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:36.270
<v Speaker 2>we paid for being in suffering and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue there,</v>

149
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that this is what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater religious traditions of the</v>

150
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:44.631
<v Speaker 2>world have been attempting to elucidate</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the purpose of life given that</v>

151
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:49.881
<v Speaker 2>is to identify and and follow a motive</v>
<v Speaker 2>being that makes life justifiable even</v>

152
00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 2>given the radical necessity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

153
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.770
<v Speaker 2>If you're constantly in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>placidity satisfaction and happiness,</v>

154
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 2>then nothing is going to affect you</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply enough.</v>

155
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Not your own suffering and the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other people,</v>

156
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 2>not injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not not the horrors of the world.</v>

157
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is going to affect you deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so that you'll become deep and</v>

158
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>life without depth is by definition</v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow and meaningless,</v>

159
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>and there's a problem that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that because life is tragic and</v>

160
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>because life involves suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your philosophy is shallow and</v>

161
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 2>meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you suffer,</v>

162
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you will become resentful and hostile</v>
<v Speaker 2>and self critical and then you'll become</v>

163
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.310
<v Speaker 2>cruel and destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so not only is there a necessity for</v>

164
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:49.761
<v Speaker 2>your own mental health to forthrightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>confront the deepest questions of life,</v>

165
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you remained a danger to yourself</v>

166
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>and maybe more importantly to others,</v>

167
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an adolescent,</v>

168
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.950
<v Speaker 3>you also shed childhood potential to</v>
<v Speaker 3>become the limited but specialized and</v>

169
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.130
<v Speaker 3>potentially useful thing that you will</v>
<v Speaker 3>become.</v>

170
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.450
<v Speaker 3>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

171
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:11.090
<v Speaker 3>is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it worth shedding that potential?</v>

172
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 3>And Peter Pan's answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

173
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:16.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to remain in Neverland as a</v>

174
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:19.400
<v Speaker 3>magical boy forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's King of the lost boys,</v>

175
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 3>which I would say is not a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not much of a dominance</v>

176
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:22.664
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

177
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the king king of the King of the</v>

178
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 3>losers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

179
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>People who can't get their act together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mature.</v>

180
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you notice in Peter Pan that Peter</v>

181
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Pan doesn't grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't establish a relationship with</v>

182
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Wendy who's actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you</v>

183
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 3>know is a ferry and they don't exist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's really in some sense of figure</v>

184
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:48.380
<v Speaker 3>of his imagination because he won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>mature,</v>

185
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 3>he can't have an actual relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a genuine person.</v>

186
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.580
<v Speaker 3>So he has to satisfy himself with while</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like a pornographic</v>

187
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.250
<v Speaker 3>fantasy actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So seriously it is.</v>

188
00:10:58.251 --> 00:10:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

189
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a toned down a lot in the movie</v>

190
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:05.330
<v Speaker 3>version obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still that's what's underlying it.</v>

191
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow</v>

192
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:10.400
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is the only figure of</v>

193
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:14.720
<v Speaker 3>authority that's around for him as his</v>
<v Speaker 3>captain Hook and he doesn't like Captain</v>

194
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's because captain hook is a</v>

195
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 3>tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's brutal,</v>

196
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's also a coward because he's,</v>

197
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.960
<v Speaker 3>he's lost a hand already to a crocodile</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a clock in its stomach.</v>

198
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.720
<v Speaker 3>That's chaos and time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

199
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>that's the dragon that lives underneath</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

200
00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like the basset lisc can Harry</v>
<v Speaker 3>Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already</v>

201
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:34.790
<v Speaker 3>got a piece of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly the case.</v>

202
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Like that crocodile has got a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

203
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm older than 50 and so time is already</v>

204
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:42.590
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its grip on me and you know,</v>

205
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.420
<v Speaker 3>part of the problem of being adult is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you also have to take the fact that</v>

206
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:51.440
<v Speaker 3>your finite and limited into account and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're terrified by that,</v>

207
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>which people tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it can easily turn you into a</v>

208
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>tyrant because you're afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything or disgusted by everything</v>

209
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 3>and you have to ramp up the amount you</v>
<v Speaker 3>control it.</v>

210
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 3>And so Peter Pan looks at Captain</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norcott,</v>

211
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.830
<v Speaker 3>he thinks there's no damn way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to end up as.</v>

212
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 3>So he's got a bad role model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been telling people online in</v>

213
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 3>various ways in the lectures the patient</v>
<v Speaker 3>start fixing the world.</v>

214
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Bye.</v>

215
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Cleaning up the room and I want it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>just elaborate on that a little bit</v>

216
00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:22.061
<v Speaker 4>before I get back to the lecture itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'd say it's become this Internet</v>

217
00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.260
<v Speaker 4>weird Internet meme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

218
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.220
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

219
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a joke and good.</v>

220
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy about the fact that so</v>

221
00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:35.960
<v Speaker 4>much of this has got like the leaving of</v>
<v Speaker 4>humor and it's really important because</v>

222
00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:40.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what stops things from</v>
<v Speaker 4>degenerating into into conflict humor</v>

223
00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:44.150
<v Speaker 4>and I was thinking about this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>

224
00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:47.810
<v Speaker 4>the mustard seed idea and you see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing about cleaning up your room.</v>

225
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.070
<v Speaker 4>This is also something I learned from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl young and his studies on alchemy</v>

226
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:55.760
<v Speaker 4>because for young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the alchemist was attempting to</v>

227
00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:58.310
<v Speaker 4>make the philosopher's stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was not only engaged in the</v>

228
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:01.730
<v Speaker 4>transformation of the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was engaged in a process of self</v>

229
00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 4>transformation that occurred at the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>time as the,</v>

230
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.420
<v Speaker 4>as the chemical Trent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the chemical transformation.</v>

231
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.430
<v Speaker 4>So it was a psychological work in some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

232
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you want to sort out your room</v>
<v Speaker 4>and beautified because the beauty is</v>

233
00:13:14.151 --> 00:13:17.360
<v Speaker 4>also important and let's say that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have is just a little room like</v>

234
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.480
<v Speaker 4>you're not rich or you're poor and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have any power.</v>

235
00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:22.550
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got your damn room and you've</v>

236
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:25.010
<v Speaker 4>got this space right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that,</v>

237
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.630
<v Speaker 4>that that's a part of the cosmos that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can come to grips with and you might</v>

238
00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:29.991
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

239
00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:32.120
<v Speaker 4>what's there in front of you right in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of you?</v>

240
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.230
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is it depends on</v>
<v Speaker 4>how open your eyes art.</v>

241
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the proper answer because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could say,</v>

242
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 4>w William Blake said this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

243
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 4>eldest Huxley made comments that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>very similar that in a transcendent</v>

244
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.610
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see infinity in the finite and</v>

245
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.541
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

246
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can see infinity in what you</v>

247
00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:51.500
<v Speaker 4>have within your grasp.</v>

248
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 4>If you look and you could save,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's the case with your room and</v>

249
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.590
<v Speaker 4>so you want to clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

250
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.150
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you do that?</v>

251
00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

252
00:14:00.531 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 4>a room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his room is a place to sleep and so if</v>

253
00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:06.710
<v Speaker 4>you set your room up properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you figure out how to sleep and</v>

254
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:10.280
<v Speaker 4>when you should sleep and how you should</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep and then you figure out when you</v>

255
00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:12.830
<v Speaker 4>should wake up and then you figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what clothes you should wear</v>

256
00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:15.230
<v Speaker 4>because they have to be arranged</v>
<v Speaker 4>properly in your dresser and then you</v>

257
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:17.690
<v Speaker 4>have to have some place to put your</v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes and you're going to have some</v>

258
00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 4>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out what you're going</v>

259
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:21.170
<v Speaker 4>to wear those clothes to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

260
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 4>and then that means you have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what you're going to do and then</v>

261
00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:27.170
<v Speaker 4>your room has to serve that purpose</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise it isn't set up</v>

262
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:27.590
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

263
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.610
<v Speaker 4>And if it doesn't set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

264
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.370
<v Speaker 4>you will be unhappy and not happy in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

265
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:39.371
<v Speaker 4>Because the way that we perceive the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is as a place to move from point a</v>

266
00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:43.610
<v Speaker 4>to point B in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if the place that we're in</v>

267
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:46.520
<v Speaker 4>facilitates that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we're happy to be there.</v>

268
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.630
<v Speaker 4>And if the place that we're in serves as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an obstacle to that movement,</v>

269
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 4>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what it means to set up your room</v>

270
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 4>is that you have to have somewhere to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's worthwhile,</v>

271
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 4>or you can set up your room and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>room has to be set up to facilitate</v>

272
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the next thing is,</v>

273
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you have to make it beautiful,</v>

274
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 4>but that's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

275
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 4>That means you have to have some taste</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't mean you have to have</v>

276
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

277
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can be garish with money and</v>

278
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 4>you can be tasteful with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you need is taste and taste beats</v>

279
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:19.260
<v Speaker 4>money when it comes to beautifying</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

280
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 4>Not that money is trivial because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

281
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 4>But taste is crucial and people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>very artistically oriented can make</v>

282
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 4>beautiful things out of virtually</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

283
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the literature suggests that if you're</v>

284
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 4>going to make beautiful things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting real constraints on,</v>

285
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 4>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>facilitates creativity instead of</v>

286
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 4>interfering with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because let's say you have to make</v>

287
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.090
<v Speaker 4>something out of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

288
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.610
<v Speaker 4>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

289
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.650
<v Speaker 4>You have to make something out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

290
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 4>You have to be creative in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

291
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.780
<v Speaker 4>and so then to beautify your room means</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you also have to develop your</v>

292
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:58.781
<v Speaker 4>capacity to be creative and so then you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can make your room shine,</v>

293
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 4>but then what will happen is that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>your family isn't together,</v>

294
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 4>they will interfere with that.</v>

295
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 4>You will interfere with that because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't have the discipline to do it</v>

296
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:08.920
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when you start building this,</v>

297
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little microcosm of perfection with</v>

298
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 4>what you have at hand and it'll evoke</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the pathologies of everyone in your</v>

299
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:18.620
<v Speaker 4>household.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wonder what the hell you're up to in</v>

300
00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 4>there and they won't necessarily be</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy because if you're.</v>

301
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 4>If they're in a lowly place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say and so are you and you're</v>

302
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 4>trying to move out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the higher you move out of that,</v>

303
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 4>the more the place they're in looks bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you might say,</v>

304
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they should do is celebrate your</v>

305
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 4>victory over chaos and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't what will happen.</v>

306
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 4>What will happen instead is that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>will attempt to pull you back down.</v>

307
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 4>They'll attempt to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously all families don't do</v>

308
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

309
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.390
<v Speaker 4>but all families do that to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some families do almost nothing but</v>

310
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

311
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to organize your room,</v>

312
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to have to confront</v>
<v Speaker 4>the devils in your house and that's</v>

313
00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's often a terrifying thing because</v>

314
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:03.320
<v Speaker 4>some of those devils have have lineages</v>
<v Speaker 4>that go back many,</v>

315
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many generations and God only knows what</v>

316
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 4>you have to struggle with in order to</v>
<v Speaker 4>overcome that.</v>

317
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 4>And so and then and so to sort yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>out into fix up your room is a</v>

318
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 4>nontrivial matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

319
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 4>and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll learn by doing that and then</v>

320
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe you'll learn enough by doing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you can fix up your family a</v>

321
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then having done that,</v>

322
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 4>you'll have enough character so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you try to operate in the world at</v>

323
00:17:27.741 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 4>your job or maybe in the broader social</v>
<v Speaker 4>spheres,</v>

324
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 4>that you'll be a force for good instead</v>
<v Speaker 4>of harm.</v>

325
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 4>Because you will have learned some</v>
<v Speaker 4>humility by noting just how difficult it</v>

326
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 4>was to put your damn room together well</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yourself for that matter,</v>

327
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>and so you'll proceed cautiously with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your eyes open towards the good.</v>

328
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 4>I talked to people very frequently whose</v>
<v Speaker 4>families have them with too much</v>

329
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 4>protection and they know it themselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that means they're deprived of</v>

330
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:56.210
<v Speaker 4>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

331
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you see in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>

332
00:17:58.441 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

333
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.480
<v Speaker 4>the children are first generation</v>
<v Speaker 4>immigrants often do better than the than</v>

334
00:18:04.481 --> 00:18:07.340
<v Speaker 4>the than their children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that the</v>

335
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 4>children are first generation</v>
<v Speaker 4>immigrants,</v>

336
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 4>have necessity driving them and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know how much you need necessity</v>

337
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 4>to drive you because maybe you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>very disciplined.</v>

338
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 4>And if an a catastrophe doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately befall you.</v>

339
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 4>If you don't act forthrightly today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you'll never act</v>

340
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 4>forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

341
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Because the gap between your foolishness</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the punishment is,</v>

342
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 4>is lengthened by your unearned wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you never grow up and learn and</v>

343
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:37.611
<v Speaker 4>you have to get yourself away from your</v>
<v Speaker 4>dependency in order to allow necessity</v>

344
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 4>to drive you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's to become independent and to</v>

345
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 4>become mature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of what's happening in</v>

346
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:47.570
<v Speaker 4>our culture is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

347
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.630
<v Speaker 4>the force that's attacking the</v>
<v Speaker 4>forthright movement forward of young men</v>

348
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:58.851
<v Speaker 4>in particular is afraid of the power of</v>
<v Speaker 4>man because it's confused about the</v>

349
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 4>distinction between power and authority</v>
<v Speaker 4>and competence.</v>

350
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Like I know a man who's who has</v>
<v Speaker 4>authority and competence has power as a</v>

351
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 4>byproduct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the authority and competence is</v>

352
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

353
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people who can't understand that</v>

354
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.890
<v Speaker 4>fail to make the distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 4>power and authority of competence and</v>

355
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of power and so they</v>
<v Speaker 4>destroy authority and competence.</v>

356
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 4>And that's a terrible thing because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>need authority and competence.</v>

357
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 4>What else is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else is going to allow us to</v>

358
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>prevail in the long run?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you get away from your country</v>

359
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:36.450
<v Speaker 4>and you get away from your kin and from</v>
<v Speaker 4>your father's house,</v>

360
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go out there and you establish</v>

361
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 4>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a call to adventure.</v>

362
00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:44.470
<v Speaker 4>That's what this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first lines in the Abrahamic story</v>

363
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:49.350
<v Speaker 4>is a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So great unto a land that I will show</v>

364
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

365
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

366
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that</v>

367
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 4>I've been struck very hard by a number</v>
<v Speaker 4>of writers,</v>

368
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously among them,</v>

369
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote things like Nicha that if you</v>

370
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 4>understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just break you into pieces you</v>

371
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:12.890
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that you and</v>

372
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 4>understood in the psychoanalysts</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>

373
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most terrifying elements</v>
<v Speaker 4>of psychoanalytic thinking is very</v>

374
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 4>tightly aligned with religious thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that you are not the master of</v>

375
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 4>your own house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are spirits that dwelling within</v>

376
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning you have a will and you can</v>

377
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 4>exercise a certain amount of conscious</v>
<v Speaker 4>control over your being,</v>

378
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 4>but there are all sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>occur within you that seemed to be</v>

379
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 4>beyond your capacity to control your</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams.</v>

380
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good example of your</v>

381
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 4>impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

382
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 4>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might think of those as so foreign</v>

383
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.420
<v Speaker 4>from you that they're not even.</v>

384
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't even want them to be part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

385
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 4>but more subtly even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about what you're interested in?</v>

386
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 4>What compels you like where does that</v>
<v Speaker 4>come from?</v>

387
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you can't,</v>

388
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 4>you can't conjure it up of your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>accord,</v>

389
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're a student and you're taking</v>

390
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 4>difficult course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might say to yourself,</v>

391
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to sit down and study for three</v>

392
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you sit down and that is what</v>

393
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your attention goes everywhere and you</v>

394
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:11.704
<v Speaker 4>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

395
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 4>whose attention is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>

396
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 4>If it goes everywhere because you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your attention,</v>

397
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.044
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

398
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 4>if it's your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you'd be able to control it,</v>

399
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might think,</v>

400
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 4>well jen and just exactly what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>is controlling it.</v>

401
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.991
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

402
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 4>it's random.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better not be random.</v>

403
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens to some degree in</v>

404
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an element of randomness in</v>

405
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not random.</v>

406
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 4>It's driven by the action of phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think are best considered as</v>

407
00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:43.100
<v Speaker 4>something like subpersonalities or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll even.</v>

408
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120
<v Speaker 4>That's only a partial description.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't make yourself interested in</v>

409
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:53.671
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interest manifests itself in grips you.</v>

410
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what is it that's gripping you</v>

411
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 4>and how do you conceptualize that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a divine power?</v>

412
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's divine as far as your concerned</v>

413
00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 4>because it grips you and you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything about it.</v>

414
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 4>And so there's a calling in you towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're compelled by and what you're</v>

415
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 4>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes that might be very dark</v>

416
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're compelled forward by your</v>

417
00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

418
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 4>and so the idea that what moves you away</v>
<v Speaker 4>from your country and your father's</v>

419
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 4>house and the comforts of your childhood</v>
<v Speaker 4>home is,</v>

420
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 4>is something that's beyond you and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you listened to in Harken to.</v>

421
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can say,</v>

422
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to call it that God.</v>

423
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like it doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>call it.</v>

424
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter to what it is,</v>

425
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 4>what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It still is.</v>

426
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.930
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the other thing.</v>

427
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 4>If you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've been a clinician and talked to</v>

428
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:52.660
<v Speaker 4>enough people now as old as I am to know</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

429
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do not listen to that thing that</v>

430
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 4>beckons you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will pay for it like you cannot</v>

431
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.420
<v Speaker 4>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll have everything that's terrible</v>

432
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:05.800
<v Speaker 4>about life in your life and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it that's good and worse.</v>

433
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 4>You'll know that it was your fault and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you squandered what you could have</v>

434
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:15.181
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is not only a calling forth,</v>

435
00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 4>but a warning unto a land that I will</v>
<v Speaker 4>show thee and that's it.</v>

436
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 4>That I will show the that and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be too concrete about this.</v>

437
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of new territories</v>

438
00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 4>that you can inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you abstract and conceptual</v>

439
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 4>territories of Gilda University and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>study biology or you study physics or,</v>

440
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 4>or any discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a territory,</v>

441
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the territory that all of the</v>

442
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 4>scholars have established and then as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you master the discipline,</v>

443
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 4>you move out beyond the established</v>
<v Speaker 4>territory,</v>

444
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 4>into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a new right.</v>

445
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's even a land of your enemies</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that matter,</v>

446
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's a new land to the frontier is</v>
<v Speaker 4>always in front of you.</v>

447
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they earth was less inhabited than</v>

448
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 4>it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frontier was the psychological</v>

449
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 4>frontier and the geographical frontier</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the same thing and now they've</v>

450
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 4>separated to some degree because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not so much geographical frontier,</v>

451
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's the frontier is a place that</v>
<v Speaker 4>never disappears and the land that's</v>

452
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 4>beyond the land that you know is always</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

453
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's always where you should go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of that packed into these four</v>

454
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 4>phrases so</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

455
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 4>So when I've been thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative,</v>

456
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 4>you look at the world through a story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

457
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 4>you can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this story is what gives value to</v>

458
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 4>the world or or the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you extract from the value of the</v>

459
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can look at it either way,</v>

460
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 4>you're somewhere and it's not good</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

461
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the eternal human predicament.</v>

462
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't good enough.</v>

463
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 4>And to some degree that's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing because if it was good</v>

464
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's nothing for you to do.</v>

465
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually maybe a good thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insufficient.</v>

466
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.400
<v Speaker 4>And that might be why sometimes having</v>
<v Speaker 4>less is is better than having more.</v>

467
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 4>And I don't want to be a pollyanna about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

468
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that there's deprivation that can</v>

469
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 4>reach to the point where it's no where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's completely counterproductive,</v>

470
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't always the case that</v>
<v Speaker 4>starting with little is you.</v>

471
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 4>If you start with little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start with more possibility.</v>

472
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you moved from always from what's</v>

473
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 4>unbearable about the present to some</v>
<v Speaker 4>better future.</v>

474
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't have that,</v>

475
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 4>then you have no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have nothing but threat and negative</v>

476
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:22.340
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have no positive emotion because the</v>

477
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 4>positive emotion is generated in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conception of the better future.</v>

478
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:29.450
<v Speaker 4>And then the evidence that you generate</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

479
00:25:29.451 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 4>that you're moving towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the positive and fulfilling</v>

480
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:34.730
<v Speaker 4>meaning of life comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you want to set up this structure</v>

481
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

482
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.660
<v Speaker 4>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what it means is that you want to</v>

483
00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:43.661
<v Speaker 4>be going somewhere that's good enough so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the going is worth the while and</v>

484
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 4>you can ask yourself that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly what we tried to build</v>

485
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 4>into the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

486
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know what's wrong with life.</v>

487
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 4>It's rife with suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 4>insufficiency and deception and evil.</v>

488
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 4>It's all of that obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

489
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.640
<v Speaker 4>What would make the journey worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

490
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.470
<v Speaker 4>you can ask yourself that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

491
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.081
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

492
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 4>In order to bear up under this load,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that I would need to be</v>

493
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 4>striving to attain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you ask yourself that,</v>

494
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 4>that's to knock and the door will open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that means.</v>

495
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 4>If you ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you will find an answer and you'll</v>

496
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:18.290
<v Speaker 4>think you'll shrink away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll think,</v>

497
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I could do that.</v>

498
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

499
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.580
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's possible and</v>

500
00:26:25.581 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 4>you're not as much as you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so god only knows what you could,</v>

501
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.110
<v Speaker 4>what you could do and have and give if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sacrificed everything to it.</v>

502
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.270
<v Speaker 4>And that's the reason that Abraham is</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly making sacrifices.</v>

503
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.440
<v Speaker 4>It's archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

504
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 4>He's burning up like baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

505
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're alive.</v>

506
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 4>You know that's something and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable and that's something it's you</v>

507
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 4>have to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you think about it as a modern</v>

508
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the act of sacrificing something</v>

509
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 4>might have some dramatic compulsion to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

510
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go out into a flock and to take</v>

511
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 4>something that's new board and to cut</v>
<v Speaker 4>its throat into bleed it into burn.</v>

512
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 4>It might be a way of indicating to</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself that you're actually serious</v>

513
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 4>about something and it isn't so obvious</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have rituals of seriousness like</v>

514
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 4>that now and so it's not so obvious that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're actually serious about anything</v>

515
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.570
<v Speaker 4>and so maybe that's not such a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and so maybe we shouldn't be</v>

516
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 4>thinking that these people were so</v>
<v Speaker 4>archaic and primitive and superstitious.</v>

517
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that they knew something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we don't.</v>

518
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly in the abrahamic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that maintains</v>

519
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:32.690
<v Speaker 4>Abraham's covenant with God is his</v>
<v Speaker 4>continual willingness to sacrifice it.</v>

520
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 4>It's so that sacrificial issue is so</v>
<v Speaker 4>important because you are not committed</v>

521
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:39.510
<v Speaker 4>to something unless you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice for it.</v>

522
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Commitment and sacrifice are the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and I think its borders on</v>

523
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 4>miraculous that those concepts are</v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded into this narrative at the</v>

524
00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 4>level of dramatic action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

525
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:55.000
<v Speaker 4>instead of abstract explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are acting this out and the</v>

526
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 4>fundamental conception is so profound</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's really quite.</v>

527
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.380
<v Speaker 4>It's quite inspiring and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathtaking.</v>

528
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you understand what message is</v>

529
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 4>trying to be conveyed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to make sacrifices and what do</v>

530
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 4>you have to sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to sacrifice that which is most</v>

531
00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:16.671
<v Speaker 4>valuable to you currently that stopping</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and God only knows what that is.</v>

532
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly the worst of you.</v>

533
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly that and god only knows</v>
<v Speaker 4>to what degree you're in love with the</v>

534
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:27.600
<v Speaker 4>worst of you so</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

535
00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Speaker 4>so you moved from the unbearable</v>
<v Speaker 4>president to the ideal future and and</v>

536
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 4>you can't help that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to live in a structure like</v>

537
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your house.</v>

538
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you want to get your house in</v>

539
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:41.730
<v Speaker 4>order and if you want it to be a place</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can live properly,</v>

540
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:46.731
<v Speaker 4>then you have to plan the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is perfect.</v>

541
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

542
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.610
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means it's good for you.</v>

543
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I,</v>

544
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do all the time with my clinical and</v>

545
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 4>consulting clients is trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what would be good for them,</v>

546
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.050
<v Speaker 4>but we do more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We try to think,</v>

547
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:04.660
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what,</v>

548
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.050
<v Speaker 4>how can we set this up so it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for you?</v>

549
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 4>And that all the consequences of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are things that are good for other</v>

550
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so because people are often also</v>

551
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 4>timid about trying to get something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good for themselves because they</v>

552
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:18.960
<v Speaker 4>feel that it's selfish or that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't deserve it.</v>

553
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 4>So we set it up so that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well look,</v>

554
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 4>we're going to set it up so that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>plainly obvious that this will not harm</v>

555
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 4>the structure of the universe for you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have what you need and to do it in a way</v>

556
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 4>that's of benefit to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no downside,</v>

557
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you have oriented yourself</v>

558
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>but not perfectly because you're full of</v>
<v Speaker 4>and errors.</v>

559
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 5>So then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you have to fix those errors.</v>

560
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 5>But you still have to be oriented.</v>

561
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.170
<v Speaker 5>This is why I started getting interested</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get interested in the phenomenon of</v>

562
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 5>meaning as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a phenomenological experience to</v>

563
00:29:56.981 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 5>experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not exactly obvious what that means</v>

564
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 5>to experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that you can,</v>

565
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 5>you can approach it obliquely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

566
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 5>like if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch yourself for two weeks and notice</v>

567
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing something that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>regard as meaningful,</v>

568
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:12.484
<v Speaker 5>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well here,</v>

569
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 5>here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's some markers.</v>

570
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 5>You lose a sense of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You lose a sense of vulnerability.</v>

571
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 5>You're deeply engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems,</v>

572
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 5>it seems worth the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

573
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.760
<v Speaker 5>You forget yourself while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

574
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.360
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you forget your existential</v>
<v Speaker 5>concerns while you're doing it.</v>

575
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:32.740
<v Speaker 5>You're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>ruminating or obsessing about the</v>

576
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 5>meaning of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

577
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.830
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's markers for,</v>

578
00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 5>it's like the flow states that chicks at</v>
<v Speaker 5>my highly described.</v>

579
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.373
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

580
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.860
<v Speaker 5>and then you can experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You experienced it under a certain sort</v>

581
00:30:45.861 --> 00:30:48.440
<v Speaker 5>of ritualistic conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might experience it when you go see</v>

582
00:30:48.441 --> 00:30:50.690
<v Speaker 5>a great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might experience it when you listen</v>

583
00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:52.370
<v Speaker 5>to music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think music is a very,</v>

584
00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:57.080
<v Speaker 5>very standard pathway for people to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of experience because</v>

585
00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.380
<v Speaker 5>virtually everyone gets intimations of</v>
<v Speaker 5>mute of meaning from music and I think</v>

586
00:31:02.571 --> 00:31:07.571
<v Speaker 5>music music is hierarchically structured</v>
<v Speaker 5>patterns that are representative of</v>

587
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.080
<v Speaker 5>being laying itself out properly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that,</v>

588
00:31:12.081 --> 00:31:17.081
<v Speaker 5>so it's an abstract representation of</v>
<v Speaker 5>proper being and so we can.</v>

589
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.030
<v Speaker 5>We can grapple with the phenomena of</v>
<v Speaker 5>music and we can.</v>

590
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Speaker 5>We can bark or phenomenon meaning we can</v>
<v Speaker 5>box it in a little bit and start to</v>

591
00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 5>conceptualize it.</v>

592
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.810
<v Speaker 6>W</v>

593
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.040
<v Speaker 5>we can start to conceptualize it perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the manifestation of a deep instinct</v>

594
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Speaker 5>and so I would say well meaning is what</v>
<v Speaker 5>manifests itself when you are,</v>

595
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:44.830
<v Speaker 5>when you've oriented yourself properly</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you've optimized the flow of</v>

596
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 5>information between you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>between you and chaos.</v>

597
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.830
<v Speaker 5>That might be the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it because literally you think</v>

598
00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:56.900
<v Speaker 5>about a piece of music because you want</v>
<v Speaker 5>it to be predictable,</v>

599
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.570
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want it to be perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 5>predictable.</v>

600
00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:03.320
<v Speaker 5>You want it to be predictable with some</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting variations and predictable</v>

601
00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:06.200
<v Speaker 5>with some variations that make sense and</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you can conceptualize that as</v>

602
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:09.830
<v Speaker 5>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's predictable at this order</v>

603
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.600
<v Speaker 5>of of stability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's varying down here from time to</v>

604
00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:18.170
<v Speaker 5>time and so you've got stable stability</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

605
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.560
<v Speaker 5>but variability there and you can handle</v>
<v Speaker 5>that so you want</v>

606
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.530
<v Speaker 5>an overarching structure stability with</v>
<v Speaker 5>some internal variability and maybe</v>

607
00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:30.230
<v Speaker 5>that's the way that you update yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>without falling apart,</v>

608
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.500
<v Speaker 5>and then I would say you can find the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pathway to the optimal rate of update by</v>

609
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 5>relying on your sense of meaning.</v>

610
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it tells you is that you're.</v>

611
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 5>You're wandering you're way through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world between the catastrophes of chaos</v>

612
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 5>in the catastrophes of order and now and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you swing into the proper locale.</v>

613
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're where you should be,</v>

614
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 5>and what happens is you get engaged by</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

615
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:59.810
<v Speaker 5>You get meaningfully engaged by that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fragile.</v>

616
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 5>It'll move on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

617
00:33:00.861 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 5>Because it's very difficult to exist at</v>
<v Speaker 5>that point constantly.</v>

618
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 5>Your bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of things,</v>

619
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 5>your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of things that are</v>

620
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 5>going to interfere with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that that isn't</v>

621
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:15.500
<v Speaker 5>where you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so then you might say,</v>

622
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where you should strive to be all</v>

623
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the question might be,</v>

624
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would it be like if you were there</v>

625
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:27.311
<v Speaker 5>all the time and I think that's where</v>
<v Speaker 5>intimations of paradise come from being</v>

626
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 5>when words think it was words.</v>

627
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Wordsworth talked about intimations of</v>
<v Speaker 5>immortality and childhood.</v>

628
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 5>People tend to romanticize their</v>
<v Speaker 5>childhood because of the sense of</v>

629
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 5>intense engagement that goes along with</v>
<v Speaker 5>being a child and it's one of the</v>

630
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 5>wonderful things about being around</v>
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>

631
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

632
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's why they pay you for their care and</v>

633
00:33:47.811 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 5>the way that children pay you for their</v>
<v Speaker 5>care is that they turn normal things</v>

634
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 5>into magic again when you're around them</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you've seen it 100 times before.</v>

635
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 5>And so when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see it.</v>

636
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:02.870
<v Speaker 5>You see what you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when a child sees that they don't</v>

637
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 5>because they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they see it.</v>

638
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 5>And then when you watch them see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see it too.</v>

639
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 5>And so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tremendous fun leading a small</v>

640
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 5>child around to do things that you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>done before because they're so,</v>

641
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like this,</v>

642
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.370
<v Speaker 5>they're like all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's too much.</v>

643
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 5>Then they cry and they get upset and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

644
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 5>but a good part of the time it's just</v>
<v Speaker 5>wild eyed wonder and then you can see</v>

645
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:26.960
<v Speaker 5>the world through their eyes and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>payment.</v>

646
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.290
<v Speaker 5>And so that's that sense of being</v>
<v Speaker 5>engaged.</v>

647
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:33.650
<v Speaker 5>Like that is something that people love</v>
<v Speaker 5>about children and rightly so,</v>

648
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a marker to the proper way</v>
<v Speaker 5>of being.</v>

649
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there there's a dictum in the.</v>

650
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 5>This is a union idea that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 5>difference between the archetype of the</v>

651
00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 5>wise old man in the archetype of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>child.</v>

652
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 5>They're the same thing because the wise</v>
<v Speaker 5>old man is the person who found what he</v>

653
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 5>had in childhood but lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

654
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a very powerful moment.</v>

655
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Tif is that the purpose of maturation is</v>
<v Speaker 5>to return to this state of childhood as</v>

656
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 5>a mature being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to stay in the state of childhood,</v>

657
00:35:01.791 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 5>that's Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to make the sacrifices necessary for</v>

658
00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 5>maturation and then return so well.</v>

659
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 5>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

660
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.230
<v Speaker 5>you do that in part by noticing what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that's meaningful for you to engage</v>

661
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's your nervous system</v>

662
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 5>reporting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right hemisphere and left hemisphere</v>

663
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 5>balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The balance between chaos and order</v>

664
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 5>produces an output that says you are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right place.</v>

665
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.300
<v Speaker 5>It's a perception.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The meaning is a perception of being in</v>

666
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 5>the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the genuine thing.</v>

667
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it can be pathologized.</v>

668
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing and that's why I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a call to virtue in most great</v>

669
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 5>religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to rely on your sense of</v>

670
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 5>meaning to Orient you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to play a straight game because</v>

671
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you warp and twist the inputs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the mechanism won't function</v>

672
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

673
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were only.</v>

674
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you blinded yourself to half the</v>

675
00:35:57.931 --> 00:36:00.140
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't use your perception story at</v>

676
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 5>yourself properly because the half of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world that you ignoring is going to</v>

677
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 5>pop up at you unexpectedly and take you</v>
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>

678
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 5>and so if your relationship with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world isn't pristine,</v>

679
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 5>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>primarily,</v>

680
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 5>then you can't rely on your own internal</v>
<v Speaker 5>orienting mechanisms and then you either</v>

681
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 5>fall into chaos which is an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe or you have to rely on some</v>

682
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 5>kind of external authority and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you prone to possession by</v>

683
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.320
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical etiologies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

684
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:28.650
<v Speaker 5>which give you that sense of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you should in fact have as a</v>

685
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 5>consequence of your own action.</v>

686
00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.370
<v Speaker 7>What should you be aiming for in your</v>
<v Speaker 7>life?</v>

687
00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.870
<v Speaker 7>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can tell you that roughly speaking,</v>

688
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.150
<v Speaker 7>if you're looking for something that</v>
<v Speaker 7>will give your life meaning,</v>

689
00:36:38.151 --> 00:36:39.050
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's.</v>

690
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Speaker 7>That's actually quite straightforward as</v>
<v Speaker 7>far as I'm thinking in detail.</v>

691
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.610
<v Speaker 7>This is where the nihilists happened so</v>
<v Speaker 7>wrong that it's almost unbelievable as</v>

692
00:36:46.611 --> 00:36:48.050
<v Speaker 7>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fundamentally,</v>

693
00:36:48.051 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 7>they're just escaping from</v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility anyways.</v>

694
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.240
<v Speaker 7>Even though they are perfectly rational</v>
<v Speaker 7>arguments for their nihilism.</v>

695
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.640
<v Speaker 7>Everything's meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

696
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.200
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

697
00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 7>no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not meaningless.</v>

698
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.450
<v Speaker 7>You never going to meet anyone who will</v>
<v Speaker 7>tell you that their pain is meaningless</v>

699
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.870
<v Speaker 7>so we can forego the whole meeting was</v>
<v Speaker 7>right off the bat.</v>

700
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.010
<v Speaker 7>There may be no positive because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can have a discussion about that,</v>

701
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.900
<v Speaker 7>but south the negative meaning exists</v>
<v Speaker 7>and everyone knows even someone who's in</v>

702
00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.110
<v Speaker 7>Archicad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nihilistic to the core drug,</v>

703
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.870
<v Speaker 7>a spike through their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going to act like that has</v>

704
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:28.871
<v Speaker 7>meaning and since I'm not an existential</v>
<v Speaker 7>and look at how people are instead of</v>

705
00:37:30.861 --> 00:37:34.040
<v Speaker 7>what they say and they'll act out the</v>
<v Speaker 7>idea that that has meaning very,</v>

706
00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:36.170
<v Speaker 7>very rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we'll just go with that.</v>

707
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 7>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

708
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.990
<v Speaker 7>there's all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's not the kind of meaning that</v>

709
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 7>I believe doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe that only positive meaning</v>

710
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 7>doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a little on the negative side,</v>

711
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:50.540
<v Speaker 7>I would say at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I can understand it.</v>

712
00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:53.030
<v Speaker 7>People have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People can have pretty dreadful lights,</v>

713
00:37:53.031 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you can easily get yourself into a</v>

714
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.820
<v Speaker 7>situation where it seems like there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing at all to your life.</v>

715
00:37:57.821 --> 00:38:00.140
<v Speaker 7>Accept suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what happens to people who</v>

716
00:38:00.141 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 7>become suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

717
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Speaker 7>and it's no joke and they have the</v>
<v Speaker 7>reasons.</v>

718
00:38:03.921 --> 00:38:07.370
<v Speaker 7>Now you know sometimes those people have</v>
<v Speaker 7>been hurt in ways that are absolutely</v>

719
00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:11.180
<v Speaker 7>unimaginable and so when they see a</v>
<v Speaker 7>horizon that's full of nothing but</v>

720
00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:13.580
<v Speaker 7>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't just wave that away,</v>

721
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 7>but I would say</v>

722
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:22.750
<v Speaker 7>the first thing we might hypothesize is</v>
<v Speaker 7>that pain is an unalterable fact of</v>

723
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:25.610
<v Speaker 7>meeting and certainly seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>negative,</v>

724
00:38:25.611 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 7>but one of the things you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 7>try to orient yourself in relationship</v>

725
00:38:29.211 --> 00:38:31.990
<v Speaker 7>to is the reduction of human suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

726
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.970
<v Speaker 7>because I think that's you know the</v>
<v Speaker 7>answer,</v>

727
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 7>what you do about a child who's</v>
<v Speaker 7>suffering in a concentration camp is it</v>

728
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 7>who the hell is going to care the</v>
<v Speaker 7>billion ears,</v>

729
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not the right answer.</v>

730
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 7>And if it's not the right answer in that</v>
<v Speaker 7>situation that perhaps it's not the</v>

731
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 7>right answer at all and the right answer</v>
<v Speaker 7>to who the hell is going to care anyways</v>

732
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 7>in a million years is why the world</v>
<v Speaker 7>would you frame in state that</v>

733
00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 7>idiotically mean anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anybody?</v>

734
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 7>This has kind of a trick of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination in some sense of anybody</v>

735
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:07.270
<v Speaker 7>who's quick witted can come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 7>frame of reference that makes anything</v>

736
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 7>that makes almost anything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lack meaning within that frame of</v>

737
00:39:11.321 --> 00:39:12.154
<v Speaker 7>reference.</v>

738
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 7>What all that means to me is that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>pick the stupid frequent reference,</v>

739
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why should you?</v>

740
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 7>Why should you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Except without doubt,</v>

741
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 7>the consequence of your stupid</v>
<v Speaker 7>algorithm.</v>

742
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.000
<v Speaker 7>Who's going to care in a million years?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

743
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>

744
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 7>you got to be able to do better than</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

745
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 7>If that's what you're going to wipe</v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning.</v>

746
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so what do you want for meaning?</v>

747
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 7>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>reduce suffering.</v>

748
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 7>That'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could devote your life to that and I</v>

749
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:39.720
<v Speaker 7>would say start locally and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

750
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 7>and I think this is the alternative to</v>
<v Speaker 7>rightly nationalism and which is too</v>

751
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:46.900
<v Speaker 7>much order and left wing the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is too much chaos.</v>

752
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 7>We don't want to go down that rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 7>hole again,</v>

753
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.280
<v Speaker 7>either of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what's the alternative?</v>

754
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 7>I thought about this for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

755
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.000
<v Speaker 7>It took me decades to come to this</v>
<v Speaker 7>conclusion.</v>

756
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 7>The conclusion is just that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>straightened yourself out and you do</v>

757
00:39:58.721 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 7>that humbling.</v>

758
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 7>Here's this idea that the new testament,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I get quite a kick out of,</v>

759
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.550
<v Speaker 7>that you're not supposed to pray in</v>
<v Speaker 7>public and a little more complicated</v>

760
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:07.131
<v Speaker 7>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Actually.</v>

761
00:40:07.131 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 7>You're not supposed to frame the problem</v>
<v Speaker 7>until you sorta out the dispute that you</v>

762
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 7>have with your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For example.</v>

763
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 7>I really like that idea because what it</v>
<v Speaker 7>means is that you shouldn't make a</v>

764
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 7>public display of your virtue until</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've straightened up your damn life,</v>

765
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.220
<v Speaker 7>and this is one of the things I really</v>
<v Speaker 7>liked about protests and I really don't</v>

766
00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 7>like the fact that university students</v>
<v Speaker 7>are taught by their pathway and</v>

767
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 7>professors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That the way that you change your world.</v>

768
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.870
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

769
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 7>You don't change the world by going and</v>
<v Speaker 7>waving signs that people that you've</v>

770
00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:50.480
<v Speaker 7>defined as more equal than,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but first of all probability that</v>

771
00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.850
<v Speaker 7>they're more useful than you is actually</v>
<v Speaker 7>quite low</v>

772
00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.390
<v Speaker 7>because he up may be you're in the same</v>
<v Speaker 7>damn boat and if you've divided the</v>

773
00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 7>world up conveniently so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 7>identify the innocence and the and the</v>

774
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:06.560
<v Speaker 7>dam or the oppressor and the oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you think that if you're in the</v>

775
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.470
<v Speaker 7>positive category,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then the probability that you're part of</v>

776
00:41:09.471 --> 00:41:12.620
<v Speaker 7>the solution and not part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 7>is zero.</v>

777
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.950
<v Speaker 7>So it's just not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Know I'm the most profound people that</v>

778
00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:19.050
<v Speaker 7>don't have you said the same thing over</v>
<v Speaker 7>and over.</v>

779
00:41:19.051 --> 00:41:22.040
<v Speaker 7>It's like the line between good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 7>runs down the middle of every human</v>

780
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:25.220
<v Speaker 7>heart and the first thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>supposed to do is win that battle on</v>

781
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:27.800
<v Speaker 7>your own territory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's no bloody joke.</v>

782
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.370
<v Speaker 7>That's a difficult thing to do because</v>
<v Speaker 7>it means that you have to recognize</v>

783
00:41:31.371 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Recognize yourself as a of gravy and</v>

784
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 7>that is what you are and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 7>terrible thing for me to learn.</v>

785
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.850
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you look at the 20th century and</v>

786
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:41.631
<v Speaker 7>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

787
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 7>who brought on the horrors of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>cognitive systems and the horrors of the</v>

788
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 7>Nazi system is the answer is people just</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you.</v>

789
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 7>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you don't understand that and you</v>

790
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:55.770
<v Speaker 7>think that answer is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you're not very wise and the and</v>

791
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.090
<v Speaker 7>it's not surprising because the price</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you paid for wisdom,</v>

792
00:41:59.091 --> 00:42:02.660
<v Speaker 7>this is radical disillusion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>disillusion lip and the confrontation</v>

793
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 7>with England and no one wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

794
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.490
<v Speaker 7>It's a terrible thing to confront and</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's because human beings are terrible</v>

795
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 7>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

796
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 7>I think we're also absolutely remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 7>creatures and wonderful creatures.</v>

797
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 7>We have an unlimited capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 7>brutality and evil and every one of us</v>

798
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 7>carries it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so what you do is you try to sort</v>

799
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 7>that out in your own life and you start.</v>

800
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 7>I haven't gotten to talk to me just a</v>
<v Speaker 7>while back about about his life.</v>

801
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 7>Haven't been going very well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He decided to put himself together and</v>

802
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 7>he started doing this little ritual</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

803
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 7>which I thought was quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was kind of an isolated guy,</v>

804
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 7>very overweight guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I talk to him,</v>

805
00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:43.850
<v Speaker 7>he lost about 130 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was quite impressive for this part</v>

806
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 7>of the putting himself together,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he started doing it by bill.</v>

807
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 7>He had a bunch of labels leftover from</v>
<v Speaker 7>his childhood and the first thing he</v>

808
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 7>did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because he was feeling very nihilistic</v>

809
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:53.670
<v Speaker 7>and hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

810
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he found that he got a little bit of</v>

811
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 7>satisfaction out of building little</v>
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>

812
00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.150
<v Speaker 7>other labels,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

813
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.040
<v Speaker 7>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well that was pretty interesting.</v>

814
00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:02.240
<v Speaker 7>And so he built a bunch of these things</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then he said,</v>

815
00:43:02.241 --> 00:43:03.730
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got a bunch of these things built.</v>

816
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.670
<v Speaker 7>Then I had to figure out how to organize</v>
<v Speaker 7>them in the room angry.</v>

817
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 7>I thought that's cool because he started</v>
<v Speaker 7>higher resolution at the level of</v>

818
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:11.401
<v Speaker 7>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

819
00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 7>what it was building something that was</v>
<v Speaker 7>trivial.</v>

820
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 7>He knew that he was just playing the</v>
<v Speaker 7>game,</v>

821
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 7>but then as soon as he had a collection</v>
<v Speaker 7>of those,</v>

822
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 7>then you have to sort out the space that</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was going to organize them in many</v>

823
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:22.960
<v Speaker 7>figured out under sort of the room that</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were going to be.</v>

824
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.720
<v Speaker 7>So we started organizing and beautifying</v>
<v Speaker 7>the room and at the same time he</v>

825
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 7>modified his diet and he was putting</v>
<v Speaker 7>himself together.</v>

826
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 7>That's the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the right thing to do is that</v>

827
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.660
<v Speaker 7>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are responsibilities that are</v>

828
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 7>awaiting you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right that are in your own grass and you</v>

829
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 7>know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is also something that no one</v>

830
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:43.370
<v Speaker 7>can preach to you about.</v>

831
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.400
<v Speaker 7>It's something you have to decide for</v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself and you can do it quite</v>

832
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 7>straightforwardly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's something that I do on a regular</v>

833
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 7>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You sit down the anything or in the</v>

834
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:56.711
<v Speaker 7>morning and ask yourself like you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>asking someone that you want the answer</v>

835
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 7>from like really genuinely needed to</v>
<v Speaker 7>have the chicken.</v>

836
00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 7>Not telling yourself none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're asking yourself,</v>

837
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a bunch of things about my life</v>

838
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 7>that are in an order that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 7>together and I know it and they're</v>

839
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:12.950
<v Speaker 7>making me suffer and they're making me</v>
<v Speaker 7>less than I am.</v>

840
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 7>And there's some of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 7>are staring me right at the face and I</v>

841
00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 7>know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there are some of those that I can</v>

842
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 7>put in order today with a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 7>work so that when I wake up tomorrow,</v>

843
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 7>the domain of my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is basically being itself,</v>

844
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 7>that the main,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my experience will be more pristine and</v>

845
00:44:30.381 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 7>better put together than it is today.</v>

846
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 7>And you asked yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you will find that right away.</v>

847
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 7>You know what they are finding things</v>
<v Speaker 7>that come up,</v>

848
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.051
<v Speaker 7>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bang,</v>

849
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.561
<v Speaker 7>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bang,</v>

850
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 7>and they'll all be things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 7>very heroic.</v>

851
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 7>They're kind of trivial and that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>knew the voiding you've been avoiding</v>

852
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those are little dragons of chaos.</v>

853
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:47.540
<v Speaker 7>They space and you know they're just</v>
<v Speaker 7>little.</v>

854
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 7>That's good because you're not much of a</v>
<v Speaker 7>hero warrior.</v>

855
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 7>And so maybe a little tiny dragons are</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the ones that you've been put up.</v>

856
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you sort those things out and they will.</v>

857
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they will order.</v>

858
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.720
<v Speaker 7>You're in an order that being around you</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a more pristine and productive way.</v>

859
00:45:03.311 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Speaker 7>I think you just a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 7>focused in together.</v>

860
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 7>And what that'll mean is that the next</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing you can do is ask yourself the</v>

861
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:12.840
<v Speaker 7>same question and the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>problems that will emerge will be</v>

862
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 7>slightly larger and more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you can try to put those in</v>

863
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 7>order and that will make everything</v>
<v Speaker 7>around you more pristine and benefit</v>

864
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 7>together and it'll make you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 7>stronger and more clear habit.</v>

865
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.990
<v Speaker 7>And then another set of problems will</v>
<v Speaker 7>emerge that's a little bit larger.</v>

866
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.700
<v Speaker 7>If you continue to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know you'll sort yourself out,</v>

867
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 7>you clean up your room and you put your</v>
<v Speaker 7>house in order and then you could start</v>

868
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 7>to work in the community and by that</v>
<v Speaker 7>time you'll actually have some power and</v>

869
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:43.010
<v Speaker 7>some and some self confidence and some</v>
<v Speaker 7>competence and some cream cheese and</v>

870
00:45:43.011 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 7>you'll be much more,</v>
<v Speaker 7>much less likely to stupidly hit</v>

871
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 7>something complicated with a stick and</v>
<v Speaker 7>say that you fixed it,</v>

872
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.870
<v Speaker 7>but you have to start low.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to be Carl Jung said,</v>

873
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 7>very an interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting phrases.</v>

874
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 7>He says that the reason that monitor</v>
<v Speaker 7>people can't see this because they won't</v>

875
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 7>look low enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really liked that.</v>

876
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's an extraordinarily wise person.</v>

877
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 7>What he meant by that was something like</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I'm telling you is that the secret</v>

878
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 7>to your existence is right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 7>you and it manifests itself as all those</v>

879
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 7>things you know you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're avoiding because one of the</v>

880
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:16.460
<v Speaker 7>things you might ask yourself as a</v>
<v Speaker 7>curse,</v>

881
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 7>you're useless and weak and miserable</v>
<v Speaker 7>and cruel than all of those horrible</v>

882
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but partly that's because you're also</v>

883
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:23.690
<v Speaker 7>not what you could be in.</v>

884
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 7>Part of the reason for that is that what</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know you shouldn't be doing.</v>

885
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.300
<v Speaker 7>So you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because this is a very interesting game.</v>

886
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 7>If you started doing the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>know you should do,</v>

887
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.510
<v Speaker 7>this is a discussion with your own</v>
<v Speaker 7>conscious.</v>

888
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 7>If you started doing those things that</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know you should do and you did that</v>

889
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 7>diligently,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what beheld would you be like in 10</v>

890
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 7>years?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now?</v>

891
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:48.570
<v Speaker 7>That's an exciting game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's an interesting game and if you</v>

892
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 7>play that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we will find that you're hell a lot more</v>

893
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:53.490
<v Speaker 7>than you were and that's something at</v>
<v Speaker 7>least you might not hit the pinnacles</v>

894
00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.440
<v Speaker 7>that you're going to be a lot more than</v>
<v Speaker 7>you are,</v>

895
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.920
<v Speaker 7>and then if you're not and miserable or</v>
<v Speaker 7>direction in sovereign digital,</v>

896
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 7>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pitying and all those things,</v>

897
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:05.210
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be a lot less resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're going to be a lot less broom.</v>

898
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 7>You're going to be a lot less cruel to</v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself and to other people.</v>

899
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a pretty good start.</v>

900
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even if you're not a positive force for</v>

901
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 7>good in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you just were wretched horrible,</v>

902
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 7>that would be a good additional</v>
<v Speaker 7>contribution.</v>

903
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

904
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 7>I would say too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a corridor that goes along with</v>

905
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:26.850
<v Speaker 7>that</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>

906
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 7>and this is so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you could look at it this way.</v>

907
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 7>This is something that I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 7>explain.</v>

908
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:39.271
<v Speaker 7>I didn't video on a couple of videos</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I've been fascinated by because</v>

909
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:45.031
<v Speaker 7>it's a very good relation and cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How architects manifest themselves and</v>

910
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 7>how people understand the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even if they don't know,</v>

911
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 7>they understand them because it gives a</v>
<v Speaker 7>very interesting movie and think about</v>

912
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:53.570
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't you?</v>

913
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.880
<v Speaker 7>You might ask.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

914
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 7>with modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>think about people going to church.</v>

915
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:01.700
<v Speaker 7>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how can people believe those foolish,</v>

916
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 7>those superstitions.</v>

917
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.260
<v Speaker 7>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

918
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 7>what the hell do you think you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you were moving?</v>

919
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 7>What are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here you are.</v>

920
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 7>You're family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You probably haven't seen Nokia lately,</v>

921
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.710
<v Speaker 7>but whatever</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're an adult,</v>

922
00:48:15.711 --> 00:48:18.980
<v Speaker 7>you bring your five year old to seem to</v>
<v Speaker 7>know you're just as interest as he is</v>

923
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 7>and think about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

924
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 7>you know those are drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not real creatures.</v>

925
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.980
<v Speaker 7>There draws second pot wouldn't pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who actually happens to wander around</v>

926
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 7>who is being guided to life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Quite cricket was highest goal is to for</v>

927
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 7>recent snow onto and understand and</v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow that makes a fairy tournament to</v>

928
00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.030
<v Speaker 7>something that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like that's strange people.</v>

929
00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.920
<v Speaker 7>The fact that you're doing that is very</v>
<v Speaker 7>peculiar and it says something about</v>

930
00:48:47.921 --> 00:48:51.360
<v Speaker 7>what people are like means that we</v>
<v Speaker 7>understand the things that we don't</v>

931
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:54.740
<v Speaker 7>normally understand and so it's.</v>

932
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.610
<v Speaker 7>It's a very interesting movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can tell you what it's fundamental</v>

933
00:48:57.611 --> 00:48:59.740
<v Speaker 7>presupposition is I'll just guide you</v>
<v Speaker 7>through it very,</v>

934
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 7>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the beginning of the movie,</v>

935
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.910
<v Speaker 7>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's,</v>

936
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.500
<v Speaker 7>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

937
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 7>the archetype of the good father,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

938
00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 7>which is an archetype that we forgot</v>
<v Speaker 7>about us because our culture isn't just</v>

939
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:15.460
<v Speaker 7>a tyrannical patriarchy as you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the fact that farm and comfortable</v>

940
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 7>and we're not tearing each other to</v>
<v Speaker 7>shreds at the moment,</v>

941
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 7>which is what you do in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolute chaos,</v>

942
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:21.770
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's made him on.</v>

943
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 7>You're freezing and starving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

944
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 7>And that is what one have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have a piece and it's rare and it's</v>

945
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:33.460
<v Speaker 7>amazing that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we shouldn't take it for granted because</v>

946
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 7>it's not the normal order of things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The normal order of things is</v>

947
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:40.600
<v Speaker 7>destructive chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you're fortunate enough to live</v>

948
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:42.100
<v Speaker 7>somewhere that's peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>productive,</v>

949
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.130
<v Speaker 7>you should thank your lucky stars every</v>
<v Speaker 7>second of your life.</v>

950
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.470
<v Speaker 7>And if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that means is that you don't know</v>

951
00:49:47.471 --> 00:49:51.370
<v Speaker 7>anything about history and you know</v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing about human beings because</v>

952
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:53.010
<v Speaker 7>things can get out smoothly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>monster.</v>

953
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 7>And it happens all the time and there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>always a fraction of the population who</v>

954
00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.000
<v Speaker 7>thinks that's how they like things to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>and perhaps there's a fraction of you</v>

955
00:50:00.001 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 7>have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like that too.</v>

956
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.830
<v Speaker 7>And I wouldn't nurture that fragment</v>
<v Speaker 7>pharmacy you unless you want to go.</v>

957
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.240
<v Speaker 7>We're equal taking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyways,</v>

958
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.133
<v Speaker 7>back to</v>

959
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:17.490
<v Speaker 6>thank you,</v>

960
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.400
<v Speaker 7>and then you can tell that he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 7>warm house and it's full of toys and</v>

961
00:50:23.401 --> 00:50:27.020
<v Speaker 7>it's full of music boxes and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>goldfish.</v>

962
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.130
<v Speaker 7>He takes care of them and so it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>

963
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:34.140
<v Speaker 7>It makes this pop and then he puts us on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the puppet and that's the final act and</v>

964
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 7>the public can have its capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 7>speak.</v>

965
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.650
<v Speaker 7>And that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're a good father because you want</v>

966
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:44.651
<v Speaker 7>to take your son and turn them into</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone who can speak right,</v>

967
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.390
<v Speaker 7>who can speak his soul and soldier</v>
<v Speaker 7>battle,</v>

968
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 7>puts a smile on his son space and says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be</v>

969
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 7>a good boy sweater?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

970
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't it be wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

971
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.170
<v Speaker 7>Because that's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're a good father.</v>

972
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 7>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't it be possible that this puppet</v>

973
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 7>could actually become something genuine</v>
<v Speaker 7>and independent with its own voice?</v>

974
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 7>While he says that sounds likely it goes</v>
<v Speaker 7>off to bed and then the star appears up</v>

975
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:14.110
<v Speaker 7>in the window and the wishes on the scar</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you think,</v>

976
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.780
<v Speaker 7>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What does it mean to wish on a star?</v>

977
00:51:16.781 --> 00:51:17.200
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

978
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 7>the star is that light that gets into</v>
<v Speaker 7>the darkness,</v>

979
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:21.250
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's something transcendent.</v>

980
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.340
<v Speaker 7>You go show up into the night sky and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>

981
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.090
<v Speaker 7>It's odd inspiring whether you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>religious or not.</v>

982
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.180
<v Speaker 7>You're looking into the incident while</v>
<v Speaker 7>you make a relationship with the</v>

983
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 7>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 7>By wishing on a star,</v>

984
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:35.711
<v Speaker 7>you raise your eyes above the horizon</v>
<v Speaker 7>and point at the light that shines in</v>

985
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Speaker 7>the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you say,</v>

986
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 7>I wish more than anything else that my</v>
<v Speaker 7>son can become a real person.</v>

987
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 7>So that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're a good for the water may come</v>

988
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:49.060
<v Speaker 7>into a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to be a tyrant.</v>

989
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 7>You don't want them to be a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You want them to be something as strong</v>

990
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:53.920
<v Speaker 7>and independent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Also,</v>

991
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 7>Pinocchio goes out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He faces all these different moral</v>

992
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:00.320
<v Speaker 7>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's armed with his conscience.</v>

993
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:02.700
<v Speaker 7>It turns up to the other bug,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

994
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.950
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why?</v>

995
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's because things bug you.</v>

996
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 7>You know you're conscious bugs you and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason that the conscience is</v>

997
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:15.460
<v Speaker 7>jimminy cricket is because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 7>same initials as Jesus Christ and</v>

998
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 7>Jimminy cricket is southern US slime for</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ and no doubt the other</v>

999
00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:22.550
<v Speaker 7>mangers thought that was very comical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not telling you that that is a very</v>

1000
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:24.930
<v Speaker 7>strange representation of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's for sure.</v>

1001
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:28.560
<v Speaker 7>It would make it into a cricketer and he</v>
<v Speaker 7>is also rather error prone in the movie</v>

1002
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 7>because the movie doesn't have besides</v>
<v Speaker 7>the affordable Christian structure.</v>

1003
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 7>But part of the reason this took me a</v>
<v Speaker 7>long time to figure out too is that you</v>

1004
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 7>have to have a dialogue with your</v>
<v Speaker 7>conscience,</v>

1005
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 7>but it has to be a dog because it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>actually not 100 percent right.</v>

1006
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.460
<v Speaker 7>It has to be something that you build by</v>
<v Speaker 7>having a discussion with it across time.</v>

1007
00:52:46.461 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 7>And that's actually where Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 7>junior cricket,</v>

1008
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 7>as the movie progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>both the puppet and the conscience get</v>

1009
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.520
<v Speaker 7>wiser by begging themselves against the</v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

1010
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.430
<v Speaker 7>And the pop and house to resist the</v>
<v Speaker 7>temptation of Isi,</v>

1011
00:52:59.431 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 7>fame and celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the first temptation,</v>

1012
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.830
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because he's asked to be an actor,</v>

1013
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.610
<v Speaker 7>which is an easy way to be celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the Kardashians,</v>

1014
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's it's status without responsibility</v>

1015
00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:14.561
<v Speaker 7>or or competence and so that that exists</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the traffic and then he's,</v>

1016
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:18.380
<v Speaker 7>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He learns that lying is a very bad idea,</v>

1017
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what he's knows.</v>

1018
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 7>Grocery has to get that sort of know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he said he's asked to present</v>

1019
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 7>himself as a victim of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what the Fox and the coyotes and</v>

1020
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.160
<v Speaker 7>when he decides that he's too ill to go</v>
<v Speaker 7>back to school,</v>

1021
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 7>they take them to pleasure.</v>

1022
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:37.260
<v Speaker 7>It varies trained to be a jackass that</v>
<v Speaker 7>works for slavers into soul lines.</v>

1023
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.610
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not Bad for animation,</v>

1024
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:42.800
<v Speaker 7>I could say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then at the end of it,</v>

1025
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 7>the leaky tries to go back home because</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's terribly lost in these half.</v>

1026
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:49.130
<v Speaker 7>Jack asked because the people that</v>
<v Speaker 7>pleasure island have told him,</v>

1027
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.330
<v Speaker 7>taught him to do nothing but break,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I can't help it</v>

1028
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.330
<v Speaker 7>offers or what would you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would you say is,</v>

1029
00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 7>is an appalling parallel to what's</v>
<v Speaker 7>happening to educate people who are</v>

1030
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 7>being educated in modern universities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which are increasingly play houses where</v>

1031
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:07.880
<v Speaker 7>you're taught to break in the listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't listen to the protesters.</v>

1032
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.240
<v Speaker 7>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it just.</v>

1033
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:14.270
<v Speaker 7>It's just painful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's this constant repetition of a soul.</v>

1034
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.730
<v Speaker 7>Nonsense thank loudly chanted is because</v>
<v Speaker 7>the protesters,</v>

1035
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to convince themselves</v>
<v Speaker 7>even more desperately than they're</v>

1036
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 7>trying to convince them.</v>

1037
00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.130
<v Speaker 7>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pinocchio goes back home and half</v>

1038
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.330
<v Speaker 7>jackass in half again and trust to find</v>
<v Speaker 7>his father.</v>

1039
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 7>There's no going home right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Once you're an adult,</v>

1040
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 7>it's your young adult.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't get to go back because there</v>

1041
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:49.440
<v Speaker 7>isn't anyone there that can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 7>what to do anymore,</v>

1042
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 7>and so they go as far as fair and finds</v>
<v Speaker 7>out that he has to go to the bottom of</v>

1043
00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 7>chaos itself to rescue his father and</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what we have to do,</v>

1044
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.050
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because our civilization is in a state</v>

1045
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:04.210
<v Speaker 7>of crisis now is predicted long ago by</v>
<v Speaker 7>people like Dj.</v>

1046
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.520
<v Speaker 7>And partly what you're trying to do with</v>
<v Speaker 7>you go to university is to go to the</v>

1047
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:11.640
<v Speaker 7>heart of therapist right to the place</v>
<v Speaker 7>that terrifies you the most,</v>

1048
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 7>and to find your values,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your culture really has,</v>

1049
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.400
<v Speaker 7>and that's what it means to go down to</v>
<v Speaker 7>the bottom of the desk to the thing that</v>

1050
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 7>terrifies you the most integrative</v>
<v Speaker 7>before your father to very little story.</v>

1051
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 7>The Egyptians were telling that story</v>
<v Speaker 7>for a thousand years ago.</v>

1052
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:26.010
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the oldest stories of</v>
<v Speaker 7>mankind,</v>

1053
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.970
<v Speaker 7>and so that's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You and the United Yourself with your</v>

1054
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 7>culture so that you're more than just a</v>
<v Speaker 7>weakened symbol minded individual,</v>

1055
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.550
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You dedicate yourself to the study of</v>

1056
00:55:35.551 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 7>what's great about the past and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>incorporate it so that there can be</v>

1057
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 7>something to you and then you bring your</v>
<v Speaker 7>father back up to the surface so that</v>

1058
00:55:42.481 --> 00:55:45.900
<v Speaker 7>the culture can see and live in yet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then that makes you into a real</v>

1059
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 7>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1060
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 7>that's the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1061
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:55.140
<v Speaker 7>we watch it were captivated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now it's time to understand.</v>

1062
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:59.760
<v Speaker 7>It takes time to understand that in an</v>
<v Speaker 7>articulated and conscious map because</v>

1063
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 7>it's too late for us to be unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>

1064
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 7>And so we have stella and shrimp,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1065
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 7>we have the chaos of the left and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>left says,</v>

1066
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:10.940
<v Speaker 7>well we need to tear down structures</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they own press.</v>

1067
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Speaker 7>So like obviously instructors who</v>
<v Speaker 7>oppressed because something's good at</v>

1068
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 7>the top of the structure and also good</v>
<v Speaker 7>at the bottom.</v>

1069
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.990
<v Speaker 7>So if you have any values dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's going to privilege some things and</v>

1070
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 7>exclude others,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if you scrap structures and there's</v>

1071
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 7>nothing to live for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we can't do that.</v>

1072
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:30.220
<v Speaker 7>That's just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then the radical right says back to</v>

1073
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 7>the nation and it's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1074
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 7>we went back to the nation a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 7>times so it doesn't really look that</v>

1075
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:39.600
<v Speaker 7>great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And part of the reason for that is that</v>

1076
00:56:39.601 --> 00:56:41.720
<v Speaker 7>the purpose of the nation isn't the</v>
<v Speaker 7>nation.</v>

1077
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:47.080
<v Speaker 7>The purpose of the nation is to produce</v>
<v Speaker 7>citizens who transcend Emma juvenate,</v>

1078
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.710
<v Speaker 7>the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so the nation should be probably</v>

1079
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 7>properly subordinated to the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right to the divine individually for</v>

1080
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 7>that map.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what we figured out in the</v>

1081
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:56.970
<v Speaker 7>West.</v>

1082
00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 7>Now it is that we only figured that out</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the west,</v>

1083
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:04.300
<v Speaker 7>but so far we've been fortunate enough</v>
<v Speaker 7>to put it into a reasonable practice in</v>

1084
00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 7>our political institutions and thank God</v>
<v Speaker 7>for that.</v>

1085
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 7>At least it's worked somewhere and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 7>be completely foolish to give that up</v>

1086
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 7>because look at what it's provided us</v>
<v Speaker 7>with.</v>

1087
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 7>Its remarkable for free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as free as we can,</v>

1088
00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that we're happy</v>
<v Speaker 7>because freedom and happiness are not</v>

1089
00:57:20.681 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 7>the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But we did figure out what the state</v>

1090
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 7>should be subordinate to the wisdom of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the individual,</v>

1091
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:29.740
<v Speaker 7>to the site and the wisdom of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>individual that puts a heavy</v>

1092
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:32.150
<v Speaker 7>responsibility on everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That mean to you have to be the</v>

1093
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 7>individual who can see at speed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's your job.</v>

1094
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 7>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the thing that's so cool about that is</v>

1095
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 7>you know you need a meaning in your life</v>
<v Speaker 7>that enables you to bear the suffering</v>

1096
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:46.180
<v Speaker 7>of their life without becoming</v>
<v Speaker 7>corrupted.</v>

1097
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 7>That's the basic rule and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>build yourself into something that you</v>

1098
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:56.371
<v Speaker 7>can actually respect so that you can see</v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself bearing not terrible</v>

1099
00:57:56.621 --> 00:58:00.700
<v Speaker 7>existential burger properly and then you</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't lose hope and you don't use</v>

1100
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 7>meaning because you can see that you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>strong enough to stand up underneath</v>

1101
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:07.830
<v Speaker 7>that Burger and then there's something</v>
<v Speaker 7>about you that you can respect and then</v>

1102
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:11.950
<v Speaker 7>maybe other people can respect that will</v>
<v Speaker 7>help bring suffering in the world to an</v>

1103
00:58:11.951 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 7>end and that will help people develop</v>
<v Speaker 7>fully as individuals and that will</v>

1104
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:19.830
<v Speaker 7>enable us to avoid the dehumanizing</v>
<v Speaker 7>rigid.</v>

1105
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:25.550
<v Speaker 7>A I'll uniformity of the nationalistic</v>
<v Speaker 7>lack and appalling devouring chaos of</v>

1106
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Speaker 7>the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How about no</v>

1107
00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.220
<v Speaker 8>the individual</v>

1108
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:39.240
<v Speaker 7>that's the secret to the world and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're all individuals.</v>

1109
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 7>You're all the secret to the world and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then all you have to do</v>

1110
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:51.200
<v Speaker 7>to discover that is picked up</v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility.</v>

1111
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:55.050
<v Speaker 7>Stop listening to people who keep</v>
<v Speaker 7>burdening you with rights.</v>

1112
00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:00.080
<v Speaker 7>How many Goddamn rights deal?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why you need some responsibility?</v>

1113
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.170
<v Speaker 7>So pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>open your eyes and learn how to make</v>

1114
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:07.850
<v Speaker 7>yourself articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that made the world one sentence of</v>

1115
00:59:07.851 --> 00:59:11.850
<v Speaker 7>a series of health than it already</v>
<v Speaker 7>descended into the 20th century.</v>

1116
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.400
<v Speaker 9>You've think detailed what you think</v>
<v Speaker 9>students shouldn't do in these examples</v>

1117
00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:23.360
<v Speaker 9>of like protests and these examples of</v>
<v Speaker 9>certain types of activist tactics.</v>

1118
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 9>What advice would you have for students?</v>
<v Speaker 9>How can students make the changes that</v>

1119
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 9>they want to make?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Particularly?</v>

1120
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 9>Do you have any advice for students</v>
<v Speaker 9>here?</v>

1121
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.420
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Read great books.</v>

1122
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 9>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

1123
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:38.810
<v Speaker 9>you've got this four year period that</v>
<v Speaker 9>has been carved out of your lives by</v>

1124
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 9>society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They given you an identity,</v>

1125
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 9>like a high quality identity and freedom</v>
<v Speaker 9>at the same time and you're not going to</v>

1126
00:59:45.501 --> 00:59:47.570
<v Speaker 9>get that again in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You've got a.</v>

1127
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.310
<v Speaker 9>you've got a respectable identity,</v>
<v Speaker 9>university student and complete freedom</v>

1128
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 9>associated with that or as near as</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're ever going to get and you've got</v>

1129
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 9>these unbelievable libraries that are</v>
<v Speaker 9>full of the writings of people who are,</v>

1130
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 9>who are intelligent and articulate</v>
<v Speaker 9>beyond comprehension and you know,</v>

1131
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 9>and and you can go there and you can</v>
<v Speaker 9>learn all this and you might think,</v>

1132
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why should you learn it while you learn</v>

1133
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 9>it to get a job?</v>

1134
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 9>Or you learn it to get good grades or</v>
<v Speaker 9>you learn it to get a degree and that's</v>

1135
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 9>all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's nonsense.</v>

1136
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.290
<v Speaker 9>The reason that you come to university</v>
<v Speaker 9>to be educated is because there is</v>

1137
01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 9>nothing more powerful than someone who</v>
<v Speaker 9>is articulate and who can think and</v>

1138
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Speaker 9>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's power and power of the best,</v>

1139
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 9>sort of its authority and influence and</v>
<v Speaker 9>respectability and competence.</v>

1140
01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 9>And so you come to university to craft</v>
<v Speaker 9>your highest skill and your highest</v>

1141
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:35.450
<v Speaker 9>skill is to be found in articulated</v>
<v Speaker 9>speech.</v>

1142
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 9>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you're,</v>

1143
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 9>if you're a master at formulating your</v>
<v Speaker 9>arguments,</v>

1144
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.420
<v Speaker 9>you win everything and better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you win everything,</v>

1145
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.560
<v Speaker 9>everyone around you wins too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because to transform yourself into,</v>

1146
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:51.500
<v Speaker 9>let's consider,</v>
<v Speaker 9>consider your transformation into</v>

1147
01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 9>something approximating the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It means you shine a light on the whole</v>

1148
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:56.780
<v Speaker 9>world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1149
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:58.550
<v Speaker 9>there's nothing more exciting to do than</v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

1150
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 9>There's nothing better you can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 9>do.</v>

1151
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 9>And to think that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 9>university to be trained to have a job,</v>

1152
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:06.080
<v Speaker 9>it's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's a hell of a lot better than being</v>

1153
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 9>unemployed and covered with cheeto dust</v>
<v Speaker 9>while you're snacking away in front of</v>

1154
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 9>your video game in the basement,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's not.</v>

1155
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 9>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I don't have anything against video</v>

1156
01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:20.261
<v Speaker 9>games by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's hardly a triumphant call to,</v>

1157
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:24.620
<v Speaker 9>to being in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's what universities should be</v>

1158
01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:26.420
<v Speaker 9>calling forth.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like God,</v>

1159
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:28.010
<v Speaker 9>you people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you as you know I,</v>

1160
01:01:28.011 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 9>I know what Harvard students are like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I taught here for five years.</v>

1161
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 9>You people are spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're spectacular.</v>

1162
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:34.341
<v Speaker 9>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

1163
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.620
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're all capable of being world</v>

1164
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 9>beaters.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You transform yourself into something</v>

1165
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 9>that's articulated and sensible and</v>
<v Speaker 9>grounded in history and knowledgeable</v>

1166
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:45.590
<v Speaker 9>and wise man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can do anything you want and</v>

1167
01:01:45.591 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 9>hopefully anything you want for good</v>
<v Speaker 9>because if you have any sense,</v>

1168
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 9>everything you want to do would be for</v>
<v Speaker 9>the good because there's nothing more</v>

1169
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.340
<v Speaker 9>compelling or meaningful or or useful in</v>
<v Speaker 9>combating the tragedy of life than to</v>

1170
01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:02.980
<v Speaker 9>than to struggle with all your soul on</v>
<v Speaker 9>behalf of the good and the university</v>

1171
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:04.300
<v Speaker 9>hasn't forgotten that.</v>

1172
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 9>It's why everyone's bailing out of the</v>
<v Speaker 9>humanities and they should.</v>

1173
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:11.170
<v Speaker 9>The humanities are corrupt and they're</v>
<v Speaker 9>corrupt because they're not telling the</v>

1174
01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 9>students this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's so bloody obvious.</v>

1175
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.000
<v Speaker 9>So like learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>learn to speak,</v>

1176
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.590
<v Speaker 9>let to read.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes you a super power and the</v>

1177
01:02:20.591 --> 01:02:25.591
<v Speaker 9>individual superpower you have it under.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't understand why that isn't just</v>

1178
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 9>told to students.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not that hard to understand and</v>

1179
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 9>everyone wants to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

1180
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:32.390
<v Speaker 9>really?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I could do that.</v>

1181
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 9>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

1182
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>really you could do that,</v>

1183
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 9>and the whole society around you is</v>
<v Speaker 9>labored for really thousands of years to</v>

1184
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 9>provide every single one of you with</v>
<v Speaker 9>this spectacular opportunity that you</v>

1185
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:46.880
<v Speaker 9>have while your undergraduates and</v>
<v Speaker 9>graduate students here.</v>

1186
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:47.731
<v Speaker 9>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're just.</v>

1187
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 9>Everyone's just praying that you would</v>
<v Speaker 9>come here and manifest everything that</v>

1188
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 9>you could manifest and that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 9>should be doing.</v>

1189
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 9>Instead of waving placards and</v>
<v Speaker 9>complaining about how you're oppressed</v>

1190
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 9>for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you see these Yale students complaining</v>

1191
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 9>about their oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's just,</v>

1192
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 9>it just leaves me aghast and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1193
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 9>we're against the ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

1194
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:10.231
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>

1195
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Your baby ruling class members.</v>

1196
01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:13.943
<v Speaker 9>You're young.</v>

1197
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

1198
01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.780
<v Speaker 9>The only reason you're not rich just</v>
<v Speaker 9>because you're young,</v>

1199
01:03:23.781 --> 01:03:25.630
<v Speaker 9>you know that's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really.</v>

1200
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.680
<v Speaker 9>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you look at the one percent,</v>

1201
01:03:27.681 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 9>even the dreaded one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1202
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.660
<v Speaker 9>most of those people are old.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why?</v>

1203
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.610
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you progress through life,</v>

1204
01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:38.630
<v Speaker 9>if you're reasonably successful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you trade in your promising youth for</v>

1205
01:03:38.631 --> 01:03:41.780
<v Speaker 9>your wealthy old age,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you're still bloody old.</v>

1206
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.170
<v Speaker 9>Were you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you trade it,</v>

1207
01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.720
<v Speaker 9>would you trade your youth for that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like if you factor age out of the</v>

1208
01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:49.670
<v Speaker 9>economic equation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>things look a lot different.</v>

1209
01:03:49.671 --> 01:03:51.530
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of course older people have more money.</v>

1210
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:54.350
<v Speaker 9>If they have any sense they'd been</v>
<v Speaker 9>collecting it for their whole life.</v>

1211
01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:57.620
<v Speaker 9>Is that somehow unfair?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not unfair unless you want to want</v>

1212
01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:01.220
<v Speaker 9>to be poverty stricken when you're 70</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you and you don't want to be</v>

1213
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:03.800
<v Speaker 9>poverished strict poverty stricken when</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're 70.</v>

1214
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.330
<v Speaker 9>So I just don't understand what's</v>
<v Speaker 9>happened to the universities.</v>

1215
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.840
<v Speaker 9>I can't believe that you're not told</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you come the first day,</v>

1216
01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:12.674
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

1217
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:15.080
<v Speaker 9>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're here on a heroic mission.</v>

1218
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.770
<v Speaker 9>You're going to take your capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 9>articulate yourself to levels that are</v>

1219
01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:22.190
<v Speaker 9>undreamed of you're going to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 9>here unstoppable.</v>

1220
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.020
<v Speaker 9>You're going to be able to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 9>you want.</v>

1221
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.090
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's what you're here for.</v>

1222
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.650
<v Speaker 9>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're taught that,</v>

1223
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.630
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know the world's a pretty oppressive</v>

1224
01:04:29.631 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 9>place and you're probably the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 9>the victim pile.</v>

1225
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:32.631
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

1226
01:04:32.631 --> 01:04:33.620
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and there's,</v>

1227
01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.600
<v Speaker 9>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's virtually nothing you can do</v>

1228
01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:36.650
<v Speaker 9>about it except,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1229
01:04:36.651 --> 01:04:41.330
<v Speaker 9>deconstruct the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it's so neat and so pathetic that</v>

1230
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.570
<v Speaker 9>the university should be embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 9>that that's what they're peddling to</v>

1231
01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:46.790
<v Speaker 9>students.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm embarrassed by it.</v>

1232
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.601
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've,</v>

1233
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:50.240
<v Speaker 9>I've gone on public record telling</v>
<v Speaker 9>parents what do you well,</v>

1234
01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:54.110
<v Speaker 9>send your boys to trade school because</v>
<v Speaker 9>at least they'll learn something useful</v>

1235
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.130
<v Speaker 9>and that's a terrible thing for someone</v>
<v Speaker 9>like me to say because I do believe that</v>

1236
01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 9>the are being articulated and educated</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the highest possible manner is</v>

1237
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:06.380
<v Speaker 9>there's nothing that's better for you</v>
<v Speaker 9>and for society.</v>

1238
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.470
<v Speaker 9>And why or why have the university's</v>
<v Speaker 9>forgotten this?</v>

1239
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.120
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.</v>

1240
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.630
<v Speaker 9>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then the philosophy of intense</v>

1241
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 9>resentment and oppression and group</v>
<v Speaker 9>identity and god,</v>

1242
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.070
<v Speaker 9>it's just pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Dr Susan.</v>

1243
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 9>I think a lot of students here would</v>
<v Speaker 9>agree with you that one of the main</v>

1244
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:28.120
<v Speaker 9>purposes of education and college,</v>
<v Speaker 9>particularly at Harvard,</v>

1245
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 9>is to develop their sense of</v>
<v Speaker 9>articulation,</v>

1246
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 9>their ability to read,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their ability to create a critically</v>

1247
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 9>think.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But then what comes after,</v>

1248
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 9>particularly at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a big discussion on what is a</v>

1249
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 9>good life,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what does it mean to use those skills</v>

1250
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 9>that we get here?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then we graduate.</v>

1251
01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.020
<v Speaker 9>What do we do from there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I stopped unnecessary suffering.</v>

1252
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 9>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know that that's your calling.</v>

1253
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:54.971
<v Speaker 9>It's like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1254
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:56.520
<v Speaker 9>what do you do after you graduate?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1255
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:59.830
<v Speaker 9>if you graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 9>articulated and powerful,</v>

1256
01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.860
<v Speaker 9>there will be people giving you so many</v>
<v Speaker 9>opportunities.</v>

1257
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 9>You won't even be able to keep up with</v>
<v Speaker 9>them.</v>

1258
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I've worked with very,</v>

1259
01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 9>very competent people in many different</v>
<v Speaker 9>domains in my life.</v>

1260
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 9>Hyper competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I can tell you some very interesting</v>

1261
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 9>things about hyper competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The first thing is they are not selfish</v>

1262
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.070
<v Speaker 9>and they're not greedy and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 9>great pleasures in their lives is to</v>

1263
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 9>find people who have the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 9>also be hyper competent and to open</v>

1264
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 9>doors for them as rapidly as they can</v>
<v Speaker 9>possibly be opened.</v>

1265
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.760
<v Speaker 9>They delight in that because there is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's nothing there.</v>

1266
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.610
<v Speaker 9>There's very few things that are more</v>
<v Speaker 9>intrinsically meaningful.</v>

1267
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.850
<v Speaker 9>If you're an accomplished person,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then to find young people who have the</v>

1268
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:38.770
<v Speaker 9>possibility of being accomplished and</v>
<v Speaker 9>say,</v>

1269
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.780
<v Speaker 9>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>here's an opportunity for you.</v>

1270
01:06:40.781 --> 01:06:41.531
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>go out there,</v>

1271
01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.364
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>
<v Speaker 9>kill it.</v>

1272
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:43.530
<v Speaker 9>And then they go out there and kill it.</v>

1273
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 9>You think right on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

1274
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 9>here's another opportunity to go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Go there near that to new think.</v>

1275
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>

1276
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 9>They're all hurting their wealth and</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're not going to share it with</v>

1277
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 9>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like that's absolute complete</v>

1278
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.960
<v Speaker 9>rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you don't even have to worry about</v>

1279
01:06:55.961 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 9>what you're going to do after you</v>
<v Speaker 9>graduate from here.</v>

1280
01:06:57.941 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 9>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you turn yourself into half of what</v>

1281
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:02.680
<v Speaker 9>you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because people will be dying to offer</v>

1282
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 9>you every opportunity that you can</v>
<v Speaker 9>possibly make use of.</v>

1283
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.100
<v Speaker 9>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

1284
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:08.720
<v Speaker 9>it's a moot point.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The,</v>

1285
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the world is always desperately short of</v>

1286
01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Speaker 9>people who can think and speak and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you think,</v>

1287
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:16.270
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I won't be made use of.</v>

1288
01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 9>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can't say that if you're at.</v>

1289
01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 9>If you're at Harvard for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean people already figured out who</v>

1290
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:24.220
<v Speaker 9>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They've already figured it out and</v>

1291
01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:26.950
<v Speaker 9>they're offering you the world on a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on a golden platter.</v>

1292
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 9>It take it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's yours.</v>

1293
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.220
<v Speaker 9>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So like,</v>

1294
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.160
<v Speaker 9>great man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Pull yourself together and deserve.</v>

1295
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.980
<v Speaker 9>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's what everyone wants.</v>

1296
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 9>It's what your parents want.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's also what you want.</v>

1297
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 9>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's what you want.</v>

1298
01:07:40.061 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 9>It's what men.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's what women want from men.</v>

1299
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:46.390
<v Speaker 9>It's what men want from women.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like for you to be who you could</v>

1300
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 9>be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then the highest faculty of the</v>

1301
01:07:49.181 --> 01:07:54.181
<v Speaker 9>human being is articulated speech.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the divine faculty and there is</v>

1302
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 9>nothing more powerful than that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There was nothing that's even in the</v>

1303
01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:00.190
<v Speaker 9>same league,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so if you.</v>

1304
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 9>If you don't have faith in that than</v>
<v Speaker 9>your,</v>

1305
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 9>then your priorities are misplaced and I</v>
<v Speaker 9>can't even understand why you wouldn't</v>

1306
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 9>have faith in that being,</v>
<v Speaker 9>say,</v>

1307
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 9>Harvard students because look where it's</v>
<v Speaker 9>got you already know you're already</v>

1308
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 9>sitting on top of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so make deserve it.</v>

1309
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.290
<v Speaker 9>Make use of it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1310
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 9>Go out there and fix things up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what you need to do.</v>

1311
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 9>There's lots of things that need to be</v>
<v Speaker 9>fixed up and what do you want to do is</v>

1312
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 9>burden yourself with so much</v>
<v Speaker 9>responsibility that you can barely stand</v>

1313
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 9>and then you'll get stronger trying to</v>
<v Speaker 9>lift it up and you'll be.</v>

1314
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 9>Won't be asking what should I be doing</v>
<v Speaker 9>with my life or what's the meaning of</v>

1315
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 9>life or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It will be self evident and self evident</v>

1316
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 9>at minimum you can say there's more</v>
<v Speaker 9>suffering in the world than there should</v>

1317
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:43.760
<v Speaker 9>be and I could probably do something</v>
<v Speaker 9>about that and you can do something</v>

1318
01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 9>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so go do something about it and then</v>

1319
01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 9>there'll be less suffering in the world</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then when you're 80 you can look</v>

1320
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 9>back on your life and say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1321
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:52.930
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's less suffering in the world than</v>

1322
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 9>there would have been had.</v>

1323
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 9>I know it existed and and you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 9>to even have a sense of,</v>

1324
01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 9>of ultimate destiny or even any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 9>theistic belief to regard that as a</v>

1325
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:06.610
<v Speaker 9>positive good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I think it goes beyond the mere</v>

1326
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 9>pragmatic utility of addressing the</v>
<v Speaker 9>world's ails because I think we do live</v>

1327
01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:11.294
<v Speaker 9>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in a,</v>

1328
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 9>in a world that has a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 9>reality as well as the reality that we</v>

1329
01:09:14.931 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 9>can detect,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but even independently of fat,</v>

1330
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 9>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like.</v>

1331
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is part of the reason I like people</v>

1332
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 9>like Bill Gates is a great example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

1333
01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 9>That guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's after five major diseases at the</v>

1334
01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:26.930
<v Speaker 9>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

1335
01:09:26.931 --> 01:09:29.420
<v Speaker 9>He's trying to wipe out polio.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's trying to wipe out</v>

1336
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 9>malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1337
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:34.310
<v Speaker 9>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's trying to wipe out malaria.</v>

1338
01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:35.330
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1339
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 9>what should you do with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1340
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>take a look at Bill Gates and see if you</v>

1341
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 9>could do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That would be good.</v>

1342
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 9>So.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So Dr Peterson,</v>

1343
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:49.040
<v Speaker 9>you talked about this idea of ending</v>
<v Speaker 9>unnecessary suffering and this idea of</v>

1344
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 9>committing one's life to that at a</v>
<v Speaker 9>minimum.</v>

1345
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 9>That's the minimum thing that you could</v>
<v Speaker 9>do.</v>

1346
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 9>A lot of students,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think accept that premise and view</v>

1347
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 9>what they're doing as trying to</v>
<v Speaker 9>eliminate or reduce unnecessary</v>

1348
01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:06.920
<v Speaker 9>suffering and they see activism or other</v>
<v Speaker 9>forms of direct service as fulfilling</v>

1349
01:10:06.921 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 9>that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you simply disagree with the content</v>

1350
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 9>of what they think the tactic that they</v>
<v Speaker 9>are using to end unnecessary suffering</v>

1351
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:19.220
<v Speaker 9>or do you think that their motives or</v>
<v Speaker 9>their intentions are not even the same</v>

1352
01:10:19.221 --> 01:10:20.054
<v Speaker 9>as yours?</v>

1353
01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.500
<v Speaker 9>Arts to public?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1354
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.380
<v Speaker 9>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's this,</v>

1355
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 9>there's this old saying from the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>from the new testament about not praying</v>

1356
01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 9>in public,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right,</v>

1357
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 9>and now idea is that if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 9>commune for the higher good,</v>

1358
01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 9>you should do it in private because</v>
<v Speaker 9>otherwise you're warping your ethic in</v>

1359
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:44.120
<v Speaker 9>some sense by demonstrating how virtuous</v>
<v Speaker 9>you virtuous you are to the world.</v>

1360
01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.250
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1361
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.770
<v Speaker 9>you go out there with a stick and a sign</v>
<v Speaker 9>on it that says I'm against poverty.</v>

1362
01:10:48.771 --> 01:10:49.490
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

1363
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 9>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's really like for poverty,</v>

1364
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 9>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so it's,</v>

1365
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.400
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

1366
01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 9>it's an abdication of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 9>with the mask of social virtue and you</v>

1367
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 9>want to solve difficult problems.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You've figured out how to get along with</v>

1368
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:05.690
<v Speaker 9>your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the one you've been fighting with for</v>

1369
01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 9>five years or see if you can staple your</v>
<v Speaker 9>family back together.</v>

1370
01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:11.720
<v Speaker 9>See if you can stop fighting with your</v>
<v Speaker 9>girlfriend and have a relationship that</v>

1371
01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 9>lasts for more than two weeks.</v>

1372
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.270
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like there are things that you</v>

1373
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.840
<v Speaker 9>should be doing in the confines of your</v>
<v Speaker 9>own life that are private and humble.</v>

1374
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:19.831
<v Speaker 9>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 9>would,</v>

1375
01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 9>that would constitute genuine</v>
<v Speaker 9>accomplishments.</v>

1376
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 9>And those are the things that you should</v>
<v Speaker 9>attend to and no one's going to come</v>

1377
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:25.380
<v Speaker 9>along and say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

1378
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>good job,</v>

1379
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're changing the world because it's</v>

1380
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 9>private,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's real and people don't do that.</v>

1381
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.204
<v Speaker 9>And so no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't,</v>

1382
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 9>I don't trust the activist.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't trust the activist ethos at all.</v>

1383
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 9>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think everything about it is,</v>

1384
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 9>is superficial and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and trendy and,</v>

1385
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 9>and too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

1386
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.730
<v Speaker 9>and the externalizes the blame,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the evil is always elsewhere,</v>

1387
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:57.570
<v Speaker 9>which is a dreadful mistake to make</v>
<v Speaker 9>because the evil isn't elsewhere.</v>

1388
01:11:57.571 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's the thing that you understand</v>

1389
01:11:59.701 --> 01:12:02.610
<v Speaker 9>when you're wise is the evil is not</v>
<v Speaker 9>elsewhere.</v>

1390
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:05.880
<v Speaker 9>It's you because you're not everything</v>
<v Speaker 9>you could be.</v>

1391
01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.081
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1392
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 9>you should work on that before going in</v>
<v Speaker 9>telling someone else that maybe they're</v>

1393
01:12:10.231 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 9>not who they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I think it's,</v>

1394
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.970
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I don't buy it.</v>

1395
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 9>It's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's far too easy and it's too public</v>

1396
01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.420
<v Speaker 9>and it's too self congratulatory.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then there's the murderous,</v>

1397
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:24.690
<v Speaker 9>like Marxist element,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which I'm always often inclined to</v>

1398
01:12:24.691 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 9>mention.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So certainly I think you've identified</v>

1399
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:33.321
<v Speaker 9>certain causes where the public element</v>
<v Speaker 9>or the self congratulatory time to do</v>

1400
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 9>good could be harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but do you think there are cases,</v>

1401
01:12:38.251 --> 01:12:40.620
<v Speaker 9>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm thinking of policy influencing</v>

1402
01:12:40.621 --> 01:12:44.340
<v Speaker 9>policy being a policymaker.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It seems like something like that public</v>

1403
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:49.341
<v Speaker 9>policy could be used to eliminate some</v>
<v Speaker 9>unnecessary suffering but would involve</v>

1404
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:53.610
<v Speaker 9>a more public domain,</v>
<v Speaker 9>something where you are trying to</v>

1405
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 9>attract followers,</v>
<v Speaker 9>trying to attract praise from other</v>

1406
01:12:56.851 --> 01:12:57.750
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Look,</v>

1407
01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.390
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you,</v>

1408
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:03.150
<v Speaker 9>if you've established yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 9>world as a credible human being and</v>

1409
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:08.130
<v Speaker 9>people are asking you to enter public</v>
<v Speaker 9>service because of your accomplishments,</v>

1410
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.290
<v Speaker 9>then it's time to do it right?</v>

1411
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.910
<v Speaker 9>But before that it's a little on the</v>
<v Speaker 9>premature side and if you're just</v>

1412
01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 9>setting your for self forward as an</v>
<v Speaker 9>Avatar of an idea of an ideology,</v>

1413
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.040
<v Speaker 9>then there's nothing to you except I</v>
<v Speaker 9>think of it as the chattering of various</v>

1414
01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:26.720
<v Speaker 9>forms of demons.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like you're not helpful and if you.</v>

1415
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.020
<v Speaker 9>If you look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you want to think,</v>

1416
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:29.580
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>are you fit to lead?</v>

1417
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:30.960
<v Speaker 9>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's put it that way.</v>

1418
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>First of all,</v>

1419
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 9>do you know where you're going?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because that's actually one of the</v>

1420
01:13:34.771 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 9>hallmarks of a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Leader knows where he's going and maybe</v>

1421
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 9>other people are also interested in</v>
<v Speaker 9>going that way,</v>

1422
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:43.500
<v Speaker 9>but the leaders I've met have carved</v>
<v Speaker 9>themselves out a personal vision,</v>

1423
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.753
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not some.</v>

1424
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 9>It's not some cookie cutter ideological</v>
<v Speaker 9>solution to the ills of the planet.</v>

1425
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.450
<v Speaker 9>They've done a detailed analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1426
01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:54.060
<v Speaker 9>They know what they're talking about and</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're usually people.</v>

1427
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 9>They've had a successful relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they've had a successful family,</v>

1428
01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:00.650
<v Speaker 9>they have a couple of degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They've established a business like</v>

1429
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 9>they've made themselves credible in five</v>
<v Speaker 9>or six dimensions.</v>

1430
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:07.380
<v Speaker 9>Well then maybe you know enough about</v>
<v Speaker 9>the world to dare to mess with its</v>

1431
01:14:07.381 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 9>internal mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and if you.</v>

1432
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:12.080
<v Speaker 9>If you don't have that kind of in depth,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then you should just.</v>

1433
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 9>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You should know more work on the</v>

1434
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 9>economic systems of Western</v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization.</v>

1435
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 9>Then you should try to adjust the</v>
<v Speaker 9>electronic systems of your automobile</v>

1436
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 9>because the latter is far less complex</v>
<v Speaker 9>than the former.</v>

1437
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 9>So of course there's utility in policy</v>
<v Speaker 9>formulation and in,</v>

1438
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 9>in government service and in all of</v>
<v Speaker 9>those sorts of things.</v>

1439
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.680
<v Speaker 9>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You have to have transformed yourself at</v>

1440
01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:38.140
<v Speaker 9>least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 9>into someone who's actually competent</v>

1441
01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.360
<v Speaker 9>before you should even dare to do such</v>
<v Speaker 9>things.</v>

1442
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.380
<v Speaker 9>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1443
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.200
<v Speaker 9>I have read some marks and now I know</v>
<v Speaker 9>how to change the world.</v>

1444
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:50.630
<v Speaker 9>That's a very bad idea because the</v>
<v Speaker 9>probability that you're going to take</v>

1445
01:14:50.631 --> 01:14:55.070
<v Speaker 9>something complex that doesn't work too</v>
<v Speaker 9>badly and fix it with your idiotic</v>

1446
01:14:55.071 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 9>intervention is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

1447
01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well put</v>

1448
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 10>the chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 10>and so,</v>

1449
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:18.290
<v Speaker 10>and that's very interesting observation</v>
<v Speaker 10>because since the chaos is virtually</v>

1450
01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:19.760
<v Speaker 10>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's a real questions.</v>

1451
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.750
<v Speaker 10>Where the hell do you put it while you</v>
<v Speaker 10>put it in what you ignore and you can</v>

1452
01:15:23.751 --> 01:15:27.230
<v Speaker 10>ignore it as long as it isn't actively</v>
<v Speaker 10>interfering with your movement forward,</v>

1453
01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:32.231
<v Speaker 10>you can assume that it's that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 10>matter that it doesn't matter that it</v>

1454
01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 10>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Same thing.</v>

1455
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:37.600
<v Speaker 10>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so here's the kicker.</v>

1456
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:42.601
<v Speaker 10>There's one more class of things that</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can run into along the way and this</v>

1457
01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:46.180
<v Speaker 10>is where the chaos breaks through.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So let's say</v>

1458
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 10>you're moving from point a to point b</v>
<v Speaker 10>and something that you don't expect</v>

1459
01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 10>occurs and it gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So let's say that you're living with</v>

1460
01:16:04.281 --> 01:16:07.610
<v Speaker 10>someone and maybe you kind of like them,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're not married so you don't like</v>

1461
01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:09.890
<v Speaker 10>them that much because otherwise you'd</v>
<v Speaker 10>ask them to marry you.</v>

1462
01:16:09.891 --> 01:16:12.000
<v Speaker 10>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1463
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:17.260
<v Speaker 10>and so had quarter view is looking for</v>
<v Speaker 10>something better in three quarters view</v>

1464
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.160
<v Speaker 10>is half satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 10>something like that.</v>

1465
01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.810
<v Speaker 10>And then a person because we're</v>
<v Speaker 10>ambivalent about such things.</v>

1466
01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:27.320
<v Speaker 10>And then the person you discover or the</v>
<v Speaker 10>person announces that they've been</v>

1467
01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:29.510
<v Speaker 10>having an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

1468
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.690
<v Speaker 10>So then how are you supposed to respond</v>
<v Speaker 10>emotionally to that?</v>

1469
01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.430
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the part of you that wasn't all that</v>

1470
01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:37.070
<v Speaker 10>committed to the relationship is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 10>exhilarated by that.</v>

1471
01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 10>And then the three quarters of you</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's half satisfied is hurt and,</v>

1472
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.390
<v Speaker 10>and you're going to exploit that part</v>
<v Speaker 10>for sure in the ensuing discussions and</v>

1473
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.680
<v Speaker 10>not mention the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

1474
01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:48.290
<v Speaker 10>that's kind of exciting that you've</v>
<v Speaker 10>betrayed me that way.</v>

1475
01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:50.450
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>

1476
01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.330
<v Speaker 10>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that you,</v>

1477
01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.230
<v Speaker 10>that's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now what's happened is a whole has you</v>

1478
01:16:57.231 --> 01:17:00.230
<v Speaker 10>have this structure that you're walking</v>
<v Speaker 10>on ice,</v>

1479
01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.190
<v Speaker 10>like the thin ice that you're skating on</v>
<v Speaker 10>and now there's a hole in it and the</v>

1480
01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:06.620
<v Speaker 10>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We don't even know how deep the hole is,</v>

1481
01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:09.140
<v Speaker 10>but you know there's a hole there and so</v>
<v Speaker 10>now you're anxious.</v>

1482
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 10>It.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

1483
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 10>they'll maybe also a little bit excited</v>
<v Speaker 10>because God only knows what's down</v>

1484
01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 10>there,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but but you don't know what to do with</v>

1485
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 10>that whole because it could spread very</v>
<v Speaker 10>badly on you.</v>

1486
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:24.131
<v Speaker 10>It could be that you know the whole</v>
<v Speaker 10>relationship was a facade and that all</v>

1487
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.780
<v Speaker 10>your relationships have been facades,</v>
<v Speaker 10>facades,</v>

1488
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 10>and that the reason that is is because</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're so damn shallow that it's</v>

1489
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 10>impossible for you to have a</v>
<v Speaker 10>relationship that isn't just a facade</v>

1490
01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:35.960
<v Speaker 10>and that's partly because you don't pay</v>
<v Speaker 10>any attention to other people.</v>

1491
01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 10>And it's also partly because you're</v>
<v Speaker 10>malevolent and selfish.</v>

1492
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.740
<v Speaker 10>So that's a nasty thing to discover.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Or maybe that's the sort of person that</v>

1493
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 10>you're attracting.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Which would make sense actually if</v>

1494
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:47.480
<v Speaker 10>that's the sort of person that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so.</v>

1495
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.160
<v Speaker 10>So there are certain things that you can</v>
<v Speaker 10>encounter that basically unglue you,</v>

1496
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:57.080
<v Speaker 10>and what happens is that those moments</v>
<v Speaker 10>of being unglued travel up that entire</v>

1497
01:17:57.081 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 10>hierarchy of presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like because the one of the logical</v>

1498
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:04.760
<v Speaker 10>conclusions to being betrayed in a</v>
<v Speaker 10>relationship is that you are,</v>

1499
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 10>that you're truly a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now another</v>

1500
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:13.730
<v Speaker 10>equally logical conclusion is that the</v>
<v Speaker 10>person that you're with is really a bad</v>

1501
01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:16.550
<v Speaker 10>person.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And another logical conclusion is all</v>

1502
01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 10>people are truly bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1503
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.290
<v Speaker 10>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>in,</v>

1504
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.320
<v Speaker 10>in macro ways that in microwaves you</v>
<v Speaker 10>can't trust anyone.</v>

1505
01:18:24.321 --> 01:18:26.030
<v Speaker 10>You can't trust women.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't trust men.</v>

1506
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 10>You can't trust human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can't trust yourself.</v>

1507
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 10>The whole place is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a nightmare.</v>

1508
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 10>Well then you can fall through into</v>
<v Speaker 10>chaos.</v>

1509
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:38.600
<v Speaker 10>Now the way your body responds to that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when something or maybe you know you're</v>

1510
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:40.280
<v Speaker 10>supposed to be getting a promotion at</v>
<v Speaker 10>work,</v>

1511
01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:42.590
<v Speaker 10>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You're all chipper about the promotion</v>

1512
01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:47.150
<v Speaker 10>at work and you walk into your boss's</v>
<v Speaker 10>office because he or she wants to see</v>

1513
01:18:47.151 --> 01:18:49.700
<v Speaker 10>you and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

1514
01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we've reviewed your performance over the</v>

1515
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:58.090
<v Speaker 10>last few years and your performance has</v>
<v Speaker 10>been somewhere between mediocre and</v>

1516
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:02.900
<v Speaker 10>decent and we're downsizing and see</v>
<v Speaker 10>later.</v>

1517
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 10>That's not a raise or a promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's for sure.</v>

1518
01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.930
<v Speaker 10>That's a whole that you fall into and</v>
<v Speaker 10>the question is,</v>

1519
01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what do you make of that?</v>

1520
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.560
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>How do you frame that?</v>

1521
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:19.390
<v Speaker 10>How do you take that emergent chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 10>make habitable order out of.</v>

1522
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:22.700
<v Speaker 10>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is the whole capitalist system rotten to</v>

1523
01:19:22.701 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 10>the core?</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

1524
01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 10>that's a convenient explanation under</v>
<v Speaker 10>those circumstances,</v>

1525
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:29.390
<v Speaker 10>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Where you're working for a psychopathic</v>

1526
01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 10>son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Did you make the wrong choice in</v>

1527
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 10>university and was that your father's</v>
<v Speaker 10>fault because you never did what you</v>

1528
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:39.530
<v Speaker 10>wanted or was it your fault for not</v>
<v Speaker 10>standing up to them or is it a dying</v>

1529
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Speaker 10>industry or is maybe this is a wake up</v>
<v Speaker 10>call that you should go do something</v>

1530
01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:45.940
<v Speaker 10>else that you've been waiting to.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you know that you've actually wanted</v>

1531
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 10>to do your whole life and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're doing such a miserable job at</v>

1532
01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:52.460
<v Speaker 10>your current occupation because you're</v>
<v Speaker 10>bitter and resentful about the fact that</v>

1533
01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:53.600
<v Speaker 10>you never did what you want.</v>

1534
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:57.230
<v Speaker 10>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's all of those things at once and</v>

1535
01:19:57.231 --> 01:20:01.160
<v Speaker 10>that's very stressful because all of</v>
<v Speaker 10>those things at once is too many things</v>

1536
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 10>and that's the reemergence of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's the flood.</v>

1537
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 10>That's the return to the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 10>the cosmos.</v>

1538
01:20:08.641 --> 01:20:10.320
<v Speaker 10>That's another way that it's been</v>
<v Speaker 10>represented.</v>

1539
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 10>Mythologically stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You voyage all the way back to the</v>

1540
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:17.940
<v Speaker 10>beginning of the cosmos when there's</v>
<v Speaker 10>nothing but undifferentiated chaos and</v>

1541
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:21.900
<v Speaker 10>that's what you're confronting and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's too much for you and often it is.</v>

1542
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 10>I mean that that can really.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That can be traumatizing.</v>

1543
01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.170
<v Speaker 10>It can hurt your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1544
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.870
<v Speaker 10>it's just too much for you to bear,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1545
01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:33.600
<v Speaker 10>You're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so how do you respond to that?</v>

1546
01:20:33.601 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some of it is catastrophic,</v>

1547
01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 10>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You freeze and that's protective and</v>

1548
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 10>maybe you don't even want to move.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You don't want to bloody well get out of</v>

1549
01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 10>bed for a week and that's because your</v>
<v Speaker 10>body is reacting as if the bedroom floor</v>

1550
01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 10>is covered with snakes and the best</v>
<v Speaker 10>thing for you to do is just not move,</v>

1551
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.460
<v Speaker 10>just freeze.</v>

1552
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 10>Not a pleasant situation to be in</v>
<v Speaker 10>because it's your aroused,</v>

1553
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 10>very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very physiologically demanding,</v>

1554
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:00.720
<v Speaker 10>and there's zero about it that's</v>
<v Speaker 10>productive except maybe the snakes won't</v>

1555
01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 10>see you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but they've already seen you,</v>

1556
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:05.700
<v Speaker 10>so that isn't helping very well.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So you've got all this undifferentiated</v>

1557
01:21:05.701 --> 01:21:06.990
<v Speaker 10>nadir,</v>
<v Speaker 10>negative emotion,</v>

1558
01:21:06.991 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 10>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 10>fear,</v>

1559
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.180
<v Speaker 10>hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 10>anger,</v>

1560
01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:10.080
<v Speaker 10>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 10>shame,</v>

1561
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 10>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the whole plethora of catastrophes.</v>

1562
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 10>And then maybe on the other side lurking</v>
<v Speaker 10>down there is,</v>

1563
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.920
<v Speaker 10>thank God I'm done with that job.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I just bloody well hated.</v>

1564
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 10>I dragged myself off to work every day</v>
<v Speaker 10>and there's a little part of my soul</v>

1565
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:27.960
<v Speaker 10>that so goddamn happy.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I finally got fired that I can hardly</v>

1566
01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:29.160
<v Speaker 10>stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1567
01:21:29.161 --> 01:21:31.890
<v Speaker 10>and maybe you don't even admit that to</v>
<v Speaker 10>yourself because well,</v>

1568
01:21:31.891 --> 01:21:35.190
<v Speaker 10>that would mean that all that time you</v>
<v Speaker 10>spent at the job was just sunk costs.</v>

1569
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.880
<v Speaker 10>You're deluding yourself the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 10>on.</v>

1570
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.430
<v Speaker 10>It is an interesting thing to consider</v>
<v Speaker 10>those sometimes if you're in the</v>

1571
01:21:41.431 --> 01:21:44.700
<v Speaker 10>unpleasant circumstance of having to</v>
<v Speaker 10>fire someone,</v>

1572
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:47.550
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>sometimes firing someone is the best</v>

1573
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 10>thing that can happen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which doesn't mean that you should go</v>

1574
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:55.200
<v Speaker 10>out and like enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Although I have met very disagreeable</v>

1575
01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 10>people who actually enjoyed firing</v>
<v Speaker 10>people and I'll tell you a story about</v>

1576
01:21:58.891 --> 01:22:00.840
<v Speaker 10>that at some point because it's quite</v>
<v Speaker 10>interesting,</v>

1577
01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:03.450
<v Speaker 10>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>sometimes if someone's just limping</v>

1578
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:08.451
<v Speaker 10>along in their job and doing it as</v>
<v Speaker 10>miserably in wretchedly as they possibly</v>

1579
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 10>can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the best thing you can do to them for</v>

1580
01:22:11.371 --> 01:22:12.420
<v Speaker 10>them is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1581
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.820
<v Speaker 10>you're failing at this and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>

1582
01:22:17.821 --> 01:22:21.180
<v Speaker 10>you would have to be failing at</v>
<v Speaker 10>absolutely everything else in the entire</v>

1583
01:22:21.181 --> 01:22:23.340
<v Speaker 10>world.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So maybe you should just accept the dam</v>

1584
01:22:23.341 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 10>failure and go off and try something</v>
<v Speaker 10>new.</v>

1585
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:29.610
<v Speaker 10>And I mean that's terrifying for people</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I know they hate it and all that,</v>

1586
01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>

1587
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.680
<v Speaker 10>but sometimes it's better than the</v>
<v Speaker 10>alternative,</v>

1588
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 10>which is just slow torturous death.</v>

1589
01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.470
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the idea of dream analysis,</v>

1590
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:44.560
<v Speaker 11>I suppose it's one of Freud's perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 11>Freud's major contribution to modern</v>

1591
01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:47.660
<v Speaker 11>western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The idea was there was something to</v>

1592
01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:51.620
<v Speaker 11>dreams and I suppose what I did is said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>hey look,</v>

1593
01:22:51.621 --> 01:22:55.820
<v Speaker 11>isn't it strange we have this whole</v>
<v Speaker 11>other form of thought that we engage in</v>

1594
01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.340
<v Speaker 11>at night it and it speaks in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>language that we don't really understand</v>

1595
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 11>and so what the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And you can say many modern people</v>

1596
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 12>do dreams are of no significance or even</v>
<v Speaker 12>that they're random processes,</v>

1597
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 12>which is an absurd proposition obviously</v>
<v Speaker 12>because they're by Terrell,</v>

1598
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 12>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're obviously not random.</v>

1599
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 12>So.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So Freud's idea was that there was some</v>

1600
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 12>something in dreams that was</v>
<v Speaker 12>informative,</v>

1601
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:25.750
<v Speaker 12>so that's his.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Now he had a method for describe for</v>

1602
01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:30.751
<v Speaker 12>extracting out from the dream what dream</v>
<v Speaker 12>purported to represent and he outlined</v>

1603
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:36.250
<v Speaker 12>that in great detail in the</v>
<v Speaker 12>interpretation of dreams and if you want</v>

1604
01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 12>to read one book by Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I would highly recommend that when it's</v>

1605
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.390
<v Speaker 12>a very long book and it's very detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but for a desert extraordinarily</v>

1606
01:23:43.391 --> 01:23:45.700
<v Speaker 12>comprehensive analysis of the way that</v>
<v Speaker 12>dreams work.</v>

1607
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 12>Now he made the because because he had</v>
<v Speaker 12>brought a theoretical framework to bear,</v>

1608
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:54.160
<v Speaker 12>even on his investigation into dream</v>
<v Speaker 12>structure,</v>

1609
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 12>he concluded that dreams were</v>
<v Speaker 12>essentially wish fulfillments,</v>

1610
01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 12>and that's where young and Freud</v>
<v Speaker 12>disagreed.</v>

1611
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 12>He also believed that the primary</v>
<v Speaker 12>motivating factor of human beings with</v>

1612
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 12>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and now that's a tougher one to toss</v>

1613
01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 12>aside because even if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 12>Darwinian,</v>

1614
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.090
<v Speaker 12>rather than afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Ian,</v>

1615
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 12>you're going to obviously support the</v>
<v Speaker 12>proposition that sexual motivation among</v>

1616
01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 12>any living creature is going to be one</v>
<v Speaker 12>of the highest order motivations because</v>

1617
01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:27.010
<v Speaker 12>otherwise creatures don't reproduce and</v>
<v Speaker 12>and prevail over the long run.</v>

1618
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 12>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>is that is that the ultimate source of</v>

1619
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 12>motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And in some sense the answer to that has</v>

1620
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 12>to be yes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

1621
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:38.080
<v Speaker 12>Freud wanted to make that in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 12>the sole source of motivation,</v>

1622
01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:41.620
<v Speaker 12>and I'm oversimplifying and I hate to do</v>
<v Speaker 12>that in relationship to Freud because he</v>

1623
01:24:41.621 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 12>was not as simple minded character</v>
<v Speaker 12>young.</v>

1624
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:47.200
<v Speaker 12>How to dream once,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if I remember correctly,</v>

1625
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:51.820
<v Speaker 12>that Freud and jung were excavating a</v>
<v Speaker 12>basement.</v>

1626
01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.840
<v Speaker 12>And so freud had outlined in Freud had</v>
<v Speaker 12>already discovered the basement,</v>

1627
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:56.230
<v Speaker 12>let's say.</v>

1628
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 12>So that would be the unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 12>structure of the psyche and young broke</v>

1629
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 12>through into another basement that was a</v>
<v Speaker 12>multi chambered place.</v>

1630
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:04.330
<v Speaker 12>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 12>many,</v>

1631
01:25:04.331 --> 01:25:09.180
<v Speaker 12>many rooms and I suppose what drove</v>
<v Speaker 12>young and freud apart was the</v>

1632
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.190
<v Speaker 12>proposition that there was a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 12>lot more going down,</v>

1633
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 12>going on down there.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Then had already met the eye and they</v>

1634
01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:19.390
<v Speaker 12>broke on the idea that the sexual</v>
<v Speaker 12>impulse was primary,</v>

1635
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 12>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they broke when you wrote a book called</v>

1636
01:25:22.511 --> 01:25:24.490
<v Speaker 12>symbols of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which is actually.</v>

1637
01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 12>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's three books that I know of that</v>

1638
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:30.250
<v Speaker 12>are sort of like maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 12>One is symbols of transformation.</v>

1639
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 12>One is a book by Eric Norman called the</v>
<v Speaker 12>origins and history of consciousness.</v>

1640
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:38.980
<v Speaker 12>And the third and the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 12>while his maps of meaning,</v>

1641
01:25:38.981 --> 01:25:40.960
<v Speaker 12>they're the same book.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're just like,</v>

1642
01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:43.960
<v Speaker 12>they're trying to solve the same problem</v>
<v Speaker 12>from three different directions.</v>

1643
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 12>They're all attempts to address the same</v>
<v Speaker 12>problem.</v>

1644
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.830
<v Speaker 12>And so symbols of transformation was a</v>
<v Speaker 12>book that you wrote about the fantasies</v>

1645
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 12>of schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a American woman,</v>

1646
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.280
<v Speaker 12>and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He was trying to relate her fantasies to</v>

1647
01:25:57.281 --> 01:26:00.220
<v Speaker 12>these old mythological ideas and young's</v>
<v Speaker 12>idea.</v>

1648
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:02.650
<v Speaker 12>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and this is an idea that was shared by</v>

1649
01:26:02.651 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 12>people like piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so we</v>

1650
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 11>were not going to say that you and Freud</v>
<v Speaker 11>just pulled this idea out of the air,</v>

1651
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:13.030
<v Speaker 11>was that the the birthplace of myth,</v>
<v Speaker 11>mythology and literature for that matter</v>

1652
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.790
<v Speaker 11>was the dream that that they share</v>
<v Speaker 11>structural,</v>

1653
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 11>they share,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they share,</v>

1654
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:27.790
<v Speaker 11>they share what mode of information</v>
<v Speaker 11>presentation and it's a relatively</v>

1655
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.790
<v Speaker 11>radical hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>

1656
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:42.280
<v Speaker 11>but given that they both,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they both represent</v>

1657
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.773
<v Speaker 8>hm</v>

1658
01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:47.980
<v Speaker 11>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 11>dreams and mythological representations</v>

1659
01:26:47.981 --> 01:26:52.060
<v Speaker 11>share and essentially narrative</v>
<v Speaker 11>structure and they use their literary</v>

1660
01:26:52.061 --> 01:26:54.160
<v Speaker 11>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean it's not so unreasonable to</v>

1661
01:26:54.161 --> 01:26:58.660
<v Speaker 11>notice that a dream at night is like the</v>
<v Speaker 11>movie that you play in your head and</v>

1662
01:26:58.661 --> 01:27:02.350
<v Speaker 11>it's not unreasonable to note as well</v>
<v Speaker 11>that the dreams that you have at night</v>

1663
01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:05.830
<v Speaker 11>bear a relationship to the daydreams</v>
<v Speaker 11>that you have during the day.</v>

1664
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.010
<v Speaker 11>It's a form of cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It seems like an involuntary form of</v>

1665
01:27:09.011 --> 01:27:10.930
<v Speaker 11>cognition though.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's a very strange thing.</v>

1666
01:27:10.931 --> 01:27:13.300
<v Speaker 11>So young thought about the dream as</v>
<v Speaker 11>nature,</v>

1667
01:27:13.301 --> 01:27:16.180
<v Speaker 11>speaking of its own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 11>roughly speaking.</v>

1668
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.890
<v Speaker 11>And so his idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

1669
01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:19.600
<v Speaker 11>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when you sleep,</v>

1670
01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:21.580
<v Speaker 11>you dream,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but the dream happens to you.</v>

1671
01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:25.210
<v Speaker 11>It's not something that you create the</v>
<v Speaker 11>way that you don't even think about</v>

1672
01:27:25.211 --> 01:27:26.740
<v Speaker 11>creating it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>because I might say,</v>

1673
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:27.880
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what are you thinking about?</v>

1674
01:27:27.881 --> 01:27:30.550
<v Speaker 11>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm thinking about whatever it is,</v>

1675
01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.970
<v Speaker 11>and you'll take credit in some sense for</v>
<v Speaker 11>thinking that because it seems like a</v>

1676
01:27:33.971 --> 01:27:37.030
<v Speaker 11>voluntary activity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but what happens at night is that you</v>

1677
01:27:37.031 --> 01:27:39.730
<v Speaker 11>think,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but you think involuntarily and so what</v>

1678
01:27:39.731 --> 01:27:43.240
<v Speaker 11>young would say is that means that</v>
<v Speaker 11>something is thinking in you</v>

1679
01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.980
<v Speaker 11>and that's a perfectly reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 11>looking at it and this is one of the</v>

1680
01:27:47.981 --> 01:27:52.000
<v Speaker 11>things that's uncanny about the cycle</v>
<v Speaker 11>analysts as they were willing to take</v>

1681
01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:54.880
<v Speaker 11>their observations to their logical</v>
<v Speaker 11>conclusion.</v>

1682
01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.600
<v Speaker 11>There are things that think in you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What are those things and what are they</v>

1683
01:28:01.211 --> 01:28:05.170
<v Speaker 11>thinking and why are they thinking it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>

1684
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.060
<v Speaker 11>if you do dream analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and this is a tricky thing because who's</v>

1685
01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:12.430
<v Speaker 11>to say if your damn analysis is correct?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Right?</v>

1686
01:28:12.431 --> 01:28:14.840
<v Speaker 11>It's very difficult to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you.</v>

1687
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:18.790
<v Speaker 11>If you do dream analysis with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you generally have them lay out their</v>

1688
01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:23.020
<v Speaker 11>dream and then you ask them when they're</v>
<v Speaker 11>going through their dream of second</v>

1689
01:28:23.021 --> 01:28:24.430
<v Speaker 11>time,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they lay out their dream and you can</v>

1690
01:28:24.431 --> 01:28:27.490
<v Speaker 11>kind of get a picture of it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and then they lay out their dream a</v>

1691
01:28:27.491 --> 01:28:31.420
<v Speaker 11>second time and as they go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>every time they mentioned a detail or a</v>

1692
01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:34.210
<v Speaker 11>character,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you ask them what that reminds them of</v>

1693
01:28:34.211 --> 01:28:39.211
<v Speaker 11>and the hypothesis is that the dream is</v>
<v Speaker 11>presenting an image or an idea that's</v>

1694
01:28:39.521 --> 01:28:44.020
<v Speaker 11>associated with a network of ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 11>then if you can expand on the network of</v>

1695
01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:47.410
<v Speaker 11>ideas as you go through the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you can elaborate on the dream.</v>

1696
01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:51.820
<v Speaker 11>You can expand it upwards and you can</v>
<v Speaker 11>start to see what it might be attempting</v>

1697
01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:53.950
<v Speaker 11>to put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now.</v>

1698
01:28:53.951 --> 01:28:56.770
<v Speaker 11>Freud's idea was that the dream knew</v>
<v Speaker 11>what it was doing,</v>

1699
01:28:57.010 --> 01:29:00.580
<v Speaker 11>but that its content was being</v>
<v Speaker 11>suppressed and oppressed by an internal</v>

1700
01:29:00.581 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 11>sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The dream had to be</v>

1701
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 12>sneaky about what it was saying because</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was going to deliver a message that</v>

1702
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:11.100
<v Speaker 12>the person didn't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That that was tied up with his idea of</v>

1703
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 12>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but that's not young's idea.</v>

1704
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 12>See,</v>
<v Speaker 12>young's idea was different.</v>

1705
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:16.370
<v Speaker 12>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>

1706
01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:19.110
<v Speaker 12>no.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The dream is trying to tell you what is</v>

1707
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 12>trying to tell you as clear as it can.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's just the best it can do,</v>

1708
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 12>and so you could think of the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and this is I believe,</v>

1709
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:30.000
<v Speaker 12>the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The dream is the birthplace of thought.</v>

1710
01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 12>The same way that artists are the</v>
<v Speaker 12>birthplace of culture.</v>

1711
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:37.110
<v Speaker 12>It's exactly the same process.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's that your mind is groping outward</v>

1712
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:42.300
<v Speaker 12>to try to comprehend what it has not yet</v>
<v Speaker 12>comprehended and it does that first by</v>

1713
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 12>trying to map it on to image and it's</v>
<v Speaker 12>doing that in the dream and it's</v>

1714
01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 12>somewhat incoherent and and,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and well,</v>

1715
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 12>let's stick with coherent because it's</v>
<v Speaker 12>not yet a full fledge thought.</v>

1716
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.110
<v Speaker 12>It's the birthplace of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's a fantasy about what might be,</v>

1717
01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 12>and then if you can grip the fantasy and</v>
<v Speaker 12>share it with other people,</v>

1718
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 12>then maybe they can elaborate upon it</v>
<v Speaker 12>and bring it into being with more</v>

1719
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:10.230
<v Speaker 12>clarity than it would be if it merely</v>
<v Speaker 12>existed.</v>

1720
01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:14.010
<v Speaker 12>As the precursor of a thought in your</v>
<v Speaker 12>imagination,</v>

1721
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.970
<v Speaker 13>do you know if you take people and I've</v>
<v Speaker 13>told you this and you expose them</v>

1722
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:21.750
<v Speaker 13>voluntarily to things that they are</v>
<v Speaker 13>avoiding and are afraid of,</v>

1723
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that they know they need to overcome in</v>

1724
01:30:23.641 --> 01:30:26.100
<v Speaker 13>order to meet their goals,</v>
<v Speaker 13>their self defined goals.</v>

1725
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:29.880
<v Speaker 13>If you can teach people to stand up in</v>
<v Speaker 13>the face of the things they're afraid</v>

1726
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 13>of,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they get stronger and you don't know</v>

1727
01:30:32.851 --> 01:30:36.120
<v Speaker 13>what the upper limits to that are</v>
<v Speaker 13>because you might ask yourself like if</v>

1728
01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 13>for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing</v>
<v Speaker 13>what you knew you needed to do by the</v>

1729
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:42.360
<v Speaker 13>depth,</v>
<v Speaker 13>by your own definitions,</v>

1730
01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:44.010
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Within the value structure that you've</v>

1731
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:46.050
<v Speaker 13>created,</v>
<v Speaker 13>to the degree that you've done that,</v>

1732
01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 13>what would you be like?</v>

1733
01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.630
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

1734
01:30:50.631 --> 01:30:53.510
<v Speaker 13>there are remarkable people who come</v>
<v Speaker 13>into the world from time to time and</v>

1735
01:30:53.511 --> 01:30:58.280
<v Speaker 13>there are people who do find out over</v>
<v Speaker 13>decades long periods what they could be</v>

1736
01:30:58.281 --> 01:31:03.281
<v Speaker 13>like if they were who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If they said if they spoke their being</v>

1737
01:31:03.381 --> 01:31:08.090
<v Speaker 13>forward and they get stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 13>stronger and stronger and we don't know</v>

1738
01:31:08.091 --> 01:31:10.250
<v Speaker 13>the limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We do not know the limits to that,</v>

1739
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:11.510
<v Speaker 13>and so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1740
01:31:11.511 --> 01:31:15.590
<v Speaker 13>in part perhaps the reason that you're</v>
<v Speaker 13>suffering unbearably can be left at your</v>

1741
01:31:15.591 --> 01:31:18.890
<v Speaker 13>feet because you're not everything you</v>
<v Speaker 13>could be and you know it,</v>

1742
01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:22.520
<v Speaker 13>and of course that's a terrible thing to</v>
<v Speaker 13>admit and it's a terrible thing to</v>

1743
01:31:22.521 --> 01:31:25.010
<v Speaker 13>consider,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but there's real promise in it,</v>

1744
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.300
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Because it means that</v>

1745
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.660
<v Speaker 13>perhaps there's another way that you</v>
<v Speaker 13>could look at the world and the number</v>

1746
01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:33.030
<v Speaker 13>another way that you could act in the</v>
<v Speaker 13>world.</v>

1747
01:31:33.031 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 13>So what it would reflect back to you</v>
<v Speaker 13>would be much better than what it</v>

1748
01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:39.240
<v Speaker 13>reflects back to you now.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then the second part of that is,</v>

1749
01:31:39.241 --> 01:31:41.940
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>imagine that many people did that</v>

1750
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.070
<v Speaker 13>because we've done a lot as human</v>
<v Speaker 13>beings.</v>

1751
01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:46.890
<v Speaker 13>We've done a lot of remarkable things</v>
<v Speaker 13>and I told you already,</v>

1752
01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 13>I think before that today,</v>
<v Speaker 13>for example,</v>

1753
01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:54.260
<v Speaker 13>about 250,000 people will be lifted out</v>
<v Speaker 13>of abject poverty and about 300,000</v>

1754
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.610
<v Speaker 13>people attached to the electrical power</v>
<v Speaker 13>grid.</v>

1755
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 13>We're making.</v>
<v Speaker 13>People were lifting people out of</v>

1756
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 13>collectively at a faster rate that's</v>
<v Speaker 13>ever occurred in the history of</v>

1757
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 13>humankind by a huge margin and that's</v>
<v Speaker 13>been going on unbelievably quickly since</v>

1758
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 13>the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The UN employee plan to have poverty</v>

1759
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 13>between 2000 and 2015 and it was</v>
<v Speaker 13>accomplished by 2013.</v>

1760
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 13>So there's inequality developing in many</v>
<v Speaker 13>places and you hear lots of political</v>

1761
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 13>agitation about that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But overall the tide is lifting everyone</v>

1762
01:32:24.821 --> 01:32:27.970
<v Speaker 13>up and now it's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We have no idea how fast we can multiply</v>

1763
01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:31.000
<v Speaker 13>that if people got their act together</v>
<v Speaker 13>and really aimed at it.</v>

1764
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:32.171
<v Speaker 13>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

1765
01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:35.140
<v Speaker 13>my,</v>
<v Speaker 13>my experience is with people that were</v>

1766
01:32:35.141 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 13>probably running at about 51 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 13>our capacity.</v>

1767
01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:40.630
<v Speaker 13>Something mean you can think about this</v>
<v Speaker 13>yourselves.</v>

1768
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 13>I often ask undergraduates how many</v>
<v Speaker 13>hours a day you waste or how many hours</v>

1769
01:32:45.701 --> 01:32:48.550
<v Speaker 13>a week you waste.</v>
<v Speaker 13>The classic answer is something like</v>

1770
01:32:48.551 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 13>four to six hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

1771
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:52.730
<v Speaker 13>inefficient studying,</v>
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

1772
01:32:52.731 --> 01:32:56.020
<v Speaker 13>watching things on youtube that not only</v>
<v Speaker 13>do you not want to watch,</v>

1773
01:32:56.021 --> 01:32:58.990
<v Speaker 13>that you don't even care about that make</v>
<v Speaker 13>you feel horrible about watching.</v>

1774
01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:01.930
<v Speaker 13>After you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's probably four hours right there.</v>

1775
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.600
<v Speaker 13>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well that's 20,</v>

1776
01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 13>25 hours a week.</v>

1777
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.950
<v Speaker 13>It's 100 hours a month.</v>
<v Speaker 13>That's two and a half full work weeks.</v>

1778
01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:14.160
<v Speaker 13>It's half a year of work weeks per year.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And if your time is worth $20 an hour,</v>

1779
01:33:15.071 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 13>which is a radical underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's probably more like 50.</v>

1780
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 13>If you think about it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 13>deferred wages,</v>

1781
01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.440
<v Speaker 13>if you're wasting 20 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you're wasting $50,000 a year and you</v>

1782
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:29.770
<v Speaker 13>are doing that right now and it's</v>
<v Speaker 13>because you're young wasting $50,000 a</v>

1783
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:33.070
<v Speaker 13>year as a way bigger catastrophe then it</v>
<v Speaker 13>would be for me to waste it because I'm</v>

1784
01:33:33.071 --> 01:33:36.310
<v Speaker 13>not going to last nearly as long.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And so if your life isn't everything,</v>

1785
01:33:36.311 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 13>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You could ask yourself,</v>

1786
01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:39.550
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>what would happen if you just stopped</v>

1787
01:33:39.551 --> 01:33:42.340
<v Speaker 13>wasting the opportunities that are in</v>
<v Speaker 13>front of you?</v>

1788
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 13>You be who knows how much more</v>
<v Speaker 13>efficient,</v>

1789
01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 13>10 times more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 13>20 times more efficient.</v>

1790
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.200
<v Speaker 13>That's the prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You have no idea how efficient,</v>

1791
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:54.340
<v Speaker 13>efficient people get.</v>

1792
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 13>It's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's off the charts</v>

1793
01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and if we all got our act together</v>

1794
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:04.870
<v Speaker 13>collectively and stopped making things</v>
<v Speaker 13>worse because that's another thing</v>

1795
01:34:04.871 --> 01:34:08.260
<v Speaker 13>people do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Not only do they not do what they should</v>

1796
01:34:08.261 --> 01:34:11.170
<v Speaker 13>to make things better,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they actively attempt to make things</v>

1797
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:16.171
<v Speaker 13>worse because they're spiteful or</v>
<v Speaker 13>resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or</v>

1798
01:34:16.541 --> 01:34:21.541
<v Speaker 13>homicidal or genocidal or all of those</v>
<v Speaker 13>things all bundled together in an</v>

1799
01:34:21.881 --> 01:34:25.990
<v Speaker 13>absolutely pathological package.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If people stopped really,</v>

1800
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 13>really trying just to make things worse,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we have no idea how much better they</v>

1801
01:34:29.711 --> 01:34:33.670
<v Speaker 13>would get just because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So there's this weird dynamic that's</v>

1802
01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:37.990
<v Speaker 13>part of the existential system of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 13>between human vulnerability,</v>

1803
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 13>social judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 13>both of which are are,</v>

1804
01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.290
<v Speaker 13>are,</v>
<v Speaker 13>are major causes of suffering and the</v>

1805
01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:47.950
<v Speaker 13>failure of individuals to adopt the</v>
<v Speaker 13>responsibility that they know they</v>

1806
01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:50.590
<v Speaker 13>should adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that's the thing that's interesting</v>

1807
01:34:50.591 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 13>too,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is that like one of the,</v>

1808
01:34:52.811 --> 01:34:56.170
<v Speaker 13>another thing I've asked often asked my</v>
<v Speaker 13>undergraduate classes,</v>

1809
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.390
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>there's this idea that people have that</v>

1810
01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 13>people have a conscience</v>

1811
01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:03.750
<v Speaker 13>and you know what the conscience is.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>

1812
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.940
<v Speaker 13>it's this feeling or voice you have in</v>
<v Speaker 13>your head just before you do something</v>

1813
01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:10.170
<v Speaker 13>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is stupid,</v>

1814
01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:13.710
<v Speaker 13>telling you that probably you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 13>do that stupid thing.</v>

1815
01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.500
<v Speaker 13>You don't have to listen to it strangely</v>
<v Speaker 13>enough,</v>

1816
01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.640
<v Speaker 13>but you go ahead and do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And then of course exactly what the</v>

1817
01:35:20.641 --> 01:35:24.060
<v Speaker 13>conscience told you was going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 13>inevitably happens so that you feel even</v>

1818
01:35:24.061 --> 01:35:26.790
<v Speaker 13>stupider about it than you would if it</v>
<v Speaker 13>happened by accident.</v>

1819
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:27.960
<v Speaker 13>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

1820
01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:31.590
<v Speaker 13>I knew this was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I got a warning it was going to happen</v>

1821
01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:34.770
<v Speaker 13>and I went and did it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And the funny thing too is that that</v>

1822
01:35:34.771 --> 01:35:38.160
<v Speaker 13>conscience operates within people and we</v>
<v Speaker 13>really don't understand what the hell</v>

1823
01:35:38.161 --> 01:35:38.994
<v Speaker 13>that is.</v>

1824
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.160
<v Speaker 13>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1825
01:35:41.161 --> 01:35:44.700
<v Speaker 13>what would happen if you abided by your</v>
<v Speaker 13>conscience for five years or for 10</v>

1826
01:35:44.701 --> 01:35:47.070
<v Speaker 13>years?</v>
<v Speaker 13>What sort of position might you be in?</v>

1827
01:35:47.071 --> 01:35:50.460
<v Speaker 13>What sort of family might you have?</v>
<v Speaker 13>What sort of relationship might you be</v>

1828
01:35:50.461 --> 01:35:55.050
<v Speaker 13>able to forge and you can be bloody sure</v>
<v Speaker 13>that a relationship that's forged on the</v>

1829
01:35:55.051 --> 01:36:00.000
<v Speaker 13>basis of who you actually are is going</v>
<v Speaker 13>to be a lot stronger and more welcome</v>

1830
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:02.670
<v Speaker 13>than one that's forged on the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 13>who you aren't.</v>

1831
01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:03.871
<v Speaker 13>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 13>of course,</v>

1832
01:36:03.871 --> 01:36:08.430
<v Speaker 13>that means that the person you're with</v>
<v Speaker 13>has to deal with the full force of you</v>

1833
01:36:08.431 --> 01:36:10.650
<v Speaker 13>in all your ability and your</v>
<v Speaker 13>catastrophe,</v>

1834
01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:13.200
<v Speaker 13>and that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 13>very difficult thing to negotiate,</v>

1835
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.110
<v Speaker 13>but if you do negotiate it well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>at least you,</v>

1836
01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.320
<v Speaker 13>you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you have somewhere solid to stand and</v>

1837
01:36:19.321 --> 01:36:22.590
<v Speaker 13>you have somewhere to live.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You have a real life and it's a great</v>

1838
01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:25.770
<v Speaker 13>basis upon which to bring children into</v>
<v Speaker 13>the world,</v>

1839
01:36:25.771 --> 01:36:27.630
<v Speaker 13>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 13>because you can have an actual</v>

1840
01:36:27.631 --> 01:36:30.960
<v Speaker 13>relationship with them instead of</v>
<v Speaker 13>torturing them half to death,</v>

1841
01:36:30.961 --> 01:36:35.961
<v Speaker 13>which is what happens in a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a tremendously large minority of cases.</v>

1842
01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:40.140
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's more than that too because,</v>

1843
01:36:40.141 --> 01:36:43.200
<v Speaker 13>and this is what I'll close with and</v>
<v Speaker 13>this is why I wanted to introduce social</v>

1844
01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.580
<v Speaker 13>knutson's readings to you.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You see,</v>

1845
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.740
<v Speaker 13>because it isn't merely that your fate</v>
<v Speaker 13>depends on whether or not you get your</v>

1846
01:36:49.741 --> 01:36:54.030
<v Speaker 13>act together and to what degree you</v>
<v Speaker 13>decide that you're going to live out</v>

1847
01:36:54.031 --> 01:36:57.120
<v Speaker 13>your own genuine being.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It isn't only your fate,</v>

1848
01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.900
<v Speaker 13>it's the fate of everyone that you're</v>
<v Speaker 13>networked with and so you know,</v>

1849
01:37:00.901 --> 01:37:01.734
<v Speaker 13>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1850
01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:05.310
<v Speaker 13>there's 9 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 13>7 billion people in the world.</v>

1851
01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:07.530
<v Speaker 13>We're going to peak at about 9 billion</v>
<v Speaker 13>by the way,</v>

1852
01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:11.160
<v Speaker 13>and then it'll decline rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but 7 billion people in the world and</v>

1853
01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 13>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 13>You're just one little dust mote among</v>

1854
01:37:13.891 --> 01:37:16.410
<v Speaker 13>that 7 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and so it really doesn't matter what you</v>

1855
01:37:16.411 --> 01:37:19.080
<v Speaker 13>do or don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but that's simply not the case.</v>

1856
01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:23.040
<v Speaker 13>It's the wrong model because you're at</v>
<v Speaker 13>the center of a network.</v>

1857
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.580
<v Speaker 13>You're a node in a network.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Of course that's even more true now that</v>

1858
01:37:26.581 --> 01:37:28.170
<v Speaker 13>we have social media.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You'll,</v>

1859
01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:32.190
<v Speaker 13>you'll know a thousand people at least</v>
<v Speaker 13>over the course of your life and they'll</v>

1860
01:37:32.191 --> 01:37:35.640
<v Speaker 13>know a thousand people each and that</v>
<v Speaker 13>puts you one person away from a million</v>

1861
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:40.470
<v Speaker 13>and two persons away from a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and so that's how you're connected and</v>

1862
01:37:40.471 --> 01:37:43.500
<v Speaker 13>the things you do.</v>
<v Speaker 13>They're like dropping a stone in a pond.</v>

1863
01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:48.240
<v Speaker 13>The ripples move outward and they effect</v>
<v Speaker 13>things in ways that you can't fully</v>

1864
01:37:48.241 --> 01:37:52.110
<v Speaker 13>comprehend and it means that the things</v>
<v Speaker 13>that you do and that you don't do are</v>

1865
01:37:52.111 --> 01:37:57.090
<v Speaker 13>far more important than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 13>and so if you act that way,</v>

1866
01:37:57.091 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 13>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the terror of realizing that is that it</v>

1867
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 13>actually starts to matter what you do</v>
<v Speaker 13>and you might say,</v>

1868
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's better than living a meaningless</v>

1869
01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 13>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's better for it to matter,</v>

1870
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:10.260
<v Speaker 13>but I mean if you really asked yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 13>would you be so sure if you had the</v>

1871
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:10.920
<v Speaker 13>choice?</v>

1872
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.560
<v Speaker 13>I can live with no responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 13>whatsoever.</v>

1873
01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:18.360
<v Speaker 13>The price I pay is that nothing matters</v>
<v Speaker 13>or I can reverse it and everything</v>

1874
01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:21.330
<v Speaker 13>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but I have to take the responsibility</v>

1875
01:38:21.331 --> 01:38:24.660
<v Speaker 13>that's associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's not so obvious to me that people</v>

1876
01:38:24.661 --> 01:38:27.480
<v Speaker 13>would take the meaningful path.</v>
<v Speaker 13>No.</v>

1877
01:38:27.481 --> 01:38:28.171
<v Speaker 13>When you say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1878
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:30.960
<v Speaker 13>nihilists suffer dreadfully because</v>
<v Speaker 13>there's no meaning in their life and</v>

1879
01:38:30.961 --> 01:38:31.950
<v Speaker 13>they still suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

1880
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:34.200
<v Speaker 13>but the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they have no responsibility.</v>

1881
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 13>So that's the payoff and I actually</v>
<v Speaker 13>think that's the motivation.</v>

1882
01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:38.041
<v Speaker 13>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

1883
01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 13>I can't help being nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 13>All my belief systems have collapsed.</v>

1884
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:41.821
<v Speaker 13>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

1885
01:38:41.821 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 13>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Maybe you've just allowed them to</v>

1886
01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:47.400
<v Speaker 13>collapse because it's a hell of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 13>easier than acting them out and the</v>

1887
01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:49.020
<v Speaker 13>price you pay is a meaningless</v>
<v Speaker 13>suffering,</v>

1888
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:51.960
<v Speaker 13>but you can always whining about that</v>
<v Speaker 13>and people will feel sorry for you and</v>

1889
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 13>you have the option of taking the</v>
<v Speaker 13>pathway of the martyr so that's a pretty</v>

1890
01:38:54.871 --> 01:38:55.410
<v Speaker 13>good deal.</v>

1891
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 13>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 13>especially when the when the alternative</v>

1892
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:04.131
<v Speaker 13>is to bear your burden properly and to</v>
<v Speaker 13>live forthrightly in the world.</v>

1893
01:39:04.711 --> 01:39:06.870
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 13>what SOS units and figured out in so</v>

1894
01:39:06.871 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 13>many people in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 13>it's not just him,</v>

1895
01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:14.400
<v Speaker 13>even though he's the best example,</v>
<v Speaker 13>is that if you live a pathological life,</v>

1896
01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:18.540
<v Speaker 13>you pathologize your society and if</v>
<v Speaker 13>enough people do that,</v>

1897
01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 13>then it's held really,</v>
<v Speaker 13>really,</v>

1898
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.500
<v Speaker 13>and you can read the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If you have the fortitude to do that and</v>

1899
01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:32.310
<v Speaker 13>you'll see exactly what hell is like and</v>
<v Speaker 13>then you can decide if that's a place</v>

1900
01:39:32.311 --> 01:39:34.740
<v Speaker 13>you'd like to visit or even more</v>
<v Speaker 13>importantly,</v>

1901
01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 13>if it's a light.</v>
<v Speaker 13>If it's a place you'd like to visit and</v>

1902
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:41.400
<v Speaker 13>take all your family and friends because</v>
<v Speaker 13>that's what happened in the 20th</v>

1903
01:39:41.401 --> 01:39:42.234
<v Speaker 13>century.</v>

1904
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.730
<v Speaker 12>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so now I'll read you the story of the</v>

1905
01:39:44.731 --> 01:39:47.880
<v Speaker 12>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the father of Prince Gautama,</v>

1906
01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:51.600
<v Speaker 12>the Buddha savior of the Orient,</v>
<v Speaker 12>determined to protect his son from</v>

1907
01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 12>desperate knowledge and tragic awareness</v>
<v Speaker 12>built for him and enclosed pavilion,</v>

1908
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 12>a walled garden of earthly delights.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay,</v>

1909
01:39:58.201 --> 01:40:03.201
<v Speaker 12>so the story goes that an angel visited</v>
<v Speaker 12>Buddhist father and said that he's going</v>

1910
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:06.720
<v Speaker 12>to have a son and the son is either</v>
<v Speaker 12>going to become the greatest ruler that</v>

1911
01:40:06.721 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 12>the world has ever seen or a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 12>leader and the father being a practical</v>

1912
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 12>man thought where there's no bloody way.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I want my son to be some like wandering</v>

1913
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:17.310
<v Speaker 12>spiritual leader.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I want him to be the greatest king that</v>

1914
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 12>the world has ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay?</v>

1915
01:40:19.141 --> 01:40:24.141
<v Speaker 12>And so the father decides,</v>
<v Speaker 12>how am I going to get my son to be the</v>

1916
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 12>greatest ruler the world has ever seen?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I better get them to fall in love with</v>

1917
01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:32.420
<v Speaker 12>the world because then he's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 12>go traipsing after some sort of pathway.</v>

1918
01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 12>Did spiritual knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He's going to stick to practical tasks,</v>

1919
01:40:36.451 --> 01:40:38.430
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's something that a father should do</v>

1920
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:40.500
<v Speaker 12>to some degree is orient you in the</v>
<v Speaker 12>world.</v>

1921
01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:42.840
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And maybe shouldn't subvert your</v>

1922
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 12>spiritual development to any great</v>
<v Speaker 12>degree,</v>

1923
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 12>but there's a practical element to this</v>
<v Speaker 12>and and so anyways,</v>

1924
01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:51.210
<v Speaker 12>that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so that's what happens.</v>

1925
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:56.730
<v Speaker 12>The father bill is this of perfection</v>
<v Speaker 12>and he eliminates from it everything</v>

1926
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:01.600
<v Speaker 12>that's a reminder of the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's associated with life.</v>

1927
01:41:01.601 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 12>So the only thing that's allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the only creatures that are allowed to</v>

1928
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 12>be in there,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the only people that are allowed to be</v>

1929
01:41:06.281 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 12>in there are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 12>young,</v>

1930
01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 12>and happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So the Buddha grows up surrounded by</v>

1931
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:13.510
<v Speaker 12>nothing but the positive elements of</v>
<v Speaker 12>life.</v>

1932
01:41:13.511 --> 01:41:14.171
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you think,</v>

1933
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what does that mean?</v>

1934
01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.200
<v Speaker 12>While it's akin to the paradise idea,</v>
<v Speaker 12>obviously walled enclosure of paradise</v>

1935
01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 12>where there's no death,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but there's more to it than that too.</v>

1936
01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:26.500
<v Speaker 12>It's also in some sense what a good</v>
<v Speaker 12>father would do.</v>

1937
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:29.070
<v Speaker 12>What do you do with your young children?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

1938
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 12>you don't expose them to death and decay</v>
<v Speaker 12>at every step of the way.</v>

1939
01:41:32.651 --> 01:41:33.370
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>To you.</v>

1940
01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:37.270
<v Speaker 12>You build a protected world for them</v>
<v Speaker 12>like a wall enclosure,</v>

1941
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 12>and you only keep what's healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 12>life giving inside of it,</v>

1942
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:44.500
<v Speaker 12>and you don't expose them to things that</v>
<v Speaker 12>they can't tolerate.</v>

1943
01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:46.330
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe you don't take a three year old to</v>

1944
01:41:46.331 --> 01:41:47.500
<v Speaker 12>a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Now maybe you do,</v>

1945
01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.750
<v Speaker 12>but maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There's things that you don't expect</v>

1946
01:41:49.751 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Speaker 12>them to be able to cope with.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You regulate what they're allowed to</v>

1947
01:41:53.021 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 12>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're not going to show them the tech</v>

1948
01:41:54.731 --> 01:41:58.000
<v Speaker 12>Texas chainsaw massacre when they're</v>
<v Speaker 12>four years old.</v>

1949
01:41:58.001 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 12>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so so you're staving off knowledge of</v>

1950
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:03.640
<v Speaker 12>mortality and death,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and so he's just being a good father in</v>

1951
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:04.480
<v Speaker 12>many ways here.</v>

1952
01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:09.220
<v Speaker 12>All signs of decay and degeneration</v>
<v Speaker 12>where thus kept hidden from the prince,</v>

1953
01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.510
<v Speaker 12>immersed in the immediate pleasures of</v>
<v Speaker 12>the census in physical love and dance</v>

1954
01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 12>and music and beauty and pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Gautama grew to maturity,</v>

1955
01:42:17.141 --> 01:42:20.200
<v Speaker 12>protected absolutely from the</v>
<v Speaker 12>limitations of mortal being.</v>

1956
01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.360
<v Speaker 12>However,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he grew curious,</v>

1957
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:26.650
<v Speaker 12>despite his father's most particular</v>
<v Speaker 12>attention and will and resolve to leave</v>

1958
01:42:26.651 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 12>his seductive prison.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

1959
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:32.140
<v Speaker 12>it's that curiosity element.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's the same thing that lurks in the</v>

1960
01:42:32.141 --> 01:42:34.630
<v Speaker 12>Adam and Eve story.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like God tells Adam and Eve,</v>

1961
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.530
<v Speaker 12>see that tree over there.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Don't be bothered with it.</v>

1962
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.760
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know what's going to happen with</v>

1963
01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 12>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 12>especially if there's a snake associated</v>

1964
01:42:42.101 --> 01:42:43.360
<v Speaker 12>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're going to be over there right</v>

1965
01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 12>away.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Check in that place out,</v>

1966
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.480
<v Speaker 12>and that's exactly what happens with the</v>
<v Speaker 12>Buddha.</v>

1967
01:42:47.481 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 12>It's like he's raised to be healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 12>what is.</v>

1968
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:55.990
<v Speaker 12>What's the consequence of that is that</v>
<v Speaker 12>the fact that he's healthy makes them</v>

1969
01:42:55.991 --> 01:43:00.580
<v Speaker 12>look for what's beyond the protected</v>
<v Speaker 12>confines of the thing that made him</v>

1970
01:43:00.581 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 12>healthy.</v>

1971
01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:03.460
<v Speaker 12>It's like what's like even in the Japan</v>
<v Speaker 12>story,</v>

1972
01:43:03.461 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 12>you know where Japan Paints on</v>
<v Speaker 12>Pinocchio,</v>

1973
01:43:06.401 --> 01:43:07.630
<v Speaker 12>his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and he's ready to go.</v>

1974
01:43:07.631 --> 01:43:11.230
<v Speaker 12>He puts them outside the next day and</v>
<v Speaker 12>Pinocchio is ready to run away with all</v>

1975
01:43:11.231 --> 01:43:12.011
<v Speaker 12>the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>

1976
01:43:12.011 --> 01:43:16.060
<v Speaker 12>So the consequence of raising a child in</v>
<v Speaker 12>a healthy way is that the child is going</v>

1977
01:43:16.061 --> 01:43:20.950
<v Speaker 12>to be curious enough to go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 12>look for some trouble and we actually</v>

1978
01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:23.680
<v Speaker 12>know that because there is followup</v>
<v Speaker 12>studies of teenagers,</v>

1979
01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:27.220
<v Speaker 12>you imagine that there's teenagers who</v>
<v Speaker 12>never break any rules and then there's</v>

1980
01:43:27.221 --> 01:43:28.990
<v Speaker 12>teenagers who break all the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay?</v>

1981
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 12>These teenagers don't do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Introverted,</v>

1982
01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 12>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 12>anxious,</v>

1983
01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:34.990
<v Speaker 12>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Sorry,</v>

1984
01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.510
<v Speaker 12>I said that twice.</v>
<v Speaker 12>These ones are antisocial.</v>

1985
01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:39.970
<v Speaker 12>The ones in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's what you want.</v>

1986
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 12>You want your damn teenager to get out</v>
<v Speaker 12>of the paradisical confines of your</v>

1987
01:43:43.781 --> 01:43:46.780
<v Speaker 12>house and to go cause some trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 12>to investigate.</v>

1988
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 12>Maybe you don't want to know about it</v>
<v Speaker 12>anymore than you have to.</v>

1989
01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:53.300
<v Speaker 12>You don't want them to be breaking rules</v>
<v Speaker 12>all the time and you don't want them to</v>

1990
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:57.470
<v Speaker 12>be so timid into press that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 12>make a move on their own and never make</v>

1991
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 12>a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So the paradoxical thing here,</v>

1992
01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 12>and it sort of echoed are,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is why I like these two stories</v>

1993
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 12>back to back is like if you give people</v>
<v Speaker 12>what they want,</v>

1994
01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.290
<v Speaker 12>then the first thing they're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 12>is try to get beyond it.</v>

1995
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 12>And Dostoevsky says the same thing and</v>
<v Speaker 12>notes from underground.</v>

1996
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 12>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if you gave people everything they</v>

1997
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 12>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 12>pure utopia.</v>

1998
01:44:16.011 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 12>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so that they're sitting in a pool of</v>

1999
01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 12>bliss with nothing but bubbles of</v>
<v Speaker 12>happiness coming up from the surface and</v>

2000
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:25.970
<v Speaker 12>all they have to do is eat cake.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And busy themselves with the</v>

2001
01:44:25.971 --> 01:44:27.590
<v Speaker 12>continuation of the species.</v>

2002
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:32.180
<v Speaker 12>Dusty said Dostoyevsky's observation is</v>
<v Speaker 12>the first thing that people would do is</v>

2003
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 12>find something to smash that with.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Just so that something interesting and</v>

2004
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:37.760
<v Speaker 12>perverse could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like,</v>

2005
01:44:37.761 --> 01:44:38.451
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yes,</v>

2006
01:44:38.451 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 12>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're creatures that are designed to</v>

2007
01:44:41.571 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 12>encounter the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We want to keep moving beyond what we</v>

2008
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:47.120
<v Speaker 12>have.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Even if we have what we have is what we</v>

2009
01:44:47.121 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 12>want.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And maybe that's partly because we're</v>

2010
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:51.410
<v Speaker 12>oriented towards the future.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We think,</v>

2011
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 12>well this is great,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but it's not good enough.</v>

2012
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:55.130
<v Speaker 12>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but it's not good enough.</v>

2013
01:44:55.131 --> 01:44:58.130
<v Speaker 12>There's always something more that</v>
<v Speaker 12>drives us forward.</v>

2014
01:44:58.450 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 12>While.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So that's what happens with the Buddha.</v>

2015
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.290
<v Speaker 12>He gets curious.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He sees the walls,</v>

2016
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.240
<v Speaker 12>he thinks there's walls,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's probably something outside of</v>

2017
01:45:05.241 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 12>those walls.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So then he goes to his father</v>

2018
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:12.330
<v Speaker 12>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm,</v>

2019
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 12>I want to go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what's outside?</v>

2020
01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:15.570
<v Speaker 12>And his father says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>

2021
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 12>you don't want to go outside.</v>

2022
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 12>And Buddha says,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>

2023
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 12>well I really do want to go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And his father knows that unless he lets</v>

2024
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:22.640
<v Speaker 12>him go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he's going to climb over the walls.</v>

2025
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:26.570
<v Speaker 12>And so the father decides he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let them go inside,</v>

2026
01:45:26.571 --> 01:45:28.340
<v Speaker 12>please go fix everything out there</v>
<v Speaker 12>first.</v>

2027
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Speaker 12>So he goes outside.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like the Chinese preparing for the</v>

2028
01:45:31.431 --> 01:45:33.200
<v Speaker 12>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know when they sprayed the grass</v>

2029
01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:36.790
<v Speaker 12>with with with green paint,</v>
<v Speaker 12>got rid of all the homeless people is</v>

2030
01:45:36.791 --> 01:45:39.560
<v Speaker 12>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So he goes outside the city and he tells</v>

2031
01:45:39.561 --> 01:45:40.394
<v Speaker 12>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 12>all right,</v>

2032
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 12>old people,</v>
<v Speaker 12>sick people dying.</v>

2033
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:46.250
<v Speaker 12>People hit the road.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We don't want to see it for awhile.</v>

2034
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 12>Clean all this out.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We want the attractive people around the</v>

2035
01:45:49.131 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 12>sides of the roads like waving palm</v>
<v Speaker 12>fronds and all of that and so when my</v>

2036
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:54.650
<v Speaker 12>son comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he's going to see nothing but what's</v>

2037
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 12>good and so we get that all arranged it.</v>

2038
01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.080
<v Speaker 12>He lets his son go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Now his son goes outside in this little</v>

2039
01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:03.500
<v Speaker 12>chariot thing and he has someone with</v>
<v Speaker 12>him now,</v>

2040
01:46:03.501 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 12>unbeknownst to his father,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that person that's with them as an</v>

2041
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:09.320
<v Speaker 12>emissary of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so in a perverse way,</v>

2042
01:46:09.321 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 12>he plays the same role as the serpent in</v>
<v Speaker 12>the story of Adam and eve,</v>

2043
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:19.090
<v Speaker 12>and the gods have already arranged so</v>
<v Speaker 12>that the father's a carer is going to be</v>

2044
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:23.150
<v Speaker 12>insufficient and it's the snake in the</v>
<v Speaker 12>garden idea.</v>

2045
01:46:23.151 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 12>It's like no matter how much care you</v>
<v Speaker 12>take to make things perfect,</v>

2046
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 12>some of the some of what what you're</v>
<v Speaker 12>excluding is going to come back in.</v>

2047
01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.020
<v Speaker 12>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Buddha goes outside and he's in his</v>

2048
01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 12>chariot and preparations were made to</v>
<v Speaker 12>guild is chosen route to cover the</v>

2049
01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:43.340
<v Speaker 12>adventurous path with flowers and to</v>
<v Speaker 12>display for his admiration and</v>

2050
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 12>preoccupation,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the fairest women of the kingdom.</v>

2051
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:49.680
<v Speaker 12>The print set out with full retinue in</v>
<v Speaker 12>the shield and comfort of a chaperone</v>

2052
01:46:49.681 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 12>chariot.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And delighted in the Panorama previously</v>

2053
01:46:52.411 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 12>prepared for him.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The gods,</v>

2054
01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:57.270
<v Speaker 12>however,</v>
<v Speaker 12>decided to disrupt these most carefully</v>

2055
01:46:57.271 --> 01:47:02.271
<v Speaker 12>laid plans and sent an aged man to</v>
<v Speaker 12>hobble in full view alongside the road.</v>

2056
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.450
<v Speaker 12>The princess fascinated gaze fell upon</v>
<v Speaker 12>the ancient interloper.</v>

2057
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.270
<v Speaker 12>Compelled by curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He asked his attendant,</v>

2058
01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 12>what is that creature stumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 12>shabby bent and broken beside my retinue</v>

2059
01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 12>and the attendant answered that is a man</v>
<v Speaker 12>like other men who was born in infant</v>

2060
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 12>became a child,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a youth,</v>

2061
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 12>a husband,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a father,</v>

2062
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 12>a father of fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He has become old subject to destruction</v>

2063
01:47:25.561 --> 01:47:26.730
<v Speaker 12>of his beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 12>his will,</v>

2064
01:47:26.731 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 12>and the possibilities of life like other</v>
<v Speaker 12>men,</v>

2065
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 12>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>hesitantly inquired the prints.</v>

2066
01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 12>That means this will happen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and the attendant answered inevitably</v>

2067
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:39.240
<v Speaker 12>with the passage of time.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

2068
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 12>that's the end of that party.</v>

2069
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:44.340
<v Speaker 12>The world collapses in on Buddha and</v>
<v Speaker 12>paying he hightails at home.</v>

2070
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:45.570
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what does that mean?</v>

2071
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:46.950
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's what children do.</v>

2072
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:49.200
<v Speaker 12>Roughly speaking is there around their</v>
<v Speaker 12>mother.</v>

2073
01:47:49.570 --> 01:47:50.910
<v Speaker 12>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They've got security there.</v>

2074
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 12>They go out into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they encounter something that's just a</v>

2075
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:55.300
<v Speaker 12>little bit too much for them.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Bang,</v>

2076
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:56.620
<v Speaker 12>they come home,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they get old,</v>

2077
01:47:56.621 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 12>padded,</v>
<v Speaker 12>back into shape and hugged,</v>

2078
01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.290
<v Speaker 12>didn't taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hugging children and patting is actually</v>

2079
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:03.990
<v Speaker 12>analgesic.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It actually reduces pate.</v>

2080
01:48:04.230 --> 01:48:06.260
<v Speaker 12>Unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's what you do with someone who's</v>

2081
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:07.103
<v Speaker 12>grieving,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

2082
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:10.370
<v Speaker 12>So you hug them because grief is paid</v>
<v Speaker 12>so,</v>

2083
01:48:11.210 --> 01:48:11.911
<v Speaker 12>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2084
01:48:11.911 --> 01:48:13.580
<v Speaker 12>you pat them and they get rid of their</v>
<v Speaker 12>pain.</v>

2085
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 12>They get rid of their anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you calm them down and what happens?</v>

2086
01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the next day they want to go out again.</v>

2087
01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.550
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's exactly what happens to the</v>

2088
01:48:20.551 --> 01:48:23.010
<v Speaker 12>Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So he's all shorted out by his encounter</v>

2089
01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:25.200
<v Speaker 12>with death,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which is very little different than what</v>

2090
01:48:25.201 --> 01:48:29.820
<v Speaker 12>happens to Adam and eve runs back</v>
<v Speaker 12>recoveries for six months.</v>

2091
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:34.050
<v Speaker 12>He has posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He runs home and he recovers for six</v>

2092
01:48:34.051 --> 01:48:34.884
<v Speaker 12>months,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right</v>

2093
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 12>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 12>His anxiety lessened his curiosity,</v>

2094
01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:39.780
<v Speaker 12>grinny.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He ventured outside again.</v>

2095
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.980
<v Speaker 12>This time that God sent a sick man</v>
<v Speaker 12>interview this creature,</v>

2096
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:46.050
<v Speaker 12>he asked his attendance,</v>
<v Speaker 12>shaking and palsy,</v>

2097
01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:48.360
<v Speaker 12>horribly afflicted,</v>
<v Speaker 12>unbearable to behold,</v>

2098
01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:50.850
<v Speaker 12>a source of pity and contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What is he?</v>

2099
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.090
<v Speaker 12>And the attendant answered that's a man</v>
<v Speaker 12>like other men</v>

2100
01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 12>was born whole,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but who became ill and sick,</v>

2101
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:01.830
<v Speaker 12>unable to cope,</v>
<v Speaker 12>a burden to himself and others suffering</v>

2102
01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:04.650
<v Speaker 12>and incurable like other men,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you say,</v>

2103
01:49:04.651 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 12>inquired the prince.</v>
<v Speaker 12>This could happen to me and the</v>

2104
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:10.620
<v Speaker 12>attendant answers,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no man is exempt from the ravages of</v>

2105
01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 12>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Once again,</v>

2106
01:49:12.811 --> 01:49:15.270
<v Speaker 12>the world collapsed and Gautama returned</v>
<v Speaker 12>to his home,</v>

2107
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 12>but the delights of his previous life</v>
<v Speaker 12>were ashes in his mouth and he ventured</v>

2108
01:49:21.151 --> 01:49:25.080
<v Speaker 12>forth a third time,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the gods in their mercy sent him a dead</v>

2109
01:49:25.081 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 12>man in funeral procession.</v>
<v Speaker 12>This creature,</v>

2110
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:30.570
<v Speaker 12>he asked his attendant laying so still</v>
<v Speaker 12>appearing,</v>

2111
01:49:30.571 --> 01:49:34.170
<v Speaker 12>so fearsome,</v>
<v Speaker 12>surrounded by grief and by Soro last and</v>

2112
01:49:34.171 --> 01:49:35.460
<v Speaker 12>for Lauren.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What is he?</v>

2113
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 12>And the attendant answered that is a man</v>
<v Speaker 12>like other men,</v>

2114
01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.430
<v Speaker 12>born of woman,</v>
<v Speaker 12>beloved in hated.</v>

2115
01:49:41.431 --> 01:49:43.680
<v Speaker 12>Who is once you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Who once was you,</v>

2116
01:49:43.681 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 12>and now as the earth like other men you</v>
<v Speaker 12>say acquired prince,</v>

2117
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 11>then this could happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is your and said the attendant and</v>

2118
01:49:51.941 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 11>the end of all men.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

2119
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 11>that's the end of childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

2120
01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.080
<v Speaker 11>There's no going back after that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's like Pinocchio goes back.</v>

2121
01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.560
<v Speaker 11>There's no one home anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's there's nothing that your father</v>

2122
01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 11>can do to protect you from knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 11>death.</v>

2123
01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:09.970
<v Speaker 11>There is no returning to the childhood</v>
<v Speaker 11>unconsciousness because you're.</v>

2124
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:12.490
<v Speaker 11>You now know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and there's no going backwards.</v>

2125
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:14.830
<v Speaker 11>Suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's going backwards.</v>

2126
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:19.510
<v Speaker 11>That's how you replace your emergent</v>
<v Speaker 11>self consciousness with the old blissful</v>

2127
01:50:19.511 --> 01:50:22.960
<v Speaker 11>unconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's exactly what suicidal people</v>

2128
01:50:22.961 --> 01:50:27.730
<v Speaker 11>wish that are going to destroy their</v>
<v Speaker 11>painful selfconsciousness and make it</v>

2129
01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:32.460
<v Speaker 11>all go away.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The world collabs to final time and</v>

2130
01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.330
<v Speaker 11>Gautama asked to be returned home,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but the attendant had orders from the</v>

2131
01:50:36.331 --> 01:50:39.210
<v Speaker 11>prince's father and took them instead to</v>
<v Speaker 11>a festival of women.</v>

2132
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.931
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>curing.</v>

2133
01:50:39.931 --> 01:50:42.150
<v Speaker 11>Near occurring nearby in a grove in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>woods.</v>

2134
01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:46.140
<v Speaker 11>The prince was met by a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 11>assemblage who offered themselves freely</v>

2135
01:50:46.141 --> 01:50:50.100
<v Speaker 11>to him without restraint in song,</v>
<v Speaker 11>dance and play in the spirit of sensual</v>

2136
01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:52.950
<v Speaker 11>love,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but Gautama could think only of death</v>

2137
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:56.970
<v Speaker 11>and the inevitable decomposition of</v>
<v Speaker 11>beauty and took no pleasure in the</v>

2138
01:50:56.971 --> 01:50:57.804
<v Speaker 11>display.</v>

2139
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:03.600
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so you see the parallels between one</v>

2140
01:51:03.601 --> 01:51:05.490
<v Speaker 11>story and the other.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They're the same.</v>

2141
01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.640
<v Speaker 11>They have the same underlying structure,</v>
<v Speaker 11>initial paradise,</v>

2142
01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:11.040
<v Speaker 11>partly childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 11>partly unconsciousness.</v>

2143
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:16.050
<v Speaker 11>The emergence of knowledge of mortality</v>
<v Speaker 11>into that and the demolition of the of</v>

2144
01:51:16.051 --> 01:51:18.600
<v Speaker 11>the paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is the same story that we've been</v>

2145
01:51:18.601 --> 01:51:22.590
<v Speaker 11>talking about all along.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Ordered state collapse into chaos.</v>

2146
01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:25.080
<v Speaker 11>While the rest of the story is the</v>
<v Speaker 11>return,</v>

2147
01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:27.660
<v Speaker 11>like in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Bible is actually set up that way,</v>

2148
01:51:27.661 --> 01:51:31.230
<v Speaker 11>it's collapse into history and then</v>

2149
01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:34.020
<v Speaker 11>a movement upward.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The question is,</v>

2150
01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:36.570
<v Speaker 11>what's the movement upward?</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's the question here.</v>

2151
01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:41.880
<v Speaker 11>When the collapse is caused by knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 11>of mortality and self caught and the</v>

2152
01:51:41.881 --> 01:51:44.190
<v Speaker 11>emergence of self consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 11>knowledge of death,</v>

2153
01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:49.220
<v Speaker 11>is there any manner in which redemption</v>
<v Speaker 11>can be attained or is that the final</v>

2154
01:51:49.410 --> 01:51:50.820
<v Speaker 11>like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>is that finally,</v>

2155
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:53.160
<v Speaker 11>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Does that finally demolished you?</v>

2156
01:51:53.670 --> 01:51:55.880
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's the question and that's that's,</v>

2157
01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:01.100
<v Speaker 11>that's it's the answer to that question</v>
<v Speaker 11>that entire civilizations constantly</v>

2158
01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.770
<v Speaker 11>pursue and the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

2159
01:52:04.771 --> 01:52:08.820
<v Speaker 11>what is the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And part of the answer is identification</v>

2160
01:52:08.821 --> 01:52:12.390
<v Speaker 11>with this spirit that generates order</v>
<v Speaker 11>out of chaos.</v>

2161
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:15.140
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'll tell you a couple of strange things</v>

2162
01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.180
<v Speaker 11>that it thinks that I don't really</v>
<v Speaker 11>understand.</v>

2163
01:52:17.181 --> 01:52:20.390
<v Speaker 11>The first is when we've done the</v>
<v Speaker 11>analysis of the effects of the future</v>

2164
01:52:20.391 --> 01:52:23.600
<v Speaker 11>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it has had a different differential</v>

2165
01:52:23.601 --> 01:52:28.340
<v Speaker 11>impact on men and it's had a</v>
<v Speaker 11>particularly differential impact on what</v>

2166
01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:32.870
<v Speaker 11>I would call it excluded men and so that</v>
<v Speaker 11>would be non western ethic minority men</v>

2167
01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:38.080
<v Speaker 11>or or what majority of men who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 11>doing very well.</v>

2168
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:40.190
<v Speaker 11>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>at Mohawk College,</v>

2169
01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:44.750
<v Speaker 11>the future authoring program had a</v>
<v Speaker 11>particularly robust effect on Mohawk</v>

2170
01:52:44.751 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 11>college who are men who</v>

2171
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 5>hadn't done very well in high school and</v>
<v Speaker 5>who hadn't picked a major that had a</v>

2172
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:53.170
<v Speaker 5>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a career destination edits,</v>

2173
01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 5>and so you can imagine those people are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have an ambiguous relationship with</v>

2174
01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 5>the idea of education and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>oriented specifically towards a goal.</v>

2175
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:07.250
<v Speaker 5>They're not very motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now why did it have a differential</v>

2176
01:53:07.251 --> 01:53:09.800
<v Speaker 5>effect on men?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

2177
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.691
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2178
01:53:11.691 --> 01:53:15.320
<v Speaker 5>the women are doing better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it might just be a matter of the fact</v>

2179
01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:18.410
<v Speaker 5>that it does better for people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't doing as well and at the moment</v>

2180
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 5>most of them are men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe.</v>

2181
01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 5>I think that might be part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't believe that's all of it.</v>

2182
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 5>I think that part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 5>women are doing better is because</v>

2183
01:53:27.591 --> 01:53:31.970
<v Speaker 5>they're agreeable and so if a system</v>
<v Speaker 5>sets out a structure and says,</v>

2184
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.180
<v Speaker 5>here's a pathway to attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the women won't rebel against that.</v>

2185
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:37.610
<v Speaker 5>They'll go along with it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>working very well for them at the</v>

2186
01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:38.750
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The men,</v>

2187
01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:42.110
<v Speaker 5>especially the men on the disagreeable</v>
<v Speaker 5>end of the distribution and there's way</v>

2188
01:53:42.111 --> 01:53:45.020
<v Speaker 5>more men on the district disagreeable</v>
<v Speaker 5>end of the distribution.</v>

2189
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:46.370
<v Speaker 5>Then there are women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2190
01:53:46.371 --> 01:53:49.130
<v Speaker 5>That's what you get from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at overlapping normal</v>

2191
01:53:49.131 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 5>distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the male district,</v>

2192
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 5>female distribution for agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mail distribution for agreeableness.</v>

2193
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:57.920
<v Speaker 5>Tremendous overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2194
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 5>Women are higher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the really agreeable people are</v>

2195
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:02.780
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the really disagreeable people are</v>

2196
01:54:02.781 --> 01:54:06.020
<v Speaker 5>meant and maybe the real differences</v>
<v Speaker 5>occur at the extremes,</v>

2197
01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:06.943
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2198
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.840
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

2199
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.170
<v Speaker 5>it's a very interesting side effect of</v>
<v Speaker 5>overlapping distributions so people can</v>

2200
01:54:12.171 --> 01:54:15.890
<v Speaker 5>be mostly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that can still produce radical</v>

2201
01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 5>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Disagreeable men won't do anything they</v>

2202
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 5>don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just say,</v>

2203
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:25.110
<v Speaker 5>up yours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go home and play video games with</v>

2204
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:25.300
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2205
01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm not listening to your stupid classes</v>
<v Speaker 5>and why should I work for you?</v>

2206
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 5>I'll just go have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do my own thing.</v>

2207
01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then if you take the men who are</v>

2208
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:37.610
<v Speaker 5>like that and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2209
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:40.460
<v Speaker 5>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can have what you want,</v>

2210
01:54:40.461 --> 01:54:43.270
<v Speaker 5>but you have figured out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then they write down what they want</v>

2211
01:54:43.271 --> 01:54:44.104
<v Speaker 5>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh hey,</v>

2212
01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:46.910
<v Speaker 5>well that might be worth having.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe I'll put some effort into it.</v>

2213
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:49.310
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2214
01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's weak evidence and this is a weak</v>

2215
01:54:52.191 --> 01:54:54.680
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm trying to stretch out my</v>

2216
01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 5>understanding to account for this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'll tell you something else that's</v>

2217
01:54:57.141 --> 01:54:59.240
<v Speaker 5>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand this either.</v>

2218
01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:04.220
<v Speaker 5>So more than 90 percent of the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who watch my videos on youtube are men.</v>

2219
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Now that's weird because now about 80</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of psychology students are</v>

2220
01:55:08.421 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that is not what you would expect,</v>

2221
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:13.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would expect that the majority of</v>

2222
01:55:13.461 --> 01:55:14.990
<v Speaker 5>them would be women and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2223
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:17.420
<v Speaker 5>it's because of the political stance</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've taken and I thought,</v>

2224
01:55:17.421 --> 01:55:19.880
<v Speaker 5>well that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I went and looked at the demographic</v>

2225
01:55:19.881 --> 01:55:23.150
<v Speaker 5>data because I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well before I did any of the political</v>

2226
01:55:23.151 --> 01:55:25.700
<v Speaker 5>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>85 percent of my viewers were men,</v>

2227
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:30.320
<v Speaker 5>so it's actually increased a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's increased by six percent and that's</v>

2228
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 5>not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was still overwhelmingly men.</v>

2229
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 5>So that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

2230
01:55:35.901 --> 01:55:37.040
<v Speaker 5>what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is that?</v>

2231
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then now I've been watching crowds</v>

2232
01:55:39.981 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 5>when I've been talking to them and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>crowds that have come to see me in</v>

2233
01:55:43.711 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This happened at the University of</v>

2234
01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:49.470
<v Speaker 5>Toronto Free Speech Debate and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually noticed it and commented on it</v>

2235
01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:52.590
<v Speaker 5>before the debate took place because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was talking about intrinsic differences</v>

2236
01:55:52.591 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 5>between men and women and I looked</v>
<v Speaker 5>around the room and I thought,</v>

2237
01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:57.420
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>80 percent of the people in this room</v>

2238
01:55:57.421 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 5>are men.</v>

2239
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 5>So I had all the men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women and women stand up and then all</v>

2240
01:56:00.781 --> 01:56:01.830
<v Speaker 5>the men stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2241
01:56:01.831 --> 01:56:05.460
<v Speaker 5>look like here's a natural experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For some reason,</v>

2242
01:56:05.461 --> 01:56:07.770
<v Speaker 5>80 percent of the people who showed up</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this are men now.</v>

2243
01:56:07.771 --> 01:56:11.550
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do that and it was a risk,</v>

2244
01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:13.740
<v Speaker 5>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2245
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:17.130
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what's interesting now is that</v>

2246
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 5>every public appearance that I've made</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's related to the sort of topics</v>

2247
01:56:21.181 --> 01:56:23.460
<v Speaker 5>that we're discussing is overwhelmingly</v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

2248
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:27.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's like 85 to 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I thought,</v>

2249
01:56:27.421 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's weird.</v>

2250
01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Like what the Hell's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2251
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing I've noticed is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I've been talking a lot to the</v>

2252
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:36.960
<v Speaker 5>crowds that I've been talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not about rights but about</v>

2253
01:56:36.961 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 5>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2254
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.260
<v Speaker 5>Because you can't have the bloody</v>
<v Speaker 5>converse.</v>

2255
01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:42.570
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't have the conversation about</v>

2256
01:56:42.571 --> 01:56:47.040
<v Speaker 5>rights without the conversation about</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility because your rights are</v>

2257
01:56:47.041 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 5>my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they are technically.</v>

2258
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:55.130
<v Speaker 5>So you just can't have only half of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion and we're only having half</v>

2259
01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:56.940
<v Speaker 5>that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

2260
01:56:56.941 --> 01:56:58.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell are you leaving out?</v>

2261
01:56:59.070 --> 01:57:02.580
<v Speaker 5>If you only have that half of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion and the answer is,</v>

2262
01:57:02.581 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're leaving out responsibility and</v>

2263
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:05.880
<v Speaker 5>then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2264
01:57:05.881 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 5>what are you leaving out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're leaving out responsibility and</v>

2265
01:57:08.641 --> 01:57:09.870
<v Speaker 5>that answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2266
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're leaving out the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2267
01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.340
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2268
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.630
<v Speaker 5>here you are suffering away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What makes it worthwhile?</v>

2269
01:57:18.930 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 5>Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're completely,</v>

2270
01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:23.010
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're completely.</v>

2271
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:28.310
<v Speaker 5>You have no idea what you're you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost impossible to describe how</v>

2272
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 5>bad an idea that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Responsibility.</v>

2273
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 5>That's what gives life meaning.</v>

2274
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like lift a load.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you can tolerate yourself,</v>

2275
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:41.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because look at your useless,</v>

2276
01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:44.310
<v Speaker 5>easily hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>easily killed.</v>

2277
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Why should you have any self respect?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the story of the fall.</v>

2278
01:57:48.690 --> 01:57:50.510
<v Speaker 5>Pick something up and carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pick.</v>

2279
01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.290
<v Speaker 5>Make it heavy enough so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

2280
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:54.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well useless as I am.</v>

2281
01:57:54.691 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 5>At least I could move that from there to</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2282
01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.130
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's really cool about that is that</v>

2283
01:57:59.131 --> 01:58:04.131
<v Speaker 5>when I talk to these crowds about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the man's eyes light up and that's very</v>

2284
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:06.420
<v Speaker 5>like I've seen that phenomena because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been talking about this</v>

2285
01:58:06.421 --> 01:58:09.090
<v Speaker 5>mythological material for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can see what I'm watching.</v>

2286
01:58:09.091 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 5>Crowds people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their eyebrows lift,</v>

2287
01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:14.970
<v Speaker 5>their eyes light up because I put</v>
<v Speaker 5>something together for them,</v>

2288
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:18.570
<v Speaker 5>not what mythological stories do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not taking responsibility for</v>

2289
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:20.070
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the stories do.</v>

2290
01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:21.720
<v Speaker 5>So I say this story to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go click,</v>

2291
01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:22.554
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click.</v>

2292
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:25.680
<v Speaker 5>You know when their eyes light up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this responsibility thing that's a</v>

2293
01:58:25.681 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 5>whole new order of this is that young</v>
<v Speaker 5>men are so hungry for that.</v>

2294
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:32.370
<v Speaker 5>It is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things I've been talking</v>

2295
01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:36.480
<v Speaker 5>to some of the people who've been</v>
<v Speaker 5>running for the conservative leadership</v>

2296
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 5>in Canada and I've been talking to them</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

2297
01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:40.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the difficulties they have</v>

2298
01:58:40.471 --> 01:58:42.760
<v Speaker 5>communicating with young people because</v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives,</v>

2299
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 5>what the hell are they going to sell to</v>
<v Speaker 5>young people,</v>

2300
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:46.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because being conservative is something</v>

2301
01:58:46.421 --> 01:58:49.240
<v Speaker 5>that happens when you're older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can sell responsibility.</v>

2302
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:52.360
<v Speaker 5>No one's selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>

2303
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 5>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing but responsibility.</v>

2304
01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:57.250
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was watching the simpsons the other</v>

2305
01:58:57.251 --> 01:58:59.830
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched the simpsons episode and I</v>

2306
01:58:59.831 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 5>deconstructed it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it's really interesting.</v>

2307
01:59:02.771 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 5>So what happens in the first Simpson</v>
<v Speaker 5>episode is that it's Christmas and homer</v>

2308
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 5>and marge are going to buy some</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christmas presents,</v>

2309
01:59:09.281 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 5>but homer doesn't get his Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 5>bonus.</v>

2310
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 5>And so it was absolutely crushed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2311
01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:18.190
<v Speaker 5>And that actually is a recurring theme</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the simpsons where homer loses his</v>

2312
01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:20.440
<v Speaker 5>job or something like that or can't make</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough money.</v>

2313
01:59:20.530 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 5>He's completely crushed even though he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of useless,</v>

2314
01:59:23.111 --> 01:59:24.730
<v Speaker 5>bumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>laughing,</v>

2315
01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:26.710
<v Speaker 5>full of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2316
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 5>The thing that gives that show its soul</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that he still oriented towards his</v>

2317
01:59:30.431 --> 01:59:31.990
<v Speaker 5>family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes them honorable,</v>

2318
01:59:31.991 --> 01:59:36.730
<v Speaker 5>is that foolish as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's decided to adopt responsibility for</v>

2319
01:59:36.731 --> 01:59:39.760
<v Speaker 5>his family and to try to bear that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he's not.</v>

2320
01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:41.770
<v Speaker 5>He's a holy fool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not a complete fool.</v>

2321
01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:45.700
<v Speaker 5>And so interesting watching the story</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he suffers dreadfully as a</v>

2322
01:59:45.701 --> 01:59:48.700
<v Speaker 5>consequence of not being able to fulfill</v>
<v Speaker 5>this responsibility.</v>

2323
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for men.</v>

2324
01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:52.840
<v Speaker 5>Women have their sets of</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibilities.</v>

2325
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.240
<v Speaker 5>They're not the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2326
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:58.690
<v Speaker 5>because they're complicated because</v>
<v Speaker 5>women of course have to take primary</v>

2327
01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:01.810
<v Speaker 5>responsibility for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for having infants at least,</v>

2328
02:00:01.811 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 5>but then also for caring for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're.</v>

2329
02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.290
<v Speaker 5>They're structured differently than men</v>
<v Speaker 5>for biological necessity,</v>

2330
02:00:08.291 --> 02:00:11.620
<v Speaker 5>even if it's not a psychological issue</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's also partly a psychological</v>

2331
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:13.960
<v Speaker 5>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Women know what they have to do.</v>

2332
02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:18.910
<v Speaker 5>Men have to figure out what they have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do and if they have nothing worth living</v>

2333
02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:22.690
<v Speaker 5>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not</v>

2334
02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:28.660
<v Speaker 5>because the alternative to valued</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility is</v>

2335
02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:33.130
<v Speaker 5>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low class pleasure,</v>

2336
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.560
<v Speaker 5>and you saw that in the Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2337
02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:37.240
<v Speaker 5>That's pleasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2338
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why lift the load if there's nothing in</v>

2339
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 5>it for you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing that we're doing to</v>

2340
02:00:42.131 --> 02:00:44.530
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very bad idea and two boys,</v>

2341
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.740
<v Speaker 5>so like your pathological and</v>
<v Speaker 5>oppressive.</v>

2342
02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:48.521
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

2343
02:00:48.521 --> 02:00:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Then why the hell am I going to play if</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the.</v>

2344
02:00:50.631 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 5>If that's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I get no credit for bearing</v>

2345
02:00:53.441 --> 02:00:55.960
<v Speaker 5>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can bloody well be sure I'm not</v>

2346
02:00:55.961 --> 02:00:58.690
<v Speaker 5>going to bear it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you know your life is useless</v>

2347
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:01.810
<v Speaker 5>and meaningless and you have your full</v>
<v Speaker 5>of self contempt,</v>

2348
02:01:01.811 --> 02:01:04.360
<v Speaker 5>denialism and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's not good.</v>

2349
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:08.740
<v Speaker 5>And so that's why I think that's what I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think is going on at a deeper level with</v>

2350
02:01:08.741 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 5>regards to men needing this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A man has to decide that he's going to</v>

2351
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 5>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has to decide that,</v>

2352
02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:16.421
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2353
02:01:16.421 --> 02:01:19.420
<v Speaker 5>you know partly what you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the future authoring process to say,</v>

2354
02:01:19.421 --> 02:01:20.770
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what's your highest value?</v>

2355
02:01:21.610 --> 02:01:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the star.</v>

2356
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:23.650
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2357
02:01:23.650 --> 02:01:26.470
<v Speaker 5>what are you aiming for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can decide man,</v>

2358
02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:29.590
<v Speaker 5>but you know there is some criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be good for you.</v>

2359
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:33.760
<v Speaker 5>It should be good for you in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 5>facilitates your moving forward.</v>

2360
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it should be good for you in a way</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's also good for the family and the</v>

2361
02:01:36.731 --> 02:01:38.940
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should cover the,</v>

2362
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:44.060
<v Speaker 5>the domain of life mean there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>constraints on what you should regard as</v>

2363
02:01:44.061 --> 02:01:45.570
<v Speaker 5>a value,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you.</v>

2364
02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 5>But within those constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the choice.</v>

2365
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:51.890
<v Speaker 5>You have choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2366
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:55.420
<v Speaker 5>the thing is is that people will carry a</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy load if they get to pick the god</v>

2367
02:01:55.421 --> 02:01:58.580
<v Speaker 5>damn load so and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2368
02:01:58.581 --> 02:01:59.870
<v Speaker 5>I won't carry any load.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2369
02:01:59.871 --> 02:02:00.561
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

2370
02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:02.780
<v Speaker 5>but then you're like the sled dog that</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have a sled.</v>

2371
02:02:02.781 --> 02:02:03.710
<v Speaker 5>Depaul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just gonna.</v>

2372
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:07.640
<v Speaker 5>You're in a terror pieces out of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>own legs because you're bored,</v>

2373
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:10.490
<v Speaker 5>you know you need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are pack animals.</v>

2374
02:02:10.491 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 5>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to pull against a weight and</v>

2375
02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:16.040
<v Speaker 5>that's not true for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not true.</v>

2376
02:02:16.041 --> 02:02:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Particularly say for low conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2377
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:21.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe they're open and creative</v>
<v Speaker 5>are extroverted and some other things,</v>

2378
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:24.020
<v Speaker 5>but for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the typical person,</v>

2379
02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:25.913
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2380
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.820
<v Speaker 5>they'll eat themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll eat themselves up unless they</v>

2381
02:02:28.821 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 5>have a load.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why there's such an opiod</v>

2382
02:02:30.591 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 5>epidemic among a dispossessed white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle aged guys who are unemployed in</v>

2383
02:02:34.911 --> 02:02:35.744
<v Speaker 5>the US.</v>

2384
02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:39.050
<v Speaker 5>So like they lose their job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're done right?</v>

2385
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 5>They despise themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they develop chronic pain syndromes and</v>

2386
02:02:42.921 --> 02:02:45.770
<v Speaker 5>depression and the chronic pain is</v>
<v Speaker 5>treated with opiates.</v>

2387
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:49.550
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2388
02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:52.430
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looks like to me is you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to.</v>

2389
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:55.280
<v Speaker 5>And it's so interesting to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 5>young men when you talk to them about</v>

2390
02:02:55.281 --> 02:02:57.410
<v Speaker 5>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a God damn thrilled about it.</v>

2391
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:59.170
<v Speaker 5>It just blows me away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2392
02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:01.070
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's.</v>

2393
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:06.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grow the hell up and do something</v>

2394
02:03:06.171 --> 02:03:07.070
<v Speaker 5>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2395
02:03:07.071 --> 02:03:07.910
<v Speaker 5>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2396
02:03:07.911 --> 02:03:11.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm so excited by that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one ever mentioned that before.</v>

2397
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.800
<v Speaker 5>It's like rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>

2398
02:03:12.801 --> 02:03:13.700
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>

2399
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:14.800
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2400
02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's appalling.</v>

2401
02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.940
<v Speaker 5>It's an end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel that that's deeply felt by</v>

2402
02:03:19.941 --> 02:03:23.870
<v Speaker 5>the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are coming out to to listen to these</v>

2403
02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:24.920
<v Speaker 5>sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to there.</v>

2404
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:29.690
<v Speaker 5>They've had enough of that so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they better have because it's a non</v>

2405
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:32.270
<v Speaker 5>productive motive being responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2406
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:35.090
<v Speaker 5>That's where the meaning in life is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2407
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:48.790
<v Speaker 7>the most fundamental element,</v>
<v Speaker 7>creativity is actually conceptualized as</v>

2408
02:03:49.241 --> 02:03:54.241
<v Speaker 7>a biological trait.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Different personalities.</v>

2409
02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.090
<v Speaker 7>We all know our terminology for</v>
<v Speaker 7>describing those personalities is broad</v>

2410
02:03:59.091 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 7>and somewhat difficult to categorize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but psychologists progress</v>

2411
02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:07.780
<v Speaker 7>in the last 40 years pretty from the</v>
<v Speaker 7>strictest scientific perspective.</v>

2412
02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:10.580
<v Speaker 7>And they know that people differ in</v>
<v Speaker 7>extroversion,</v>

2413
02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.970
<v Speaker 7>extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gregarious,</v>

2414
02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:17.820
<v Speaker 7>and enthusiastic and assert.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so they seem to wind their way</v>

2415
02:04:17.821 --> 02:04:21.730
<v Speaker 7>through the world by utilizing social</v>
<v Speaker 7>capital and social networks.</v>

2416
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:26.330
<v Speaker 7>Extroverts don't necessarily like you</v>
<v Speaker 7>and creative people.</v>

2417
02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Extroverts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well create creative people is slightly</v>

2418
02:04:31.381 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 5>tilted towards extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not the fundamental dimension</v>

2419
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:36.540
<v Speaker 5>of introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People like to spend time alone and</v>

2420
02:04:36.541 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>there's plenty creative introverted</v>

2421
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.280
<v Speaker 14>people,</v>
<v Speaker 14>um,</v>

2422
02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:43.740
<v Speaker 14>that another personality dimension is</v>
<v Speaker 14>known as neuroticism,</v>

2423
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 14>somewhat unflatteringly,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and it's,</v>

2424
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:50.220
<v Speaker 14>it's an index of sensitivity to negative</v>
<v Speaker 14>emotion so that if people,</v>

2425
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:53.400
<v Speaker 14>if you know people who are volatile,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know they're touchy and they tend to</v>

2426
02:04:53.401 --> 02:04:58.230
<v Speaker 14>fly off the handle,</v>
<v Speaker 14>or they're a or they're sad or morose or</v>

2427
02:04:58.231 --> 02:05:02.070
<v Speaker 14>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 14>or tend to avoid stressful situations,</v>

2428
02:05:02.071 --> 02:05:04.080
<v Speaker 14>then they tend to be higher in trait</v>
<v Speaker 14>neuroticism.</v>

2429
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 14>And that's specifically a negative</v>
<v Speaker 14>emotion dimension.</v>

2430
02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 14>Extroversion is an index of positive</v>
<v Speaker 14>emotion.</v>

2431
02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.430
<v Speaker 14>And so people,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they're separate biological systems,</v>

2432
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:15.870
<v Speaker 14>positive and negative from them trying</v>
<v Speaker 14>to get back to creativity or the third.</v>

2433
02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.680
<v Speaker 14>The third category is agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Agreeable people are compassionate and</v>

2434
02:05:19.681 --> 02:05:21.390
<v Speaker 14>they basically live for,</v>
<v Speaker 14>for close,</v>

2435
02:05:21.391 --> 02:05:22.980
<v Speaker 14>intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 14>personal relationships.</v>

2436
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.410
<v Speaker 14>There's conscientious people who are due</v>
<v Speaker 14>to full.</v>

2437
02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:28.950
<v Speaker 14>And then there are open people and the</v>
<v Speaker 14>open people,</v>

2438
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 14>it's the dimension is called openness to</v>
<v Speaker 14>experience.</v>

2439
02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:35.040
<v Speaker 14>There are people who are fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 14>interested in ideas,</v>

2440
02:05:35.041 --> 02:05:38.360
<v Speaker 14>so if you're talking to an open person,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they will immediately move the</v>

2441
02:05:39.010 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 14>conversation to to the discussion of</v>
<v Speaker 14>ideas.</v>

2442
02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 14>So most of the people in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 14>tonight,</v>

2443
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 14>for those who aren't here for political</v>
<v Speaker 14>curiosity are here because they're open</v>

2444
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 14>people,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they want to,</v>

2445
02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:51.930
<v Speaker 14>they want to hear an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 14>discussion and and so open people are</v>

2446
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 14>interested in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 14>That's the intellect component of</v>

2447
02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:57.690
<v Speaker 14>openness and then they're also</v>
<v Speaker 14>interested in aesthetics and that would</v>

2448
02:05:57.691 --> 02:06:01.770
<v Speaker 14>be where the artists really intellect</v>
<v Speaker 14>and aesthetics is where the artists come</v>

2449
02:06:01.771 --> 02:06:04.460
<v Speaker 14>out and that was the thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 14>important to know about that and it's</v>

2450
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:07.350
<v Speaker 14>why I went through all five traits.</v>
<v Speaker 14>These are fundamentally,</v>

2451
02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:10.230
<v Speaker 14>these are attributes and ways of looking</v>
<v Speaker 14>at the world,</v>

2452
02:06:10.231 --> 02:06:13.260
<v Speaker 14>ways of behaving that are fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 14>rooted in biology.</v>

2453
02:06:13.261 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 14>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 14>very deep.</v>

2454
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:19.350
<v Speaker 14>It's not a surface trait by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 14>of the imagination and creative people</v>

2455
02:06:19.351 --> 02:06:22.180
<v Speaker 14>also tend to be a higher in,</v>
<v Speaker 14>in,</v>

2456
02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:25.280
<v Speaker 14>in trade intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 14>technically speaking,</v>

2457
02:06:25.281 --> 02:06:28.680
<v Speaker 14>and that's the ability to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 14>abstractions rapidly.</v>

2458
02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:30.840
<v Speaker 14>So is creativity is sort of second</v>
<v Speaker 14>level.</v>

2459
02:06:30.841 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 14>Then comes the,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the,</v>

2460
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.191
<v Speaker 14>the,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

2461
02:06:32.191 --> 02:06:34.800
<v Speaker 14>the traits that you've just described,</v>
<v Speaker 14>don't include them.</v>

2462
02:06:34.801 --> 02:06:37.380
<v Speaker 14>Where are they in that group?</v>
<v Speaker 14>While creativity,</v>

2463
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:39.690
<v Speaker 14>creativity loads very highly with</v>
<v Speaker 14>openness.</v>

2464
02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:42.510
<v Speaker 14>It,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's getting idiot create creativity and</v>

2465
02:06:42.511 --> 02:06:45.630
<v Speaker 14>openness are probably synonymous more or</v>
<v Speaker 14>less,</v>

2466
02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:50.631
<v Speaker 14>although it isn't obvious that interest</v>
<v Speaker 14>in ideas per se is the same as</v>

2467
02:06:51.451 --> 02:06:53.700
<v Speaker 14>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but there's very few people who are</v>

2468
02:06:53.701 --> 02:06:55.550
<v Speaker 14>artistic who aren't very interested in</v>
<v Speaker 14>ideas.</v>

2469
02:06:55.551 --> 02:06:57.570
<v Speaker 14>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they move along the same path very</v>

2470
02:06:57.571 --> 02:07:00.760
<v Speaker 14>tightly.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So let's unpack this notion because you</v>

2471
02:07:00.761 --> 02:07:03.840
<v Speaker 14>know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's axiomatic that creativity and art</v>

2472
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:07.950
<v Speaker 14>are a indistinguishable.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Is that true from the point of view of a</v>

2473
02:07:07.951 --> 02:07:09.800
<v Speaker 14>psychologist?</v>
<v Speaker 14>I would say it's,</v>

2474
02:07:09.801 --> 02:07:10.500
<v Speaker 14>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's,</v>

2475
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.930
<v Speaker 14>it's a pretty decent,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's a pretty decent truth.</v>

2476
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:15.270
<v Speaker 14>It's open.</v>
<v Speaker 14>People are the ones that are interested</v>

2477
02:07:15.271 --> 02:07:17.190
<v Speaker 14>in aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So you know,</v>

2478
02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.220
<v Speaker 14>there are lots of people who are in some</v>
<v Speaker 14>sense blind too,</v>

2479
02:07:20.221 --> 02:07:22.860
<v Speaker 14>but it's actually one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 14>distinguishes,</v>

2480
02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:25.110
<v Speaker 14>strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it distinguishes conservatives and</v>

2481
02:07:25.111 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 14>liberals roughly speaking because</v>
<v Speaker 14>liberal liberal people tend to be high</v>

2482
02:07:30.091 --> 02:07:30.924
<v Speaker 14>in openness.</v>

2483
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 14>They tend to be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but they're low in trait</v>

2484
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 14>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So they're not very beautiful.</v>

2485
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:37.690
<v Speaker 14>They're not orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they're not particularly industrious,</v>

2486
02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:39.280
<v Speaker 14>not,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not compared to conservatives,</v>

2487
02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.590
<v Speaker 14>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yes and well,</v>

2488
02:07:41.591 --> 02:07:44.440
<v Speaker 14>it's partly because you see this is one</v>
<v Speaker 14>of the paradoxes.</v>

2489
02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.410
<v Speaker 14>Conservatives are high in</v>
<v Speaker 14>conscientiousness,</v>

2490
02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 14>especially orderliness and they're low</v>
<v Speaker 14>in openness.</v>

2491
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:53.560
<v Speaker 14>And I think the reason for that in part</v>
<v Speaker 14>is that it's not that easy to be</v>

2492
02:07:53.561 --> 02:07:55.810
<v Speaker 14>creative if you're too industrious or</v>
<v Speaker 14>orderly.</v>

2493
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 14>Because imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 14>imagine you want to be a musician and</v>

2494
02:07:58.571 --> 02:08:00.460
<v Speaker 14>you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 14>19 years old or worse,</v>

2495
02:08:00.461 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 14>25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you know?</v>

2496
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the thing is is that it's an insane</v>

2497
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:10.270
<v Speaker 14>thing to do if you,</v>
<v Speaker 14>if you're someone who's dutiful and</v>

2498
02:08:10.271 --> 02:08:13.420
<v Speaker 14>career oriented and practical because</v>
<v Speaker 14>the probability that you're going to</v>

2499
02:08:13.421 --> 02:08:17.860
<v Speaker 14>monetize your creativity is so low that</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's futile to even attempt it in many</v>

2500
02:08:17.861 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 14>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And so if you're too concerned with</v>

2501
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 14>convention and,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and productivity,</v>

2502
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:26.800
<v Speaker 14>then that's going to undercut your</v>
<v Speaker 14>ability to,</v>

2503
02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 14>to,</v>
<v Speaker 14>to manifest adherence to your creative</v>

2504
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:31.480
<v Speaker 14>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 14>which also takes you and all sorts of</v>

2505
02:08:31.481 --> 02:08:34.060
<v Speaker 14>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 14>none of which are necessarily practical.</v>

2506
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:37.830
<v Speaker 14>So one of the ways of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 14>creativity is that it's,</v>

2507
02:08:38.050 --> 02:08:42.340
<v Speaker 14>it's a gambling strategy and,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and conservatives make low risk,</v>

2508
02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.340
<v Speaker 14>low return,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but certain bets really.</v>

2509
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:48.130
<v Speaker 14>And whereas the more liberal types and</v>
<v Speaker 14>the more creative types,</v>

2510
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:50.470
<v Speaker 14>they make high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 14>high return bits.</v>

2511
02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:53.950
<v Speaker 14>And so almost all of them fail,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but those who succeed succeed</v>

2512
02:08:53.951 --> 02:08:56.530
<v Speaker 14>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And they also changed the world.</v>

2513
02:08:56.950 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 14>And so although it's very foolish to be</v>
<v Speaker 14>creative,</v>

2514
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:03.940
<v Speaker 14>it's creative people who,</v>
<v Speaker 14>who lead the vanguard for forward into</v>

2515
02:09:03.941 --> 02:09:06.940
<v Speaker 14>the unknown and transform the world.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So foolish as it is,</v>

2516
02:09:06.941 --> 02:09:09.550
<v Speaker 14>it's absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Foolish because risky.</v>

2517
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.690
<v Speaker 14>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 14>because risky.</v>

2518
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:13.060
<v Speaker 14>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I mean it's risk.</v>

2519
02:09:13.061 --> 02:09:15.070
<v Speaker 14>It's foolish in the same way that a high</v>
<v Speaker 14>risk,</v>

2520
02:09:15.071 --> 02:09:18.130
<v Speaker 14>high return bet is foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 14>There's a high probability that you'll</v>

2521
02:09:18.131 --> 02:09:20.590
<v Speaker 14>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And so if you're a conservative person,</v>

2522
02:09:20.591 --> 02:09:22.390
<v Speaker 14>you're very concerned about hedging your</v>
<v Speaker 14>bets.</v>

2523
02:09:22.391 --> 02:09:25.330
<v Speaker 14>You don't want to lose being creative as</v>
<v Speaker 14>a very bad game to play,</v>

2524
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.810
<v Speaker 14>but you won't play it anyways because</v>
<v Speaker 14>you're conservative so it isn't going to</v>

2525
02:09:27.811 --> 02:09:28.644
<v Speaker 14>matter.</v>

2526
02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:32.050
<v Speaker 14>So you are a,</v>
<v Speaker 14>an open,</v>

2527
02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:37.060
<v Speaker 14>a late teen and you have conservative</v>
<v Speaker 14>parents and you say,</v>

2528
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:38.020
<v Speaker 14>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 14>Dad,</v>

2529
02:09:38.021 --> 02:09:39.910
<v Speaker 14>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I think I've decided that I'm going to</v>

2530
02:09:39.911 --> 02:09:43.260
<v Speaker 14>be an artist and they think what's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 14>with that kid that the death.</v>

2531
02:09:43.261 --> 02:09:45.070
<v Speaker 14>A complicated conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 14>isn't it?</v>

2532
02:09:45.071 --> 02:09:45.821
<v Speaker 14>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yes,</v>

2533
02:09:45.821 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 14>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's,</v>

2534
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 14>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's like discussing color with someone</v>

2535
02:09:48.491 --> 02:09:52.030
<v Speaker 14>who's colorblind and,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and I mean that like it's actually a</v>

2536
02:09:52.031 --> 02:09:55.030
<v Speaker 14>perverse things about perverse thing</v>
<v Speaker 14>about conservatives in some sense</v>

2537
02:09:55.031 --> 02:09:58.870
<v Speaker 14>because the data on the economic utility</v>
<v Speaker 14>of artists is really,</v>

2538
02:09:58.871 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 14>really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I mean artists,</v>

2539
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:03.640
<v Speaker 14>artists and entrepreneurs are the same</v>
<v Speaker 14>people and of course entrepreneurs are</v>

2540
02:10:03.641 --> 02:10:07.780
<v Speaker 14>the people who provide all of the vision</v>
<v Speaker 14>for the entire capitalist system.</v>

2541
02:10:07.781 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 14>They're absolutely necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but conservatives tend to be so blind to</v>

2542
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:14.860
<v Speaker 14>art that they can't even see that the</v>
<v Speaker 14>artists are the people who drive the who</v>

2543
02:10:14.861 --> 02:10:16.210
<v Speaker 14>drive the economy forward.</v>

2544
02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.270
<v Speaker 14>But you make them sound so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>

2545
02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:20.590
<v Speaker 14>there you lord.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So here's,</v>

2546
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:23.710
<v Speaker 14>here's another way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 14>as we're talking about political,</v>

2547
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:25.740
<v Speaker 14>conservative political liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yes,</v>

2548
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 14>they're also talking about trait,</v>
<v Speaker 14>like personality traits,</v>

2549
02:10:28.631 --> 02:10:30.550
<v Speaker 14>determined voting patterns to a great</v>
<v Speaker 14>degree.</v>

2550
02:10:30.551 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 14>So people vote their temperaments and</v>
<v Speaker 14>this is something that's useful to</v>

2551
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 14>understand when you're engaged in a</v>
<v Speaker 14>political discussion is that the person</v>

2552
02:10:37.701 --> 02:10:41.480
<v Speaker 14>across the table from you who holds</v>
<v Speaker 14>viewpoints other than yours is not doing</v>

2553
02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:43.280
<v Speaker 14>it because they're stupid or ill</v>
<v Speaker 14>informed.</v>

2554
02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.280
<v Speaker 14>They're doing it because they are not</v>
<v Speaker 14>the same sort of person you are.</v>

2555
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:50.750
<v Speaker 14>And the the funny thing about about</v>
<v Speaker 14>creative people versus conservative</v>

2556
02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:54.530
<v Speaker 14>people say are liberal people versus</v>
<v Speaker 14>conservative people is that liberal</v>

2557
02:10:54.531 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 14>start companies and conservatives run</v>
<v Speaker 14>them.</v>

2558
02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:02.350
<v Speaker 14>So and I'm really glad to know you need</v>
<v Speaker 14>to conserve their managers like</v>

2559
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:06.140
<v Speaker 14>conscientious people make good managers</v>
<v Speaker 14>and good administrators.</v>

2560
02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:10.130
<v Speaker 14>It's and they tend to do better in</v>
<v Speaker 14>school too because diligence and due to</v>

2561
02:11:10.131 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 14>fullness is an excellent predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 14>academic performance.</v>

2562
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:16.070
<v Speaker 14>So if you want something,</v>
<v Speaker 14>if you want something that's already</v>

2563
02:11:16.071 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 14>been invented,</v>
<v Speaker 14>implemented,</v>

2564
02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:22.580
<v Speaker 14>and then turned into a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you don't get someone creative to do</v>

2565
02:11:22.581 --> 02:11:24.080
<v Speaker 14>that.</v>
<v Speaker 14>They're off to do the next thing.</v>

2566
02:11:24.081 --> 02:11:26.480
<v Speaker 14>They're not even interested in that</v>
<v Speaker 14>you'll bore them to death.</v>

2567
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:28.690
<v Speaker 14>So,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

2568
02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:32.750
<v Speaker 14>so let's say you're an employer and you</v>
<v Speaker 14>need some creative people.</v>

2569
02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:37.310
<v Speaker 14>They're a psychometric test to find out</v>
<v Speaker 14>if someone's actually creative and</v>

2570
02:11:37.311 --> 02:11:38.180
<v Speaker 14>they're going to be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>

2571
02:11:38.181 --> 02:11:39.710
<v Speaker 14>Iq tests work.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I mean,</v>

2572
02:11:39.711 --> 02:11:41.840
<v Speaker 14>not,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not everyone with a high Iq is creative.</v>

2573
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 14>Lots of lawyers have high Iq and they</v>
<v Speaker 14>tend not to be creative at all.</v>

2574
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:47.860
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you think to think about why that is a.</v>

2575
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:50.090
<v Speaker 14>because lawyers are bound by precedent</v>
<v Speaker 14>and,</v>

2576
02:11:50.091 --> 02:11:53.030
<v Speaker 14>and rules and so that isn't the same as</v>
<v Speaker 14>being creative.</v>

2577
02:11:53.150 --> 02:11:55.250
<v Speaker 14>And you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you want a creative accountant?</v>

2578
02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.810
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not really.</v>

2579
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:59.780
<v Speaker 14>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not unless you're looking for a jail</v>

2580
02:11:59.781 --> 02:12:03.590
<v Speaker 14>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So they don't like that word at all.</v>

2581
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.260
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>no.</v>

2582
02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:04.850
<v Speaker 14>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Yeah,</v>

2583
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:07.240
<v Speaker 14>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 14>My creative accountant wake.</v>

2584
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:08.640
<v Speaker 14>Wake right.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It's so,</v>

2585
02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:10.820
<v Speaker 14>so,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so.</v>

2586
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:11.960
<v Speaker 14>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I tested,</v>

2587
02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:16.270
<v Speaker 14>I tested psychometrically tested 100</v>
<v Speaker 14>most creative lawyers in Canada as,</v>

2588
02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:19.820
<v Speaker 14>as a project about 15 years ago with a</v>
<v Speaker 14>magazine called expert,</v>

2589
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:22.280
<v Speaker 14>which was a high prestige magazine among</v>
<v Speaker 14>lawyers.</v>

2590
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:26.930
<v Speaker 14>We had lawyers from across the country</v>
<v Speaker 14>be nominated for their by their firms,</v>

2591
02:12:26.931 --> 02:12:30.290
<v Speaker 14>for creativity and and so we got some</v>
<v Speaker 14>really like these were outstanding</v>

2592
02:12:30.291 --> 02:12:33.020
<v Speaker 14>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 14>so and we tested them psychometrically</v>

2593
02:12:33.021 --> 02:12:34.970
<v Speaker 14>very,</v>
<v Speaker 14>very high and intelligence,</v>

2594
02:12:34.971 --> 02:12:38.330
<v Speaker 14>but I'm not creative at all.</v>
<v Speaker 14>The first,</v>

2595
02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.880
<v Speaker 14>the first trait was conscientious due to</v>
<v Speaker 14>full,</v>

2596
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:43.160
<v Speaker 14>hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 14>diligent,</v>

2597
02:12:43.161 --> 02:12:44.330
<v Speaker 14>industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 14>orderly,</v>

2598
02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.520
<v Speaker 14>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you're working 70 hours a week and you</v>

2599
02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:48.860
<v Speaker 14>better bloody well work if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 14>position like that too.</v>

2600
02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.850
<v Speaker 14>So it's nose to the grindstone stuff</v>
<v Speaker 14>very low in neuroticism because it's</v>

2601
02:12:52.851 --> 02:12:55.300
<v Speaker 14>very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So they didn't experience a bunch of</v>

2602
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:59.000
<v Speaker 14>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 14>very disagreeable people while their</v>

2603
02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:00.540
<v Speaker 14>letter get litigated.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And so they would,</v>

2604
02:13:00.541 --> 02:13:02.420
<v Speaker 14>they want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 14>They're not compassionate and they're</v>

2605
02:13:02.421 --> 02:13:05.020
<v Speaker 14>not polite and only after that where</v>
<v Speaker 14>they opened.</v>

2606
02:13:05.050 --> 02:13:08.300
<v Speaker 14>So they weren't creative at all,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but they were extraordinarily</v>

2607
02:13:08.301 --> 02:13:11.750
<v Speaker 14>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So do employers look for creative</v>

2608
02:13:11.751 --> 02:13:12.830
<v Speaker 14>people?</v>
<v Speaker 14>No.</v>

2609
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:15.410
<v Speaker 14>No,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not generally.</v>

2610
02:13:15.411 --> 02:13:16.041
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's a real.</v>

2611
02:13:16.041 --> 02:13:18.470
<v Speaker 14>It's a real conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 14>So one of the things that's happening</v>

2612
02:13:18.471 --> 02:13:23.471
<v Speaker 14>right now is that in most businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 14>the noncreative people are increasingly</v>

2613
02:13:24.921 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 14>being replaced by machines,</v>
<v Speaker 14>right?</v>

2614
02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:30.730
<v Speaker 14>Because anything that's creative can</v>
<v Speaker 14>really be turned into an algorithm and</v>

2615
02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.260
<v Speaker 14>that you can run as a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but anything that isn't creative can be</v>

2616
02:13:34.261 --> 02:13:38.760
<v Speaker 14>and so there's increasing demand</v>
<v Speaker 14>incorporations for creative people,</v>

2617
02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 14>but the problem with being creative is</v>
<v Speaker 14>that you're useless at the bottom of the</v>

2618
02:13:42.061 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 14>dominance hierarchy because at the</v>
<v Speaker 14>bottom of the dominance hierarchy,</v>

2619
02:13:45.271 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 14>so a power hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 14>you should do what you're told to do.</v>

2620
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:50.220
<v Speaker 14>You're not there to think outside the</v>
<v Speaker 14>box.</v>

2621
02:13:50.221 --> 02:13:52.500
<v Speaker 14>You're there to learn what you're</v>
<v Speaker 14>supposed to do and implement it and</v>

2622
02:13:52.501 --> 02:13:54.540
<v Speaker 14>creative people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that's.</v>

2623
02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 14>That is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Now what happens though to companies is</v>

2624
02:13:59.401 --> 02:14:02.580
<v Speaker 14>that because they filter all the</v>
<v Speaker 14>creative people out at the bottom and</v>

2625
02:14:02.581 --> 02:14:06.300
<v Speaker 14>then people start to rise up to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 14>You really need creative people at the</v>

2626
02:14:06.301 --> 02:14:09.060
<v Speaker 14>top because they are the entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 14>types and they're the ones.</v>

2627
02:14:09.090 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 14>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 14>in law firms,</v>

2628
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.090
<v Speaker 14>even though lawyers aren't very</v>
<v Speaker 14>creative,</v>

2629
02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 14>the more entrepreneurial ones are the</v>
<v Speaker 14>ones that bring in all the business.</v>

2630
02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:18.780
<v Speaker 14>There's like great lawyers who can,</v>
<v Speaker 14>who can implement,</v>

2631
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:20.250
<v Speaker 14>who can,</v>
<v Speaker 14>who can,</v>

2632
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:23.430
<v Speaker 14>who can write well and communicate well.</v>
<v Speaker 14>Are there not a diamond dozen,</v>

2633
02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 14>but they're relatively common,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but the ones who are entrepreneurial who</v>

2634
02:14:26.161 --> 02:14:28.080
<v Speaker 14>can go out there and drum up new</v>
<v Speaker 14>business?</v>

2635
02:14:28.081 --> 02:14:30.210
<v Speaker 14>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 14>those people are super hyper valuable</v>

2636
02:14:30.211 --> 02:14:31.770
<v Speaker 14>and they're very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but they are,</v>

2637
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 14>but it's also very difficult to nurse</v>
<v Speaker 14>them within any system because systems</v>

2638
02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:39.870
<v Speaker 14>do not nurture creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 14>There are the antithesis of creativity</v>

2639
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:44.340
<v Speaker 14>because the artist is always the person</v>
<v Speaker 14>who stands outside the structure and so</v>

2640
02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:46.920
<v Speaker 14>or maybe builds his or her own</v>
<v Speaker 14>structure,</v>

2641
02:14:47.290 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 14>which is also why it's hard to evaluate</v>
<v Speaker 14>creative people.</v>

2642
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:54.830
<v Speaker 14>You can't really because if they're</v>
<v Speaker 14>operating within the confines of a</v>

2643
02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:59.220
<v Speaker 14>system that has an evaluative structure,</v>
<v Speaker 14>they're not creative.</v>

2644
02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:05.820
<v Speaker 12>We're having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.</v>

2645
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:09.390
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's different than how people</v>

2646
02:15:09.391 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 12>generally communicate because usually</v>
<v Speaker 12>when they communicate,</v>

2647
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 12>they're doing something like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

2648
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.540
<v Speaker 12>we're going to have a conversation and</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to tell you why I'm right and</v>

2649
02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:21.990
<v Speaker 12>all win.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If you agree or maybe you're having a</v>

2650
02:15:21.991 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 12>conversation where I don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're trying to do,</v>

2651
02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 12>maybe you're trying to impress the</v>
<v Speaker 12>person you're talking to so you're not</v>

2652
02:15:27.121 --> 02:15:28.890
<v Speaker 12>listening to them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're just thinking about what you're</v>

2653
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 12>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Say Next.</v>

2654
02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.860
<v Speaker 12>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so that's not this.</v>

2655
02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.240
<v Speaker 12>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You might have something to tell me and</v>

2656
02:15:36.241 --> 02:15:40.380
<v Speaker 12>so I'm going to listen on the off chance</v>
<v Speaker 12>that you'll tell me something that would</v>

2657
02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:43.890
<v Speaker 12>really be useful for me to know and so</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can take about it as an,</v>

2658
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:49.250
<v Speaker 12>as an extension of the Piagetian.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Piaget talked about the fundamental,</v>

2659
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:54.150
<v Speaker 12>the fundamentally important element of</v>
<v Speaker 12>knowledge being to describe how</v>

2660
02:15:54.151 --> 02:15:56.610
<v Speaker 12>knowledge is sought,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the process by which knowledge is</v>

2661
02:15:56.611 --> 02:15:57.420
<v Speaker 12>generated.</v>

2662
02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if you agree with me and I find that</v>

2663
02:16:00.991 --> 02:16:02.880
<v Speaker 12>out,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I know nothing more than I knew before.</v>

2664
02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:07.320
<v Speaker 12>I just know what I knew before and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 12>unhappy about that because it didn't get</v>

2665
02:16:07.321 --> 02:16:09.900
<v Speaker 12>challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but I'm no smarter than I was before,</v>

2666
02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 12>but maybe you're different than me and</v>
<v Speaker 12>so while I'm listening to you'll tell me</v>

2667
02:16:13.351 --> 02:16:14.880
<v Speaker 12>something I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't like.</v>

2668
02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.060
<v Speaker 12>Maybe it's something I find contemptible</v>
<v Speaker 12>or difficult,</v>

2669
02:16:18.061 --> 02:16:20.070
<v Speaker 12>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Maybe you'll find you'll tell me</v>

2670
02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:24.060
<v Speaker 12>something I don't know and then I won't</v>
<v Speaker 12>be quite as stupid and then maybe I</v>

2671
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:28.950
<v Speaker 12>won't run painfully into quite as many</v>
<v Speaker 12>things and that's a really useful thing.</v>

2672
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.820
<v Speaker 12>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>especially if you live with someone and</v>

2673
02:16:30.821 --> 02:16:34.630
<v Speaker 12>you're trying to make longterm piece</v>
<v Speaker 12>with them as they are not the same as</v>

2674
02:16:34.631 --> 02:16:37.660
<v Speaker 12>you and they're away.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They look at the world and the facts</v>

2675
02:16:37.661 --> 02:16:41.950
<v Speaker 12>that they pull out of the world aren't</v>
<v Speaker 12>the same as your facts and even though</v>

2676
02:16:41.951 --> 02:16:45.790
<v Speaker 12>you're going to be overwhelmed with the</v>
<v Speaker 12>proclivity to demonstrate that you're</v>

2677
02:16:45.791 --> 02:16:48.460
<v Speaker 12>right,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it is the case that two brains are</v>

2678
02:16:48.461 --> 02:16:53.461
<v Speaker 12>better than one and so maybe nine of the</v>
<v Speaker 12>10 things they tell you are dispensable</v>

2679
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:59.790
<v Speaker 12>or maybe even 49 out of 50,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but one thing all you need to get out of</v>

2680
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 12>the damn conversation is one thing you</v>
<v Speaker 12>don't know.</v>

2681
02:17:02.470 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 12>And one of the things that's very cool</v>
<v Speaker 12>about a good psychotherapeutic session</v>

2682
02:17:07.181 --> 02:17:09.310
<v Speaker 12>is that the whole conversation is like</v>
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>

2683
02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:15.090
<v Speaker 12>All you're doing is trying to express</v>
<v Speaker 12>the truth of the situation as clearly as</v>

2684
02:17:17.321 --> 02:17:18.910
<v Speaker 12>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's it.</v>

2685
02:17:19.690 --> 02:17:24.690
<v Speaker 12>And so now rogers' proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and I'll tell you why he derived it,</v>

2686
02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:30.820
<v Speaker 12>was that if you have a conversation like</v>
<v Speaker 12>that with someone,</v>

2687
02:17:31.090 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 12>it will make both of you better.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It will make both of you psychologically</v>

2688
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:37.990
<v Speaker 12>healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So there's an implicit presupposition</v>

2689
02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 12>that the exchange of truth is curative.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

2690
02:17:42.161 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 12>that's a very cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

2691
02:17:44.171 --> 02:17:45.740
<v Speaker 12>it's a very deep idea.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

2692
02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:49.160
<v Speaker 12>I think it's the most profound idea.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's the,</v>

2693
02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:53.080
<v Speaker 12>it's the idea upon western civil upon</v>
<v Speaker 12>which Western civilization,</v>

2694
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:57.490
<v Speaker 12>although not only Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 12>is actually predicated the idea that</v>

2695
02:17:57.491 --> 02:18:00.130
<v Speaker 12>truth produces health.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But for Rogers,</v>

2696
02:18:00.131 --> 02:18:02.740
<v Speaker 12>that was the entire purpose of the</v>
<v Speaker 12>psycho therapeutic alliance.</v>

2697
02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:05.620
<v Speaker 12>You come to see me because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 12>be better.</v>

2698
02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 12>You don't even know what that means</v>
<v Speaker 12>necessarily.</v>

2699
02:18:09.161 --> 02:18:11.620
<v Speaker 12>Neither do I.</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're going to figure that out together.</v>

2700
02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 12>But you come and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

2701
02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.620
<v Speaker 12>things are not acceptable to me and</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe there's something I could do about</v>

2702
02:18:17.621 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 12>that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So that's the minimal precondition to</v>

2703
02:18:19.751 --> 02:18:22.120
<v Speaker 12>engage in therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Something's wrong.</v>

2704
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:24.280
<v Speaker 12>You're willing to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 12>truthfully,</v>

2705
02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:26.440
<v Speaker 12>and you want it to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Without that,</v>

2706
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:29.830
<v Speaker 12>the therapeutic relationship does not</v>
<v Speaker 12>get off the ground.</v>

2707
02:18:30.130 --> 02:18:31.450
<v Speaker 12>And so then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>

2708
02:18:31.451 --> 02:18:35.560
<v Speaker 12>what relationships are therapeutic?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And the answer that would be if you have</v>

2709
02:18:35.561 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 12>a real relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's therapeutic.</v>

2710
02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:40.570
<v Speaker 12>If it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what you have is not a relationship.</v>

2711
02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:43.000
<v Speaker 12>God only knows what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're a slave,</v>

2712
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:44.580
<v Speaker 12>they're a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2713
02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:46.630
<v Speaker 12>you're both butting heads with one</v>
<v Speaker 12>another.</v>

2714
02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:49.060
<v Speaker 12>It's a primate dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 12>dispute.</v>

2715
02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.200
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>

2716
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.440
<v Speaker 12>You're like two cats in a barrel or two</v>
<v Speaker 12>people with their hands around each</v>

2717
02:18:53.441 --> 02:18:56.410
<v Speaker 12>other's throats.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But what you have is not a relationship.</v>

2718
02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.610
<v Speaker 12>So alright,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we may say that the greater the</v>

2719
02:19:00.611 --> 02:19:04.090
<v Speaker 12>communicated congruence of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 12>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>

2720
02:19:04.091 --> 02:19:05.770
<v Speaker 12>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's,</v>

2721
02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:09.520
<v Speaker 12>that's a reference to the same idea that</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was describing with regards to yoke.</v>

2722
02:19:09.521 --> 02:19:13.660
<v Speaker 12>So let's say you come and talk to me and</v>
<v Speaker 12>you want things to go,</v>

2723
02:19:13.661 --> 02:19:15.310
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well I'm going to have to more or less</v>

2724
02:19:15.311 --> 02:19:18.340
<v Speaker 12>be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Because if I'm all over the place,</v>

2725
02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:22.000
<v Speaker 12>you can't trust any continuity in what I</v>
<v Speaker 12>say.</v>

2726
02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 12>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And there's no reason for you to believe</v>

2727
02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 12>that I'm capable of actually telling you</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm capable of expressing anything</v>

2728
02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:33.020
<v Speaker 12>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So the truth is something that emerges</v>

2729
02:19:33.021 --> 02:19:36.650
<v Speaker 12>as a consequences of getting yourself</v>
<v Speaker 12>lined up and beating all the,</v>

2730
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:42.890
<v Speaker 12>what would you call</v>
<v Speaker 12>all the impurities out of your,</v>

2731
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:47.420
<v Speaker 12>out of your,</v>
<v Speaker 12>out of your soul for black of a better</v>

2732
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:48.254
<v Speaker 12>word.</v>

2733
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:51.500
<v Speaker 12>You have to be integrated for that to</v>
<v Speaker 12>happen and you do that at least in part</v>

2734
02:19:51.501 --> 02:19:55.670
<v Speaker 12>by wanting to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The more the ensuing relationship will</v>

2735
02:19:55.671 --> 02:19:59.150
<v Speaker 12>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>
<v Speaker 12>communication with the same qualities.</v>

2736
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:03.500
<v Speaker 12>So one of the things that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 12>quite influenced by Rogers,</v>

2737
02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 12>one of the things I tried to do in my</v>
<v Speaker 12>therapeutic sessions is first of all to</v>

2738
02:20:06.711 --> 02:20:09.780
<v Speaker 12>listen to really listen and then,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>

2739
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:13.370
<v Speaker 12>well I listen,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I watch and while I'm listening things</v>

2740
02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:15.410
<v Speaker 12>will happen in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2741
02:20:15.411 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 12>maybe I'll get a little image of</v>
<v Speaker 12>something or I'll get a thought or a</v>

2742
02:20:18.861 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 12>question will emerge and then I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 12>tell the person what that is.</v>

2743
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 12>But it's sort of directionless,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know?</v>

2744
02:20:23.571 --> 02:20:27.110
<v Speaker 12>It's not like I have a goal except that</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're trying to make things better.</v>

2745
02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:30.590
<v Speaker 12>I'm on the side of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm on the side of the part of the</v>

2746
02:20:30.591 --> 02:20:33.440
<v Speaker 12>person that wants things to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 12>not worse,</v>

2747
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:38.090
<v Speaker 12>and so then those parts of us have a</v>
<v Speaker 12>dialogue and the consequences of that</v>

2748
02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:41.330
<v Speaker 12>dialogue is that certain things take</v>
<v Speaker 12>place and then I'll just tell the person</v>

2749
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:43.880
<v Speaker 12>what happened and it isn't that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 12>right.</v>

2750
02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:45.950
<v Speaker 12>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The point is,</v>

2751
02:20:45.951 --> 02:20:49.820
<v Speaker 12>is that they get to have an hour where</v>
<v Speaker 12>someone actually tells them what they</v>

2752
02:20:49.821 --> 02:20:52.310
<v Speaker 12>think.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Here's the impact you're having on me.</v>

2753
02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:54.800
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is making me angry.</v>

2754
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:57.800
<v Speaker 12>This is making me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>This is really interesting.</v>

2755
02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:00.860
<v Speaker 12>This reminds me of something that you</v>
<v Speaker 12>said an hour ago that I don't quite</v>

2756
02:21:00.861 --> 02:21:02.660
<v Speaker 12>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and the whole,</v>

2757
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.440
<v Speaker 12>the whole point is not for either person</v>
<v Speaker 12>to make the proposition or convince the</v>

2758
02:21:08.961 --> 02:21:13.850
<v Speaker 12>other that their position is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but merely to have an exchange of</v>

2759
02:21:13.851 --> 02:21:18.851
<v Speaker 12>experience about how things are set up</v>
<v Speaker 12>and it's extraordinarily useful for</v>

2760
02:21:19.041 --> 02:21:22.910
<v Speaker 12>people because it's often difficult for</v>
<v Speaker 12>anyone to find anyone to talk to that</v>

2761
02:21:22.911 --> 02:21:26.090
<v Speaker 12>will actually listen.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so another thing that's really</v>

2762
02:21:26.091 --> 02:21:28.520
<v Speaker 12>strange about this listening is that if</v>
<v Speaker 12>you listen to people,</v>

2763
02:21:28.521 --> 02:21:31.520
<v Speaker 12>they will tell you the weirdest bloody</v>
<v Speaker 12>things so fast,</v>

2764
02:21:31.521 --> 02:21:32.870
<v Speaker 12>you just cannot believe it.</v>

2765
02:21:33.170 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 12>So if you're having a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 12>someone and it's dull,</v>

2766
02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:40.280
<v Speaker 12>it's because you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's why you're not listening to them</v>

2767
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:44.690
<v Speaker 12>properly because they're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They're like wombats or albatrosses or</v>

2768
02:21:44.691 --> 02:21:47.720
<v Speaker 12>rhinoceroses or something like they're</v>
<v Speaker 12>strange creatures.</v>

2769
02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:50.630
<v Speaker 12>And so if you were actually</v>
<v Speaker 12>communicating with them and they were</v>

2770
02:21:50.631 --> 02:21:53.270
<v Speaker 12>telling you how weird they really are,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it would be.</v>

2771
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 12>It would be anything but boring.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So.</v>

2772
02:21:56.770 --> 02:21:59.480
<v Speaker 12>And you can ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's a really good way of listening.</v>

2773
02:21:59.481 --> 02:22:02.540
<v Speaker 12>But you know one of Roger's points as</v>
<v Speaker 12>well.</v>

2774
02:22:02.541 --> 02:22:04.820
<v Speaker 12>You have to be oriented properly in</v>
<v Speaker 12>order to listen.</v>

2775
02:22:04.970 --> 02:22:08.000
<v Speaker 12>And the orientation has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Look what I want out of this</v>

2776
02:22:08.001 --> 02:22:11.600
<v Speaker 12>conversation is that the place we both</v>
<v Speaker 12>end up is better than the place we left.</v>

2777
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:13.820
<v Speaker 12>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's what I'm after.</v>

2778
02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:15.920
<v Speaker 12>And if you're not after that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you've got to think,</v>

2779
02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:18.200
<v Speaker 12>why the hell wouldn't you be after that?</v>

2780
02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.290
<v Speaker 12>What could you possibly be after that</v>
<v Speaker 12>would be better than that?</v>

2781
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:26.490
<v Speaker 12>You walk away smarter and more well</v>
<v Speaker 12>equipped for the world than you were</v>

2782
02:22:26.491 --> 02:22:29.550
<v Speaker 12>before you had the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and so does the other person.</v>

2783
02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:32.190
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe if you're bitter and resentful and</v>

2784
02:22:32.191 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 12>angry and anxious and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>generally annoyed at the world,</v>

2785
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:39.570
<v Speaker 12>then that isn't what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You want the other person to walk away</v>

2786
02:22:39.571 --> 02:22:41.790
<v Speaker 12>worse than Youtube because you're full</v>
<v Speaker 12>of revenge,</v>

2787
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.480
<v Speaker 12>but you know you'll get what you want if</v>
<v Speaker 12>you do that,</v>

2788
02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 12>so we know from our research that such</v>
<v Speaker 12>empathic understanding,</v>

2789
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 12>so already defined that I want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 12>you.</v>

2790
02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:56.850
<v Speaker 12>I want to hear what you have to say so</v>
<v Speaker 12>we can clarify it and move forward.</v>

2791
02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:00.090
<v Speaker 12>I want to have your best interests in</v>
<v Speaker 12>mind and mine as well,</v>

2792
02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:03.480
<v Speaker 12>but you know both at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 12>your families too.</v>

2793
02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.420
<v Speaker 12>If we could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're after making things better.</v>

2794
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:09.960
<v Speaker 12>We know from our research that such</v>
<v Speaker 12>empathic understanding,</v>

2795
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:12.150
<v Speaker 12>understanding with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 12>not about him.</v>

2796
02:23:12.151 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 12>It's such an effective approach that it</v>
<v Speaker 12>can bring about major changes in</v>

2797
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:18.030
<v Speaker 12>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Some of you may be feeling that you</v>

2798
02:23:18.031 --> 02:23:20.790
<v Speaker 12>listen well to people and that you have</v>
<v Speaker 12>never seen such results.</v>

2799
02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:24.690
<v Speaker 12>The chances are very great that you have</v>
<v Speaker 12>not been listening in the manner that</v>

2800
02:23:24.691 --> 02:23:26.340
<v Speaker 12>I've described.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Fortunately,</v>

2801
02:23:26.341 --> 02:23:30.300
<v Speaker 12>I can suggest a little experiment that</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can do to test the quality of your</v>

2802
02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:32.970
<v Speaker 12>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The next time you get into an argument</v>

2803
02:23:33.450 --> 02:23:35.580
<v Speaker 12>with your wife or your friend or a small</v>
<v Speaker 12>group of friends,</v>

2804
02:23:35.581 --> 02:23:39.630
<v Speaker 12>stop the discussion for a moment and for</v>
<v Speaker 12>an experiment institute this rule.</v>

2805
02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:45.530
<v Speaker 12>Each person can speak up for himself</v>
<v Speaker 12>only after he has first restated the</v>

2806
02:23:45.541 --> 02:23:48.960
<v Speaker 12>ideas and feelings of the previous</v>
<v Speaker 12>speaker accurately.</v>

2807
02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 12>What accurately means is they have to</v>
<v Speaker 12>agree with your restatement.</v>

2808
02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.590
<v Speaker 12>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's an annoying thing to do because</v>

2809
02:23:55.591 --> 02:23:58.050
<v Speaker 12>if someone is talking to you and you</v>
<v Speaker 12>disagree with them,</v>

2810
02:23:58.051 --> 02:23:59.820
<v Speaker 12>the first thing you want to do is take</v>
<v Speaker 12>their argument,</v>

2811
02:23:59.821 --> 02:24:02.730
<v Speaker 12>make the stupidest possible thing out of</v>
<v Speaker 12>it that you can.</v>

2812
02:24:02.970 --> 02:24:05.220
<v Speaker 12>That's the straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and then demolish it.</v>

2813
02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 12>It's like so then you can walk away</v>
<v Speaker 12>feeling good about it,</v>

2814
02:24:08.911 --> 02:24:12.930
<v Speaker 12>and primate diamonds dominated them</v>
<v Speaker 12>really nicely.</v>

2815
02:24:12.931 --> 02:24:14.850
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but that isn't what you do.</v>

2816
02:24:14.851 --> 02:24:15.481
<v Speaker 12>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

2817
02:24:15.481 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 12>well I'm going to take what you told me</v>
<v Speaker 12>and maybe I'm even going to make your</v>

2818
02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:21.750
<v Speaker 12>argument stronger than the one you made.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's useful if you're dealing with</v>

2819
02:24:21.751 --> 02:24:24.540
<v Speaker 12>someone that you have to live with</v>
<v Speaker 12>because maybe they can't bloody well</v>

2820
02:24:24.541 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 12>express themselves very well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but they have something to say so you</v>

2821
02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:30.550
<v Speaker 12>make their argument strong.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Alright,</v>

2822
02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:35.280
<v Speaker 12>then you see what this would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It would mean that before presenting</v>

2823
02:24:35.281 --> 02:24:37.680
<v Speaker 12>your own point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it'd be necessary for you to really</v>

2824
02:24:37.681 --> 02:24:41.550
<v Speaker 12>achieve the other speakers frame of</v>
<v Speaker 12>reference to understand his thoughts and</v>

2825
02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:44.250
<v Speaker 12>feelings so well that you could</v>
<v Speaker 12>summarize them for him.</v>

2826
02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.140
<v Speaker 12>Sounds simple,</v>
<v Speaker 12>doesn't it?</v>

2827
02:24:47.130 --> 02:24:50.310
<v Speaker 12>But if you'll try it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you'll find that it's the most difficult</v>

2828
02:24:50.311 --> 02:24:52.650
<v Speaker 12>thing that you've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay,</v>

2829
02:24:52.651 --> 02:24:54.240
<v Speaker 12>good.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We'll leave it at that and then we'll</v>

2830
02:24:54.241 --> 02:24:55.170
<v Speaker 12>see you on Tuesday.</v>

2831
02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:02.960
<v Speaker 15>What's my advice to young men seeking a</v>
<v Speaker 15>woman for marriage and family?</v>

2832
02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:05.630
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Well,</v>

2833
02:25:05.631 --> 02:25:06.464
<v Speaker 15>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 15>fine.</v>

2834
02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.660
<v Speaker 15>That's the same quest.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Second question.</v>

2835
02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.520
<v Speaker 15>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 15>that's pretty straightforward man.</v>

2836
02:25:10.521 --> 02:25:14.270
<v Speaker 15>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you can't eliminate the necessity of</v>

2837
02:25:14.271 --> 02:25:16.310
<v Speaker 15>being attracted to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 15>That's important.</v>

2838
02:25:16.311 --> 02:25:18.290
<v Speaker 15>And that's mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know?</v>

2839
02:25:18.291 --> 02:25:19.610
<v Speaker 15>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 15>so for example,</v>

2840
02:25:19.611 --> 02:25:21.920
<v Speaker 15>here's a funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 15>if you,</v>

2841
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:25.420
<v Speaker 15>one of the things know that attracts</v>
<v Speaker 15>people to one another is bilateral</v>

2842
02:25:25.421 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 15>symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And so if you take men and you ranked</v>

2843
02:25:29.681 --> 02:25:34.681
<v Speaker 15>them by the cemetery of their faces and</v>
<v Speaker 15>then you give the asymmetrical men tee</v>

2844
02:25:36.521 --> 02:25:41.080
<v Speaker 15>shirts to wear clean t shirts for a day</v>
<v Speaker 15>and the symmetrical men clean t shirts</v>

2845
02:25:41.081 --> 02:25:44.560
<v Speaker 15>to wear for a day and then you give the</v>
<v Speaker 15>t shirts to women and you have them rate</v>

2846
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:46.060
<v Speaker 15>the,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the older,</v>

2847
02:25:46.690 --> 02:25:51.220
<v Speaker 15>the women rate the odor of the</v>
<v Speaker 15>symmetrical men as more attractive than</v>

2848
02:25:51.221 --> 02:25:52.930
<v Speaker 15>the odor of the asymmetrical man.</v>

2849
02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.060
<v Speaker 15>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and there were other,</v>

2850
02:25:55.310 --> 02:25:57.790
<v Speaker 15>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>factors that determine sexual</v>

2851
02:25:57.791 --> 02:26:01.720
<v Speaker 15>attractiveness that are based on</v>
<v Speaker 15>biological factors that are so deeply</v>

2852
02:26:01.721 --> 02:26:03.700
<v Speaker 15>embedded in terms of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 15>for example.</v>

2853
02:26:03.701 --> 02:26:08.701
<v Speaker 15>So a women also tend to not be sexually</v>
<v Speaker 15>attracted to the,</v>

2854
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:13.360
<v Speaker 15>to the scent of men whose,</v>
<v Speaker 15>who have,</v>

2855
02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:17.650
<v Speaker 15>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's rh factors that would make for</v>

2856
02:26:17.651 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 15>potential trouble in childbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And the often,</v>

2857
02:26:22.391 --> 02:26:26.220
<v Speaker 15>the reason that the women give for not</v>
<v Speaker 15>preferring the scent of those men is</v>

2858
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 15>that they smell too much like their</v>
<v Speaker 15>brother.</v>

2859
02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:30.670
<v Speaker 15>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So there was weird,</v>

2860
02:26:30.671 --> 02:26:33.640
<v Speaker 15>mysterious things that determine whether</v>
<v Speaker 15>or not people are sexually and</v>

2861
02:26:33.641 --> 02:26:36.470
<v Speaker 15>physically attracted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And I think it's very important that</v>

2862
02:26:36.471 --> 02:26:41.471
<v Speaker 15>that's part of a marital relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 15>The next most important thing is trust.</v>

2863
02:26:41.771 --> 02:26:45.970
<v Speaker 15>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's like there's no marriage that's</v>

2864
02:26:45.971 --> 02:26:49.240
<v Speaker 15>successful without trust you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 15>You got to tell each other the truth.</v>

2865
02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:53.300
<v Speaker 15>And one of the reasons that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 15>believe that marriage as a,</v>

2866
02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:57.520
<v Speaker 15>an oath and Carl young as a bond was</v>
<v Speaker 15>necessary.</v>

2867
02:26:57.521 --> 02:26:58.960
<v Speaker 15>It's really wise.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's like,</v>

2868
02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:01.510
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>telling the truth to someone is no</v>

2869
02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 15>simple thing because there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 15>things about all of us that are terrible</v>

2870
02:27:05.351 --> 02:27:08.560
<v Speaker 15>and weak and reprehensible and shameful</v>
<v Speaker 15>and all of those things.</v>

2871
02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:11.350
<v Speaker 15>And they kind of have to be brought out</v>
<v Speaker 15>into the open and dealt with.</v>

2872
02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:16.030
<v Speaker 15>And you're not going to tell the truth</v>
<v Speaker 15>about yourself to someone who can run</v>

2873
02:27:16.031 --> 02:27:18.220
<v Speaker 15>away screaming when you reveal who you</v>
<v Speaker 15>are.</v>

2874
02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:21.520
<v Speaker 15>And so the marriage bond is something</v>
<v Speaker 15>like,</v>

2875
02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:22.810
<v Speaker 15>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 15>here's the deal.</v>

2876
02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:28.390
<v Speaker 15>I'm going to handcuff myself to you and</v>
<v Speaker 15>you're going to handcuff yourself to me</v>

2877
02:27:28.930 --> 02:27:30.700
<v Speaker 15>and then we're going to tell each other</v>
<v Speaker 15>the truth.</v>

2878
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:32.800
<v Speaker 15>And neither of us are going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 15>run away,</v>

2879
02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:35.290
<v Speaker 15>and so our,</v>
<v Speaker 15>once we know the truth,</v>

2880
02:27:35.291 --> 02:27:38.260
<v Speaker 15>then we're either going to live together</v>
<v Speaker 15>in mutual torment or we're going to try</v>

2881
02:27:38.261 --> 02:27:41.830
<v Speaker 15>to deal with that truth and straighten</v>
<v Speaker 15>ourselves out and straighten ourselves</v>

2882
02:27:41.831 --> 02:27:42.664
<v Speaker 15>out jointly.</v>

2883
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:47.760
<v Speaker 15>And that's going to make us more</v>
<v Speaker 15>powerful and more resilient and more and</v>

2884
02:27:48.311 --> 02:27:51.640
<v Speaker 15>deeper and wiser as we progress together</v>
<v Speaker 15>through life.</v>

2885
02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:54.130
<v Speaker 15>And,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and I think that's absolutely brilliant</v>

2886
02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:55.900
<v Speaker 15>because if you leave a backdoor open</v>
<v Speaker 15>man,</v>

2887
02:27:55.901 --> 02:27:57.340
<v Speaker 15>you're going to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 15>that's for sure.</v>

2888
02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:00.970
<v Speaker 15>And the oath is there.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And this was [inaudible] commentary on</v>

2889
02:28:00.971 --> 02:28:04.790
<v Speaker 15>the spiritualization of,</v>
<v Speaker 15>of the human parable.</v>

2890
02:28:04.850 --> 02:28:07.030
<v Speaker 15>And by Christian marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 15>for example,</v>

2891
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:08.770
<v Speaker 15>which emphasized,</v>
<v Speaker 15>uh,</v>

2892
02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:10.510
<v Speaker 15>the,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the,</v>

2893
02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:14.050
<v Speaker 15>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the subordination of both members of the</v>

2894
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:19.051
<v Speaker 15>marital union to a higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 15>a personality that was embodied in the</v>

2895
02:28:20.711 --> 02:28:21.740
<v Speaker 15>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the logos.</v>

2896
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.350
<v Speaker 15>So the idea is that in,</v>
<v Speaker 15>in,</v>

2897
02:28:23.370 --> 02:28:23.890
<v Speaker 15>in,</v>
<v Speaker 15>in,</v>

2898
02:28:23.890 --> 02:28:25.460
<v Speaker 15>in the Christian marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 15>for example,</v>

2899
02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:28.850
<v Speaker 15>the man isn't the boss and the woman</v>
<v Speaker 15>isn't the boss,</v>

2900
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
<v Speaker 15>the boss is the mutual personality</v>
<v Speaker 15>composed by the seeking of truth in both</v>

2901
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:37.870
<v Speaker 15>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And that's conceptualized as their,</v>

2902
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:41.870
<v Speaker 15>their joint subjugation to the logos and</v>
<v Speaker 15>that is absolutely dead on,</v>

2903
02:28:41.871 --> 02:28:42.410
<v Speaker 15>man.</v>

2904
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:47.410
<v Speaker 15>It's like the ruler of your marital life</v>
<v Speaker 15>should be your vowed to tell each other</v>

2905
02:28:47.541 --> 02:28:51.440
<v Speaker 15>the truth because like in hard times</v>
<v Speaker 15>during your life,</v>

2906
02:28:51.441 --> 02:28:53.580
<v Speaker 15>when you've done something stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 15>idiotic,</v>

2907
02:28:53.581 --> 02:28:57.140
<v Speaker 15>that might take you down and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 15>have anybody that you can turn to,</v>

2908
02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:58.910
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>if you have a partner that you can</v>

2909
02:28:58.911 --> 02:28:59.990
<v Speaker 15>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you can go say,</v>

2910
02:28:59.991 --> 02:29:00.824
<v Speaker 15>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2911
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:04.580
<v Speaker 15>I made a big financial mistake man and</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's really torturing me and I feel like</v>

2912
02:29:04.581 --> 02:29:06.500
<v Speaker 15>a complete idiot and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 15>dangerous.</v>

2913
02:29:06.501 --> 02:29:09.530
<v Speaker 15>And the person there,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's going to help you figure out what</v>

2914
02:29:09.531 --> 02:29:11.780
<v Speaker 15>to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And they're going to know that when they</v>

2915
02:29:11.781 --> 02:29:14.210
<v Speaker 15>make a stupid mistake and they're bloody</v>
<v Speaker 15>well going to,</v>

2916
02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:17.240
<v Speaker 15>that they can come and talk to you and</v>
<v Speaker 15>that you guys are going to work your way</v>

2917
02:29:17.241 --> 02:29:19.580
<v Speaker 15>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And that's a big deal.</v>

2918
02:29:19.581 --> 02:29:22.430
<v Speaker 15>And there's a couple of things our</v>
<v Speaker 15>culture gets really wrong.</v>

2919
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:26.630
<v Speaker 15>And one is it devalues marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 15>That's really a very bad idea because</v>

2920
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:30.080
<v Speaker 15>marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 15>marriages like a third of your life.</v>

2921
02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:33.710
<v Speaker 15>And maybe more and kids are a third of</v>
<v Speaker 15>your life and your,</v>

2922
02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:36.740
<v Speaker 15>your,</v>
<v Speaker 15>your life outside of marriage and kids</v>

2923
02:29:36.741 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 15>is a third of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2924
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:43.580
<v Speaker 15>approximately speaking and to miss any</v>
<v Speaker 15>of that is a massive,</v>

2925
02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:45.170
<v Speaker 15>massive mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Now,</v>

2926
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.850
<v Speaker 15>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 15>I will also say that for some people</v>

2927
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.020
<v Speaker 15>missing one or more of those is</v>
<v Speaker 15>necessary because they have a reason.</v>

2928
02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:56.660
<v Speaker 15>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>maybe they're brilliantly creative</v>

2929
02:29:56.661 --> 02:29:59.930
<v Speaker 15>artists and they need to devote</v>
<v Speaker 15>themselves entirely to their career or</v>

2930
02:29:59.931 --> 02:30:01.970
<v Speaker 15>they're outstanding in some way and so</v>
<v Speaker 15>they need,</v>

2931
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 15>they can justify the sacrifice of one</v>
<v Speaker 15>part of that triad,</v>

2932
02:30:05.751 --> 02:30:07.850
<v Speaker 15>of being to another part,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but for.</v>

2933
02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:10.460
<v Speaker 15>But generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it's a very dangerous thing and,</v>

2934
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:11.510
<v Speaker 15>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 15>it,</v>

2935
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:15.140
<v Speaker 15>it shouldn't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And also kids get an absolutely terrible</v>

2936
02:30:15.141 --> 02:30:16.040
<v Speaker 15>rap,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2937
02:30:16.250 --> 02:30:19.580
<v Speaker 15>because kids are delightful if they're</v>
<v Speaker 15>well behaved.</v>

2938
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:22.940
<v Speaker 15>One of the chapters in my new book is</v>
<v Speaker 15>called don't let your children do</v>

2939
02:30:22.941 --> 02:30:25.850
<v Speaker 15>anything that makes you dislike them.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And you can do that,</v>

2940
02:30:25.851 --> 02:30:29.180
<v Speaker 15>especially if you discuss it thoroughly</v>
<v Speaker 15>with your spouse.</v>

2941
02:30:29.181 --> 02:30:32.630
<v Speaker 15>You're the person that's helping you</v>
<v Speaker 15>discipline the kids and children are the</v>

2942
02:30:32.631 --> 02:30:36.980
<v Speaker 15>best company because they're really</v>
<v Speaker 15>enthusiastic about everything they love</v>

2943
02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:39.080
<v Speaker 15>doing new things.</v>
<v Speaker 15>They really love you,</v>

2944
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:43.460
<v Speaker 15>so they're happy that you're around.</v>
<v Speaker 15>All you have to do is make sure they're</v>

2945
02:30:43.461 --> 02:30:46.700
<v Speaker 15>not too hot and they're not too cold and</v>
<v Speaker 15>they've had something to eat and they're</v>

2946
02:30:46.701 --> 02:30:51.701
<v Speaker 15>not too tired and you don't expect them</v>
<v Speaker 15>to stay engaged in something for longer</v>

2947
02:30:52.521 --> 02:30:55.340
<v Speaker 15>than they can manage because we used to</v>
<v Speaker 15>take our kids when they were little out</v>

2948
02:30:55.341 --> 02:30:58.070
<v Speaker 15>to restaurants for example.</v>
<v Speaker 15>And they could sit there no problem and</v>

2949
02:30:58.071 --> 02:31:00.110
<v Speaker 15>behave really nicely when they were two</v>
<v Speaker 15>and three,</v>

2950
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:02.840
<v Speaker 15>but they couldn't do it for more than</v>
<v Speaker 15>about 45 minutes.</v>

2951
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:06.350
<v Speaker 15>He can't push your luck.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But I also noticed with little kids is</v>

2952
02:31:06.351 --> 02:31:11.180
<v Speaker 15>that they got antsy and unreasonable</v>
<v Speaker 15>about five to 10 minutes before the</v>

2953
02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 15>adults did too.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It's just the adults were too stupid to</v>

2954
02:31:13.671 --> 02:31:15.410
<v Speaker 15>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 15>The kids would notice right away.</v>

2955
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:16.663
<v Speaker 15>So,</v>
<v Speaker 15>um,</v>

2956
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:19.260
<v Speaker 15>so back to marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 15>while you look for someone you're</v>

2957
02:31:19.261 --> 02:31:20.700
<v Speaker 15>attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 15>that you love,</v>

2958
02:31:20.701 --> 02:31:23.400
<v Speaker 15>and then you look for someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 15>can bloody well trust.</v>

2959
02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.110
<v Speaker 15>And then you tell them the truth and</v>
<v Speaker 15>that way maybe you can get through life</v>

2960
02:31:28.111 --> 02:31:33.111
<v Speaker 15>and you can have someone to weave the</v>
<v Speaker 15>rope of your being with and together to</v>

2961
02:31:33.841 --> 02:31:37.500
<v Speaker 15>make to make your joint ropes stronger</v>
<v Speaker 15>and you can have some continuity in your</v>

2962
02:31:37.501 --> 02:31:41.190
<v Speaker 15>narrative and you can have children and</v>
<v Speaker 15>then you can have grandchildren and like</v>

2963
02:31:41.191 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 15>you can have a life man and there is</v>
<v Speaker 15>nothing.</v>

2964
02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:46.530
<v Speaker 15>You are so fortunate if you can manage</v>
<v Speaker 15>that.</v>

2965
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:48.070
<v Speaker 15>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Okay,</v>

2966
02:31:48.090 --> 02:31:51.660
<v Speaker 15>so there's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 15>So what's my advice to young men seeking</v>

2967
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:53.520
<v Speaker 15>a woman for marriage and family?</v>
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

2968
02:31:53.521 --> 02:31:55.650
<v Speaker 15>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 15>and also,</v>

2969
02:31:55.651 --> 02:31:57.690
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 15>marry someone you think would be a good</v>

2970
02:31:57.691 --> 02:32:00.420
<v Speaker 15>mother and that has enough sense</v>
<v Speaker 15>generally speaking,</v>

2971
02:32:00.421 --> 02:32:04.680
<v Speaker 15>to know that she wants children.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Now some women don't want children and</v>

2972
02:32:04.681 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 15>fair enough and some women perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 15>shouldn't have children.</v>

2973
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:12.810
<v Speaker 15>That's also possible.</v>
<v Speaker 15>But the general rule of thumb is,</v>

2974
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:14.440
<v Speaker 15>especially once a woman's,</v>
<v Speaker 15>you know,</v>

2975
02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 15>in her mid twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 15>if she doesn't know that she wants</v>

2976
02:32:17.761 --> 02:32:19.850
<v Speaker 15>children or wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 15>met it,</v>

2977
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.730
<v Speaker 15>unless she has a viciously important</v>
<v Speaker 15>reason,</v>

2978
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:28.200
<v Speaker 15>then she's not oriented properly.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Psychologically she,</v>

2979
02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:29.280
<v Speaker 15>she,</v>
<v Speaker 15>she isn't.</v>

2980
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:31.530
<v Speaker 15>She doesn't know what's important in</v>
<v Speaker 15>life.</v>

2981
02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:33.810
<v Speaker 15>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 15>that might also be the case with you and</v>

2982
02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:35.850
<v Speaker 15>it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 15>but as a rule of thumb,</v>

2983
02:32:35.860 --> 02:32:36.810
<v Speaker 15>that's a really good one.</v>

2984
02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:40.500
<v Speaker 3>How do men and women differ in the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>they evaluate mates?</v>

2985
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the study.</v>

2986
02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:47.330
<v Speaker 3>More than a thousand respondents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily female.</v>

2987
02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:51.800
<v Speaker 3>What they looked at was how much each</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2988
02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:54.660
<v Speaker 3>how much prestige each person had in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their occupation,</v>

2989
02:32:54.661 --> 02:32:56.990
<v Speaker 3>so kind of where they were situated in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy,</v>

2990
02:32:57.380 --> 02:32:59.810
<v Speaker 3>what their income was under education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there are all markers.</v>

2991
02:32:59.930 --> 02:33:04.310
<v Speaker 3>They're all pretty decent markers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>socio economic status or they're pretty</v>

2992
02:33:04.311 --> 02:33:08.720
<v Speaker 3>decent markers of status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and then they looked at how many</v>

2993
02:33:08.721 --> 02:33:12.830
<v Speaker 3>partners each person had number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime partners and number of</v>

2994
02:33:12.831 --> 02:33:17.810
<v Speaker 3>preceding year sexual partners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime occurrence of simultaneous</v>

2995
02:33:17.811 --> 02:33:19.550
<v Speaker 3>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was someone who was in a</v>

2996
02:33:19.551 --> 02:33:21.590
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sexual relationship with more than one</v>

2997
02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:26.591
<v Speaker 3>person at the same time and lifetime</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequency of simultaneous partners from</v>

2998
02:33:26.901 --> 02:33:29.660
<v Speaker 3>one very seldom or never to five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very often,</v>

2999
02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:33.620
<v Speaker 3>here's their assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of partners,</v>

3000
02:33:33.621 --> 02:33:38.621
<v Speaker 3>a member of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A acquires is an index of how often this</v>

3001
02:33:39.231 --> 02:33:42.050
<v Speaker 3>individual is chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the other sex,</v>

3002
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an indication of reproductive</v>

3003
02:33:46.491 --> 02:33:49.580
<v Speaker 3>fitness as judged by members of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite sex</v>

3004
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male criteria</v>

3005
02:33:55.810 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the correlation between their fertility</v>

3006
02:34:00.121 --> 02:34:03.270
<v Speaker 3>rates and the number of partners in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>previous year was point nine four,</v>

3007
02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:08.930
<v Speaker 3>so that's basically markers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological youth and also markers of</v>

3008
02:34:08.931 --> 02:34:13.100
<v Speaker 3>biological health like symmetry or waist</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hip ratio,</v>

3009
02:34:13.101 --> 02:34:15.590
<v Speaker 3>which actually tends to be correlated</v>
<v Speaker 3>with reproductive</v>

3010
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:22.290
<v Speaker 3>fitness because women with lower waist</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hip ratios are generally healthier</v>

3011
02:34:24.610 --> 02:34:29.440
<v Speaker 3>because especially in youth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the acquisition of abdominal fat is</v>

3012
02:34:29.441 --> 02:34:32.440
<v Speaker 3>often an indicator of subpar physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

3013
02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 3>The correlation between the fertility</v>
<v Speaker 3>rate and the number of partners in the</v>

3014
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.980
<v Speaker 3>previous year is point nine Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all of it,</v>

3015
02:34:40.570 --> 02:34:42.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never see a correlation to point</v>

3016
02:34:42.251 --> 02:34:47.251
<v Speaker 3>nine for anywhere ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Males choose fertility indicators,</v>

3017
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:50.320
<v Speaker 3>beauty waist to hip ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>youthful appearance,</v>

3018
02:34:50.650 --> 02:34:55.240
<v Speaker 3>neotenous facial features,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and monotonous means like a infant.</v>

3019
02:34:55.450 --> 02:35:00.450
<v Speaker 3>So one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the markers of feminine beauty is</v>

3020
02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:05.680
<v Speaker 3>a face that has small childlike</v>
<v Speaker 3>features,</v>

3021
02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:13.980
<v Speaker 3>female criteria all respondents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The correlation between socioeconomic</v>

3022
02:35:14.141 --> 02:35:16.480
<v Speaker 3>status and frequency of simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners.</v>

3023
02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.710
<v Speaker 3>For men it's point five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the higher the status of the man man,</v>

3024
02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 3>the more likely yes simultaneous sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners,</v>

3025
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:26.440
<v Speaker 3>so it means he's going out with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually at the same time.</v>

3026
02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:28.210
<v Speaker 3>For men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's point four,</v>

3027
02:35:28.211 --> 02:35:32.080
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Women it's zero age 30 and over</v>

3028
02:35:32.081 --> 02:35:36.760
<v Speaker 3>correlation between socioeconomic status</v>
<v Speaker 3>and frequency of simultaneous partners.</v>

3029
02:35:36.970 --> 02:35:39.670
<v Speaker 3>For men it's point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Women it's zero</v>

3030
02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 3>age 30 to 39.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The correlation between socioeconomic</v>

3031
02:35:45.101 --> 02:35:48.100
<v Speaker 3>status for women and frequency of</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneous partners.</v>

3032
02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:51.580
<v Speaker 3>For men point nine two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very small end though.</v>

3033
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:52.930
<v Speaker 3>For Women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's point one,</v>

3034
02:35:52.931 --> 02:35:57.240
<v Speaker 3>one</v>
<v Speaker 3>female criteria.</v>

3035
02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:00.150
<v Speaker 3>For men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might reflect a tendency on the part</v>

3036
02:36:00.151 --> 02:36:03.870
<v Speaker 3>of females to choose high status</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners during their own reproductive</v>

3037
02:36:03.871 --> 02:36:05.850
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This might account,</v>

3038
02:36:05.970 --> 02:36:10.290
<v Speaker 3>especially for this strong relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>founded men between the age of 30 and 39</v>

3039
02:36:10.890 --> 02:36:14.760
<v Speaker 3>women who typically prefer men three to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years older than they are,</v>

3040
02:36:14.761 --> 02:36:16.650
<v Speaker 3>would then be in their mid to late</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>

3041
02:36:16.651 --> 02:36:20.250
<v Speaker 3>a time when accountability and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity to male resources is at its</v>

3042
02:36:20.251 --> 02:36:21.084
<v Speaker 3>peak</v>

3043
02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:26.650
<v Speaker 3>supporting evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that,</v>

3044
02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:29.020
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that women pick man for</v>

3045
02:36:29.021 --> 02:36:31.880
<v Speaker 3>the socioeconomic status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that women pick men for the</v>

3046
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:36.370
<v Speaker 3>ability to climb the status hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we forced women in an experiment</v>

3047
02:36:36.371 --> 02:36:39.220
<v Speaker 3>that we never published to choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>between those two things.</v>

3048
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Wealth versus ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The women overwhelmingly chose ability.</v>

3049
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 3>They just use wealth as a marker of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

3050
02:36:45.890 --> 02:36:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an honors thesis and often honors</v>

3051
02:36:51.191 --> 02:36:52.960
<v Speaker 3>thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're publishable,</v>

3052
02:36:52.961 --> 02:36:56.500
<v Speaker 3>drift into the thing all do next month</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they stay there forever.</v>

3053
02:36:56.990 --> 02:37:00.040
<v Speaker 3>So because it's a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually quite hard to turn an</v>

3054
02:37:00.041 --> 02:37:04.060
<v Speaker 3>honors thesis into a publishable paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if there isn't some single person</v>

3055
02:37:04.061 --> 02:37:06.970
<v Speaker 3>driving that forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's it's not going to happen.</v>

3056
02:37:07.390 --> 02:37:10.810
<v Speaker 3>So that that was the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3057
02:37:10.811 --> 02:37:15.530
<v Speaker 3>so trevor's parental investment model</v>
<v Speaker 3>contends that women are more likely than</v>

3058
02:37:15.531 --> 02:37:18.650
<v Speaker 3>men to seek a mate who possesses</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonphysical characteristics that</v>

3059
02:37:18.651 --> 02:37:22.010
<v Speaker 3>maximize the survival or reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 3>prospects of their Osprey,</v>

3060
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:27.070
<v Speaker 3>and we're examining in a Meta analysis</v>
<v Speaker 3>of meat selection research as predicted,</v>

3061
02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>women accorded more weight than men to</v>
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic status of ambitiousness</v>

3062
02:37:32.091 --> 02:37:35.360
<v Speaker 3>character and intelligence and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger differences.</v>

3063
02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Largest Jeff gender differences were</v>
<v Speaker 3>observed for cues to resource</v>

3064
02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 3>acquistion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acquisition status and ambitiousness.</v>

3065
02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll also as predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender preferences were not found in</v>

3066
02:37:46.101 --> 02:37:49.310
<v Speaker 3>preferences for characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrelated to progeny survival,</v>

3067
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:52.220
<v Speaker 3>like sense of humor in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality</v>

3068
02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:55.430
<v Speaker 3>were valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparisons could be made.</v>

3069
02:37:55.431 --> 02:37:58.070
<v Speaker 3>The findings were generally invariant</v>
<v Speaker 3>across generations,</v>

3070
02:37:58.071 --> 02:38:03.071
<v Speaker 3>cultures and research paradigms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to this next one.</v>

3071
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3072
02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:10.690
<v Speaker 3>so here's some correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is between how much money</v>

3073
02:38:10.691 --> 02:38:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you make and your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the correlation between neuroticism</v>

3074
02:38:15.551 --> 02:38:17.860
<v Speaker 3>and how much money you get paid as</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative point three.</v>

3075
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:20.890
<v Speaker 3>The higher you are in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less you make,</v>

3076
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:22.750
<v Speaker 3>less you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3077
02:38:27.810 --> 02:38:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3078
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:32.880
<v Speaker 3>because you're not confident in your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities.</v>

3079
02:38:33.570 --> 02:38:36.480
<v Speaker 3>You have low self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're not confident in your own</v>

3080
02:38:36.481 --> 02:38:38.760
<v Speaker 3>abilities and you're anxious about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>

3081
02:38:39.570 --> 02:38:43.560
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel confident and calm about</v>

3082
02:38:43.561 --> 02:38:47.400
<v Speaker 3>negotiating for more money or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking for a raise is quite low.</v>

3083
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Extraversion and money made virtually no</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>

3084
02:38:52.251 --> 02:38:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no correlation.</v>

3085
02:38:53.421 --> 02:38:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Agreeableness negative point two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For now,</v>

3086
02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:58.970
<v Speaker 3>you might not think that those</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlations are very large,</v>

3087
02:38:58.971 --> 02:39:02.690
<v Speaker 3>but if the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism and money made is negative.</v>

3088
02:39:02.691 --> 02:39:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Point three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you translate that into an effect</v>

3089
02:39:05.721 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is called the binomial</v>

3090
02:39:07.191 --> 02:39:11.600
<v Speaker 3>effect size distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the effect of neuroticism will</v>

3091
02:39:11.601 --> 02:39:16.601
<v Speaker 3>ensure that 65 percent of men make more</v>
<v Speaker 3>money than average on 35 percent of</v>

3092
02:39:17.421 --> 02:39:21.830
<v Speaker 3>women make more money than average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the effect of neuroticism and if</v>

3093
02:39:21.831 --> 02:39:24.560
<v Speaker 3>you add neuroticism and agreeableness</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

3094
02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:26.720
<v Speaker 3>I have to do the math because I have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>square.</v>

3095
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I take the square root,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point five,</v>

3096
02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:32.570
<v Speaker 6>point five,</v>

3097
02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that in front of a class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately it's going to push it up</v>

3098
02:39:41.351 --> 02:39:43.480
<v Speaker 3>to about 70 slash 30 or higher than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3099
02:39:44.890 --> 02:39:47.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of a negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation between conscious</v>

3100
02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:51.670
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and money made</v>
<v Speaker 3>ascendancy.</v>

3101
02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:54.850
<v Speaker 3>How well you progress up the rates?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3102
02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I didn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look in detail into the models</v>

3103
02:40:05.281 --> 02:40:07.080
<v Speaker 3>they use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was just going to stick to the zero</v>

3104
02:40:07.081 --> 02:40:12.081
<v Speaker 3>order correlations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so ascendancy negative point one for</v>

3105
02:40:13.591 --> 02:40:15.540
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Negative point one,</v>

3106
02:40:15.541 --> 02:40:17.070
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

3107
02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The effects are larger if you total</v>

3108
02:40:22.971 --> 02:40:25.250
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3109
02:40:26.090 --> 02:40:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Here's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something to think about.</v>

3110
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Job Satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The correlation with neuroticism is</v>

3111
02:40:33.561 --> 02:40:35.400
<v Speaker 3>negative point four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

3112
02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:38.330
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's very</v>

3113
02:40:38.331 --> 02:40:41.540
<v Speaker 3>interesting about eroticism is it's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very good predictor of marital</v>

3114
02:40:41.541 --> 02:40:46.370
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction and it's interesting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that light to note that 70 percent of</v>

3115
02:40:46.371 --> 02:40:48.680
<v Speaker 3>divorces are initiated by women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3116
02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:53.800
<v Speaker 3>one reason for that is that men are</v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible get along with and the other</v>

3117
02:40:54.081 --> 02:40:57.140
<v Speaker 3>possibility is that women are too</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive to that and there's no way of</v>

3118
02:40:57.141 --> 02:40:59.960
<v Speaker 3>sorting that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's nonetheless interesting to note</v>

3119
02:40:59.961 --> 02:41:02.090
<v Speaker 3>that that's still where the gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference lies.</v>

3120
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation with job satisfaction,</v>

3121
02:41:07.681 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 3>negative point for two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation with life satisfaction,</v>

3122
02:41:10.471 --> 02:41:13.560
<v Speaker 3>negative point for two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation with career satisfaction,</v>

3123
02:41:13.561 --> 02:41:14.820
<v Speaker 3>negative point four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3124
02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:20.130
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember is that almost all the measures</v>

3125
02:41:20.131 --> 02:41:24.600
<v Speaker 3>that purport to measure something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing or happiness or satisfaction</v>

3126
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:28.830
<v Speaker 3>are so contaminated with neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not even clear that they're</v>

3127
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:33.420
<v Speaker 3>measuring something different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see agreeableness.</v>

3128
02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:36.960
<v Speaker 3>The correlation with career satisfaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>is negative point two,</v>

3129
02:41:40.450 --> 02:41:45.450
<v Speaker 3>if you get men to rate their performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get their bosses to rate their</v>

3130
02:41:45.551 --> 02:41:48.520
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men rate their performance pretty much</v>

3131
02:41:48.521 --> 02:41:51.910
<v Speaker 3>the same as the boss is rate their</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance or maybe they rate them a</v>

3132
02:41:51.911 --> 02:41:54.460
<v Speaker 3>little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if women raped their own</v>

3133
02:41:54.461 --> 02:41:57.190
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rate their own performance as worse</v>

3134
02:41:57.191 --> 02:42:00.040
<v Speaker 3>than their bosses rating of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance consistently,</v>

3135
02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:03.670
<v Speaker 3>and the predictor of that seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative emotionality.</v>

3136
02:42:08.190 --> 02:42:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Now you might wonder if negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionality is something that's</v>

3137
02:42:11.941 --> 02:42:16.941
<v Speaker 3>associated with lower levels of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction across a broad variety of</v>

3138
02:42:17.251 --> 02:42:20.160
<v Speaker 3>measures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What possible use could it be,</v>

3139
02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3140
02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:28.580
<v Speaker 3>exactly how is the physical environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>different for women and for men and one</v>

3141
02:42:29.730 --> 02:42:33.960
<v Speaker 3>clearer fact is that at an individual</v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

3142
02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:38.490
<v Speaker 3>at least in relationship to dominance</v>
<v Speaker 3>battles with men,</v>

3143
02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.210
<v Speaker 3>women are at a disadvantage not least</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of their size.</v>

3144
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:50.750
<v Speaker 11>Here's another,</v>
<v Speaker 11>here's another something worth</v>

3145
02:42:50.751 --> 02:42:52.490
<v Speaker 11>considering.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't know how important it is,</v>

3146
02:42:52.491 --> 02:42:56.300
<v Speaker 11>but it might be really important.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It depends on how important this is.</v>

3147
02:42:56.301 --> 02:42:59.060
<v Speaker 11>Something that Carl Young said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so it depends on how important.</v>

3148
02:42:59.061 --> 02:43:04.061
<v Speaker 11>Youngest now,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Freud established the field of</v>

3149
02:43:04.131 --> 02:43:09.131
<v Speaker 11>psychoanalysis and with an investigation</v>
<v Speaker 11>I would say rigorous investigation into</v>

3150
02:43:10.641 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 11>the contents,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the unconscious,</v>

3151
02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:15.190
<v Speaker 11>a modern psychologists and psychiatrists</v>
<v Speaker 11>like to,</v>

3152
02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:19.220
<v Speaker 11>what would you say denigrate Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but uh,</v>

3153
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 11>and I think there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think that Freud's fundamental</v>

3154
02:43:22.031 --> 02:43:25.570
<v Speaker 11>insights were so profound and so</v>
<v Speaker 11>valuable that they got immediately</v>

3155
02:43:25.571 --> 02:43:29.070
<v Speaker 11>absorbed into our culture and now they</v>
<v Speaker 11>seem self evident and so that all that's</v>

3156
02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:33.490
<v Speaker 11>left of Freud is his errors because we</v>
<v Speaker 11>believe everything else,</v>

3157
02:43:33.491 --> 02:43:35.560
<v Speaker 11>we believe all the profound things he</v>
<v Speaker 11>discovered,</v>

3158
02:43:35.561 --> 02:43:38.290
<v Speaker 11>we just take them for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so we don't believe the things that</v>

3159
02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:42.790
<v Speaker 11>he said that weren't quite on the money</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's all we credit with him with</v>

3160
02:43:42.791 --> 02:43:45.100
<v Speaker 11>now.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But he was certainly the first person</v>

3161
02:43:45.101 --> 02:43:49.960
<v Speaker 11>who brought up the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>unconscious in a rigorous manner and he</v>

3162
02:43:49.961 --> 02:43:53.920
<v Speaker 11>was the first person to do a rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 11>examination of dreams because the</v>

3163
02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:55.720
<v Speaker 11>interpretation of dreams is a great</v>
<v Speaker 11>book.</v>

3164
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:59.110
<v Speaker 11>It's well worth reading.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And he was the first person to note that</v>

3165
02:43:59.111 --> 02:44:04.000
<v Speaker 11>people were in some sense inhabited by</v>
<v Speaker 11>subpersonalities that had a certain</v>

3166
02:44:04.001 --> 02:44:08.290
<v Speaker 11>degree of autonomy and independent life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Brilliant observation,</v>

3167
02:44:08.291 --> 02:44:10.330
<v Speaker 11>the cognitive psychologists haven't</v>
<v Speaker 11>caught up with that at all,</v>

3168
02:44:10.331 --> 02:44:11.164
<v Speaker 11>yet.</v>

3169
02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:19.080
<v Speaker 11>Ewan was profoundly affected by Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Jung was profoundly affected by nature</v>

3170
02:44:19.081 --> 02:44:21.990
<v Speaker 11>and by Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Those were his two main intellectual</v>

3171
02:44:23.130 --> 02:44:26.220
<v Speaker 11>influences.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't think one more than the other.</v>

3172
02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:31.080
<v Speaker 11>He split with Freud on the religious</v>
<v Speaker 11>issue.</v>

3173
02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:34.290
<v Speaker 11>That was what caused the disruption in</v>
<v Speaker 11>their relationship,</v>

3174
02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:37.920
<v Speaker 11>and I think it's an extremely</v>
<v Speaker 11>interesting historical occurrence.</v>

3175
02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:43.590
<v Speaker 11>It might be a profound significance.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Freud believed that the fundamental myth</v>

3176
02:44:43.681 --> 02:44:46.230
<v Speaker 11>of the human being was the Eda Pole</v>
<v Speaker 11>Myth,</v>

3177
02:44:46.770 --> 02:44:51.720
<v Speaker 11>and the myth from a broader perspective</v>
<v Speaker 11>is a failed hero's story.</v>

3178
02:44:52.410 --> 02:44:57.410
<v Speaker 11>So the eatable myth is the myth of a man</v>
<v Speaker 11>who develops who grows up but then</v>

3179
02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:01.620
<v Speaker 11>accidentally becomes too close to his</v>
<v Speaker 11>mother,</v>

3180
02:45:01.650 --> 02:45:04.050
<v Speaker 11>sleeps with her.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't know who she is,</v>

3181
02:45:04.051 --> 02:45:07.620
<v Speaker 11>and as a consequence blinds himself and</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's a,</v>

3182
02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.220
<v Speaker 11>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's a warning about human</v>

3183
02:45:11.221 --> 02:45:15.240
<v Speaker 11>development going wrong in that story.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And I think that Freud put his finger on</v>

3184
02:45:15.241 --> 02:45:19.680
<v Speaker 11>it extraordinarily well because human</v>
<v Speaker 11>beings have a very long period of</v>

3185
02:45:19.681 --> 02:45:20.514
<v Speaker 11>dependency.</v>

3186
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:25.470
<v Speaker 11>And one of the things that you do see in</v>
<v Speaker 11>clinical practice is that many people's</v>

3187
02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:30.500
<v Speaker 11>problems are associated with their</v>
<v Speaker 11>inability to break free of their family,</v>

3188
02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:33.840
<v Speaker 11>like they're consumed by the family</v>
<v Speaker 11>drama,</v>

3189
02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:36.090
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>They can't get beyond what happened to</v>

3190
02:45:36.091 --> 02:45:38.940
<v Speaker 11>them in their family.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They're stuck in the past.</v>

3191
02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:40.193
<v Speaker 11>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's,</v>

3192
02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:44.910
<v Speaker 11>that's equivalent symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you might say to the idea of being too</v>

3193
02:45:44.911 --> 02:45:46.290
<v Speaker 11>close to your mother of,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of,</v>

3194
02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:49.810
<v Speaker 11>of the boundaries being improperly</v>
<v Speaker 11>specified.</v>

3195
02:45:49.811 --> 02:45:52.770
<v Speaker 11>And that happens far more often than</v>
<v Speaker 11>anyone would like to think.</v>

3196
02:45:54.270 --> 02:45:54.941
<v Speaker 11>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Freud,</v>

3197
02:45:54.941 --> 02:45:59.700
<v Speaker 11>I thought it was a universal,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but you see,</v>

3198
02:45:59.701 --> 02:46:02.880
<v Speaker 11>he had a different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And his idea was that it wasn't the</v>

3199
02:46:02.881 --> 02:46:05.610
<v Speaker 11>failed hero story.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That was the universal human myth.</v>

3200
02:46:05.850 --> 02:46:09.950
<v Speaker 11>It was the successful hero's story.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's a difference.</v>

3201
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:15.310
<v Speaker 11>I could seriously a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 11>because the successful hero's story is</v>

3202
02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:18.020
<v Speaker 11>remembering sleeping beauty.</v>

3203
02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:20.570
<v Speaker 11>You may remember this in the Disney</v>
<v Speaker 11>movie,</v>

3204
02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:24.440
<v Speaker 11>the evil queen traps the prince in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>dungeon and she's not going to let them</v>

3205
02:46:24.441 --> 02:46:26.000
<v Speaker 11>out till he's old.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Right?</v>

3206
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:29.420
<v Speaker 11>And so there's this comical scene where</v>
<v Speaker 11>she's down in the dungeon,</v>

3207
02:46:29.421 --> 02:46:31.580
<v Speaker 11>he's all in chains and she's laughing at</v>
<v Speaker 11>him,</v>

3208
02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:34.160
<v Speaker 11>telling him what his future is going to</v>
<v Speaker 11>be like.</v>

3209
02:46:34.210 --> 02:46:37.130
<v Speaker 11>She's quite evil and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>she,</v>

3210
02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:40.970
<v Speaker 11>she paints this wonderful picture of him</v>
<v Speaker 11>being freed in like 80 years and</v>

3211
02:46:40.971 --> 02:46:44.110
<v Speaker 11>hobbling out of the castle on his horse</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's so old,</v>

3212
02:46:44.111 --> 02:46:46.170
<v Speaker 11>he can barely stand up in him with gray</v>
<v Speaker 11>hair.</v>

3213
02:46:46.171 --> 02:46:47.270
<v Speaker 11>And,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and you know,</v>

3214
02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.560
<v Speaker 11>she recites the story of his eventual</v>
<v Speaker 11>triumphant departure from the castle as</v>

3215
02:46:53.031 --> 02:46:56.540
<v Speaker 11>a old and decrepit man.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And she has a great laugh about it.</v>

3216
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:58.100
<v Speaker 11>And it's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3217
02:46:58.101 --> 02:47:00.830
<v Speaker 11>it's a real punchy story.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's really something wonderful for</v>

3218
02:47:00.831 --> 02:47:03.530
<v Speaker 11>children.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That story and</v>

3219
02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:10.030
<v Speaker 11>he gets free of the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of the shackles and the things that free</v>

3220
02:47:11.251 --> 02:47:11.340
<v Speaker 11>him.</v>

3221
02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:14.810
<v Speaker 11>Our three little female fairies.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's the positive aspect of the feminine</v>

3222
02:47:14.811 --> 02:47:16.800
<v Speaker 11>that frees him from the dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's so.</v>

3223
02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:20.300
<v Speaker 11>It's very interesting and very accurate</v>
<v Speaker 11>from a psychological perspective.</v>

3224
02:47:20.301 --> 02:47:23.660
<v Speaker 11>It's the negative element of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>feminine that encapsulates him in the</v>

3225
02:47:23.661 --> 02:47:25.160
<v Speaker 11>dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it's the positive element of the</v>

3226
02:47:25.161 --> 02:47:27.970
<v Speaker 11>feminine that frees him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then he,</v>

3227
02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:31.490
<v Speaker 11>he has a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The Evil Queen is not very happy when he</v>

3228
02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:33.680
<v Speaker 11>escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You may remember that she stands on top</v>

3229
02:47:33.681 --> 02:47:38.240
<v Speaker 11>of her castle tower and starts to spin</v>
<v Speaker 11>off cosmic sparks.</v>

3230
02:47:38.241 --> 02:47:40.610
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>she's quite the creature enveloped in</v>

3231
02:47:40.611 --> 02:47:44.810
<v Speaker 11>flame and then she turns into a dragon</v>
<v Speaker 11>and she then the prince has to fight</v>

3232
02:47:44.811 --> 02:47:49.811
<v Speaker 11>with her in order to make contact with</v>
<v Speaker 11>sleeping beauty and an awakened her from</v>

3233
02:47:51.621 --> 02:47:56.621
<v Speaker 11>her comatose existence as her</v>
<v Speaker 11>unconscious existence and</v>

3234
02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:03.690
<v Speaker 11>wants a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's a brilliant representation of a</v>

3235
02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:05.660
<v Speaker 11>successful hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He,</v>

3236
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:12.010
<v Speaker 11>he doesn't end up staying in an unholy</v>
<v Speaker 11>relationship with his mother.</v>

3237
02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.280
<v Speaker 11>Let's say he escapes and then conquers</v>
<v Speaker 11>the worst thing that can be imagined and</v>

3238
02:48:21.411 --> 02:48:23.540
<v Speaker 11>is ennobled by that and that as a</v>
<v Speaker 11>consequence,</v>

3239
02:48:23.541 --> 02:48:28.541
<v Speaker 11>he's able to wake the slumbering</v>
<v Speaker 11>feminine from its coma and that's a</v>

3240
02:48:30.021 --> 02:48:33.620
<v Speaker 11>union story and that's the story that he</v>
<v Speaker 11>juxtaposed against Freud.</v>

3241
02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:39.140
<v Speaker 11>Freud thought of religious phenomena as</v>
<v Speaker 11>part of an occult tide.</v>

3242
02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.590
<v Speaker 11>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that would drown rationale rationality.</v>

3243
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:47.720
<v Speaker 11>That's why Freud was so valiantly</v>
<v Speaker 11>antireligious and you thought,</v>

3244
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:50.210
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's not the case.</v>

3245
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:52.040
<v Speaker 11>You're throwing the baby out with the</v>
<v Speaker 11>bathwater.</v>

3246
02:48:52.310 --> 02:48:56.480
<v Speaker 11>There's something profound and central</v>
<v Speaker 11>to the hero.</v>

3247
02:48:56.481 --> 02:49:01.481
<v Speaker 11>Myth and union clinical work is</v>
<v Speaker 11>essentially the awakening of the hero</v>

3248
02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:07.800
<v Speaker 11>myth in the in the analysis and in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>client or the patient</v>

3249
02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:13.340
<v Speaker 12>to conceptualize yourself as that which</v>
<v Speaker 12>can confront chaos and triumph and that</v>

3250
02:49:13.861 --> 02:49:18.300
<v Speaker 12>that's associated with an ennobling of</v>
<v Speaker 12>the Sea of consciousness and the</v>

3251
02:49:18.301 --> 02:49:23.070
<v Speaker 12>establishment of proper positive</v>
<v Speaker 12>relationships between male and female.</v>

3252
02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:26.610
<v Speaker 12>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm a skeptical person.</v>

3253
02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:31.410
<v Speaker 12>I'm a very,</v>
<v Speaker 12>very skeptical person and I've tried</v>

3254
02:49:31.411 --> 02:49:35.920
<v Speaker 12>with every trick.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I have to put a lever underneath young</v>

3255
02:49:35.970 --> 02:49:39.680
<v Speaker 12>story and lifted up and disrupt it and</v>
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>

3256
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:43.080
<v Speaker 12>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think he was right in that Freud was</v>

3257
02:49:43.081 --> 02:49:43.711
<v Speaker 12>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

3258
02:49:43.711 --> 02:49:46.800
<v Speaker 12>I have great respect for Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think he got the progam problem</v>

3259
02:49:46.801 --> 02:49:50.370
<v Speaker 12>diagnosed very,</v>
<v Speaker 12>very nicely and in my clinical work,</v>

3260
02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:54.150
<v Speaker 12>I see the phenomena that Freud described</v>
<v Speaker 12>emerge continually,</v>

3261
02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:57.450
<v Speaker 12>constantly the best.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If you're interested in that,</v>

3262
02:49:57.810 --> 02:50:00.420
<v Speaker 12>there's a documentary you should watch.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I may have mentioned it before.</v>

3263
02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:02.400
<v Speaker 12>I think it's the best documentary ever</v>
<v Speaker 12>made.</v>

3264
02:50:02.430 --> 02:50:03.900
<v Speaker 12>Certainly the best one I've ever seen.</v>

3265
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:08.040
<v Speaker 12>It's called crumb and it's about a</v>
<v Speaker 12>underground cartoonists.</v>

3266
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:11.670
<v Speaker 12>Robert Crumb who who is part of the</v>
<v Speaker 12>hippie movement in,</v>

3267
02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:15.310
<v Speaker 12>although he hated hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he was part of the hippie movement in</v>

3268
02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:17.970
<v Speaker 12>the sixties in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and started the entire underground</v>

3269
02:50:17.971 --> 02:50:22.350
<v Speaker 12>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what culture that that manifested itself</v>

3270
02:50:22.351 --> 02:50:27.351
<v Speaker 12>eventually in graphic novels who's quite</v>
<v Speaker 12>a significant figure from the</v>

3271
02:50:28.141 --> 02:50:33.060
<v Speaker 12>perspective of popular art and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 12>very intelligent man and also I would</v>

3272
02:50:33.061 --> 02:50:36.270
<v Speaker 12>say a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 12>although a very bent and depraved and</v>

3273
02:50:36.271 --> 02:50:39.720
<v Speaker 12>warped one,</v>
<v Speaker 12>someone very acutely aware of his own</v>

3274
02:50:39.721 --> 02:50:44.721
<v Speaker 12>shadow and the documentary outlines his</v>
<v Speaker 12>attempts to escape from his absolutely</v>

3275
02:50:46.591 --> 02:50:51.570
<v Speaker 12>dreadful mother and the failure of his</v>
<v Speaker 12>two brothers to do the same thing.</v>

3276
02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:55.680
<v Speaker 12>One of whom ended up as a street beggar</v>
<v Speaker 12>in San Francisco and the other who drank</v>

3277
02:50:55.681 --> 02:50:58.830
<v Speaker 12>furniture Polish and died six months</v>
<v Speaker 12>after the documentary was produced.</v>

3278
02:50:59.010 --> 02:51:01.740
<v Speaker 12>It's an unbelievably shocking</v>
<v Speaker 12>documentary.</v>

3279
02:51:01.950 --> 02:51:06.950
<v Speaker 12>It's the only piece of film that I've</v>
<v Speaker 12>ever seen that captures Friday and</v>

3280
02:51:08.791 --> 02:51:09.624
<v Speaker 12>pathology.</v>

3281
02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:12.480
<v Speaker 12>I've never seen anything because he</v>
<v Speaker 12>can't see it generally,</v>

3282
02:51:12.481 --> 02:51:16.290
<v Speaker 12>unless you're in a clinical situation,</v>
<v Speaker 12>unless you know the details of someone's</v>

3283
02:51:16.291 --> 02:51:18.180
<v Speaker 12>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the personal intimate details,</v>

3284
02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:23.040
<v Speaker 12>you cannot communicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But the documentary as who made the film</v>

3285
02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:25.320
<v Speaker 12>was Robert Zweig off,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if I remember correctly,</v>

3286
02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:29.430
<v Speaker 12>was a friend of the crumbs and so he got</v>
<v Speaker 12>access in a way that no one else would</v>

3287
02:51:29.431 --> 02:51:31.320
<v Speaker 12>have,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and they're also very forthright and</v>

3288
02:51:31.321 --> 02:51:33.870
<v Speaker 12>forthcoming about their situation in</v>
<v Speaker 12>general.</v>

3289
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:36.930
<v Speaker 12>I would highly recommend that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's a real punch.</v>

3290
02:51:37.050 --> 02:51:42.050
<v Speaker 12>If you want to know how a rapist thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like if you actually want to know,</v>

3291
02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:44.370
<v Speaker 12>because maybe you don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>In fact,</v>

3292
02:51:44.371 --> 02:51:46.740
<v Speaker 12>you probably don't want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

3293
02:51:46.741 --> 02:51:50.310
<v Speaker 12>Because do you really want to know that?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Because to understand that means to put</v>

3294
02:51:50.311 --> 02:51:52.230
<v Speaker 12>yourself in that position and to</v>
<v Speaker 12>understand it.</v>

3295
02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:57.440
<v Speaker 12>If you really want to know how a serial</v>
<v Speaker 12>sexual Predator thinks and why.</v>

3296
02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:02.960
<v Speaker 12>If you watch crum and you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you'll know and that's only a tiny bit</v>

3297
02:52:03.841 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 12>of what the film has to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's really</v>

3298
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:09.250
<v Speaker 11>quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Anyways,</v>

3299
02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:18.180
<v Speaker 11>young split with Freud on the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 11>the Interpol story as the fundamental</v>

3300
02:52:20.021 --> 02:52:25.021
<v Speaker 11>myth of humankind and on the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 11>the validity of the religious viewpoint</v>

3301
02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:30.940
<v Speaker 11>and young came down heavily on the side</v>
<v Speaker 11>of the validity of the religious</v>

3302
02:52:30.941 --> 02:52:33.310
<v Speaker 11>viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And he established that in a book called</v>

3303
02:52:33.311 --> 02:52:36.610
<v Speaker 11>symbols of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which was written in 1914,</v>

3304
02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:40.390
<v Speaker 11>and that's the book that broke,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that produced the break permanent split</v>

3305
02:52:40.391 --> 02:52:44.620
<v Speaker 11>with Freud and that book,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I would say that books actually been</v>

3306
02:52:44.621 --> 02:52:48.970
<v Speaker 11>written three times.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was written as symbols of trip four</v>

3307
02:52:48.971 --> 02:52:50.650
<v Speaker 11>times written as symbols of</v>
<v Speaker 11>transformation,</v>

3308
02:52:50.651 --> 02:52:52.780
<v Speaker 11>which young extensively revised when he</v>
<v Speaker 11>was old,</v>

3309
02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:57.940
<v Speaker 11>and then it was rewritten in is in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>sense by a student of young's called</v>

3310
02:52:57.941 --> 02:53:01.090
<v Speaker 11>Eric Norman,</v>
<v Speaker 11>who is also something someone I would</v>

3311
02:53:01.091 --> 02:53:02.530
<v Speaker 11>really recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Eric Norman,</v>

3312
02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:07.210
<v Speaker 11>I think is [inaudible] greatest student.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And he wrote two books.</v>

3313
02:53:07.211 --> 02:53:09.670
<v Speaker 11>He wrote one called the origins and</v>
<v Speaker 11>history of consciousness,</v>

3314
02:53:09.970 --> 02:53:13.090
<v Speaker 11>which is a description of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>development of consciousness out of</v>

3315
02:53:13.091 --> 02:53:16.360
<v Speaker 11>unconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 11>using the hero myth as a,</v>

3316
02:53:16.810 --> 02:53:17.810
<v Speaker 11>as an,</v>
<v Speaker 11>as a,</v>

3317
02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:18.973
<v Speaker 11>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>as a,</v>

3318
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:21.700
<v Speaker 11>what would you say as a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>as an interpretive skeleton.</v>

3319
02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:26.700
<v Speaker 11>So we Newman viewed the hero myth as the</v>
<v Speaker 11>dramatized story of the emergence of</v>

3320
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:31.990
<v Speaker 11>human consciousness out of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>surrounding unconsciousness in which it</v>

3321
02:53:31.991 --> 02:53:34.360
<v Speaker 11>was embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The struggle for consciousness,</v>

3322
02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:37.030
<v Speaker 11>the struggle of consciousness upward</v>
<v Speaker 11>towards the light,</v>

3323
02:53:37.031 --> 02:53:41.670
<v Speaker 11>like a lotus flower struggles up through</v>
<v Speaker 11>the muck and they and the water to to</v>

3324
02:53:41.680 --> 02:53:45.790
<v Speaker 11>lay itself on the surface of the water</v>
<v Speaker 11>and and bloom and reveal the Buddha,</v>

3325
02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.340
<v Speaker 11>which is of course what the lotus flower</v>
<v Speaker 11>does from a symbolic perspective and</v>

3326
02:53:49.650 --> 02:53:50.980
<v Speaker 11>for,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for for Norman.</v>

3327
02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:54.080
<v Speaker 11>The hero's story was the story of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>development,</v>

3328
02:53:54.081 --> 02:53:56.800
<v Speaker 11>the successful development of</v>
<v Speaker 11>consciousness and the origins of</v>

3329
02:53:56.801 --> 02:53:59.500
<v Speaker 11>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The origins and history of consciousness</v>

3330
02:53:59.501 --> 02:54:02.170
<v Speaker 11>is a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Interestingly,</v>

3331
02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:07.510
<v Speaker 11>Camille Paglia row read the origins and</v>
<v Speaker 11>history of consciousness.</v>

3332
02:54:07.511 --> 02:54:12.220
<v Speaker 11>She's one of the few mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 11>intellectuals that I've ever encountered</v>

3333
02:54:12.221 --> 02:54:16.390
<v Speaker 11>who read that in commented on it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and she believed that it would be</v>

3334
02:54:16.391 --> 02:54:21.391
<v Speaker 11>sufficient antidote to postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 11>denigration of literature.</v>

3335
02:54:22.330 --> 02:54:26.920
<v Speaker 11>She thought it was that powerful a work,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I believe that.</v>

3336
02:54:26.921 --> 02:54:31.330
<v Speaker 11>I think it's a remarkable book.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Carl Jung wrote the foreword to that</v>

3337
02:54:31.331 --> 02:54:34.890
<v Speaker 11>book and he said in the forward that it</v>
<v Speaker 11>was the book that he wished he would</v>

3338
02:54:34.891 --> 02:54:36.850
<v Speaker 11>have written,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so sort of like young.</v>

3339
02:54:36.851 --> 02:54:38.920
<v Speaker 11>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't remember how many volumes,</v>

3340
02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:43.270
<v Speaker 11>dozens of very thick,</v>
<v Speaker 11>difficult volumes.</v>

3341
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:48.510
<v Speaker 11>It was like Norman was able to</v>
<v Speaker 11>distill those into a single volume</v>

3342
02:54:51.161 --> 02:54:52.750
<v Speaker 11>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and so I would also say if you're</v>

3343
02:54:52.751 --> 02:54:55.930
<v Speaker 11>interested in young,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the best book to read is the origins and</v>

3344
02:54:55.931 --> 02:54:59.950
<v Speaker 11>history of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's the best intro into into the union</v>

3345
02:54:59.951 --> 02:55:00.790
<v Speaker 11>world,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so you.</v>

3346
02:55:00.791 --> 02:55:04.460
<v Speaker 11>It's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very difficult to understand.</v>

3347
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:08.600
<v Speaker 11>It requires a real shift of perspective</v>
<v Speaker 11>in order to understand what he's talking</v>

3348
02:55:08.601 --> 02:55:11.630
<v Speaker 11>about,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and Norman wrote another book called the</v>

3349
02:55:11.631 --> 02:55:15.530
<v Speaker 11>great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is a little bit more specialized</v>

3350
02:55:15.531 --> 02:55:17.570
<v Speaker 11>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's also extremely interesting</v>

3351
02:55:17.571 --> 02:55:22.571
<v Speaker 11>because it flushes out the archetype of</v>
<v Speaker 11>chaos and its representation as feminine</v>

3352
02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:26.910
<v Speaker 11>and it's a brilliant book as well and</v>
<v Speaker 11>highly worth,</v>

3353
02:55:27.020 --> 02:55:28.700
<v Speaker 11>highly worth reading both those books.</v>

3354
02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:34.520
<v Speaker 11>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 11>young was a very strange person and a</v>

3355
02:55:34.521 --> 02:55:39.521
<v Speaker 11>visionary and and so that's kept them</v>
<v Speaker 11>outside of the academic realm almost</v>

3356
02:55:40.821 --> 02:55:41.654
<v Speaker 11>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

3357
02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:44.570
<v Speaker 11>I was constantly warned as an</v>
<v Speaker 11>undergraduate and then a graduate</v>

3358
02:55:44.571 --> 02:55:49.571
<v Speaker 11>student and then a professor against</v>
<v Speaker 11>ever talking about young in any way</v>

3359
02:55:50.301 --> 02:55:52.940
<v Speaker 11>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 11>When I went on the job market,</v>

3360
02:55:52.941 --> 02:55:55.640
<v Speaker 11>when I was at mcgill,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when I had graduated from mcgill,</v>

3361
02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:58.280
<v Speaker 11>I had done my scientific research in</v>
<v Speaker 11>Anelka,</v>

3362
02:55:58.281 --> 02:56:00.200
<v Speaker 11>holism,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I had a fairly lengthy publication</v>

3363
02:56:00.201 --> 02:56:05.201
<v Speaker 11>record that was pure empirical research</v>
<v Speaker 11>and really neuro physiological research</v>

3364
02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:11.770
<v Speaker 11>into the pharmacology of alcoholism and</v>
<v Speaker 11>I established a reasonably solid dossier</v>

3365
02:56:14.490 --> 02:56:16.940
<v Speaker 11>publications,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but at the same time I was writing this</v>

3366
02:56:16.941 --> 02:56:20.450
<v Speaker 11>book that became maps of meaning and so</v>
<v Speaker 11>I split my time in graduate student</v>

3367
02:56:20.510 --> 02:56:25.510
<v Speaker 11>school between these two endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One very specifically neurological and</v>

3368
02:56:25.611 --> 02:56:30.611
<v Speaker 11>pharmacological and really biologically</v>
<v Speaker 11>based on the other very abstract,</v>

3369
02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:32.450
<v Speaker 11>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 11>symbolic,</v>

3370
02:56:32.451 --> 02:56:35.210
<v Speaker 11>psychoanalytic,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the complete opposite,</v>

3371
02:56:35.211 --> 02:56:39.020
<v Speaker 11>but I could see that the two things</v>
<v Speaker 11>overlapped really nicely and there was a</v>

3372
02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:43.970
<v Speaker 11>number of scientists at the time that</v>
<v Speaker 11>we're also drawing the same conclusions.</v>

3373
02:56:43.970 --> 02:56:47.830
<v Speaker 11>The same relationship between the</v>
<v Speaker 11>biology and the psychoanalysis.</v>

3374
02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:50.690
<v Speaker 11>Jaak Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 11>who wrote a book called an affective</v>

3375
02:56:50.691 --> 02:56:52.670
<v Speaker 11>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is a great classic,</v>

3376
02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:58.060
<v Speaker 11>is one of those people who who saw the</v>
<v Speaker 11>relationship between the neurobiology of</v>

3377
02:56:58.311 --> 02:57:02.810
<v Speaker 11>emotion and motivation and the</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychoanalytic insights never became a</v>

3378
02:57:02.811 --> 02:57:04.850
<v Speaker 11>mainstream view.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But I think it's too complex.</v>

3379
02:57:04.851 --> 02:57:09.710
<v Speaker 11>I think that bridging the gap between</v>
<v Speaker 11>the biology and the and the symbolic is</v>

3380
02:57:09.770 --> 02:57:11.830
<v Speaker 11>too much for people generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3381
02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.530
<v Speaker 11>it was certainly virtually too much for</v>
<v Speaker 11>me because I got quite ill when I was a</v>

3382
02:57:15.531 --> 02:57:18.290
<v Speaker 11>graduate student.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think for a variety of reasons.</v>

3383
02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.500
<v Speaker 11>I also would go out and party three</v>
<v Speaker 11>nights a week and so that probably had</v>

3384
02:57:21.501 --> 02:57:22.460
<v Speaker 11>something to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>

3385
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:28.100
<v Speaker 11>but working on those two things</v>
<v Speaker 11>simultaneously was also rather</v>

3386
02:57:28.101 --> 02:57:29.450
<v Speaker 11>exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>

3387
02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:34.940
<v Speaker 11>you was a tremendously insightful</v>
<v Speaker 11>clinician and he was a strange person.</v>

3388
02:57:34.970 --> 02:57:36.110
<v Speaker 11>Introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 11>visionary,</v>

3389
02:57:36.700 --> 02:57:38.210
<v Speaker 11>high and introversion.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Very,</v>

3390
02:57:38.211 --> 02:57:38.871
<v Speaker 11>very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very,</v>

3391
02:57:38.871 --> 02:57:40.400
<v Speaker 11>very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very high in openness.</v>

3392
02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:44.180
<v Speaker 11>Like off the charts and also God only</v>
<v Speaker 11>knows what his Iq was.</v>

3393
02:57:44.181 --> 02:57:46.370
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>every time I read it's like reading</v>

3394
02:57:46.371 --> 02:57:48.500
<v Speaker 11>Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's terrifying because you know,</v>

3395
02:57:48.501 --> 02:57:51.500
<v Speaker 11>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he's so damn smart that he can think up</v>

3396
02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:53.510
<v Speaker 11>answers to questions that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 11>even.</v>

3397
02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:55.700
<v Speaker 11>It's not like you don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 11>answers is the,</v>

3398
02:57:55.710 --> 02:57:58.070
<v Speaker 11>you never conceptualized the damn</v>
<v Speaker 11>questions.</v>

3399
02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:00.320
<v Speaker 11>It's really something to read.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Someone like that,</v>

3400
02:58:00.321 --> 02:58:01.350
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Who says,</v>

3401
02:58:01.351 --> 02:58:02.520
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>here's a mystery and you think,</v>

3402
02:58:02.521 --> 02:58:04.350
<v Speaker 11>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I never thought of that is a mystery,</v>

3403
02:58:04.351 --> 02:58:06.330
<v Speaker 11>and here's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>

3404
02:58:06.690 --> 02:58:07.560
<v Speaker 11>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's.</v>

3405
02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:10.140
<v Speaker 11>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's something you know,</v>

3406
02:58:10.141 --> 02:58:12.240
<v Speaker 11>and he could read Greek and he could</v>
<v Speaker 11>read.</v>

3407
02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:17.430
<v Speaker 11>He read all the ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He read a very large variety of ancient</v>

3408
02:58:17.431 --> 02:58:22.431
<v Speaker 11>languages and was very familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 11>entire corpus of of astrological thought</v>

3409
02:58:22.921 --> 02:58:27.921
<v Speaker 11>and of l chemical thought and of classic</v>
<v Speaker 11>literature and Biblical stories and been</v>

3410
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:35.000
<v Speaker 11>educated in a way that no one is</v>
<v Speaker 11>educated now and so he's very daunting</v>

3411
02:58:35.881 --> 02:58:40.080
<v Speaker 11>person to encounter and terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 11>absolutely terrifying.</v>

3412
02:58:40.081 --> 02:58:45.081
<v Speaker 11>His Book Ion,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is the second volume of the second</v>

3413
02:58:45.211 --> 02:58:47.220
<v Speaker 11>volume of volume nine,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is the archetypes of the</v>

3414
02:58:47.221 --> 02:58:50.070
<v Speaker 11>collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That damn book is just absolutely</v>

3415
02:58:50.071 --> 02:58:52.920
<v Speaker 11>terrifying because young,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he's one of these visionaries who can</v>

3416
02:58:52.921 --> 02:58:57.510
<v Speaker 11>see way underneath the social structures</v>
<v Speaker 11>and look at patterns that are developing</v>

3417
02:58:57.511 --> 02:59:02.070
<v Speaker 11>across for you in young's case across</v>
<v Speaker 11>thousands of years and lays them out and</v>

3418
02:59:02.071 --> 02:59:05.580
<v Speaker 11>so that's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's really something to to encounter.</v>

3419
02:59:05.610 --> 02:59:07.170
<v Speaker 11>Ion is a terrifying book.</v>

3420
02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:11.910
<v Speaker 11>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 11>one question might be,</v>

3421
02:59:11.911 --> 02:59:13.120
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>because I read the organ,</v>

3422
02:59:13.140 --> 02:59:14.790
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 11>how the hell did he know these things?</v>

3423
02:59:14.791 --> 02:59:18.210
<v Speaker 11>How could he figure these things out?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I can't understand how he could possibly</v>

3424
02:59:18.211 --> 02:59:20.550
<v Speaker 11>know these things.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

3425
02:59:20.551 --> 02:59:25.551
<v Speaker 11>here's a partial answer.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Young was a visionary,</v>

3426
02:59:26.310 --> 02:59:31.310
<v Speaker 11>and so what that means as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 11>tell and like we could do a little quick</v>

3427
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:34.560
<v Speaker 11>survey here.</v>
<v Speaker 11>How many of you think you think in words</v>

3428
02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:37.350
<v Speaker 11>can put up your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 11>do you think in words?</v>

3429
02:59:39.170 --> 02:59:40.190
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so it looks like.</v>

3430
02:59:40.610 --> 02:59:42.620
<v Speaker 11>What about pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 11>How many of you think in pictures?</v>

3431
02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:45.240
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so that's interesting.</v>

3432
02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:47.370
<v Speaker 11>How many of you think that's about half</v>
<v Speaker 11>and half by the way?</v>

3433
02:59:47.490 --> 02:59:50.550
<v Speaker 11>Probably a fewer on the word side.</v>
<v Speaker 11>How many of you think in pictures and</v>

3434
02:59:50.551 --> 02:59:51.384
<v Speaker 11>words?</v>

3435
02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:54.030
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so all right,</v>

3436
02:59:54.031 --> 02:59:56.310
<v Speaker 11>so it was roughly a third in each</v>
<v Speaker 11>category,</v>

3437
02:59:56.311 --> 03:00:01.311
<v Speaker 11>but that's also something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 11>haven't encountered any research on from</v>

3438
03:00:01.801 --> 03:00:03.810
<v Speaker 11>the neuropsychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>

3439
03:00:04.650 --> 03:00:08.130
<v Speaker 11>well do you think in pictures or do you</v>
<v Speaker 11>think ad words and and is that actually</v>

3440
03:00:08.131 --> 03:00:12.270
<v Speaker 11>a reliable distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think I think in words most of the</v>

3441
03:00:12.271 --> 03:00:14.820
<v Speaker 11>time,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I can think in pictures like if I'm</v>

3442
03:00:14.821 --> 03:00:17.850
<v Speaker 11>trying to build something that I can</v>
<v Speaker 11>think in pictures very almost</v>

3443
03:00:17.851 --> 03:00:20.040
<v Speaker 11>instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it isn't my natural mode of</v>

3444
03:00:20.041 --> 03:00:22.920
<v Speaker 11>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm hyperverbal and so my natural mode</v>

3445
03:00:22.921 --> 03:00:24.930
<v Speaker 11>of thinking is to think everything</v>
<v Speaker 11>through in words,</v>

3446
03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:28.740
<v Speaker 11>but I know my wife doesn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>She thinks in images and then it has to</v>

3447
03:00:28.741 --> 03:00:32.490
<v Speaker 11>translate them into words and so</v>
<v Speaker 11>anyways,</v>

3448
03:00:32.491 --> 03:00:35.250
<v Speaker 11>young was very literate and he could</v>
<v Speaker 11>really think in words,</v>

3449
03:00:35.251 --> 03:00:38.940
<v Speaker 11>but he could really think in images.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Also talking to my wife quite</v>

3450
03:00:38.941 --> 03:00:43.440
<v Speaker 11>extensively like her,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the intensity of her visualization</v>

3451
03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:45.120
<v Speaker 11>vastly exceeds mine.</v>

3452
03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:47.340
<v Speaker 11>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if I close my eyes and then try to</v>

3453
03:00:47.341 --> 03:00:52.341
<v Speaker 11>imagine the crowd in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's pretty low resolution and vague and</v>

3454
03:00:52.711 --> 03:00:55.260
<v Speaker 11>not brilliantly colored and vivid.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3455
03:00:55.290 --> 03:00:56.123
<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>

3456
03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.650
<v Speaker 11>it's like I'm seeing through a glass</v>
<v Speaker 11>darkly,</v>

3457
03:00:58.651 --> 03:01:01.180
<v Speaker 11>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I can't bring images to mind with that</v>

3458
03:01:01.210 --> 03:01:04.520
<v Speaker 11>with spectacular clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but my wife is very good at that and you</v>

3459
03:01:04.570 --> 03:01:09.460
<v Speaker 11>seem to be absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 11>a genius at that kind of thinking.</v>

3460
03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:12.580
<v Speaker 11>And he had a lot of visionaries in his</v>
<v Speaker 11>family history as well,</v>

3461
03:01:12.581 --> 03:01:16.180
<v Speaker 11>so I don't know to what degree there is</v>
<v Speaker 11>a hereditary component of that and I</v>

3462
03:01:16.181 --> 03:01:19.840
<v Speaker 11>don't know to what degree that's</v>
<v Speaker 11>actually a neurological specialization,</v>

3463
03:01:19.841 --> 03:01:23.710
<v Speaker 11>I presume it would be associated with</v>
<v Speaker 11>the trade.</v>

3464
03:01:23.711 --> 03:01:27.880
<v Speaker 11>Openness distinguishes itself,</v>
<v Speaker 11>differentiates itself into interest in</v>

3465
03:01:27.881 --> 03:01:32.080
<v Speaker 11>ideas and interest in aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And my suspicion is that the people who</v>

3466
03:01:32.081 --> 03:01:34.600
<v Speaker 11>are more interested in aesthetics are</v>
<v Speaker 11>the visionary types.</v>

3467
03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:38.500
<v Speaker 11>The ones that think in images anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 11>young could really think in images and</v>

3468
03:01:38.501 --> 03:01:43.501
<v Speaker 11>he could imagine beings.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And I had a client once who was a lucid</v>

3469
03:01:44.651 --> 03:01:48.610
<v Speaker 11>dreamer and how many of you have had a</v>
<v Speaker 11>lucid dream so you know you're dreaming</v>

3470
03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.800
<v Speaker 11>while you're many that that phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 11>wasn't really even even identified as a</v>

3471
03:01:54.551 --> 03:01:57.910
<v Speaker 11>phenomena until the end of the 19th</v>
<v Speaker 11>century.</v>

3472
03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.240
<v Speaker 11>There was a book written about it that</v>
<v Speaker 11>Freud tried to get his hands on but</v>

3473
03:02:01.241 --> 03:02:03.250
<v Speaker 11>couldn't because it was a very rare</v>
<v Speaker 11>book.</v>

3474
03:02:03.430 --> 03:02:07.750
<v Speaker 11>And then there was a researcher about 30</v>
<v Speaker 11>years ago who started to study lucid</v>

3475
03:02:07.751 --> 03:02:09.010
<v Speaker 11>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But anyways,</v>

3476
03:02:09.011 --> 03:02:13.120
<v Speaker 11>I had a client who was a lucid dreamer</v>
<v Speaker 11>and one of the things she could do was</v>

3477
03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:18.970
<v Speaker 11>ask her dream characters what</v>
<v Speaker 11>information they were trying to convey</v>

3478
03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:22.600
<v Speaker 11>and they would tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So that was very interesting.</v>

3479
03:02:22.930 --> 03:02:27.820
<v Speaker 11>And one of the consequences of that was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't have the story completely right</v>

3480
03:02:27.821 --> 03:02:29.260
<v Speaker 11>in my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's close enough.</v>

3481
03:02:30.190 --> 03:02:32.830
<v Speaker 11>She was afraid of a very large number of</v>
<v Speaker 11>things.</v>

3482
03:02:33.310 --> 03:02:37.300
<v Speaker 11>And in her dream,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think it was a gypsy standing by a</v>

3483
03:02:37.301 --> 03:02:41.830
<v Speaker 11>wagon,</v>
<v Speaker 11>told her that if she was going to be</v>

3484
03:02:41.831 --> 03:02:46.090
<v Speaker 11>successful in university,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that she would have to visit a</v>

3485
03:02:46.091 --> 03:02:49.390
<v Speaker 11>slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that was something that was way</v>

3486
03:02:49.391 --> 03:02:52.900
<v Speaker 11>beyond her capacity to tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 11>She was a vegetarian,</v>

3487
03:02:52.901 --> 03:02:54.910
<v Speaker 11>she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat</v>
<v Speaker 11>even.</v>

3488
03:02:55.300 --> 03:02:58.780
<v Speaker 11>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and she was very oppressed and depressed</v>

3489
03:02:58.781 --> 03:03:02.530
<v Speaker 11>and anxious because of the slaughter</v>
<v Speaker 11>house nature of existence.</v>

3490
03:03:02.860 --> 03:03:04.870
<v Speaker 11>And so her dream focused on that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And</v>

3491
03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:09.850
<v Speaker 11>one of the consequences of that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>because the slaughter house was out of</v>

3492
03:03:09.851 --> 03:03:12.670
<v Speaker 11>the question as a clinical intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

3493
03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:16.960
<v Speaker 11>I took her to an embalming,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

3494
03:03:16.961 --> 03:03:19.000
<v Speaker 11>Because cause I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I asked her what,</v>

3495
03:03:19.060 --> 03:03:22.060
<v Speaker 11>what,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what might be equivalent to that,</v>

3496
03:03:22.090 --> 03:03:24.960
<v Speaker 11>and so she suggested that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and you know,</v>

3497
03:03:24.970 --> 03:03:27.700
<v Speaker 11>exposure therapy is a hallmark of</v>
<v Speaker 11>clinical psychology,</v>

3498
03:03:27.701 --> 03:03:28.390
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

3499
03:03:28.390 --> 03:03:32.020
<v Speaker 11>One of the things you do with people as</v>
<v Speaker 11>a clinician is you find out what they're</v>

3500
03:03:32.021 --> 03:03:37.021
<v Speaker 11>afraid of and you gradually and</v>
<v Speaker 11>voluntarily expose them to that and that</v>

3501
03:03:37.031 --> 03:03:39.280
<v Speaker 11>cures them.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's associated with the hero</v>

3502
03:03:39.281 --> 03:03:39.701
<v Speaker 11>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

3503
03:03:39.701 --> 03:03:42.550
<v Speaker 11>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's like there's a dragon.</v>

3504
03:03:42.890 --> 03:03:45.220
<v Speaker 11>It's stopping you because there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 11>of dragons.</v>

3505
03:03:45.221 --> 03:03:47.320
<v Speaker 11>Most of them aren't stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You can ignore them.</v>

3506
03:03:47.380 --> 03:03:48.910
<v Speaker 11>You don't have to just go,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3507
03:03:49.420 --> 03:03:52.450
<v Speaker 11>slash away at randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You're not supposed to be fighting</v>

3508
03:03:52.451 --> 03:03:55.240
<v Speaker 11>dragons that aren't in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but if they are in your way,</v>

3509
03:03:55.241 --> 03:03:57.650
<v Speaker 11>you can't ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then you decompose them into sub</v>

3510
03:03:57.651 --> 03:04:02.450
<v Speaker 11>dragons and you have people take them on</v>
<v Speaker 11>and as they take them on,</v>

3511
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:05.620
<v Speaker 11>they dispense with the dragon and they</v>
<v Speaker 11>gained the power of the drag.</v>

3512
03:04:05.621 --> 03:04:09.200
<v Speaker 11>It's like a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 11>A video game is like that.</v>

3513
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:10.820
<v Speaker 11>That's why people like the video games.</v>

3514
03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:11.621
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's right,</v>

3515
03:04:11.621 --> 03:04:14.450
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's a reason that you absorb power</v>

3516
03:04:14.451 --> 03:04:16.700
<v Speaker 11>when you overcome things,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when you play a video game.</v>

3517
03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:20.090
<v Speaker 11>It's not like that's intrinsic to the</v>
<v Speaker 11>video game structure.</v>

3518
03:04:20.091 --> 03:04:22.490
<v Speaker 11>That's an archetypal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Anyways,</v>

3519
03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:27.170
<v Speaker 11>we went and saw an embalming,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which was a very interesting experience</v>

3520
03:04:27.190 --> 03:04:32.190
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and quite quite useful for her because</v>

3521
03:04:32.601 --> 03:04:35.780
<v Speaker 11>she knew what she could tolerate after</v>
<v Speaker 11>that and it was a hell of a lot more</v>

3522
03:04:35.781 --> 03:04:38.960
<v Speaker 11>than she thought she could tolerate and</v>
<v Speaker 11>so that's very useful to know.</v>

3523
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:45.260
<v Speaker 11>Back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He's a visionary thinker now.</v>

3524
03:04:45.530 --> 03:04:48.560
<v Speaker 11>My client,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I said she could lose a dream and she</v>

3525
03:04:48.561 --> 03:04:53.561
<v Speaker 11>could ask her dream characters what they</v>
<v Speaker 11>wanted and what they were trying to</v>

3526
03:04:54.470 --> 03:04:56.690
<v Speaker 11>communicate to her.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So that was pretty interesting.</v>

3527
03:04:57.260 --> 03:04:59.510
<v Speaker 11>That happened spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Had nothing to do with me.</v>

3528
03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:01.430
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm interested in dreams and one of my</v>

3529
03:05:01.431 --> 03:05:04.790
<v Speaker 11>clients are great dreamers,</v>
<v Speaker 11>especially the creative ones because I</v>

3530
03:05:04.791 --> 03:05:07.910
<v Speaker 11>think it's a hallmark of creativity to</v>
<v Speaker 11>have vivid dreams and to be able to</v>

3531
03:05:07.911 --> 03:05:08.744
<v Speaker 11>remember them.</v>

3532
03:05:09.260 --> 03:05:13.220
<v Speaker 11>But that was a faculty that was natural</v>
<v Speaker 11>to her</v>

3533
03:05:14.860 --> 03:05:18.650
<v Speaker 11>young.</v>
<v Speaker 11>How did this other client at one time,</v>

3534
03:05:18.651 --> 03:05:21.770
<v Speaker 11>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 11>she had a variety of fears and she had</v>

3535
03:05:21.771 --> 03:05:26.771
<v Speaker 11>this dream that she told me she was</v>
<v Speaker 11>walking down a beach and on the side of</v>

3536
03:05:27.591 --> 03:05:29.630
<v Speaker 11>the beach up a dune,</v>
<v Speaker 11>small Dune.</v>

3537
03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:32.750
<v Speaker 11>There was this old man with a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a big python,</v>

3538
03:05:33.020 --> 03:05:35.380
<v Speaker 11>and there's a crowd around him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>

3539
03:05:36.020 --> 03:05:40.670
<v Speaker 11>she was walking by the snake handler and</v>
<v Speaker 11>the snake and the crowd and she didn't</v>

3540
03:05:40.671 --> 03:05:43.490
<v Speaker 11>want to have anything to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He was sort of showing people the snake.</v>

3541
03:05:43.491 --> 03:05:46.340
<v Speaker 11>And she told me that dream and I</v>
<v Speaker 11>thought,</v>

3542
03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:47.100
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3543
03:05:47.100 --> 03:05:52.100
<v Speaker 11>you probably need to go see that snake.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so I relaxed or quasi hypnotic</v>

3544
03:05:53.331 --> 03:05:55.190
<v Speaker 11>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's very straightforward.</v>

3545
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:59.810
<v Speaker 11>Hypnosis is generally nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 11>pronounced relaxation low.</v>

3546
03:05:59.811 --> 03:06:03.320
<v Speaker 11>You have to be susceptible to hypnosis</v>
<v Speaker 11>to actually fall into a hypnotic trance</v>

3547
03:06:03.350 --> 03:06:06.290
<v Speaker 11>as a consequence of being relaxed or</v>
<v Speaker 11>just relaxed her.</v>

3548
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:10.280
<v Speaker 11>I had her breathe deeply and pay</v>
<v Speaker 11>attention to different parts of her body</v>

3549
03:06:10.281 --> 03:06:13.580
<v Speaker 11>and just relax their muscles one by one</v>
<v Speaker 11>essentially so that she could</v>

3550
03:06:13.581 --> 03:06:15.470
<v Speaker 11>concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then I told her,</v>

3551
03:06:15.471 --> 03:06:19.190
<v Speaker 11>we play with the dream a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 11>say union technique.</v>

3552
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:20.151
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

3553
03:06:20.151 --> 03:06:23.090
<v Speaker 11>so called the dream image to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which she could do quite well.</v>

3554
03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:23.841
<v Speaker 11>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>okay,</v>

3555
03:06:23.841 --> 03:06:25.610
<v Speaker 11>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>let's explore it.</v>

3556
03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:28.640
<v Speaker 11>So like pretend it's like pretend play</v>
<v Speaker 11>in.</v>

3557
03:06:28.680 --> 03:06:30.740
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you're a kid in your pretend playing,</v>

3558
03:06:30.890 --> 03:06:33.560
<v Speaker 11>you don't exactly direct the game,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right you,</v>

3559
03:06:33.561 --> 03:06:35.270
<v Speaker 11>you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you play the game.</v>

3560
03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:39.140
<v Speaker 11>So it's partly your direction obviously</v>
<v Speaker 11>because you're the player.</v>

3561
03:06:39.141 --> 03:06:42.590
<v Speaker 11>But the thing also happened</v>
<v Speaker 11>spontaneously of its own accord.</v>

3562
03:06:42.890 --> 03:06:45.770
<v Speaker 11>And you can think about that as a</v>
<v Speaker 11>dialogue between the conscious mind and</v>

3563
03:06:45.771 --> 03:06:47.360
<v Speaker 11>the unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In some sense,</v>

3564
03:06:47.361 --> 03:06:51.280
<v Speaker 11>it's developmental dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's not a fun game if you just direct</v>

3565
03:06:51.281 --> 03:06:51.410
<v Speaker 11>it.</v>

3566
03:06:51.410 --> 03:06:55.860
<v Speaker 11>It's only a fun game if you're inviting</v>
<v Speaker 11>and something is welling up as a</v>

3567
03:06:55.861 --> 03:06:57.570
<v Speaker 11>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's the same thing that happens when</v>

3568
03:06:57.571 --> 03:07:00.510
<v Speaker 11>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you're engaged in some kind of artistic</v>

3569
03:07:00.511 --> 03:07:03.450
<v Speaker 11>or literary production.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If it's all top down,</v>

3570
03:07:03.770 --> 03:07:05.130
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you're forcing it,</v>

3571
03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:07.170
<v Speaker 11>then it's propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's empty.</v>

3572
03:07:07.470 --> 03:07:10.550
<v Speaker 11>What do you want to sort of put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 11>in a receptive state of mind in an</v>

3573
03:07:10.551 --> 03:07:14.160
<v Speaker 11>imaginative state of mind?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it's sort of half you and half</v>

3574
03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:18.300
<v Speaker 11>nature itself,</v>
<v Speaker 11>manifesting itself in your creative</v>

3575
03:07:18.301 --> 03:07:21.110
<v Speaker 11>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that was the sort of state that we</v>

3576
03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:23.100
<v Speaker 11>were striving for.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And she,</v>

3577
03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:26.850
<v Speaker 11>I asked her when she was in relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I said,</v>

3578
03:07:26.851 --> 03:07:28.080
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what do you think about the snake</v>

3579
03:07:28.081 --> 03:07:28.891
<v Speaker 11>handler?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And she said,</v>

3580
03:07:28.891 --> 03:07:31.110
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he's probably a charlatan and he's just</v>

3581
03:07:31.111 --> 03:07:32.880
<v Speaker 11>there trying to impress the crowd and to</v>
<v Speaker 11>show off.</v>

3582
03:07:32.881 --> 03:07:35.730
<v Speaker 11>And she was afraid to go up there</v>
<v Speaker 11>because she thought people would push</v>

3583
03:07:35.731 --> 03:07:37.530
<v Speaker 11>her towards the snake and she'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 11>touch it.</v>

3584
03:07:37.530 --> 03:07:40.140
<v Speaker 11>And so there was a fear of the crowd</v>
<v Speaker 11>issue going on there too.</v>

3585
03:07:40.141 --> 03:07:41.790
<v Speaker 11>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well just look,</v>

3586
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:45.600
<v Speaker 11>go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but do it under these conditions is</v>

3587
03:07:45.601 --> 03:07:46.434
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3588
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:47.850
<v Speaker 11>if,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if people get pushy,</v>

3589
03:07:47.851 --> 03:07:50.310
<v Speaker 11>what are you going to tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so we figured out something,</v>

3590
03:07:50.311 --> 03:07:51.144
<v Speaker 11>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>look,</v>

3591
03:07:51.530 --> 03:07:55.920
<v Speaker 11>just tell them that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you want to look at the snake at your</v>

3592
03:07:55.921 --> 03:07:58.290
<v Speaker 11>own pace and that you don't need any</v>
<v Speaker 11>encouragement or help.</v>

3593
03:07:58.291 --> 03:08:01.230
<v Speaker 11>And it would be good if you were just</v>
<v Speaker 11>left alone.</v>

3594
03:08:01.231 --> 03:08:04.680
<v Speaker 11>So that enabled her to defend herself.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So she was afraid that the crowd would</v>

3595
03:08:04.681 --> 03:08:07.200
<v Speaker 11>push her to do something that she didn't</v>
<v Speaker 11>want to do.</v>

3596
03:08:07.470 --> 03:08:09.870
<v Speaker 11>That was part of the theme of the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So anyways,</v>

3597
03:08:09.871 --> 03:08:13.710
<v Speaker 11>she eventually climbed the Dune in her</v>
<v Speaker 11>imagination and went into the crowd and</v>

3598
03:08:13.711 --> 03:08:16.710
<v Speaker 11>the crowd turned out to be quite</v>
<v Speaker 11>welcoming and not hostile and not pushy,</v>

3599
03:08:17.010 --> 03:08:18.420
<v Speaker 11>which isn't what you'd expect,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

3600
03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:22.200
<v Speaker 11>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you'd think the crowd would have reacted</v>

3601
03:08:22.201 --> 03:08:24.870
<v Speaker 11>in accordance with their fears since it</v>
<v Speaker 11>was her fantasy.</v>

3602
03:08:25.140 --> 03:08:28.230
<v Speaker 11>But that's the thing about fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They have this autonomous quality,</v>

3603
03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:32.220
<v Speaker 11>but the crowd was welcoming and not</v>
<v Speaker 11>hostile and it turned out that the snake</v>

3604
03:08:32.221 --> 03:08:35.630
<v Speaker 11>handler wasn't a charlatan.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He was just an old guy who had this</v>

3605
03:08:35.631 --> 03:08:39.690
<v Speaker 11>snake and he was out there just showing</v>
<v Speaker 11>it to people because he thought it was a</v>

3606
03:08:39.691 --> 03:08:41.180
<v Speaker 11>cool thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

3607
03:08:41.410 --> 03:08:44.100
<v Speaker 11>and that maybe it was good for people to</v>
<v Speaker 11>come and look at a snake.</v>

3608
03:08:44.101 --> 03:08:46.890
<v Speaker 11>And so she got close enough to the snake</v>
<v Speaker 11>to touch it.</v>

3609
03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:49.890
<v Speaker 11>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I'm telling you that because I want</v>

3610
03:08:49.891 --> 03:08:52.470
<v Speaker 11>you to understand a bit more about what</v>
<v Speaker 11>union was trying to do.</v>

3611
03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:57.860
<v Speaker 11>And so he wrote these books,</v>
<v Speaker 11>notebooks that haven't been published</v>

3612
03:08:58.291 --> 03:08:59.490
<v Speaker 11>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 11>called the block books,</v>

3613
03:09:00.210 --> 03:09:04.020
<v Speaker 11>and the black books are the</v>
<v Speaker 11>documentation of his experiments with</v>

3614
03:09:04.021 --> 03:09:08.670
<v Speaker 11>his imagination</v>
<v Speaker 11>and what he would do is Adrian,</v>

3615
03:09:08.850 --> 03:09:10.560
<v Speaker 11>like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like a child daydreams.</v>

3616
03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:13.350
<v Speaker 11>He regained that faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 11>although I think with you.</v>

3617
03:09:13.351 --> 03:09:18.270
<v Speaker 11>And it was a faculty that has never</v>
<v Speaker 11>really disappeared and he had figures of</v>

3618
03:09:18.271 --> 03:09:22.020
<v Speaker 11>imagination that came to him that he</v>
<v Speaker 11>could speak with.</v>

3619
03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:26.760
<v Speaker 11>And he spoke with these figures of</v>
<v Speaker 11>imagination and documented that over a</v>

3620
03:09:26.761 --> 03:09:29.490
<v Speaker 11>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that was originally,</v>

3621
03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:34.580
<v Speaker 11>that was eventually</v>
<v Speaker 11>distilled into a book called the Red</v>

3622
03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:38.130
<v Speaker 11>Book,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which was published about three or four</v>

3623
03:09:38.131 --> 03:09:41.550
<v Speaker 11>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it was a book that young regarded as</v>

3624
03:09:41.551 --> 03:09:45.960
<v Speaker 11>the</v>
<v Speaker 11>central source from which all his</v>

3625
03:09:45.961 --> 03:09:50.961
<v Speaker 11>inspiration emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There was sort of the way it looks to me</v>

3626
03:09:51.991 --> 03:09:54.280
<v Speaker 11>is that we embody</v>

3627
03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:56.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot of information in our action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3628
03:09:57.100 --> 03:10:01.960
<v Speaker 4>And our action has developed as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of imitating other people.</v>

3629
03:10:02.540 --> 03:10:05.080
<v Speaker 4>And not only the people or the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>around us,</v>

3630
03:10:05.081 --> 03:10:07.780
<v Speaker 4>but of course the people around us</v>
<v Speaker 4>imitated the people who came before</v>

3631
03:10:07.781 --> 03:10:09.850
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those people in mutated the people</v>

3632
03:10:09.851 --> 03:10:14.500
<v Speaker 4>who came before them and so on so far</v>
<v Speaker 4>back that it's as far back as you can</v>

3633
03:10:14.501 --> 03:10:17.140
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you embody these patterns of</v>

3634
03:10:17.141 --> 03:10:20.860
<v Speaker 4>behavior that are extremely informative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't understand,</v>

3635
03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:24.100
<v Speaker 4>that are a consequence of collective</v>
<v Speaker 4>imitation across the centuries and</v>

3636
03:10:24.101 --> 03:10:27.550
<v Speaker 4>throw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then those patterns can become manifest</v>

3637
03:10:27.551 --> 03:10:32.551
<v Speaker 4>as figures of the imagination and those</v>
<v Speaker 4>failures of imagination are the</v>

3638
03:10:32.621 --> 03:10:37.621
<v Speaker 4>distillations of patterns of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so as the distillations of patterns</v>

3639
03:10:39.401 --> 03:10:42.430
<v Speaker 4>of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have content and it's not you that</v>

3640
03:10:42.431 --> 03:10:44.770
<v Speaker 4>content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you could even think about it as</v>

3641
03:10:44.771 --> 03:10:46.150
<v Speaker 4>content that's evolved.</v>

3642
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:50.140
<v Speaker 4>Although it's culturally transmitted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's content that's evolved and so these</v>

3643
03:10:50.141 --> 03:10:54.730
<v Speaker 4>figures of the imagination can reveal</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of reality to you.</v>

3644
03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:58.210
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened with young and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he described in the red</v>

3645
03:10:58.211 --> 03:11:00.490
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was what permeated his</v>

3646
03:11:00.700 --> 03:11:03.130
<v Speaker 4>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychology.</v>

3647
03:11:03.131 --> 03:11:07.420
<v Speaker 4>That was based on the presupposition</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fundamental architectural</v>

3648
03:11:07.421 --> 03:11:12.010
<v Speaker 4>structures of religious belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not pathological,</v>

3649
03:11:12.310 --> 03:11:16.750
<v Speaker 4>not deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not protective in some delusional sense</v>

3650
03:11:16.751 --> 03:11:19.690
<v Speaker 4>against the fear of death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but quite the contrary,</v>

3651
03:11:20.170 --> 03:11:25.170
<v Speaker 4>the very stories that enabled us to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>forward as confident human beings in the</v>

3652
03:11:27.281 --> 03:11:31.510
<v Speaker 4>face of chaos itself and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceivable,</v>

3653
03:11:31.570 --> 03:11:36.570
<v Speaker 4>I think perhaps probable that nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>more important conceptually happened in</v>

3654
03:11:39.191 --> 03:11:44.191
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century than that because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the first time post enlightenment</v>

3655
03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:51.600
<v Speaker 4>that Ab reproachment between the</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellect and the underlying religious</v>

3656
03:11:51.941 --> 03:11:56.941
<v Speaker 4>archetipal substructure occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have in the capacious intellect of</v>

3657
03:11:57.461 --> 03:12:00.610
<v Speaker 4>young and the same thing happened to</v>
<v Speaker 4>some degree with piaget.</v>

3658
03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:06.360
<v Speaker 4>The religious domain and the factual</v>
<v Speaker 4>domain were brought back together and</v>

3659
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:11.470
<v Speaker 4>the fact of young's enduring and</v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing popularity and influence,</v>

3660
03:12:11.471 --> 03:12:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I would say is a direct consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3661
03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:15.333
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

3662
03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Some of his work was spun off into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>new age and and the new age is a very</v>

3663
03:12:23.321 --> 03:12:27.640
<v Speaker 4>optimistic and naive movement is</v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the idea that you can do</v>

3664
03:12:27.641 --> 03:12:30.610
<v Speaker 4>nothing say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but follow your bliss and that will take</v>

3665
03:12:30.611 --> 03:12:35.611
<v Speaker 4>you ever hire to enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not the union idea at all.</v>

3666
03:12:37.450 --> 03:12:42.450
<v Speaker 4>The union idea is that what you most</v>
<v Speaker 4>need will be found where you least want</v>

3667
03:12:43.001 --> 03:12:45.750
<v Speaker 4>to look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this story.</v>

3668
03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:47.620
<v Speaker 4>King Arthur,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this story of King Arthur,</v>

3669
03:12:47.621 --> 03:12:49.240
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all in a round table,</v>

3670
03:12:49.241 --> 03:12:50.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>King Arthur and his knights,</v>

3671
03:12:50.910 --> 03:12:52.340
<v Speaker 4>they're equals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all</v>

3672
03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:54.860
<v Speaker 11>super ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they're all equals and they go off</v>

3673
03:12:54.861 --> 03:12:59.630
<v Speaker 11>to look for the holy Grail,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for the holy grail is the container of</v>

3674
03:12:59.631 --> 03:13:04.631
<v Speaker 11>the redemptive substance,</v>
<v Speaker 11>whatever that is might be the cop of the</v>

3675
03:13:05.571 --> 03:13:09.890
<v Speaker 11>Christ used at the last supper,</v>
<v Speaker 11>might be jealous that was used to</v>

3676
03:13:09.891 --> 03:13:13.430
<v Speaker 11>capture his blood on the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right when he was pierced by a sword.</v>

3677
03:13:13.610 --> 03:13:16.310
<v Speaker 11>The stories differ,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that's the holy grail and the holy</v>

3678
03:13:16.311 --> 03:13:18.920
<v Speaker 11>grail is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's the redemptive substance and the</v>

3679
03:13:18.921 --> 03:13:23.180
<v Speaker 11>knights of King Arthur go off to search</v>
<v Speaker 11>for the holy grail and but they don't</v>

3680
03:13:23.181 --> 03:13:26.300
<v Speaker 11>know where to look.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So where do you look when you don't know</v>

3681
03:13:26.301 --> 03:13:29.840
<v Speaker 11>where to look for something you need</v>
<v Speaker 11>desperately,</v>

3682
03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:32.990
<v Speaker 11>but I've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

3683
03:13:32.991 --> 03:13:36.560
<v Speaker 11>each of the nights goes into the forest</v>
<v Speaker 11>at the point that looks darkest to him,</v>

3684
03:13:37.970 --> 03:13:40.670
<v Speaker 11>and that's union psychoanalysis in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>nutshell.</v>

3685
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:45.680
<v Speaker 11>It's like that which you fear and avoid</v>
<v Speaker 11>that which you hold in contempt,</v>

3686
03:13:45.681 --> 03:13:48.680
<v Speaker 11>that which disgusts you and that you</v>
<v Speaker 11>avoid.</v>

3687
03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:51.380
<v Speaker 11>That's the gateway to what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 11>know.</v>

3688
03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:55.400
<v Speaker 11>There's nothing new agey about that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's for sure.</v>

3689
03:13:57.350 --> 03:13:57.891
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 11>young,</v>

3690
03:13:57.891 --> 03:14:01.160
<v Speaker 11>when he started this endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he started with this.</v>

3691
03:14:01.161 --> 03:14:03.200
<v Speaker 11>This is part of the notebooks from the</v>
<v Speaker 11>black book.</v>

3692
03:14:03.620 --> 03:14:04.453
<v Speaker 11>He said,</v>

3693
03:14:06.430 --> 03:14:09.430
<v Speaker 11>he wrote my soul,</v>
<v Speaker 11>my soul.</v>

3694
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:10.960
<v Speaker 11>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Do you hear me?</v>

3695
03:14:10.961 --> 03:14:12.730
<v Speaker 11>I speak.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I call you.</v>

3696
03:14:13.210 --> 03:14:15.820
<v Speaker 11>Are you there?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've returned.</v>

3697
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:19.990
<v Speaker 11>I'm here again.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've shaken the dust of all the lands</v>

3698
03:14:19.991 --> 03:14:23.290
<v Speaker 11>from my feet and I've come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm with you.</v>

3699
03:14:24.130 --> 03:14:26.770
<v Speaker 11>After long years of long wandering,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I have come to you again</v>

3700
03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:33.870
<v Speaker 11>for the unions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The Hero's journey is a journey within</v>

3701
03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:39.400
<v Speaker 11>and I think that that's probably the</v>
<v Speaker 11>bias of introverts to believe that the</v>

3702
03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:43.380
<v Speaker 11>hero's journey isn't only an inward</v>
<v Speaker 11>journey.</v>

3703
03:14:43.470 --> 03:14:46.890
<v Speaker 11>I think that it can be an outward</v>
<v Speaker 11>journey too because I don't think it</v>

3704
03:14:46.891 --> 03:14:51.510
<v Speaker 11>matters where you confront the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 11>whether it's within or without.</v>

3705
03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:54.690
<v Speaker 11>What matters is whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 11>confront the unknown.</v>

3706
03:14:54.810 --> 03:14:55.830
<v Speaker 11>That's what matters,</v>

3707
03:15:01.710 --> 03:15:06.710
<v Speaker 11>but he found that what he had ignored</v>
<v Speaker 11>was an undiscovered part of themselves,</v>

3708
03:15:07.081 --> 03:15:12.000
<v Speaker 11>so that might be something that was</v>
<v Speaker 11>equivalent to Huxley's notion that there</v>

3709
03:15:12.001 --> 03:15:15.210
<v Speaker 11>were tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's tremendous potential breadth in</v>

3710
03:15:15.211 --> 03:15:17.120
<v Speaker 11>the realm of human conscious</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiences.</v>

3711
03:15:17.370 --> 03:15:22.110
<v Speaker 11>Huxley was influenced to some degree by</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yung now Yung knew of Huxley's</v>

3712
03:15:22.111 --> 03:15:26.880
<v Speaker 11>experiments and had commented on</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychedelic use and he said something</v>

3713
03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:29.760
<v Speaker 11>like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>beware of wisdom you did not earn.</v>

3714
03:15:31.220 --> 03:15:34.560
<v Speaker 11>And Don was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's at stating things very profoundly,</v>

3715
03:15:34.561 --> 03:15:36.930
<v Speaker 11>very simply,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's a very intelligent piece of</v>

3716
03:15:36.931 --> 03:15:39.690
<v Speaker 11>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Beware of wisdom you did not earn.</v>

3717
03:15:39.691 --> 03:15:43.350
<v Speaker 11>He wrote a paper if you're interested in</v>
<v Speaker 11>this sort of thing.</v>

3718
03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:47.850
<v Speaker 11>He wrote a paper called the relations</v>
<v Speaker 11>between the ego and the unconscious,</v>

3719
03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:52.000
<v Speaker 11>which is an absolute work but completely</v>
<v Speaker 11>incomprehensible unless you know what</v>

3720
03:15:52.001 --> 03:15:54.930
<v Speaker 11>it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>unless you know what it's about and what</v>

3721
03:15:54.931 --> 03:15:58.560
<v Speaker 11>it's about is the danger of what he</v>
<v Speaker 11>called ego inflation.</v>

3722
03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:01.560
<v Speaker 11>And so one of the things that can happen</v>
<v Speaker 11>as a consequence of a revelatory</v>

3723
03:16:01.561 --> 03:16:06.561
<v Speaker 11>experience is that the division between</v>
<v Speaker 11>the individual ego and and the and what</v>

3724
03:16:09.901 --> 03:16:12.780
<v Speaker 11>would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>So hard to come up with a word that</v>

3725
03:16:12.781 --> 03:16:17.781
<v Speaker 11>isn't somehow naive or or or cliched,</v>
<v Speaker 11>to erase the relationship,</v>

3726
03:16:20.490 --> 03:16:24.660
<v Speaker 11>the boundary between the specific</v>
<v Speaker 11>consciousness of the ego and the more</v>

3727
03:16:24.661 --> 03:16:29.661
<v Speaker 11>generalized consciousness and more</v>
<v Speaker 11>generalized consciousness as such is a</v>

3728
03:16:31.681 --> 03:16:36.240
<v Speaker 11>dangerous thing to do because you can</v>
<v Speaker 11>start to equate yourself,</v>

3729
03:16:36.241 --> 03:16:41.160
<v Speaker 11>your specific self with that more</v>
<v Speaker 11>generalized consciousness as such and</v>

3730
03:16:41.190 --> 03:16:44.190
<v Speaker 11>you thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>is it something akin to a psychotic</v>

3731
03:16:44.191 --> 03:16:49.191
<v Speaker 11>inflation and the paper relations</v>
<v Speaker 11>between the ego and the unconscious is a</v>

3732
03:16:50.131 --> 03:16:52.560
<v Speaker 11>document that tells you how to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 11>that.</v>

3733
03:16:53.130 --> 03:16:58.130
<v Speaker 11>If you're</v>
<v Speaker 11>playing in this kind of realm and one of</v>

3734
03:17:00.451 --> 03:17:03.900
<v Speaker 11>the injunctions is to keep your feet on</v>
<v Speaker 11>the ground.</v>

3735
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:09.360
<v Speaker 11>He thought that was partly what happened</v>
<v Speaker 11>to Nisha was that Nisha wasn't grounded</v>

3736
03:17:09.361 --> 03:17:12.180
<v Speaker 11>enough in life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He wasn't grounded enough in day to day</v>

3737
03:17:12.181 --> 03:17:17.181
<v Speaker 11>rituals and routines and the mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now you can debate whether or not that's</v>

3738
03:17:17.250 --> 03:17:19.020
<v Speaker 11>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Whether or not that's a reasonable</v>

3739
03:17:19.021 --> 03:17:21.570
<v Speaker 11>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that was still what you unbelieved.</v>

3740
03:17:23.070 --> 03:17:24.990
<v Speaker 11>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so why am I telling you all this?</v>

3741
03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:30.480
<v Speaker 11>I'll finish with this from December 19,</v>
<v Speaker 11>13 onward.</v>

3742
03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:32.340
<v Speaker 11>Young carrier going in the same</v>
<v Speaker 11>procedure,</v>

3743
03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:36.330
<v Speaker 11>deliberately evoking a fantasy in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>waking state and then entering into it</v>

3744
03:17:36.331 --> 03:17:39.060
<v Speaker 11>as a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 11>These fantasies may be understood as a</v>

3745
03:17:39.061 --> 03:17:41.580
<v Speaker 11>type of dramatized thinking in pictorial</v>
<v Speaker 11>form.</v>

3746
03:17:42.180 --> 03:17:44.670
<v Speaker 11>In retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he recalled that his scientific question</v>

3747
03:17:44.671 --> 03:17:47.820
<v Speaker 11>was to see what took place when he</v>
<v Speaker 11>switched off consciousness.</v>

3748
03:17:48.930 --> 03:17:52.680
<v Speaker 11>The example of dreams indicated the</v>
<v Speaker 11>existence of background activity and he</v>

3749
03:17:52.681 --> 03:17:56.220
<v Speaker 11>wanted to give this a possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 11>emerging just as one does when taking</v>

3750
03:17:56.221 --> 03:17:59.280
<v Speaker 11>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 11>These journals are contemporary</v>

3751
03:17:59.281 --> 03:18:02.850
<v Speaker 11>contemporaneous clinical ledger to his</v>
<v Speaker 11>most difficult experiment or what he</v>

3752
03:18:02.851 --> 03:18:07.680
<v Speaker 11>later describes as a voyage of discovery</v>
<v Speaker 11>to the other pole of the world.</v>

3753
03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:10.260
<v Speaker 11>You don't believe that we were dreaming</v>
<v Speaker 11>all the time,</v>

3754
03:18:11.250 --> 03:18:15.300
<v Speaker 11>but that during waking life,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that pressure of external images was</v>

3755
03:18:15.301 --> 03:18:20.301
<v Speaker 11>such that the unconscious fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 11>imagery was or that the fantasy imagery</v>

3756
03:18:22.201 --> 03:18:24.540
<v Speaker 11>was of insufficient magnitude to be</v>
<v Speaker 11>conscious,</v>

3757
03:18:24.541 --> 03:18:28.320
<v Speaker 11>but that we were always situated in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>dream in relationship to the world.</v>

3758
03:18:29.220 --> 03:18:32.160
<v Speaker 5>If you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a deterministic drive.</v>

3759
03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:37.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a sub personality that has a goal</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that it has a bunch of action</v>

3760
03:18:37.081 --> 03:18:39.660
<v Speaker 5>patterns that are going to work in</v>
<v Speaker 5>reference to that goal.</v>

3761
03:18:39.870 --> 03:18:44.580
<v Speaker 5>It has a bunch of perceptions that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>suit that goal and it organizes your</v>

3762
03:18:44.581 --> 03:18:47.980
<v Speaker 5>emotional responses around that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so to think about it as a</v>

3763
03:18:47.981 --> 03:18:51.670
<v Speaker 5>personality is a much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a much more intelligent way to look</v>

3764
03:18:51.671 --> 03:18:54.190
<v Speaker 5>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the thing about skinner's rats,</v>

3765
03:18:54.191 --> 03:18:55.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skinner could get rats to do almost</v>

3766
03:18:55.991 --> 03:19:00.220
<v Speaker 5>everything and he would reward them with</v>
<v Speaker 5>food and so he had a simple rat model,</v>

3767
03:19:00.221 --> 03:19:03.730
<v Speaker 5>but his rats were starved down to 75</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of their normal body weight.</v>

3768
03:19:04.570 --> 03:19:07.500
<v Speaker 5>So not only were they not social</v>
<v Speaker 5>gregarious rats,</v>

3769
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:12.670
<v Speaker 5>rats are because they were isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were genetically altered from wild</v>

3770
03:19:12.671 --> 03:19:14.950
<v Speaker 5>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they also weren't as complex as a</v>

3771
03:19:14.951 --> 03:19:16.360
<v Speaker 5>real route because they were starving.</v>

3772
03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:18.400
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3773
03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:20.740
<v Speaker 5>starving rat is a pretty good model of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>rat.</v>

3774
03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:22.990
<v Speaker 5>And a rat has a pretty good model of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

3775
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:26.620
<v Speaker 5>but are a lot of our models have simple</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavioral learning were based on</v>

3776
03:19:26.621 --> 03:19:30.070
<v Speaker 5>starving isolated rats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

3777
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:35.020
<v Speaker 5>how to think about motivation will think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it from the hypothalamic</v>

3778
03:19:35.021 --> 03:19:36.820
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we could say one thing that</v>

3779
03:19:36.821 --> 03:19:41.290
<v Speaker 5>motivation does is set goals and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>could say that emotions track progress</v>

3780
03:19:41.291 --> 03:19:44.170
<v Speaker 5>towards goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to use that Schema even</v>

3781
03:19:44.171 --> 03:19:45.970
<v Speaker 5>though it's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you say,</v>

3782
03:19:45.971 --> 03:19:48.160
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>motivation determines where you're going</v>

3783
03:19:48.161 --> 03:19:49.360
<v Speaker 5>to aim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're hungry,</v>

3784
03:19:49.361 --> 03:19:53.110
<v Speaker 5>you're going to aim at something to eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that will organize your</v>

3785
03:19:53.111 --> 03:19:56.500
<v Speaker 5>perceptions so that you zero out</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that isn't relevant to that</v>

3786
03:19:56.501 --> 03:19:58.330
<v Speaker 5>task,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is almost everything.</v>

3787
03:19:58.780 --> 03:20:02.020
<v Speaker 5>You concentrate on those few things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to facilitate your movement</v>

3788
03:20:02.021 --> 03:20:02.800
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>

3789
03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:05.560
<v Speaker 5>When you encounter those things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>produces positive emotion,</v>

3790
03:20:05.950 --> 03:20:09.610
<v Speaker 5>as you move through the world towards</v>
<v Speaker 5>your goal and you see that things are</v>

3791
03:20:09.611 --> 03:20:12.610
<v Speaker 5>laying themselves out that facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 5>your movement forward,</v>

3792
03:20:12.820 --> 03:20:16.540
<v Speaker 5>those things caused positive emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you encounter anything that gets in</v>

3793
03:20:16.541 --> 03:20:19.060
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that produces negative emotion and</v>

3794
03:20:19.061 --> 03:20:22.630
<v Speaker 5>it can be like threat because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to encounter something that</v>

3795
03:20:22.631 --> 03:20:25.000
<v Speaker 5>gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be anger so that you move it</v>

3796
03:20:25.001 --> 03:20:26.410
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be frustration,</v>

3797
03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:28.000
<v Speaker 5>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grief.</v>

3798
03:20:28.180 --> 03:20:31.300
<v Speaker 5>Those would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had a response that serious to an</v>

3799
03:20:31.301 --> 03:20:33.760
<v Speaker 5>obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would probably punish the little</v>

3800
03:20:33.761 --> 03:20:36.150
<v Speaker 5>motivated frame right out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3801
03:20:36.250 --> 03:20:40.670
<v Speaker 5>so you walked downstairs and I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're contracting company instead of</v>

3802
03:20:40.690 --> 03:20:43.540
<v Speaker 5>wrecking ball through your kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's going to be</v>

3803
03:20:43.541 --> 03:20:45.670
<v Speaker 5>disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to keep eating the</v>

3804
03:20:45.671 --> 03:20:48.670
<v Speaker 5>peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little frame is going to get</v>

3805
03:20:48.671 --> 03:20:52.630
<v Speaker 5>punished out of existence and some new</v>
<v Speaker 5>goal is going to pop up and its stead</v>

3806
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:54.940
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things we're going to try to</v>

3807
03:20:54.941 --> 03:20:59.170
<v Speaker 5>sort out is how do you decide when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've encountered an obstacle that's so</v>

3808
03:20:59.171 --> 03:21:02.440
<v Speaker 5>big that you should just quit and go do</v>
<v Speaker 5>something else because that's not</v>

3809
03:21:02.441 --> 03:21:04.050
<v Speaker 5>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3810
03:21:04.051 --> 03:21:07.300
<v Speaker 5>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get into counter productive</v>

3811
03:21:07.301 --> 03:21:08.860
<v Speaker 5>persistence pretty easily.</v>

3812
03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:12.010
<v Speaker 5>So we don't know how people solve that</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem and it's a really complicated</v>

3813
03:21:12.011 --> 03:21:13.060
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

3814
03:21:13.061 --> 03:21:18.040
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna work on that scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals</v>

3815
03:21:18.041 --> 03:21:22.570
<v Speaker 5>that are directly relevant to biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>survival that produces a frame of</v>

3816
03:21:22.571 --> 03:21:24.670
<v Speaker 5>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not a goal,</v>

3817
03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:27.850
<v Speaker 5>it's not a drive and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>collection of behaviors.</v>

3818
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:31.340
<v Speaker 5>It's a little personality and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>personality has a viewpoint.</v>

3819
03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:35.140
<v Speaker 5>It has thoughts that go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has perceptions,</v>

3820
03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:37.300
<v Speaker 5>it has action tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>

3821
03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:40.690
<v Speaker 5>You can see this in addiction most</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly,</v>

3822
03:21:41.620 --> 03:21:45.290
<v Speaker 5>so one of the things that you find often</v>
<v Speaker 5>with people who are alcoholic is they</v>

3823
03:21:45.291 --> 03:21:50.291
<v Speaker 5>lie all the time and that's because when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're built a little alcohol dependent</v>

3824
03:21:51.171 --> 03:21:53.960
<v Speaker 5>personality inside of themselves or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>big one might.</v>

3825
03:21:53.961 --> 03:21:57.350
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's 90 percent of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>personality and one of that.</v>

3826
03:21:57.500 --> 03:22:01.970
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that component</v>
<v Speaker 5>consists of is all the rationalizations</v>

3827
03:22:01.971 --> 03:22:05.720
<v Speaker 5>that they've used over the years to</v>
<v Speaker 5>justify their addiction to themselves</v>

3828
03:22:05.721 --> 03:22:06.650
<v Speaker 5>and to other people.</v>

3829
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:10.730
<v Speaker 5>And so the addiction has a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3830
03:22:10.731 --> 03:22:14.180
<v Speaker 5>and so when the person is off or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're addicted to meth or something</v>

3831
03:22:14.181 --> 03:22:16.070
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we know the addiction is more.</v>

3832
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:20.510
<v Speaker 5>It's more short term powerful than I</v>
<v Speaker 5>would say,</v>

3833
03:22:20.511 --> 03:22:23.960
<v Speaker 5>than an alcohol addiction and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>say anything and the the,</v>

3834
03:22:24.010 --> 03:22:28.520
<v Speaker 5>the words are just tools used to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards the goal and if they happened to</v>

3835
03:22:28.521 --> 03:22:29.690
<v Speaker 5>be deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3836
03:22:29.691 --> 03:22:32.000
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just practical tools to get</v>

3837
03:22:32.001 --> 03:22:34.850
<v Speaker 5>towards the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when you get towards the goal</v>

3838
03:22:34.851 --> 03:22:36.920
<v Speaker 5>and you take a nice shot of meth or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>

3839
03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:41.420
<v Speaker 5>you reinforce all those rationales that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you use to get the drug and then the</v>

3840
03:22:41.421 --> 03:22:43.760
<v Speaker 5>next time you're even a better deceiver</v>
<v Speaker 5>and liar.</v>

3841
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:47.120
<v Speaker 5>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to say motivations one</v>

3842
03:22:47.121 --> 03:22:50.060
<v Speaker 5>way of thinking about as they set goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not the right way of thinking</v>

3843
03:22:50.061 --> 03:22:50.720
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

3844
03:22:50.720 --> 03:22:53.030
<v Speaker 5>They produce a whole framework of</v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>

3845
03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:56.360
<v Speaker 5>And so we're going to think about that</v>
<v Speaker 5>framework of interpretation and then</v>

3846
03:22:56.361 --> 03:22:59.840
<v Speaker 5>emotions emerging side of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's it.</v>

3847
03:22:59.900 --> 03:23:01.850
<v Speaker 5>So the world is framed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Motivations,</v>

3848
03:23:01.851 --> 03:23:03.590
<v Speaker 5>set goals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could say the world has to be</v>

3849
03:23:03.591 --> 03:23:06.350
<v Speaker 5>framed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So motivation sets that frame,</v>

3850
03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:07.760
<v Speaker 5>cruise goals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions,</v>

3851
03:23:07.761 --> 03:23:10.640
<v Speaker 5>perceptions and actions and inactions</v>
<v Speaker 5>track progress.</v>

3852
03:23:10.641 --> 03:23:15.380
<v Speaker 5>So positive emotion says you're moving</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward properly towards your goal.</v>

3853
03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:17.900
<v Speaker 5>And if you encounter something you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>expect,</v>

3854
03:23:17.901 --> 03:23:20.030
<v Speaker 5>you stop that anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3855
03:23:20.090 --> 03:23:21.680
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not where we thought we were.</v>

3856
03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:25.280
<v Speaker 5>And so we don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we should stop because we don't know</v>

3857
03:23:25.281 --> 03:23:26.390
<v Speaker 5>where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're doing.</v>

3858
03:23:26.540 --> 03:23:30.920
<v Speaker 5>Stop frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the more powerful negative</v>

3859
03:23:30.921 --> 03:23:33.530
<v Speaker 5>emotions like pain they might make you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get out of there.</v>

3860
03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:36.920
<v Speaker 5>So motions forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>

3861
03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:39.710
<v Speaker 5>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your emotions within that</v>

3862
03:23:39.711 --> 03:23:41.690
<v Speaker 5>motivated frame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3863
03:23:42.650 --> 03:23:45.680
<v Speaker 5>and that's another example of how your</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind is embedded in your body.</v>

3864
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:49.700
<v Speaker 5>Your emotions are in like their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their offshoots of action tendencies.</v>

3865
03:23:49.701 --> 03:23:51.260
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the right way to think about it</v>

3866
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:53.630
<v Speaker 5>because action has everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally.</v>

3867
03:23:55.460 --> 03:23:59.090
<v Speaker 5>So what are some basic motivations are</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of these are regulated by the</v>

3868
03:23:59.091 --> 03:24:00.140
<v Speaker 5>Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3869
03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:02.870
<v Speaker 5>that that tells you just how important</v>
<v Speaker 5>to control system it is.</v>

3870
03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:05.840
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that's useful to know</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the hypothalamus is that it has</v>

3871
03:24:05.841 --> 03:24:09.890
<v Speaker 5>projections going up from it that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>like tree trunks and inhibitory</v>

3872
03:24:10.730 --> 03:24:13.460
<v Speaker 5>projections coming down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like grape vines.</v>

3873
03:24:14.060 --> 03:24:17.210
<v Speaker 5>So you can kind of control your</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothalamus as long as it's not on too</v>

3874
03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:20.270
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's on in any serious way,</v>

3875
03:24:20.390 --> 03:24:22.370
<v Speaker 5>it's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It winds.</v>

3876
03:24:22.970 --> 03:24:27.860
<v Speaker 5>So partly what you do to stop yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>from falling under the dominion of your</v>

3877
03:24:27.861 --> 03:24:31.250
<v Speaker 5>hypothalamus is to never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever be anywhere where it's action is</v>

3878
03:24:31.251 --> 03:24:33.110
<v Speaker 5>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3879
03:24:33.140 --> 03:24:37.250
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to go into a biker bar</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you might find yourself in a</v>

3880
03:24:37.251 --> 03:24:38.600
<v Speaker 5>situation where panicked.</v>

3881
03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Defensive aggression is immediately</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary.</v>

3882
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:44.220
<v Speaker 5>You probably don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to panic.</v>

3883
03:24:44.221 --> 03:24:47.280
<v Speaker 5>You don't want the terror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want the frenzied fight.</v>

3884
03:24:47.310 --> 03:24:49.530
<v Speaker 5>You don't want any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to have to run away in</v>

3885
03:24:49.531 --> 03:24:51.990
<v Speaker 5>absolute panic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you just don't go there.</v>

3886
03:24:52.590 --> 03:24:56.190
<v Speaker 5>And then a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a huge part of how we regulate our</v>

3887
03:24:56.191 --> 03:25:00.900
<v Speaker 5>emotions is just by never going anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we have to experience them and so</v>

3888
03:25:00.901 --> 03:25:04.470
<v Speaker 5>that has very little to do with internal</v>
<v Speaker 5>inhibitory control and everything to do</v>

3889
03:25:04.471 --> 03:25:09.390
<v Speaker 5>with staying where you belong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So okay,</v>

3890
03:25:10.230 --> 03:25:12.120
<v Speaker 5>so basic motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunger,</v>

3891
03:25:12.121 --> 03:25:13.020
<v Speaker 5>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pain,</v>

3892
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:15.150
<v Speaker 5>pain is not regulated by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypothalamus.</v>

3893
03:25:15.151 --> 03:25:17.700
<v Speaker 5>That's a different circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anger slash aggression,</v>

3894
03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:20.640
<v Speaker 5>thermo regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>panic and escape,</v>

3895
03:25:21.390 --> 03:25:23.550
<v Speaker 5>affiliation and care,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual desire,</v>

3896
03:25:23.551 --> 03:25:27.000
<v Speaker 5>exploration play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can kind of break those in.</v>

3897
03:25:27.390 --> 03:25:32.390
<v Speaker 5>You can kind of break those into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>classic Darwinian categories to and say,</v>

3898
03:25:32.911 --> 03:25:34.500
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a set of motivations that go</v>

3899
03:25:34.501 --> 03:25:37.380
<v Speaker 5>along with self maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be your survival,</v>

3900
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:39.540
<v Speaker 5>ingestive and defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3901
03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I've sort of coded them there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the self maintenance,</v>

3902
03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:49.930
<v Speaker 5>there's an adjustive set of basic</v>
<v Speaker 5>motivations that go with self</v>

3903
03:25:49.931 --> 03:25:51.170
<v Speaker 5>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd say that's hunger,</v>

3904
03:25:51.171 --> 03:25:54.260
<v Speaker 5>thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a set of defensive motivations,</v>

3905
03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:55.140
<v Speaker 5>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anger,</v>

3906
03:25:55.140 --> 03:25:58.430
<v Speaker 5>thermoregulation paddock and escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's,</v>

3907
03:25:58.650 --> 03:26:01.190
<v Speaker 5>there's motivations that are associated</v>
<v Speaker 5>with reproduction,</v>

3908
03:26:01.470 --> 03:26:06.470
<v Speaker 5>affiliation care and sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I put exploration in place sort</v>

3909
03:26:06.651 --> 03:26:08.170
<v Speaker 5>of outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3910
03:26:10.290 --> 03:26:13.550
<v Speaker 5>I would say because those two things</v>
<v Speaker 5>serve both of these approximately</v>

3911
03:26:13.551 --> 03:26:14.384
<v Speaker 5>equally,</v>

3912
03:26:17.810 --> 03:26:22.810
<v Speaker 7>I think the postmodern objection to</v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning is actually wrong.</v>

3913
03:26:23.151 --> 03:26:26.150
<v Speaker 7>While we talked about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do believe that there's a transcendent</v>

3914
03:26:26.151 --> 03:26:29.630
<v Speaker 7>ethic and I do believe that it touches</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the metaphysical.</v>

3915
03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:33.470
<v Speaker 7>I believe it people experienced that</v>
<v Speaker 7>because people are perfectly capable of</v>

3916
03:26:33.471 --> 03:26:38.471
<v Speaker 7>having unalterably profound religious</v>
<v Speaker 7>experiences and the naturalistic</v>

3917
03:26:38.841 --> 03:26:40.700
<v Speaker 7>materialists don't know what the hell to</v>
<v Speaker 7>do with that.</v>

3918
03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:43.220
<v Speaker 7>They have no idea what to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say,</v>

3919
03:26:43.221 --> 03:26:44.180
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's delusional.</v>

3920
03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:44.721
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3921
03:26:44.721 --> 03:26:47.570
<v Speaker 7>hang on a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People who have those experiences appear</v>

3922
03:26:47.571 --> 03:26:51.680
<v Speaker 7>to be more successful and healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when exactly in what manner is that</v>

3923
03:26:51.681 --> 03:26:54.110
<v Speaker 7>delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you induce it in the lab with</v>

3924
03:26:54.111 --> 03:26:55.400
<v Speaker 7>Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

3925
03:26:55.580 --> 03:26:59.210
<v Speaker 7>among people who are dying of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their fear of death goes away.</v>

3926
03:26:59.530 --> 03:27:02.660
<v Speaker 7>It's like that's you're going to just</v>
<v Speaker 7>lay of the lay that out there as</v>

3927
03:27:02.661 --> 03:27:06.440
<v Speaker 7>delusional or yo the quit smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>85 percent success rate with one</v>

3928
03:27:06.441 --> 03:27:10.750
<v Speaker 7>mystical experience on suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but produces 85 percent cessation rate</v>

3929
03:27:10.751 --> 03:27:15.260
<v Speaker 7>and smoking completely and with a Mtma</v>
<v Speaker 7>ecstasy.</v>

3930
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:19.190
<v Speaker 7>The three treatments with Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what the current research</v>

3931
03:27:19.191 --> 03:27:24.191
<v Speaker 7>indicates,</v>
<v Speaker 7>produces a 72 percent cure rate for</v>

3932
03:27:24.381 --> 03:27:26.420
<v Speaker 7>intractable posttraumatic stress</v>
<v Speaker 7>disorder.</v>

3933
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:29.090
<v Speaker 7>It's like those are miracle cures and no</v>
<v Speaker 7>one,</v>

3934
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:31.460
<v Speaker 7>and they have to be accompanied by the</v>
<v Speaker 7>mystical experience.</v>

3935
03:27:31.461 --> 03:27:35.280
<v Speaker 7>No one knows how to counsel them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so there is a transcender yeah.</v>

3936
03:27:35.540 --> 03:27:39.680
<v Speaker 7>So it's a very physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean in the case or any of these</v>

3937
03:27:39.681 --> 03:27:40.550
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3938
03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:41.980
<v Speaker 7>You're eating</v>

3939
03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:43.620
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're ingesting saying smoking it,</v>

3940
03:27:43.630 --> 03:27:45.610
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's physical,</v>

3941
03:27:45.611 --> 03:27:48.450
<v Speaker 5>it's here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the experience is metaphysical is</v>

3942
03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:49.150
<v Speaker 5>metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3943
03:27:49.150 --> 03:27:52.660
<v Speaker 5>That's a place where the biological and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the transcendent touch and we don't know</v>

3944
03:27:52.661 --> 03:27:53.790
<v Speaker 5>what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3945
03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:58.390
<v Speaker 5>that's why psychedelics through our</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture into such a such a flip this</v>

3946
03:27:58.391 --> 03:28:00.490
<v Speaker 5>upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one knew what to do with them.</v>

3947
03:28:01.050 --> 03:28:02.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Indians retarded psilocybin</v>

3948
03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:06.580
<v Speaker 5>as food of the gods for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when people have encountered</v>

3949
03:28:06.581 --> 03:28:09.070
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic substances throughout human</v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

3950
03:28:09.370 --> 03:28:11.450
<v Speaker 5>that's always how they've been</v>
<v Speaker 5>characterized.</v>

3951
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:12.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food of the gods.</v>

3952
03:28:12.820 --> 03:28:16.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like be aware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there they opened the door to the</v>

3953
03:28:16.391 --> 03:28:21.391
<v Speaker 5>transcendent and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the evidence that they are doing</v>

3954
03:28:21.971 --> 03:28:25.360
<v Speaker 5>something that's psychedelic substances</v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing something that we seriously</v>

3955
03:28:25.361 --> 03:28:28.960
<v Speaker 5>don't understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a bit is overwhelming.</v>

3956
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Rick strassman wrote a book on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch</v>

3957
03:28:33.611 --> 03:28:34.444
<v Speaker 5>of people down in.</v>

3958
03:28:34.600 --> 03:28:37.210
<v Speaker 5>He was at in Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's stress.</v>

3959
03:28:37.240 --> 03:28:40.260
<v Speaker 5>One's a pretty straight scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3960
03:28:40.270 --> 03:28:43.210
<v Speaker 5>he was interested in measuring</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychophysiological responses to the</v>

3961
03:28:43.211 --> 03:28:45.700
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gives people dmt and they all came</v>

3962
03:28:45.701 --> 03:28:48.970
<v Speaker 5>back with the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was blasted out of my consciousness.</v>

3963
03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:52.210
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met a whole bunch of alien beings.</v>

3964
03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:55.960
<v Speaker 5>They were really surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there and then I came back and it</v>

3965
03:28:55.961 --> 03:28:58.120
<v Speaker 5>was the most real thing that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to me,</v>

3966
03:28:58.330 --> 03:28:59.590
<v Speaker 5>and straussman would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3967
03:28:59.591 --> 03:29:01.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had a union architectural</v>

3968
03:29:01.330 --> 03:29:03.580
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it was a dream and they'd say,</v>

3969
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:08.890
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he got so distraught because of</v>

3970
03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:11.800
<v Speaker 5>these continual reports that he had</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped doing the research.</v>

3971
03:29:11.801 --> 03:29:14.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making a claim for him for</v>

3972
03:29:14.441 --> 03:29:17.380
<v Speaker 5>anything metaphysical here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm definitely pointing out that</v>

3973
03:29:17.381 --> 03:29:22.381
<v Speaker 5>there are undeniable realms of human</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience that involve religious</v>

3974
03:29:24.970 --> 03:29:29.970
<v Speaker 5>experience and a sense of the infinite</v>
<v Speaker 5>transcendent that looked like they're</v>

3975
03:29:30.971 --> 03:29:33.670
<v Speaker 5>healthy and that you cannot deny.</v>

3976
03:29:44.380 --> 03:29:48.050
<v Speaker 3>So you see on the left hand side there</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see horace,</v>

3977
03:29:48.140 --> 03:29:51.040
<v Speaker 3>who is the bird headed god of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I told you about,</v>

3978
03:29:51.041 --> 03:29:53.470
<v Speaker 3>who represents the capacity to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

3979
03:29:53.830 --> 03:29:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Very important concept because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians realized in really it's</v>

3980
03:29:58.151 --> 03:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something modern people do not</v>

3981
03:30:00.131 --> 03:30:03.520
<v Speaker 3>understand because we tend to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality the highest God.</v>

3982
03:30:04.030 --> 03:30:07.570
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a pathway to totalitarianism.</v>

3983
03:30:07.810 --> 03:30:11.380
<v Speaker 3>What the Egyptians knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they only knew it in symbolic form</v>

3984
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:15.790
<v Speaker 3>was it was the capacity to attend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that in some sense was the</v>

3985
03:30:15.791 --> 03:30:19.480
<v Speaker 3>highest psychological function because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the capacity to pay attention that</v>

3986
03:30:19.481 --> 03:30:24.481
<v Speaker 3>actually moves you beyond what you only</v>
<v Speaker 3>know and rationality tends to make you</v>

3987
03:30:24.611 --> 03:30:26.650
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>integral systems that are coherent,</v>

3988
03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>that are box like and then claim that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely right.</v>

3989
03:30:30.281 --> 03:30:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Whereas attention is always looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond what you know and and attention</v>

3990
03:30:34.991 --> 03:30:37.960
<v Speaker 3>is an unbelievably powerful force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3991
03:30:38.440 --> 03:30:40.010
<v Speaker 3>that's why advertisers pay for</v>

3992
03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:41.900
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why people demand it.</v>

3993
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:43.790
<v Speaker 5>That's why children can't live without</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3994
03:30:43.940 --> 03:30:46.460
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's what you want from your</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends and your family.</v>

3995
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:50.780
<v Speaker 5>You want them to pay attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an unbelievably valuable resource.</v>

3996
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:53.630
<v Speaker 5>And so one of the things I always tell</v>
<v Speaker 5>my clients,</v>

3997
03:30:53.631 --> 03:30:55.430
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're socially anxious,</v>

3998
03:30:55.431 --> 03:30:56.264
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3999
03:30:57.740 --> 03:31:00.170
<v Speaker 5>pay more attention to the person you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to.</v>

4000
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:03.260
<v Speaker 5>If you pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really pay close attention to</v>

4001
03:31:03.261 --> 03:31:06.530
<v Speaker 5>them than the thoughts that are making</v>
<v Speaker 5>you anxious will be suppressed.</v>

4002
03:31:06.740 --> 03:31:08.810
<v Speaker 5>And because you're paying close</v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to them,</v>

4003
03:31:09.020 --> 03:31:12.950
<v Speaker 5>you'll match your movements to theirs</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you'll match your conversation to</v>

4004
03:31:12.951 --> 03:31:16.070
<v Speaker 5>them and then there's no reason for you</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be socially anxious because socially</v>

4005
03:31:16.071 --> 03:31:18.110
<v Speaker 5>anxious people will go like this when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're talking,</v>

4006
03:31:18.320 --> 03:31:19.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to look at you.</v>

4007
03:31:19.820 --> 03:31:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell can you engage anyone if</v>

4008
03:31:22.700 --> 03:31:24.890
<v Speaker 5>you're not in a little dance with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4009
03:31:24.891 --> 03:31:26.920
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of it's nonverbal,</v>

4010
03:31:26.960 --> 03:31:30.620
<v Speaker 5>it's physical and it's embodied and</v>
<v Speaker 5>without paying attention.</v>

4011
03:31:30.890 --> 03:31:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Then you lose people and you see this</v>
<v Speaker 5>with speakers all the time.</v>

4012
03:31:34.191 --> 03:31:37.190
<v Speaker 5>Cue there in front of audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have their paper and they're going</v>

4013
03:31:37.191 --> 03:31:39.740
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And usually they're talking like this</v>

4014
03:31:39.741 --> 03:31:40.660
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

4015
03:31:40.730 --> 03:31:42.830
<v Speaker 5>the logical thing to do in that case is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4016
03:31:42.831 --> 03:31:46.220
<v Speaker 5>look at facebook or get the hell out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>there something.</v>

4017
03:31:46.580 --> 03:31:48.950
<v Speaker 5>But they're not paying attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

4018
03:31:49.130 --> 03:31:52.610
<v Speaker 5>And so there's no power in the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no power in the dynamic</v>

4019
03:31:52.611 --> 03:31:53.870
<v Speaker 5>conversation at all.</v>

4020
03:31:55.120 --> 03:32:00.120
<v Speaker 16>One of the experiences that I had</v>
<v Speaker 16>when I was a 1985 or thereabouts when I</v>

4021
03:32:03.251 --> 03:32:08.251
<v Speaker 16>was working on the first draft of my</v>
<v Speaker 16>book maps of meaning where I was</v>

4022
03:32:08.531 --> 03:32:13.531
<v Speaker 16>outlining this idea that the path of the</v>
<v Speaker 16>hero who voluntarily confronts</v>

4023
03:32:14.260 --> 03:32:17.770
<v Speaker 16>uncertainty and stands on the border</v>
<v Speaker 16>between chaos and order,</v>

4024
03:32:17.980 --> 03:32:20.410
<v Speaker 16>the appropriate target for human</v>
<v Speaker 16>development.</v>

4025
03:32:20.411 --> 03:32:23.020
<v Speaker 16>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 16>it's an alternative to the chaos of</v>

4026
03:32:23.021 --> 03:32:26.530
<v Speaker 16>nihilism and totalitarianism of rigid</v>
<v Speaker 16>belief.</v>

4027
03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:28.210
<v Speaker 16>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 16>So,</v>

4028
03:32:28.300 --> 03:32:31.600
<v Speaker 16>and that's the bearing of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 16>for being.</v>

4029
03:32:31.930 --> 03:32:35.260
<v Speaker 16>I was working all of that out.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's actually announced it to the post</v>

4030
03:32:35.261 --> 03:32:37.570
<v Speaker 16>modern conundrum as far as I can tell as</v>
<v Speaker 16>well.</v>

4031
03:32:37.571 --> 03:32:39.640
<v Speaker 16>But,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but anyways,</v>

4032
03:32:40.510 --> 03:32:43.120
<v Speaker 16>at the same time I was making this</v>
<v Speaker 16>sculpture,</v>

4033
03:32:43.180 --> 03:32:45.850
<v Speaker 16>which is about a foot thick.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It's made out of layers of,</v>

4034
03:32:46.480 --> 03:32:50.440
<v Speaker 16>of what's called foam core,</v>
<v Speaker 16>which is styrofoam press between two</v>

4035
03:32:50.441 --> 03:32:52.720
<v Speaker 16>pieces of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 16>That's about a quarter of an inch thick.</v>

4036
03:32:52.720 --> 03:32:55.420
<v Speaker 16>And so often used for backing on,</v>
<v Speaker 16>on,</v>

4037
03:32:55.480 --> 03:32:57.100
<v Speaker 16>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 16>on prints and so on.</v>

4038
03:32:57.101 --> 03:32:59.830
<v Speaker 16>If you get them framed,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I made this,</v>

4039
03:33:00.220 --> 03:33:04.780
<v Speaker 16>this piece that I called the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 16>music and it's a Mandela.</v>

4040
03:33:04.810 --> 03:33:08.380
<v Speaker 16>So it's a circle inscribed inside of the</v>
<v Speaker 16>square.</v>

4041
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:12.460
<v Speaker 16>Although I tried to make it</v>
<v Speaker 16>multidimensional in a complex way that I</v>

4042
03:33:12.461 --> 03:33:17.200
<v Speaker 16>can't really describe at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but what I was trying to do and I broke</v>

4043
03:33:17.201 --> 03:33:21.070
<v Speaker 16>it into pieces of what I was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 16>do was to produce a visual,</v>

4044
03:33:22.230 --> 03:33:27.230
<v Speaker 16>a object that flickered and changed when</v>
<v Speaker 16>you looked at it because it was too</v>

4045
03:33:28.751 --> 03:33:30.740
<v Speaker 16>complex to process visually.</v>
<v Speaker 16>You know,</v>

4046
03:33:30.741 --> 03:33:33.140
<v Speaker 16>like a necker cube.</v>
<v Speaker 16>That's one of those cubes that reversed</v>

4047
03:33:33.141 --> 03:33:34.980
<v Speaker 16>is when you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Yeah.</v>

4048
03:33:35.230 --> 03:33:38.310
<v Speaker 16>Well this is like a necker cube on</v>
<v Speaker 16>steroids</v>

4049
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:43.320
<v Speaker 17>because music of course it stays the</v>
<v Speaker 17>same across time,</v>

4050
03:33:43.321 --> 03:33:48.270
<v Speaker 17>but also transform across time and it's</v>
<v Speaker 17>full of layered patterns,</v>

4051
03:33:48.271 --> 03:33:51.510
<v Speaker 17>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and the patterns interact harmoniously</v>

4052
03:33:51.511 --> 03:33:54.540
<v Speaker 17>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And it had appeared and I was fascinated</v>

4053
03:33:54.541 --> 03:33:58.560
<v Speaker 17>by music because it gives people the</v>
<v Speaker 17>direct intimation of meaning.</v>

4054
03:33:58.860 --> 03:34:03.660
<v Speaker 17>Even if they're nihilistic punk rockers,</v>
<v Speaker 17>they still can't criticize the</v>

4055
03:34:03.661 --> 03:34:06.930
<v Speaker 17>experience of meaning that they,</v>
<v Speaker 17>that they,</v>

4056
03:34:07.290 --> 03:34:11.150
<v Speaker 17>that they engage in when they're</v>
<v Speaker 17>listening to their favorite band and it</v>

4057
03:34:11.250 --> 03:34:15.510
<v Speaker 17>helps them transcend the denialism of</v>
<v Speaker 17>rationality.</v>

4058
03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:21.030
<v Speaker 17>And if you can't argue with it,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it's like arguing with dance beyond</v>

4059
03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:23.790
<v Speaker 17>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And so I was making this,</v>

4060
03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:27.750
<v Speaker 17>this sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and I spent like four months on it.</v>

4061
03:34:27.751 --> 03:34:32.751
<v Speaker 17>I was thinking about it a lot and I got</v>
<v Speaker 17>it mostly assembled and then I was in my</v>

4062
03:34:33.391 --> 03:34:38.391
<v Speaker 17>living room in Montreal and I was</v>
<v Speaker 17>listening to Mozart Symphony,</v>

4063
03:34:38.881 --> 03:34:41.430
<v Speaker 17>the Jupiter symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 17>and I was really listening to it and</v>

4064
03:34:41.431 --> 03:34:46.431
<v Speaker 17>it's one of these complex Lee multilevel</v>
<v Speaker 17>pattern pattern pieces of auditory</v>

4065
03:34:48.451 --> 03:34:53.451
<v Speaker 17>sculpture that I believe represents</v>
<v Speaker 17>being because what being is is multiple</v>

4066
03:34:53.941 --> 03:34:58.941
<v Speaker 17>levels of patterned transformation</v>
<v Speaker 17>interact and simultaneously and music is</v>

4067
03:35:00.511 --> 03:35:03.300
<v Speaker 17>a representation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 17>which is why people find a meaningful.</v>

4068
03:35:03.330 --> 03:35:05.790
<v Speaker 17>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I was listening intently to this</v>

4069
03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:11.040
<v Speaker 17>symphony and at the same time I was</v>
<v Speaker 17>concentrating on the sculpture that I</v>

4070
03:35:11.041 --> 03:35:12.720
<v Speaker 17>have made.</v>
<v Speaker 17>All of a sudden,</v>

4071
03:35:13.860 --> 03:35:16.530
<v Speaker 17>everything I'm about to say is a</v>
<v Speaker 17>metaphor because.</v>

4072
03:35:17.550 --> 03:35:20.460
<v Speaker 17>Because there's no way of encapsulating</v>
<v Speaker 17>it properly in words,</v>

4073
03:35:20.461 --> 03:35:22.980
<v Speaker 17>but it was as if the heavens opened up</v>
<v Speaker 17>above.</v>

4074
03:35:23.500 --> 03:35:25.500
<v Speaker 17>I mean I was still in my living room,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but yes,</v>

4075
03:35:25.860 --> 03:35:29.790
<v Speaker 17>it reminds me.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Experience is best represented by one of</v>

4076
03:35:29.791 --> 03:35:34.791
<v Speaker 17>those early renaissance paintings where</v>
<v Speaker 17>you see God or Christ up in the sky with</v>

4077
03:35:36.241 --> 03:35:40.050
<v Speaker 17>an opening in the sky against the clouds</v>
<v Speaker 17>and against the sun,</v>

4078
03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:44.700
<v Speaker 17>so it was like that even though I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 17>really see that,</v>

4079
03:35:44.730 --> 03:35:48.300
<v Speaker 17>but it felt like that and there was some</v>
<v Speaker 17>visuals that were associated with it and</v>

4080
03:35:48.301 --> 03:35:53.301
<v Speaker 17>I felt something descend upon me that it</v>
<v Speaker 17>had a personal nature,</v>

4081
03:35:53.580 --> 03:35:55.860
<v Speaker 17>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 17>something like what you were describing</v>

4082
03:35:55.861 --> 03:36:00.861
<v Speaker 17>as a higher consciousness that was</v>
<v Speaker 17>actually a being of a sort and it failed</v>

4083
03:36:02.371 --> 03:36:07.371
<v Speaker 17>me from the inside out and I had the and</v>
<v Speaker 17>it was.</v>

4084
03:36:08.220 --> 03:36:10.470
<v Speaker 17>It was enrapturing,</v>
<v Speaker 17>let's say,</v>

4085
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:15.780
<v Speaker 17>and it was an incredible feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It was a divine feeling,</v>

4086
03:36:15.781 --> 03:36:17.840
<v Speaker 17>I suppose is the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 17>about it.</v>

4087
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:19.470
<v Speaker 17>Certainly a religious experience.</v>

4088
03:36:21.780 --> 03:36:26.780
<v Speaker 17>I was an it transform me and turned me</v>
<v Speaker 17>into something far more than I than I</v>

4089
03:36:27.810 --> 03:36:32.370
<v Speaker 17>normally was and maybe you can take them</v>
<v Speaker 17>out that as an intimation of what you</v>

4090
03:36:32.371 --> 03:36:35.040
<v Speaker 17>could become if you worked on it for the</v>
<v Speaker 17>rest of your life.</v>

4091
03:36:35.230 --> 03:36:39.700
<v Speaker 17>Sometimes I think hallucinogens</v>
<v Speaker 17>providing people with an image of who</v>

4092
03:36:39.701 --> 03:36:41.540
<v Speaker 17>they could be a shared goal,</v>
<v Speaker 17>them,</v>

4093
03:36:41.550 --> 03:36:42.940
<v Speaker 17>they're dead wood,</v>
<v Speaker 17>right.</v>

4094
03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:46.540
<v Speaker 17>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 17>it was as if an offer is being made to</v>

4095
03:36:46.541 --> 03:36:49.930
<v Speaker 17>me that I could be like that from now on</v>
<v Speaker 17>permanently.</v>

4096
03:36:52.900 --> 03:36:54.370
<v Speaker 16>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 16>I don't know how to do that.</v>

4097
03:36:54.371 --> 03:36:57.100
<v Speaker 16>I couldn't walk down the street in this</v>
<v Speaker 16>condition,</v>

4098
03:36:57.101 --> 03:36:59.650
<v Speaker 16>in this elevated condition.</v>

4099
03:37:00.330 --> 03:37:02.600
<v Speaker 17>I wouldn't belong in the world anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I,</v>

4100
03:37:02.930 --> 03:37:06.150
<v Speaker 17>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I wouldn't know how to function.</v>

4101
03:37:06.470 --> 03:37:11.470
<v Speaker 17>I don't know how I could do it and stole</v>
<v Speaker 17>the experience.</v>

4102
03:37:12.780 --> 03:37:17.780
<v Speaker 17>This thing say that was communicating</v>
<v Speaker 17>with me was accepted that as an answer,</v>

4103
03:37:19.771 --> 03:37:24.120
<v Speaker 17>although I would say with some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 17>it.</v>

4104
03:37:24.570 --> 03:37:29.280
<v Speaker 17>And then I went and talked to my waist</v>
<v Speaker 17>and I told her what had happened and I</v>

4105
03:37:29.281 --> 03:37:34.281
<v Speaker 17>was shaking a lot and like a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 17>amount and my pupils were completely</v>

4106
03:37:35.911 --> 03:37:37.380
<v Speaker 17>dilated.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Wow.</v>

4107
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:39.960
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And that happened to me one other time</v>

4108
03:37:40.400 --> 03:37:42.630
<v Speaker 17>in a similar manner,</v>
<v Speaker 17>although it's more like an echo.</v>

4109
03:37:42.631 --> 03:37:45.740
<v Speaker 17>It wasn't quite as intense,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but you know,</v>

4110
03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:49.980
<v Speaker 17>I was concentrating very much on trying</v>
<v Speaker 17>to understand the meaning,</v>

4111
03:37:50.310 --> 03:37:54.990
<v Speaker 17>the central meaning of music and of</v>
<v Speaker 17>course this phenomena of meaning itself</v>

4112
03:37:54.991 --> 03:37:59.130
<v Speaker 17>and it seemed like the combination of</v>
<v Speaker 17>that intense concentration and the</v>

4113
03:37:59.131 --> 03:38:03.570
<v Speaker 17>visual stimulation and the music all</v>
<v Speaker 17>culminated to produce this</v>

4114
03:38:03.571 --> 03:38:05.700
<v Speaker 17>transformation of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 17>But that was,</v>

4115
03:38:06.090 --> 03:38:07.230
<v Speaker 17>that was its nature.</v>

4116
03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:13.560
<v Speaker 16>I haven't either.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Miscarry mushrooms are often buy,</v>

4117
03:38:13.970 --> 03:38:15.630
<v Speaker 16>buy mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 16>like silicide,</v>

4118
03:38:15.631 --> 03:38:19.830
<v Speaker 16>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 16>those substances are to call them</v>

4119
03:38:19.831 --> 03:38:22.500
<v Speaker 16>strange is barely to scrape the surface.</v>

4120
03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:24.660
<v Speaker 18>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 18>have you taken psychedelics?</v>

4121
03:38:25.170 --> 03:38:26.060
<v Speaker 18>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I have.</v>

4122
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:28.390
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and yeah,</v>

4123
03:38:28.391 --> 03:38:30.630
<v Speaker 18>so it sounds like it because.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Exactly,</v>

4124
03:38:31.450 --> 03:38:32.520
<v Speaker 18>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 18>You're right there.</v>

4125
03:38:32.521 --> 03:38:33.354
<v Speaker 18>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it's an,</v>

4126
03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:35.730
<v Speaker 18>it's this straight.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It's the strangest of things.</v>

4127
03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:38.660
<v Speaker 18>And,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and when it comes to identity in the</v>

4128
03:38:38.661 --> 03:38:43.220
<v Speaker 18>psychedelics affect on human identity,</v>
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>

4129
03:38:43.540 --> 03:38:48.540
<v Speaker 18>it does create an experience that is</v>
<v Speaker 18>transcendent to the very temporary human</v>

4130
03:38:52.651 --> 03:38:54.180
<v Speaker 18>form that we're currently within.</v>

4131
03:38:54.900 --> 03:38:55.351
<v Speaker 16>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Well,</v>

4132
03:38:55.351 --> 03:38:57.810
<v Speaker 16>there's a psychiatrist named Rick</v>
<v Speaker 16>Strassman.</v>

4133
03:38:57.990 --> 03:39:00.960
<v Speaker 16>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Was at the University of Texas and he</v>

4134
03:39:00.961 --> 03:39:04.440
<v Speaker 16>had been giving his experimental</v>
<v Speaker 16>subjects.</v>

4135
03:39:04.500 --> 03:39:08.160
<v Speaker 16>He's one of two groups that have got</v>
<v Speaker 16>permission to start experimenting with</v>

4136
03:39:08.161 --> 03:39:09.210
<v Speaker 16>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Again,</v>

4137
03:39:09.211 --> 03:39:13.830
<v Speaker 16>the other one was a group at Johns</v>
<v Speaker 16>Hopkins who have been recording,</v>

4138
03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:18.240
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>the consequences of giving experimental</v>

4139
03:39:18.241 --> 03:39:20.970
<v Speaker 16>subjects a suicide than yes,</v>
<v Speaker 16>in a,</v>

4140
03:39:21.020 --> 03:39:25.200
<v Speaker 16>in its chemical form they report,</v>
<v Speaker 16>they've reported,</v>

4141
03:39:25.310 --> 03:39:28.890
<v Speaker 16>um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>permanent personality transformations on</v>

4142
03:39:28.891 --> 03:39:31.980
<v Speaker 16>the part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 16>of the people who took the psilocybin</v>

4143
03:39:31.981 --> 03:39:36.230
<v Speaker 16>mushrooms who had a experience.</v>
<v Speaker 16>And so what's happened to them apart</v>

4144
03:39:36.231 --> 03:39:41.231
<v Speaker 16>from the fact that they regarded the</v>
<v Speaker 16>experience as one of the top two or</v>

4145
03:39:41.631 --> 03:39:45.080
<v Speaker 16>three experiences of their life in terms</v>
<v Speaker 16>of transformation,</v>

4146
03:39:45.680 --> 03:39:48.800
<v Speaker 16>is that when you give them personality</v>
<v Speaker 16>tests a year later,</v>

4147
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:52.970
<v Speaker 16>these are five factor personality tests</v>
<v Speaker 16>and they test extroversion,</v>

4148
03:39:52.971 --> 03:39:54.350
<v Speaker 16>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 16>agreeableness,</v>

4149
03:39:54.351 --> 03:39:58.610
<v Speaker 16>conscientiousness and openness and</v>
<v Speaker 16>openness is a creativity dimension,</v>

4150
03:39:59.210 --> 03:40:01.760
<v Speaker 16>an aesthetic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 16>creativity,</v>

4151
03:40:01.761 --> 03:40:06.761
<v Speaker 16>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 16>and their scores on openness increased</v>

4152
03:40:07.161 --> 03:40:12.080
<v Speaker 16>substantially approximately the</v>
<v Speaker 16>equivalent from the 50th percentile to</v>

4153
03:40:12.081 --> 03:40:15.800
<v Speaker 16>the 85th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 16>which is one standard deviation.</v>

4154
03:40:16.170 --> 03:40:20.840
<v Speaker 16>They increase and stay that way up to</v>
<v Speaker 16>one year later.</v>

4155
03:40:21.230 --> 03:40:22.520
<v Speaker 16>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 16>these,</v>

4156
03:40:22.580 --> 03:40:26.780
<v Speaker 16>these chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 16>these strange chemicals produced very</v>

4157
03:40:26.781 --> 03:40:31.370
<v Speaker 16>long lasting effects on people's</v>
<v Speaker 16>perception and they do produce</v>

4158
03:40:31.460 --> 03:40:33.560
<v Speaker 16>intimations of mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Now,</v>

4159
03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:37.400
<v Speaker 16>strassman actually got scared away from</v>
<v Speaker 16>his DMT research.</v>

4160
03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:38.930
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 16>he was a pretty,</v>

4161
03:40:39.050 --> 03:40:42.500
<v Speaker 16>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 16>conservative scientist and was</v>

4162
03:40:43.310 --> 03:40:47.630
<v Speaker 16>administering dmt intravenously because</v>
<v Speaker 16>it has a very short half life if you</v>

4163
03:40:47.631 --> 03:40:52.100
<v Speaker 16>take it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 16>It only lasts about 10 minutes and his</v>

4164
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:57.370
<v Speaker 16>people every and who were very carefully</v>
<v Speaker 16>screened to begin with for sanity and so</v>

4165
03:40:57.741 --> 03:40:59.870
<v Speaker 16>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Although they have some experience with</v>

4166
03:40:59.871 --> 03:41:03.870
<v Speaker 16>psychedelic drugs because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 16>want to introduce naive people to,</v>

4167
03:41:03.970 --> 03:41:07.880
<v Speaker 16>to anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 16>They all reported being shot out of</v>

4168
03:41:07.881 --> 03:41:10.360
<v Speaker 16>their body and encountering alien</v>
<v Speaker 16>beings,</v>

4169
03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:13.700
<v Speaker 16>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 16>And they,</v>

4170
03:41:13.820 --> 03:41:16.220
<v Speaker 16>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 16>when straussman attempted to explain</v>

4171
03:41:16.221 --> 03:41:17.870
<v Speaker 16>that away as a,</v>
<v Speaker 16>well,</v>

4172
03:41:17.871 --> 03:41:19.400
<v Speaker 16>let's call it a hallucination.</v>

4173
03:41:19.430 --> 03:41:22.820
<v Speaker 16>Although technically if you're</v>
<v Speaker 16>hallucinating,</v>

4174
03:41:22.821 --> 03:41:25.490
<v Speaker 16>you know that you're hallucinating and</v>
<v Speaker 16>you know what's real.</v>

4175
03:41:25.491 --> 03:41:28.250
<v Speaker 16>So these were far deeper than</v>
<v Speaker 16>hallucination,</v>

4176
03:41:28.251 --> 03:41:31.770
<v Speaker 16>right?</v>
<v Speaker 16>Or that they were something like young</v>

4177
03:41:31.771 --> 03:41:36.771
<v Speaker 16>Ian Archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but his subjects insisted that including</v>

4178
03:41:38.361 --> 03:41:42.950
<v Speaker 16>people who knew quite a bit about</v>
<v Speaker 16>archetipal psychology insisted that that</v>

4179
03:41:42.951 --> 03:41:45.980
<v Speaker 16>was not correct,</v>
<v Speaker 16>that they were in fact shot out of their</v>

4180
03:41:45.981 --> 03:41:50.981
<v Speaker 16>bodies into other spaces and dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 16>and that they encountered beings of all</v>

4181
03:41:51.351 --> 03:41:55.130
<v Speaker 16>sorts of different types.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Some of whom were surprised to see them.</v>

4182
03:41:55.131 --> 03:41:58.580
<v Speaker 16>Some of whom were happy they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 16>some of whom engaged them in</v>

4183
03:41:58.581 --> 03:42:00.080
<v Speaker 16>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 16>Um,</v>

4184
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:05.160
<v Speaker 16>I mean it makes very strange reading it</v>
<v Speaker 16>and it,</v>

4185
03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:08.060
<v Speaker 16>it.</v>
<v Speaker 16>There's no straightforward may way of</v>

4186
03:42:08.061 --> 03:42:12.230
<v Speaker 16>making sense of it and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 16>straightforward way of making sense of</v>

4187
03:42:12.231 --> 03:42:15.060
<v Speaker 16>the shamanic experiences to Eliana</v>
<v Speaker 16>thought that,</v>

4188
03:42:15.860 --> 03:42:19.840
<v Speaker 16>that those,</v>
<v Speaker 16>those rituals have been if,</v>

4189
03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:23.630
<v Speaker 16>if they were induced by drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 16>that that was a corrupt form of the</v>

4190
03:42:23.631 --> 03:42:27.230
<v Speaker 16>original ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 16>but I think later scholarship is</v>

4191
03:42:27.231 --> 03:42:31.320
<v Speaker 16>indicated that that's profoundly wrong</v>
<v Speaker 16>and that's the basis of these</v>

4192
03:42:31.500 --> 03:42:36.500
<v Speaker 16>experiences is in fact hallucinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 16>experience of the sort say that the</v>

4193
03:42:37.411 --> 03:42:40.380
<v Speaker 16>aztecs induced with siliciden mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 16>or masculine.</v>

4194
03:42:42.170 --> 03:42:44.210
<v Speaker 11>The first thing I'll do is tell you a</v>
<v Speaker 11>story about</v>

4195
03:42:45.890 --> 03:42:50.060
<v Speaker 11>female neurologist whose name escapes me</v>
<v Speaker 11>at the moment.</v>

4196
03:42:50.061 --> 03:42:51.920
<v Speaker 11>She wrote a book called my stroke of</v>
<v Speaker 11>insight.</v>

4197
03:42:52.850 --> 03:42:57.440
<v Speaker 11>Jill bolty I think is her name and she</v>
<v Speaker 11>was a harvard trained.</v>

4198
03:42:58.870 --> 03:43:00.080
<v Speaker 11>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>she had,</v>

4199
03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:04.610
<v Speaker 11>she had medical training from Harvard in</v>
<v Speaker 11>neuropsychological function and knew a</v>

4200
03:43:04.611 --> 03:43:08.300
<v Speaker 11>lot about hemispheric specialization.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We talked a little bit about hemispheric</v>

4201
03:43:08.301 --> 03:43:13.301
<v Speaker 11>specialization before and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>ways of conceptualizing the difference</v>

4202
03:43:13.341 --> 03:43:16.670
<v Speaker 11>between the two hemispheres is that the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere operates in known</v>

4203
03:43:16.671 --> 03:43:19.430
<v Speaker 11>territory and the right hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 11>operates in unknown territory.</v>

4204
03:43:19.730 --> 03:43:23.780
<v Speaker 11>That's one way of thinking about or the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere operates in the orderly</v>

4205
03:43:23.781 --> 03:43:24.950
<v Speaker 11>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In the right hemisphere,</v>

4206
03:43:24.951 --> 03:43:29.660
<v Speaker 11>operates in the chaotic domain or the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere operates in the domain</v>

4207
03:43:29.661 --> 03:43:32.450
<v Speaker 11>of detail,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and the right hemisphere operates in the</v>

4208
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:35.960
<v Speaker 11>domain of the large picture.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's something like that.</v>

4209
03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:38.450
<v Speaker 11>Now people differ in their neurological</v>
<v Speaker 11>wiring,</v>

4210
03:43:38.451 --> 03:43:41.990
<v Speaker 11>so those are over generalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that's okay.</v>

4211
03:43:41.991 --> 03:43:43.670
<v Speaker 11>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We'll live with that for the time being.</v>

4212
03:43:43.850 --> 03:43:47.030
<v Speaker 11>It's certainly not an overgeneralization</v>
<v Speaker 11>to point out that you do in fact have</v>

4213
03:43:47.031 --> 03:43:50.420
<v Speaker 11>two hemispheres and that their</v>
<v Speaker 11>structures differ and if the connections</v>

4214
03:43:50.421 --> 03:43:52.010
<v Speaker 11>between the market,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which could happen,</v>

4215
03:43:52.011 --> 03:43:53.960
<v Speaker 11>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you had surgery for intractable</v>

4216
03:43:53.961 --> 03:43:56.360
<v Speaker 11>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that each hemisphere would be capable of</v>

4217
03:43:56.361 --> 03:44:01.361
<v Speaker 11>housing its own consciousness that's</v>
<v Speaker 11>been well documented by a neuro neuro</v>

4218
03:44:01.850 --> 03:44:06.850
<v Speaker 11>neurologist named Monica who did and</v>
<v Speaker 11>Sperry who did split brain experiments</v>

4219
03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:10.730
<v Speaker 11>must be 30 years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

4220
03:44:11.860 --> 03:44:15.170
<v Speaker 11>and we know that the right and the left</v>
<v Speaker 11>hemisphere are specialized for different</v>

4221
03:44:15.171 --> 03:44:16.280
<v Speaker 11>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The Right Hemisphere,</v>

4222
03:44:16.281 --> 03:44:18.020
<v Speaker 11>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 11>seems to be more involved in</v>

4223
03:44:18.021 --> 03:44:22.190
<v Speaker 11>degeneration of negative emotion and the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere more involved in the</v>

4224
03:44:22.191 --> 03:44:24.020
<v Speaker 11>generation of positive emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 11>approach.</v>

4225
03:44:24.021 --> 03:44:26.240
<v Speaker 11>So the right hemisphere stops you in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere,</v>

4226
03:44:26.241 --> 03:44:27.074
<v Speaker 11>moves you forward.</v>

4227
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:30.770
<v Speaker 11>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Jill Bolty,</v>

4228
03:44:31.700 --> 03:44:36.620
<v Speaker 11>I hope I've got that right,</v>
<v Speaker 11>had a stroke and maintained</v>

4229
03:44:36.621 --> 03:44:41.390
<v Speaker 11>consciousness during the stroke and</v>
<v Speaker 11>analyzed it while it was happening and</v>

4230
03:44:41.391 --> 03:44:43.130
<v Speaker 11>she was able.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

4231
03:44:43.131 --> 03:44:47.660
<v Speaker 11>it was happening to hypothesize about</v>
<v Speaker 11>what part of her brain was being</v>

4232
03:44:47.661 --> 03:44:52.661
<v Speaker 11>destroyed and so she had a congenital</v>
<v Speaker 11>blood vessel malformation and had an</v>

4233
03:44:53.790 --> 03:44:58.790
<v Speaker 11>aneurysm and it just about killed her,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but she said that it effected her left</v>

4234
03:45:01.221 --> 03:45:06.221
<v Speaker 11>hemisphere and she said that she</v>
<v Speaker 11>experienced a sense of divine unity as a</v>

4235
03:45:08.061 --> 03:45:12.410
<v Speaker 11>consequence of the stroke because the</v>
<v Speaker 11>left hemisphere function was disrupted</v>

4236
03:45:12.411 --> 03:45:17.411
<v Speaker 11>and destroyed and so she became a right</v>
<v Speaker 11>hemisphere dominant and her experience</v>

4237
03:45:17.901 --> 03:45:21.620
<v Speaker 11>of that was the dissolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 11>specific ego into the,</v>

4238
03:45:22.220 --> 03:45:24.470
<v Speaker 11>into absolute consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 11>something like that.</v>

4239
03:45:25.220 --> 03:45:29.500
<v Speaker 11>Now that's only a case study and you</v>
<v Speaker 11>don't want to make too much of studies,</v>

4240
03:45:29.501 --> 03:45:34.501
<v Speaker 11>but there is an overwhelming amount of</v>
<v Speaker 11>evidence that those two kinds of</v>

4241
03:45:35.171 --> 03:45:36.520
<v Speaker 11>consciousness exist.</v>

4242
03:45:37.150 --> 03:45:42.150
<v Speaker 11>One being your consciousness of you as a</v>
<v Speaker 11>localized and specified being and the</v>

4243
03:45:44.201 --> 03:45:49.201
<v Speaker 11>other being this capacity to experience</v>
<v Speaker 11>oceanic disillusion and the sense of the</v>

4244
03:45:52.181 --> 03:45:57.181
<v Speaker 11>cosmos being one.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now why we have those capacities for</v>

4245
03:45:57.941 --> 03:46:02.941
<v Speaker 11>different conscious experiences is very</v>
<v Speaker 11>difficult to understand.</v>

4246
03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:06.640
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>part of me thinks that maybe we have a</v>

4247
03:46:06.641 --> 03:46:11.641
<v Speaker 11>generic human brain that's the brain of</v>
<v Speaker 11>the species and allied with that we have</v>

4248
03:46:13.721 --> 03:46:18.040
<v Speaker 11>a specific individual brain and one is</v>
<v Speaker 11>the left hemisphere and the other is the</v>

4249
03:46:18.041 --> 03:46:19.630
<v Speaker 11>right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the left hemisphere of being the</v>

4250
03:46:19.631 --> 03:46:23.560
<v Speaker 11>specific individual brain and usually</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's on and working because you</v>

4251
03:46:23.561 --> 03:46:27.790
<v Speaker 11>obviously have to take care of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 11>as a specific entity and not as a</v>

4252
03:46:27.791 --> 03:46:32.791
<v Speaker 11>generalized cosmic phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's hard to dice salary when you're a</v>

4253
03:46:33.041 --> 03:46:35.680
<v Speaker 11>generalized cosmic phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

4254
03:46:35.681 --> 03:46:37.630
<v Speaker 11>So you have to be more pointed than</v>
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>

4255
03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:38.591
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but look,</v>

4256
03:46:38.591 --> 03:46:40.060
<v Speaker 11>let's make no mistake about it.</v>

4257
03:46:41.020 --> 03:46:45.520
<v Speaker 11>The fact that those different states of</v>
<v Speaker 11>consciousness exist is not disputable.</v>

4258
03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:49.180
<v Speaker 11>They can be elicited in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 11>ways,</v>

4259
03:46:50.020 --> 03:46:54.340
<v Speaker 11>and so I'm going to read you something</v>
<v Speaker 11>that Elvis Huxley wrote about this back,</v>

4260
03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:57.520
<v Speaker 11>I think in 1956.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This was after he</v>

4261
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:05.110
<v Speaker 11>started his experimentation with</v>
<v Speaker 11>masculine because the psychedelics were</v>

4262
03:47:05.111 --> 03:47:08.290
<v Speaker 11>introduced into Western culture in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>19 fifties and a whole bunch of</v>

4263
03:47:08.291 --> 03:47:10.240
<v Speaker 11>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So as I've been mushrooms,</v>

4264
03:47:10.420 --> 03:47:15.420
<v Speaker 11>LSD was discovered right after the end</v>
<v Speaker 11>of World War II was discovered by</v>

4265
03:47:15.671 --> 03:47:18.460
<v Speaker 11>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 11>actually laboratory sandow was labs.</v>

4266
03:47:18.461 --> 03:47:21.430
<v Speaker 11>The guy who discovered it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Albert Hoffman had spilled some on his</v>

4267
03:47:21.431 --> 03:47:23.560
<v Speaker 11>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You can absorb it through your skin,</v>

4268
03:47:24.130 --> 03:47:27.610
<v Speaker 11>and he was biking home and had the</v>
<v Speaker 11>world's first LSD trip,</v>

4269
03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:31.930
<v Speaker 11>which was somewhat of a shock to him and</v>
<v Speaker 11>then to the entire world.</v>

4270
03:47:33.190 --> 03:47:35.470
<v Speaker 11>Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 11>who was a great literary figure,</v>

4271
03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:39.640
<v Speaker 11>a real genius,</v>
<v Speaker 11>experimented with Mescaline in the late</v>

4272
03:47:39.641 --> 03:47:43.090
<v Speaker 11>fifties and he wrote a book called the</v>
<v Speaker 11>doors of perception,</v>

4273
03:47:43.091 --> 03:47:46.120
<v Speaker 11>which had a huge impact on the emerging</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychedelic culture,</v>

4274
03:47:46.390 --> 03:47:51.390
<v Speaker 11>both on the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it at Harvard and on the West Coast with</v>

4275
03:47:51.490 --> 03:47:53.120
<v Speaker 11>Ken Keasy and is Mary Pranksters.</v>

4276
03:47:53.140 --> 03:47:56.140
<v Speaker 11>The people who popularized lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's all documented in a book called</v>

4277
03:47:56.141 --> 03:47:59.050
<v Speaker 11>the electric koolaid acid test,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which I would highly recommend.</v>

4278
03:47:59.380 --> 03:48:01.150
<v Speaker 11>It's Tom Wolfe.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's brilliant book.</v>

4279
03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:03.460
<v Speaker 11>I'm on the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was timothy leary.</v>

4280
03:48:03.820 --> 03:48:06.880
<v Speaker 11>I had timothy leary's old job at</v>
<v Speaker 11>Harvard,</v>

4281
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:08.710
<v Speaker 11>so that was kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

4282
03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:12.490
<v Speaker 11>warped way,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so I met people there who knew him,</v>

4283
03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:17.080
<v Speaker 11>who didn't think much of them also,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but who did know him,</v>

4284
03:48:17.081 --> 03:48:22.030
<v Speaker 11>but Huxley had this masculine experience</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it transported him to this</v>

4285
03:48:22.690 --> 03:48:27.100
<v Speaker 11>alternative consciousness and he said</v>
<v Speaker 11>that during his masculine experience,</v>

4286
03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:31.160
<v Speaker 11>the entire world glowed from within.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like if there was an inner light like a</v>

4287
03:48:31.161 --> 03:48:34.250
<v Speaker 11>paradise inner light,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and then everything was deeply</v>

4288
03:48:34.251 --> 03:48:39.251
<v Speaker 11>meaningful and symbolically suggestive</v>
<v Speaker 11>and overwhelming and beautiful and</v>

4289
03:48:39.441 --> 03:48:42.560
<v Speaker 11>timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so he had an experience of divine</v>

4290
03:48:42.890 --> 03:48:45.770
<v Speaker 11>eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I suppose is the most straightforward</v>

4291
03:48:45.771 --> 03:48:49.190
<v Speaker 11>way to to put that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and we know perfectly well that the</v>

4292
03:48:49.191 --> 03:48:52.580
<v Speaker 11>psychedelic drugs that all share the</v>
<v Speaker 11>same chemical structure,</v>

4293
03:48:52.820 --> 03:48:55.190
<v Speaker 11>they interact with the brain chemical</v>
<v Speaker 11>called Serotonin,</v>

4294
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:57.860
<v Speaker 11>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very fundamental neurotransmitter.</v>

4295
03:48:58.290 --> 03:49:02.210
<v Speaker 11>They all have approximately the same</v>
<v Speaker 11>range of effects,</v>

4296
03:49:03.170 --> 03:49:06.710
<v Speaker 11>although those effects are very.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's a very large multitude of</v>

4297
03:49:06.711 --> 03:49:10.010
<v Speaker 11>effects that sort of exist underneath</v>
<v Speaker 11>that umbrella.</v>

4298
03:49:11.930 --> 03:49:16.930
<v Speaker 11>Huxley was</v>
<v Speaker 11>staggered by his masculine experience.</v>

4299
03:49:18.490 --> 03:49:20.480
<v Speaker 11>He,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he didn't really know what to make of it</v>

4300
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:25.070
<v Speaker 11>and I think that that's the common</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience of people who have</v>

4301
03:49:25.490 --> 03:49:27.980
<v Speaker 11>exceptionally profound psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiences,</v>

4302
03:49:28.250 --> 03:49:29.060
<v Speaker 11>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'll,</v>

4303
03:49:29.060 --> 03:49:31.670
<v Speaker 11>I'll tell you some documentation about</v>
<v Speaker 11>that in a moment,</v>

4304
03:49:31.940 --> 03:49:36.500
<v Speaker 11>but he spent quite a long time trying to</v>
<v Speaker 11>come to grips with what this might mean</v>

4305
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:39.830
<v Speaker 11>from an intellectual perspective and in</v>
<v Speaker 11>Huxley had a great brain.</v>

4306
03:49:39.831 --> 03:49:41.660
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if someone was going to wrestle with a</v>

4307
03:49:41.661 --> 03:49:43.670
<v Speaker 11>problem like that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he was a good candidate.</v>

4308
03:49:43.730 --> 03:49:46.670
<v Speaker 11>He must've had a verbal Iq of 180.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean he's.</v>

4309
03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:50.350
<v Speaker 11>His books are incredibly literate,</v>
<v Speaker 11>incredible credible,</v>

4310
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:55.130
<v Speaker 11>mastery of language and complexity of</v>
<v Speaker 11>characterization and intellectual</v>

4311
03:49:55.131 --> 03:49:56.570
<v Speaker 11>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Really remarkable.</v>

4312
03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:01.580
<v Speaker 11>So this is what Huxley actually had to</v>
<v Speaker 11>say after his masculine experience.</v>

4313
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:05.660
<v Speaker 11>He talked about heaven and hell and he</v>
<v Speaker 11>talked about that in reference to bad</v>

4314
03:50:05.661 --> 03:50:09.200
<v Speaker 11>trips,</v>
<v Speaker 11>essentially because it was known by that</v>

4315
03:50:09.201 --> 03:50:14.201
<v Speaker 11>point that a psychedelic experience</v>
<v Speaker 11>could transport you to an ecstatic</v>

4316
03:50:14.300 --> 03:50:17.810
<v Speaker 11>domain of divine revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but could take you to the worst</v>

4317
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:21.710
<v Speaker 11>imaginable place as well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and Huxley was very interested in why</v>

4318
03:50:21.711 --> 03:50:25.790
<v Speaker 11>you would even have the capacity for</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiences like that and which I think</v>

4319
03:50:25.791 --> 03:50:28.250
<v Speaker 11>is a very good question and it's</v>
<v Speaker 11>completely unanswered question.</v>

4320
03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:30.560
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we don't know much about consciousness</v>

4321
03:50:30.561 --> 03:50:32.840
<v Speaker 11>and we know even less about</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychedelics.</v>

4322
03:50:32.841 --> 03:50:35.630
<v Speaker 11>I would say they are an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 11>mystery.</v>

4323
03:50:35.930 --> 03:50:38.210
<v Speaker 11>I don't think we understand them in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>least.</v>

4324
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:43.070
<v Speaker 11>Huxley did a good job of starting to at</v>
<v Speaker 11>least map out the mysteries of the</v>

4325
03:50:43.071 --> 03:50:45.320
<v Speaker 11>terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He said like the earth of 100 years ago,</v>

4326
03:50:45.321 --> 03:50:47.410
<v Speaker 11>our minds still has its darkest</v>
<v Speaker 11>Africa's.</v>

4327
03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:52.370
<v Speaker 11>It's unmapped,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Borneo and Amazonian Basin in relation</v>

4328
03:50:52.371 --> 03:50:55.880
<v Speaker 11>to the fauna of these regions.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We are not yet zoologists.</v>

4329
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:59.060
<v Speaker 11>We are mere naturalists and collectors</v>
<v Speaker 11>of specimens.</v>

4330
03:50:59.240 --> 03:51:01.850
<v Speaker 11>The fact is unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but we have to accept it.</v>

4331
03:51:02.090 --> 03:51:04.820
<v Speaker 11>We have to make the best of it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>However,</v>

4332
03:51:04.821 --> 03:51:08.840
<v Speaker 11>lowly the work of the collector must be</v>
<v Speaker 11>done before we can proceed to the higher</v>

4333
03:51:08.841 --> 03:51:11.210
<v Speaker 11>scientific tasks of classification,</v>
<v Speaker 11>analysis,</v>

4334
03:51:11.211 --> 03:51:14.750
<v Speaker 11>experiment and theory making like the</v>
<v Speaker 11>giraffe and the duck billed.</v>

4335
03:51:14.751 --> 03:51:17.210
<v Speaker 11>Platypus.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The creatures inhabiting these remoter</v>

4336
03:51:17.211 --> 03:51:20.780
<v Speaker 11>regions of the mind are exceedingly</v>
<v Speaker 11>improbable.</v>

4337
03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:22.310
<v Speaker 11>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they exist.</v>

4338
03:51:22.311 --> 03:51:25.230
<v Speaker 11>They're facts of observation,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and as such,</v>

4339
03:51:25.231 --> 03:51:28.350
<v Speaker 11>they cannot be ignored by anyone who was</v>
<v Speaker 11>honestly trying to understand the world</v>

4340
03:51:28.620 --> 03:51:29.490
<v Speaker 11>in which he lives.</v>

4341
03:51:34.870 --> 03:51:39.870
<v Speaker 11>When psychiatrist started to study lsd</v>
<v Speaker 11>that was mostly in the late fifties and</v>

4342
03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:44.230
<v Speaker 11>running forward from that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they thought about the drug as a</v>

4343
03:51:44.460 --> 03:51:47.800
<v Speaker 11>psychotomimetic,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which was a chemical substance that</v>

4344
03:51:47.801 --> 03:51:51.520
<v Speaker 11>would induce psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that turned out to not be true,</v>

4345
03:51:51.940 --> 03:51:56.940
<v Speaker 11>not with the psychedelics because</v>
<v Speaker 11>schizophrenia were given lsd and the</v>

4346
03:51:58.391 --> 03:52:03.391
<v Speaker 11>schizophrenia reported that while the</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience experience was certainly</v>

4347
03:52:04.210 --> 03:52:08.800
<v Speaker 11>extraordinarily strange,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it wasn't like being schizophrenia and</v>

4348
03:52:08.801 --> 03:52:12.010
<v Speaker 11>then it was found later that if you gave</v>
<v Speaker 11>schizophrenia amphetamines,</v>

4349
03:52:12.280 --> 03:52:13.930
<v Speaker 11>that made them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>

4350
03:52:13.931 --> 03:52:18.931
<v Speaker 11>you can induce a paranoid psychosis in a</v>
<v Speaker 11>normal person by overdosing them with</v>

4351
03:52:19.841 --> 03:52:22.750
<v Speaker 11>amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so whatever the hallucinogens or</v>

4352
03:52:22.840 --> 03:52:26.980
<v Speaker 11>psychedelics are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's not the same thing as mania and</v>

4353
03:52:26.981 --> 03:52:28.630
<v Speaker 11>it's not the same thing as</v>
<v Speaker 11>schizophrenia,</v>

4354
03:52:29.230 --> 03:52:32.890
<v Speaker 11>not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so,</v>

4355
03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:43.950
<v Speaker 11>so you can't just write the experience</v>
<v Speaker 11>off as an induced psychosis,</v>

4356
03:52:45.700 --> 03:52:49.480
<v Speaker 11>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>independent of its utility or lack</v>

4357
03:52:49.481 --> 03:52:51.970
<v Speaker 11>thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's not that</v>

4358
03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:57.940
<v Speaker 11>now it can be induced by drugs can be</v>
<v Speaker 11>induced by deprivation,</v>

4359
03:52:57.941 --> 03:52:59.680
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean there are accounts throughout</v>

4360
03:52:59.681 --> 03:53:04.681
<v Speaker 11>history of people putting themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 11>extreme physiological situations in</v>

4361
03:53:05.321 --> 03:53:07.570
<v Speaker 11>order to induce transformations of</v>
<v Speaker 11>consciousness.</v>

4362
03:53:07.690 --> 03:53:10.210
<v Speaker 11>Fasting is one of the routes to doing</v>
<v Speaker 11>that.</v>

4363
03:53:10.600 --> 03:53:13.450
<v Speaker 11>Dancing is another root.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Isolation.</v>

4364
03:53:13.451 --> 03:53:15.670
<v Speaker 11>Prolonged periods of isolation will also</v>
<v Speaker 11>do it.</v>

4365
03:53:16.390 --> 03:53:21.390
<v Speaker 11>Now you could say that exposing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 11>to any of those in excess produces a</v>

4366
03:53:22.121 --> 03:53:27.121
<v Speaker 11>state that's in distinguishable from</v>
<v Speaker 11>illness and that there's no reason to</v>

4367
03:53:28.031 --> 03:53:33.031
<v Speaker 11>assume that the phenomena that are</v>
<v Speaker 11>associated with illness have any utility</v>

4368
03:53:33.251 --> 03:53:36.520
<v Speaker 11>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Although it's interesting to me that</v>

4369
03:53:39.700 --> 03:53:43.930
<v Speaker 11>a disrupted consciousness can produce</v>
<v Speaker 11>coherent experiences.</v>

4370
03:53:43.931 --> 03:53:46.150
<v Speaker 11>It's not exactly what you expected was</v>
<v Speaker 11>just an illness.</v>

4371
03:53:46.151 --> 03:53:47.110
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you develop,</v>

4372
03:53:47.111 --> 03:53:48.610
<v Speaker 11>say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a high fever,</v>

4373
03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:53.560
<v Speaker 11>your experience isn't transcendent and</v>
<v Speaker 11>coherent.</v>

4374
03:53:54.130 --> 03:53:58.660
<v Speaker 11>It's fragmented and pathologized and and</v>
<v Speaker 11>the difference I think is quite</v>

4375
03:53:58.661 --> 03:54:01.510
<v Speaker 11>distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 11>although we don't only have to only</v>

4376
03:54:01.511 --> 03:54:04.420
<v Speaker 11>speculate about that because there's</v>
<v Speaker 11>been enough experimental work done now</v>

4377
03:54:04.421 --> 03:54:09.421
<v Speaker 11>with with hallucinogens psychedelics to</v>
<v Speaker 11>indicate that the notion that what they</v>

4378
03:54:09.671 --> 03:54:14.671
<v Speaker 11>produce is something that's only akin to</v>
<v Speaker 11>pathology is wrong because it's not a</v>

4379
03:54:15.611 --> 03:54:20.200
<v Speaker 11>matter of opinion at this point in the</v>
<v Speaker 11>sequence of scientific and historical</v>

4380
03:54:20.201 --> 03:54:21.280
<v Speaker 11>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>In fact,</v>

4381
03:54:21.281 --> 03:54:24.370
<v Speaker 11>there was a large scale study done 10</v>
<v Speaker 11>years ago,</v>

4382
03:54:24.430 --> 03:54:28.510
<v Speaker 11>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of 200,000 people who had experimented</v>

4383
03:54:28.511 --> 03:54:32.560
<v Speaker 11>with psychedelics and they were mentally</v>
<v Speaker 11>and physically healthier than people who</v>

4384
03:54:32.561 --> 03:54:35.590
<v Speaker 11>hadn't on virtually every parameter.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They examined,</v>

4385
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:40.990
<v Speaker 11>in fact the rate of flashbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You've heard of LSD flashbacks,</v>

4386
03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:45.580
<v Speaker 11>that mostly a hypothetical phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but the rate of self reported flashbacks</v>

4387
03:54:45.581 --> 03:54:49.270
<v Speaker 11>was higher among the non psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 11>users that among the psychedelic users,</v>

4388
03:54:50.410 --> 03:54:52.480
<v Speaker 11>so that was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was a huge study.</v>

4389
03:54:52.481 --> 03:54:53.314
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it might be,</v>

4390
03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:57.220
<v Speaker 11>you could say that those who had</v>
<v Speaker 11>experimented with psychedelics were</v>

4391
03:54:57.221 --> 03:55:02.221
<v Speaker 11>prone to be healthier to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that still contradicts the pathology</v>

4392
03:55:02.920 --> 03:55:04.870
<v Speaker 11>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so it doesn't matter either way.</v>

4393
03:55:05.290 --> 03:55:08.650
<v Speaker 11>The pathology argument is contradicted</v>
<v Speaker 11>now.</v>

4394
03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:14.350
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I did put that in.</v>

4395
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:16.810
<v Speaker 11>It was Dr Jill,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Jill Bolte Taylor.</v>

4396
03:55:17.500 --> 03:55:21.490
<v Speaker 11>This is what she said about her stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I remember that first day of the stroke</v>

4397
03:55:21.491 --> 03:55:23.650
<v Speaker 11>with terrific,</v>
<v Speaker 11>bitter sweetness in the absence of the</v>

4398
03:55:23.651 --> 03:55:26.920
<v Speaker 11>normal functioning of my left</v>
<v Speaker 11>Orientation Association area.</v>

4399
03:55:27.160 --> 03:55:31.060
<v Speaker 11>My perception of my physical boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 11>was no longer limited to where my skin</v>

4400
03:55:31.061 --> 03:55:34.600
<v Speaker 11>met air.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I felt like a genie liberated from its</v>

4401
03:55:34.601 --> 03:55:36.310
<v Speaker 11>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's a good metaphor.</v>

4402
03:55:37.960 --> 03:55:41.320
<v Speaker 11>The energy of my spirits seemed to flow</v>
<v Speaker 11>like a great whale gliding through a sea</v>

4403
03:55:41.321 --> 03:55:44.740
<v Speaker 11>of silent euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The absence of physical boundary was one</v>

4404
03:55:44.741 --> 03:55:49.741
<v Speaker 11>of glorious bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Recently is Dr Roland Griffith.</v>

4405
03:55:55.830 --> 03:56:00.540
<v Speaker 11>I met him once at a conference in San</v>
<v Speaker 11>Francisco.</v>

4406
03:56:00.570 --> 03:56:01.500
<v Speaker 11>Surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 11>surprise,</v>

4407
03:56:03.250 --> 03:56:06.240
<v Speaker 11>a conference on awe,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and this was just when he was embarking</v>

4408
03:56:06.241 --> 03:56:10.110
<v Speaker 11>on his experiments with Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which were the first experiments on</v>

4409
03:56:10.111 --> 03:56:15.111
<v Speaker 11>hallucinogens that were permitted by the</v>
<v Speaker 11>National Institute of Mental Health in</v>

4410
03:56:15.211 --> 03:56:17.100
<v Speaker 11>some three,</v>
<v Speaker 11>four decades.</v>

4411
03:56:17.300 --> 03:56:20.430
<v Speaker 11>He,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he had to be very careful to lay out the</v>

4412
03:56:20.431 --> 03:56:24.750
<v Speaker 11>scientific protocols so that the ethics</v>
<v Speaker 11>committees would approve the experiments</v>

4413
03:56:24.751 --> 03:56:29.190
<v Speaker 11>and so that the federal funding agencies</v>
<v Speaker 11>would also allow the experiments to go</v>

4414
03:56:29.191 --> 03:56:33.030
<v Speaker 11>through.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He started to experiment with psilocybin</v>

4415
03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:39.140
<v Speaker 11>and he's found a number of published,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a number of very interesting results.</v>

4416
03:56:40.170 --> 03:56:45.170
<v Speaker 11>One was that a single siliciden trip and</v>
<v Speaker 11>I specified trip because sometimes when</v>

4417
03:56:50.461 --> 03:56:53.160
<v Speaker 11>people take psilocybin out,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the doses that griffith uses,</v>

4418
03:56:53.430 --> 03:56:55.500
<v Speaker 11>they don't have a psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience.</v>

4419
03:56:55.980 --> 03:56:58.620
<v Speaker 11>Most people who take the dose do but not</v>
<v Speaker 11>everyone.</v>

4420
03:56:59.190 --> 03:57:04.190
<v Speaker 11>Those who take the dos and don't have</v>
<v Speaker 11>the mystical experience don't experience</v>

4421
03:57:04.591 --> 03:57:09.150
<v Speaker 11>the consequences of taking the drug and</v>
<v Speaker 11>the consequences can be quite profound.</v>

4422
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:13.620
<v Speaker 11>So one consequence is that if you have</v>
<v Speaker 11>the mystical experience that's</v>

4423
03:57:13.621 --> 03:57:18.621
<v Speaker 11>associated with suicide and ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you're liable to represent that to</v>

4424
03:57:19.951 --> 03:57:23.120
<v Speaker 11>others and yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One of the two or three most important</v>

4425
03:57:23.121 --> 03:57:28.121
<v Speaker 11>experiences of your entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so that would be at the same level as</v>

4426
03:57:28.340 --> 03:57:30.440
<v Speaker 11>the birth of your child or your</v>
<v Speaker 11>marriage,</v>

4427
03:57:30.560 --> 03:57:33.770
<v Speaker 11>let's say assuming that those were</v>
<v Speaker 11>transcendent experiences,</v>

4428
03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:34.790
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that's.</v>

4429
03:57:36.440 --> 03:57:39.770
<v Speaker 11>But that's how people describe them.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So that's very interesting in and of</v>

4430
03:57:39.771 --> 03:57:40.604
<v Speaker 11>itself.</v>

4431
03:57:42.680 --> 03:57:46.640
<v Speaker 11>Then the next thing that griffith,</v>
<v Speaker 11>another thing that Griffith report,</v>

4432
03:57:46.641 --> 03:57:51.641
<v Speaker 11>it was that one year after a silicide</v>
<v Speaker 11>been dose a single psilocybin dose</v>

4433
03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:55.310
<v Speaker 11>profound enough to induce a mystical</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience.</v>

4434
03:57:55.790 --> 03:58:00.790
<v Speaker 11>That trait openness of the participants</v>
<v Speaker 11>had increased one standard deviation,</v>

4435
03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:04.850
<v Speaker 11>which is a tremendous amount,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and so it looked like one dose produced</v>

4436
03:58:04.851 --> 03:58:08.120
<v Speaker 11>a permanent neurological and</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychological transformation.</v>

4437
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:11.210
<v Speaker 11>Now I'm not saying that that's a good</v>
<v Speaker 11>thing.</v>

4438
03:58:11.820 --> 03:58:16.250
<v Speaker 11>I'm not saying that because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 11>think that openness is a n</v>

4439
03:58:17.810 --> 03:58:21.170
<v Speaker 11>troubled blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's certainly a testament to the</v>

4440
03:58:21.171 --> 03:58:24.110
<v Speaker 11>unbelievable potency of the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of the drugs.</v>

4441
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:27.440
<v Speaker 11>There's about a 10 percent chance,</v>
<v Speaker 11>by the way,</v>

4442
03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:30.230
<v Speaker 11>with suicide ingestion of a trip to</v>
<v Speaker 11>hell.</v>

4443
03:58:30.500 --> 03:58:34.400
<v Speaker 11>And so that's certainly something very</v>
<v Speaker 11>much worth considering when you're</v>

4444
03:58:34.580 --> 03:58:39.350
<v Speaker 11>thinking about the potential effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of this kind of experience.</v>

4445
03:58:43.310 --> 03:58:47.780
<v Speaker 11>So the mystical experience produced by</v>
<v Speaker 11>Psilocybin is rated by people as the</v>

4446
03:58:47.781 --> 03:58:49.850
<v Speaker 11>most profound,</v>
<v Speaker 11>among the most profound experience of</v>

4447
03:58:49.851 --> 03:58:52.730
<v Speaker 11>their life as life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It produces permanent personality</v>

4448
03:58:52.980 --> 03:58:56.060
<v Speaker 11>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 11>80 five percent success in smoking</v>

4449
03:58:56.061 --> 03:58:58.970
<v Speaker 11>cessation with a single dose,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

4450
03:58:58.971 --> 03:59:01.040
<v Speaker 11>That's another thing that griffiths</v>
<v Speaker 11>demonstrated.</v>

4451
03:59:01.041 --> 03:59:05.930
<v Speaker 11>Now that is mind boggling because there</v>
<v Speaker 11>are chemical treatments for smoking</v>

4452
03:59:05.931 --> 03:59:09.860
<v Speaker 11>cessation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Buproprion is one.</v>

4453
03:59:10.880 --> 03:59:15.880
<v Speaker 11>It reduces craving to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's success rate is nowhere near 85</v>

4454
03:59:17.961 --> 03:59:21.170
<v Speaker 11>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 11>certainly not with a single dose,</v>

4455
03:59:22.190 --> 03:59:26.660
<v Speaker 11>and so we don't understand how it can be</v>
<v Speaker 11>that that occurs,</v>

4456
03:59:26.960 --> 03:59:31.960
<v Speaker 11>but it's nicely documented by Griffith</v>
<v Speaker 11>team in this experiment he gave suicide,</v>

4457
03:59:34.301 --> 03:59:36.020
<v Speaker 11>been to people who are dying of cancer.</v>

4458
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:42.050
<v Speaker 11>Cancer patients often develop chronic</v>
<v Speaker 11>clinically significant symptoms of</v>

4459
03:59:42.051 --> 03:59:45.840
<v Speaker 11>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Previous study suggested Siliciden may</v>

4460
03:59:45.860 --> 03:59:48.410
<v Speaker 11>decrease depression and anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 11>cancer patients.</v>

4461
03:59:48.730 --> 03:59:51.410
<v Speaker 11>Aldous Huxley took Lsd on his death bed</v>
<v Speaker 11>by the way.</v>

4462
03:59:52.280 --> 03:59:57.280
<v Speaker 11>So the idea that there was something</v>
<v Speaker 11>about psychedelic substances that could</v>

4463
04:00:00.740 --> 04:00:05.740
<v Speaker 11>buffer people against the catastrophes</v>
<v Speaker 11>of mortality is an idea that's as old as</v>

4464
04:00:06.741 --> 04:00:11.540
<v Speaker 11>experimentation with the drug itself.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The effects of Psilocybin were studied</v>

4465
04:00:11.541 --> 04:00:15.680
<v Speaker 11>in 51 cancer patients with life</v>
<v Speaker 11>threatening diagnosis and symptoms of</v>

4466
04:00:15.681 --> 04:00:18.710
<v Speaker 11>depression and slash or anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Unsurprisingly,</v>

4467
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:27.330
<v Speaker 11>I don't really know if it's reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 11>to describe the emotional state of</v>

4468
04:00:27.331 --> 04:00:32.331
<v Speaker 11>people diagnosed with cancer of</v>
<v Speaker 11>uncertain prognosis or mortal</v>

4469
04:00:32.760 --> 04:00:35.820
<v Speaker 11>significance as depression.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Precisely.</v>

4470
04:00:36.350 --> 04:00:38.370
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know what I mean is that if you go</v>

4471
04:00:38.371 --> 04:00:42.360
<v Speaker 11>to the doctor and he tells you that you</v>
<v Speaker 11>have intractable fatal cancer,</v>

4472
04:00:42.960 --> 04:00:47.910
<v Speaker 11>the normative response is to be rather</v>
<v Speaker 11>upset and anxious about that and so it.</v>

4473
04:00:48.540 --> 04:00:51.750
<v Speaker 11>One of the things that bothers me about</v>
<v Speaker 11>clinical psychiatry and clinical</v>

4474
04:00:51.751 --> 04:00:55.380
<v Speaker 11>psychology is the automatic</v>
<v Speaker 11>presupposition that even overwhelming</v>

4475
04:00:55.381 --> 04:00:58.920
<v Speaker 11>states of negative emotion are properly</v>
<v Speaker 11>categorized as depression because I</v>

4476
04:00:58.921 --> 04:01:01.890
<v Speaker 11>don't think you're depressed when you</v>
<v Speaker 11>get a cancer diagnosis.</v>

4477
04:01:02.400 --> 04:01:04.140
<v Speaker 11>I don't think that's the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 11>think about it.</v>

4478
04:01:04.350 --> 04:01:07.950
<v Speaker 11>I think that you have a big problem and</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's not surprising that you're</v>

4479
04:01:07.951 --> 04:01:10.890
<v Speaker 11>overwhelmed by negative emotion and to</v>
<v Speaker 11>think about that as a psychiatric</v>

4480
04:01:10.891 --> 04:01:13.740
<v Speaker 11>malfunction is a major error,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but anyways,</v>

4481
04:01:14.820 --> 04:01:16.980
<v Speaker 11>it's a side issue.</v>
<v Speaker 11>With regards to this study.</v>

4482
04:01:19.530 --> 04:01:22.860
<v Speaker 11>The effects of Psilocybin were studied</v>
<v Speaker 11>in 51 cancer patients with life</v>

4483
04:01:22.861 --> 04:01:26.070
<v Speaker 11>threatening diagnosis and symptoms of</v>
<v Speaker 11>depression and slash or anxiety.</v>

4484
04:01:26.250 --> 04:01:28.980
<v Speaker 11>I cannot imagine how they got this</v>
<v Speaker 11>through an ethics committee.</v>

4485
04:01:29.220 --> 04:01:34.050
<v Speaker 11>It's just we're going to take people who</v>
<v Speaker 11>have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that</v>

4486
04:01:34.051 --> 04:01:36.930
<v Speaker 11>are potentially life threatening and</v>
<v Speaker 11>we're going to give them psychedelics.</v>

4487
04:01:37.230 --> 04:01:39.360
<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they did it.</v>

4488
04:01:39.390 --> 04:01:43.350
<v Speaker 11>They did it and I think it's a testament</v>
<v Speaker 11>to griffiths stature as a researcher</v>

4489
04:01:43.351 --> 04:01:48.330
<v Speaker 11>that that that was allowable.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This was a randomized double blind</v>

4490
04:01:48.331 --> 04:01:51.240
<v Speaker 11>crossover trial,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very carefully designed clinical</v>

4491
04:01:51.241 --> 04:01:54.660
<v Speaker 11>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>People were assigned to the treatment</v>

4492
04:01:54.661 --> 04:01:59.661
<v Speaker 11>group or the drug group or the non drug</v>
<v Speaker 11>group randomly blindly and investigated</v>

4493
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:04.470
<v Speaker 11>the effects of the drug also with</v>
<v Speaker 11>different doses,</v>

4494
04:02:04.471 --> 04:02:07.890
<v Speaker 11>which is another hallmark of a well</v>
<v Speaker 11>designed pharmacological study,</v>

4495
04:02:08.400 --> 04:02:12.840
<v Speaker 11>very low placebo like dos one or three</v>
<v Speaker 11>milligrams per 70 kilograms of body</v>

4496
04:02:12.841 --> 04:02:17.841
<v Speaker 11>weight versus a high dose 22 or 30</v>
<v Speaker 11>milligrams per 70 kilograms of of</v>

4497
04:02:18.330 --> 04:02:21.660
<v Speaker 11>psilocybin chemical suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but administered in counterbalance</v>

4498
04:02:21.661 --> 04:02:24.930
<v Speaker 11>sequence with five weeks between</v>
<v Speaker 11>sessions in a six month followup.</v>

4499
04:02:26.250 --> 04:02:31.250
<v Speaker 11>Instruction to participants and staff</v>
<v Speaker 11>minimized the effects of expectancy</v>

4500
04:02:31.470 --> 04:02:32.400
<v Speaker 11>participants,</v>
<v Speaker 11>staff,</v>

4501
04:02:32.401 --> 04:02:35.190
<v Speaker 11>and community observers.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Rated participant moods,</v>

4502
04:02:35.191 --> 04:02:36.930
<v Speaker 11>attitudes and behaviors throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 11>study,</v>

4503
04:02:37.140 --> 04:02:40.860
<v Speaker 11>and it's also the hallmark of a well</v>
<v Speaker 11>designed study because they didn't rely</v>

4504
04:02:40.861 --> 04:02:43.770
<v Speaker 11>on a single source of information for</v>
<v Speaker 11>the outcome data,</v>

4505
04:02:43.771 --> 04:02:45.010
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>They got self-reports,</v>

4506
04:02:45.090 --> 04:02:47.610
<v Speaker 11>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but they had relatively objective</v>

4507
04:02:47.611 --> 04:02:50.220
<v Speaker 11>observers also gather data at the same</v>
<v Speaker 11>time,</v>

4508
04:02:51.300 --> 04:02:55.650
<v Speaker 11>high dose psilocybin produced large</v>
<v Speaker 11>decreases in clinician and self related</v>

4509
04:02:55.651 --> 04:02:59.490
<v Speaker 11>measures of depressed mood and anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 11>along with increases in quality of life,</v>

4510
04:02:59.670 --> 04:03:02.880
<v Speaker 11>life meaning and optimism and decreases</v>
<v Speaker 11>in death,</v>

4511
04:03:02.881 --> 04:03:05.430
<v Speaker 11>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and that's an interesting.</v>

4512
04:03:05.760 --> 04:03:09.300
<v Speaker 11>It's a subtle and scientifically spar</v>
<v Speaker 11>statement,</v>

4513
04:03:09.301 --> 04:03:13.020
<v Speaker 11>but it's a very interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was the.</v>

4514
04:03:13.980 --> 04:03:16.290
<v Speaker 11>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's an intimation of a causal</v>

4515
04:03:16.291 --> 04:03:19.120
<v Speaker 11>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 11>increases in quality of life,</v>

4516
04:03:19.121 --> 04:03:22.030
<v Speaker 11>life meaning and decreases in death,</v>
<v Speaker 11>anxiety.</v>

4517
04:03:25.150 --> 04:03:28.420
<v Speaker 11>I mean the intimation there is that one</v>
<v Speaker 11>of the ways of decreasing your anxiety</v>

4518
04:03:28.421 --> 04:03:33.421
<v Speaker 11>about death is to increase the felt</v>
<v Speaker 11>meaning in your life and the psilocybin</v>

4519
04:03:34.270 --> 04:03:37.570
<v Speaker 11>dose just potentiate that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's a good thing to know in a</v>

4520
04:03:37.571 --> 04:03:40.420
<v Speaker 11>general manner if it happens to be a</v>
<v Speaker 11>generalizable truth,</v>

4521
04:03:40.421 --> 04:03:42.190
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>If you're terrified of mortality,</v>

4522
04:03:42.730 --> 04:03:47.110
<v Speaker 11>terrified of vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's always the possibility that the</v>

4523
04:03:47.111 --> 04:03:51.550
<v Speaker 11>life path that you're following isn't</v>
<v Speaker 11>rich enough to buffer you against the</v>

4524
04:03:52.210 --> 04:03:57.210
<v Speaker 11>negative element of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's a reasonable hypothesis and an</v>

4525
04:03:58.481 --> 04:04:01.270
<v Speaker 11>optimistic one.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think although a difficult one at six</v>

4526
04:04:01.271 --> 04:04:04.750
<v Speaker 11>month followup,</v>
<v Speaker 11>these changes were sustained with about</v>

4527
04:04:04.751 --> 04:04:08.500
<v Speaker 11>80 percent of participants continuing to</v>
<v Speaker 11>show clinically significant decreases in</v>

4528
04:04:08.501 --> 04:04:13.501
<v Speaker 11>depressed mood and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Stephen Ross commenting about this,</v>

4529
04:04:14.031 --> 04:04:16.880
<v Speaker 11>he was a co investigator,</v>
<v Speaker 11>said it is simply unprecedented in</v>

4530
04:04:16.881 --> 04:04:19.850
<v Speaker 11>psychiatry that a single dose of a</v>
<v Speaker 11>medicine produces these kinds of</v>

4531
04:04:19.880 --> 04:04:22.490
<v Speaker 11>dramatic and enduring results,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

4532
04:04:22.491 --> 04:04:27.080
<v Speaker 11>Which means we have no idea why this</v>
<v Speaker 11>happens.</v>

4533
04:04:29.780 --> 04:04:33.770
<v Speaker 11>Participants in attributed improvements</v>
<v Speaker 11>and attitudes about life slash self,</v>

4534
04:04:33.771 --> 04:04:34.760
<v Speaker 11>mood,</v>
<v Speaker 11>relationships,</v>

4535
04:04:35.060 --> 04:04:39.650
<v Speaker 11>and spirituality to the high dose</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience with more than 80 percent</v>

4536
04:04:39.651 --> 04:04:43.070
<v Speaker 11>endorsing moderately or greater,</v>
<v Speaker 11>increased wellbeing and life</v>

4537
04:04:43.071 --> 04:04:45.950
<v Speaker 11>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Community observers showed corresponding</v>

4538
04:04:45.951 --> 04:04:49.610
<v Speaker 11>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Mystical type Silas psilocybin</v>

4539
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:54.470
<v Speaker 11>experience on session day mediated the</v>
<v Speaker 11>effect of Psilocybin dose on therapeutic</v>

4540
04:04:54.471 --> 04:04:56.240
<v Speaker 11>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What that means is that,</v>

4541
04:04:56.990 --> 04:05:00.230
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when researchers were trying to look at</v>

4542
04:05:00.231 --> 04:05:03.320
<v Speaker 11>a causal relationship between drug</v>
<v Speaker 11>ingestion and the positive outcome,</v>

4543
04:05:04.640 --> 04:05:06.740
<v Speaker 11>the causal relationship was drug</v>
<v Speaker 11>ingestion,</v>

4544
04:05:06.741 --> 04:05:08.570
<v Speaker 11>mystical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 11>positive outcome.</v>

4545
04:05:08.720 --> 04:05:11.030
<v Speaker 11>It wasn't drug ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 11>positive outcome.</v>

4546
04:05:11.031 --> 04:05:15.680
<v Speaker 11>There had to be the experience produced</v>
<v Speaker 11>by the pharmaceutical agent in order for</v>

4547
04:05:15.681 --> 04:05:18.620
<v Speaker 11>the pharmaceutical agent to have had its</v>
<v Speaker 11>effect.</v>

4548
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:20.180
<v Speaker 11>Now we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Again,</v>

4549
04:05:20.181 --> 04:05:23.390
<v Speaker 11>we don't know why that is either.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Maybe some people needed a higher dose.</v>

4550
04:05:23.420 --> 04:05:26.900
<v Speaker 11>Who knows because people vary</v>
<v Speaker 11>tremendously in their sensitivity to</v>

4551
04:05:26.901 --> 04:05:29.000
<v Speaker 11>pharmaceutical substances.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>

4552
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:30.440
<v Speaker 11>why am I telling you all this?</v>

4553
04:05:30.680 --> 04:05:32.960
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm telling you for a variety of</v>

4554
04:05:32.961 --> 04:05:36.500
<v Speaker 11>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 11>One is the first is make no mistake</v>

4555
04:05:36.501 --> 04:05:41.030
<v Speaker 11>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Human beings have the capacity for forms</v>

4556
04:05:41.031 --> 04:05:44.330
<v Speaker 11>of consciousness that are radically</v>
<v Speaker 11>unlike our normative forms of</v>

4557
04:05:44.331 --> 04:05:49.331
<v Speaker 11>consciousness and the evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 11>those alternative forms of consciousness</v>

4558
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:53.990
<v Speaker 11>are purely pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is the simplest explanation,</v>

4559
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:55.510
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>You perturb the system,</v>

4560
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:59.570
<v Speaker 11>produces pathology that's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That is the simplest explanation.</v>

4561
04:05:59.780 --> 04:06:04.780
<v Speaker 11>The evidence for that is weak at best,</v>
<v Speaker 11>leaving out the bad trip issue,</v>

4562
04:06:05.151 --> 04:06:10.100
<v Speaker 11>which which is non trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The empirical evidence as it accrues in</v>

4563
04:06:10.101 --> 04:06:13.850
<v Speaker 11>fact seems to suggest that the</v>
<v Speaker 11>consequence of mystical,</v>

4564
04:06:13.880 --> 04:06:18.880
<v Speaker 11>positive mystical associated with</v>
<v Speaker 11>psychedelic intake is overwhelmingly</v>

4565
04:06:18.951 --> 04:06:21.260
<v Speaker 11>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Even in extreme situations and you</v>

4566
04:06:21.261 --> 04:06:25.850
<v Speaker 11>really can't find a more extreme</v>
<v Speaker 11>situation than uncertain cancer</v>

4567
04:06:25.851 --> 04:06:30.050
<v Speaker 11>diagnosis with concomitant time and</v>
<v Speaker 11>depression and anxiety.</v>

4568
04:06:30.051 --> 04:06:31.940
<v Speaker 11>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean that's not as bad as it gets,</v>

4569
04:06:31.941 --> 04:06:33.650
<v Speaker 11>but it gets kind of in the ballpark.</v>

4570
04:06:34.010 --> 04:06:36.890
<v Speaker 11>And so the fact that even under</v>
<v Speaker 11>circumstances like that,</v>

4571
04:06:37.280 --> 04:06:41.240
<v Speaker 11>there was the overwhelming probability</v>
<v Speaker 11>that the experience would be positive</v>

4572
04:06:41.241 --> 04:06:42.830
<v Speaker 11>because that's another thing you</v>
<v Speaker 11>wouldn't expect.</v>

4573
04:06:42.831 --> 04:06:45.530
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>even from some of the earlier earliest</v>

4574
04:06:45.531 --> 04:06:48.560
<v Speaker 11>discussions about psychedelic use that</v>
<v Speaker 11>were put forth by people,</v>

4575
04:06:49.040 --> 04:06:54.040
<v Speaker 11>including Timothy leary describing the</v>
<v Speaker 11>importance of sat right so that the</v>

4576
04:06:54.081 --> 04:06:59.081
<v Speaker 11>early experimenters noted that if you</v>
<v Speaker 11>had a psychedelic experience and you</v>

4577
04:06:59.451 --> 04:07:04.451
<v Speaker 11>were in a bad state or in a bad place,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that that was one of the precursors to a</v>

4578
04:07:04.491 --> 04:07:06.830
<v Speaker 11>bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That the negative emotion that you</v>

4579
04:07:06.831 --> 04:07:11.831
<v Speaker 11>entered the experience with could be</v>
<v Speaker 11>magnified tremendously by the,</v>

4580
04:07:12.230 --> 04:07:16.760
<v Speaker 11>by the chemical substances.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So that it was necessary to be somewhere</v>

4581
04:07:16.761 --> 04:07:19.880
<v Speaker 11>safe to be around people that you trust,</v>
<v Speaker 11>to be in a familiar environment,</v>

4582
04:07:20.000 --> 04:07:24.860
<v Speaker 11>to get all the variables that you could</v>
<v Speaker 11>control under control,</v>

4583
04:07:25.190 --> 04:07:28.580
<v Speaker 11>but here's the situation where that</v>
<v Speaker 11>isn't what's happening at all because</v>

4584
04:07:28.581 --> 04:07:33.581
<v Speaker 11>people have this cancer diagnosis of</v>
<v Speaker 11>cancer diagnosis of unspecified outcome,</v>

4585
04:07:33.681 --> 04:07:35.870
<v Speaker 11>and they still,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the vast majority of them had a positive</v>

4586
04:07:35.871 --> 04:07:40.550
<v Speaker 11>experience and the positive experience</v>
<v Speaker 11>experience had long lasting positive</v>

4587
04:07:40.551 --> 04:07:41.384
<v Speaker 11>consequences.</v>

4588
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:46.990
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so the case that the transcendent</v>

4589
04:07:47.451 --> 04:07:50.720
<v Speaker 11>experience is not real,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's wrong.</v>

4590
04:07:52.040 --> 04:07:54.500
<v Speaker 11>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Now we don't know what that means</v>

4591
04:07:55.160 --> 04:07:58.400
<v Speaker 11>because it actually challenges to some</v>
<v Speaker 11>degree our concepts of what constitutes</v>

4592
04:07:58.401 --> 04:08:01.610
<v Speaker 11>real,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it's certainly well within the realm</v>

4593
04:08:01.611 --> 04:08:05.360
<v Speaker 11>of normative human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So it's part of the human capacity.</v>

4594
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:07.250
<v Speaker 11>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there there's been other neurological</v>

4595
04:08:07.251 --> 04:08:08.240
<v Speaker 11>experiments to.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There's,</v>

4596
04:08:09.170 --> 04:08:10.910
<v Speaker 11>there's a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Canadian researcher,</v>

4597
04:08:10.911 --> 04:08:12.590
<v Speaker 11>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 11>who invented something.</v>

4598
04:08:12.591 --> 04:08:17.591
<v Speaker 11>He called the God helmet and it used</v>
<v Speaker 11>electromagnetic stimulation,</v>

4599
04:08:17.961 --> 04:08:21.500
<v Speaker 11>brain stimulation to induce mystical</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiences.</v>

4600
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:23.480
<v Speaker 11>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't remember what part of the brain</v>

4601
04:08:23.481 --> 04:08:26.300
<v Speaker 11>he was shutting off or activating with</v>
<v Speaker 11>that particular gadget,</v>

4602
04:08:26.720 --> 04:08:29.590
<v Speaker 11>but</v>
<v Speaker 11>and you know there's,</v>

4603
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:30.360
<v Speaker 11>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's,</v>

4604
04:08:30.360 --> 04:08:33.560
<v Speaker 11>there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's all sorts of other indications</v>

4605
04:08:33.561 --> 04:08:38.561
<v Speaker 11>of this sort of thing that have cropped</v>
<v Speaker 11>up in other domains of the neurological</v>

4606
04:08:39.321 --> 04:08:40.460
<v Speaker 11>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 11>For example.</v>

4607
04:08:41.180 --> 04:08:46.180
<v Speaker 11>It's very common for people who are</v>
<v Speaker 11>epileptic to have religious experiences</v>

4608
04:08:46.820 --> 04:08:49.820
<v Speaker 11>as part of the prodromal to the actual</v>
<v Speaker 11>seizure.</v>

4609
04:08:50.000 --> 04:08:52.130
<v Speaker 11>That was the case with Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for example,</v>

4610
04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:57.460
<v Speaker 11>who had incredibly intense religious</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiences that would culminate in</v>

4611
04:08:57.530 --> 04:09:01.970
<v Speaker 11>epileptic seizure and he said that they</v>
<v Speaker 11>were of sufficient quality that he would</v>

4612
04:09:01.971 --> 04:09:06.971
<v Speaker 11>give up his whole life to have had the.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And the funny thing too is that in my</v>

4613
04:09:07.101 --> 04:09:12.101
<v Speaker 11>reading of Dostoevsky at least is that I</v>
<v Speaker 11>think that epileptic seizures and the</v>

4614
04:09:12.231 --> 04:09:16.860
<v Speaker 11>associated mystical were part of what</v>
<v Speaker 11>made him a transcendently brilliant</v>

4615
04:09:16.861 --> 04:09:18.810
<v Speaker 11>author.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't think that he would have broken</v>

4616
04:09:18.811 --> 04:09:23.370
<v Speaker 11>through into the domains of insight that</v>
<v Speaker 11>he possessed without those strange</v>

4617
04:09:23.371 --> 04:09:26.910
<v Speaker 11>neurological experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it was certainly not the case that</v>

4618
04:09:26.911 --> 04:09:31.860
<v Speaker 11>his epilepsy or the experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 11>were associated with it produced.</v>

4619
04:09:31.920 --> 04:09:35.220
<v Speaker 11>What you might describe as an impairment</v>
<v Speaker 11>in his cognitive function is quite the</v>

4620
04:09:35.221 --> 04:09:37.470
<v Speaker 11>contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 11>At least that's how it looks to me.</v>

4621
04:09:41.660 --> 04:09:44.990
<v Speaker 1>This is a critical issue with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the harmonic transformation,</v>

4622
04:09:44.991 --> 04:09:46.850
<v Speaker 1>is that people go through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

4623
04:09:47.210 --> 04:09:50.510
<v Speaker 1>terrible experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often drug induced by the way,</v>

4624
04:09:50.511 --> 04:09:53.480
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the Sharman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually use psychedelic chemicals</v>

4625
04:09:53.481 --> 04:09:55.280
<v Speaker 1>of one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often mushrooms,</v>

4626
04:09:55.281 --> 04:10:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but what they've come up with some very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange concoctions like Iowasca down in</v>

4627
04:10:00.080 --> 04:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>

4628
04:10:02.991 --> 04:10:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of the bark of one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another plant whose name I don't</v>

4629
04:10:07.971 --> 04:10:12.110
<v Speaker 1>remember that hardly even grow in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same place and that has to be cooked</v>

4630
04:10:12.170 --> 04:10:17.170
<v Speaker 1>together in a special way and no one has</v>
<v Speaker 1>any idea how the damn Amazonians figured</v>

4631
04:10:17.571 --> 04:10:19.220
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks impossible.</v>

4632
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

4633
04:10:20.511 --> 04:10:22.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plants told us how to do it,</v>

4634
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>which was western people don't find very</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful,</v>

4635
04:10:25.251 --> 04:10:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but the shamans are perfectly healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with that description.</v>

4636
04:10:29.270 --> 04:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And IOWASCA takes them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does that in part because it</v>

4637
04:10:33.080 --> 04:10:36.500
<v Speaker 1>affects the serotonergic system very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerfully,</v>

4638
04:10:36.501 --> 04:10:41.501
<v Speaker 1>like all psychedelics do and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>transports them to another world and</v>

4639
04:10:41.751 --> 04:10:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that's how they interpreted and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4640
04:10:44.240 --> 04:10:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we know about psychedelics,</v>

4641
04:10:47.601 --> 04:10:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you could put in a thimble and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw the thimble away.</v>

4642
04:10:50.240 --> 04:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>We know nothing about psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's new experiments going on at</v>

4643
04:10:54.651 --> 04:10:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4644
04:10:56.450 --> 04:10:59.810
<v Speaker 1>with silicide button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of this active chemical in</v>

4645
04:10:59.811 --> 04:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>magic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same structure basically as LSD and</v>

4646
04:11:02.931 --> 04:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>masculine and all the real psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 1>have basically the same structure except</v>

4647
04:11:07.280 --> 04:11:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the one that's derived from am Anita</v>
<v Speaker 1>must scarier,</v>

4648
04:11:09.530 --> 04:11:11.560
<v Speaker 1>which is called muscular acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

4649
04:11:11.680 --> 04:11:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it's its own weird thing that no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows anything about.</v>

4650
04:11:15.110 --> 04:11:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have profound neurochemical effects</v>

4651
04:11:17.361 --> 04:11:22.361
<v Speaker 1>in very small doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the research group at Johns</v>

4652
04:11:22.400 --> 04:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins has given Psilocybin to research</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects,</v>

4653
04:11:25.100 --> 04:11:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purified psilocybin because they started</v>

4654
04:11:27.561 --> 04:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>the new experimentation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics in that's been banned for</v>

4655
04:11:31.101 --> 04:11:35.270
<v Speaker 1>like 40 years because psychedelics were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so terrifying to our culture that we</v>

4656
04:11:35.271 --> 04:11:36.170
<v Speaker 1>just put them away.</v>

4657
04:11:36.170 --> 04:11:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

4658
04:11:37.341 --> 04:11:41.210
<v Speaker 1>we're not going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even from a research perspective,</v>

4659
04:11:41.211 --> 04:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>and even though some of the psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 1>look very promising for the treatment of</v>

4660
04:11:44.991 --> 04:11:48.650
<v Speaker 1>disorders like alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they recently used silicide going to</v>

4661
04:11:48.651 --> 04:11:51.950
<v Speaker 1>help people stop smoking down at Johns</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins and I think they had an 80</v>

4662
04:11:51.951 --> 04:11:54.560
<v Speaker 1>percent success rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like,</v>

4663
04:11:54.680 --> 04:11:57.080
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely mind boggling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

4664
04:11:57.470 --> 04:12:00.890
<v Speaker 1>But if you give people psilocybin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a mystical experience,</v>

4665
04:12:01.040 --> 04:12:04.340
<v Speaker 1>which is very common among people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>take these sorts of chemicals,</v>

4666
04:12:04.700 --> 04:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>then their personality transforms</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently such that one year later</v>

4667
04:12:09.951 --> 04:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they're one standard higher in openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and openness is the creativity</v>

4668
04:12:14.741 --> 04:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a permanent</v>

4669
04:12:16.991 --> 04:12:19.290
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really remarkable.</v>

4670
04:12:19.291 --> 04:12:24.291
<v Speaker 1>And about 80 percent of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments</v>

4671
04:12:24.611 --> 04:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>report that the experience is like one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two or three most important</v>

4672
04:12:28.121 --> 04:12:28.954
<v Speaker 1>things they've ever.</v>

4673
04:12:29.360 --> 04:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That's never ever happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

4674
04:12:32.560 --> 04:12:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>

4675
04:12:34.271 --> 04:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

4676
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this guy named Rick</v>
<v Speaker 1>strassman down at,</v>

4677
04:12:38.380 --> 04:12:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he was at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and he did experimentation with</v>

4678
04:12:41.831 --> 04:12:43.780
<v Speaker 1>DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dmt,</v>

4679
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

4680
04:12:47.260 --> 04:12:51.450
<v Speaker 1>is the active ingredient in Iowasca and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce it in your brain and it's in</v>

4681
04:12:51.451 --> 04:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common chemical.</v>

4682
04:12:53.770 --> 04:12:58.770
<v Speaker 1>But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an extraordinary short mechanism</v>

4683
04:12:59.201 --> 04:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4684
04:13:00.380 --> 04:13:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and people who take it report that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blasted out of their body,</v>

4685
04:13:05.140 --> 04:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>like out of a cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go out somewhere and</v>

4686
04:13:08.651 --> 04:13:13.651
<v Speaker 1>encounter beings of various sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then 10 minutes later they're back</v>

4687
04:13:14.201 --> 04:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>and virtually everyone reports that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really strange.</v>

4688
04:13:17.291 --> 04:13:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so straussman was giving people dmt</v>

4689
04:13:21.341 --> 04:13:23.950
<v Speaker 1>intravenously so that the trip would</v>
<v Speaker 1>last longer.</v>

4690
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>He get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was all,</v>

4691
04:13:25.060 --> 04:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4692
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:27.490
<v Speaker 1>nih funded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4693
04:13:27.580 --> 04:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>experimentation all cleared with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant ethics boards all conducted</v>

4694
04:13:31.031 --> 04:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>within the last 10 years.</v>

4695
04:13:32.800 --> 04:13:36.420
<v Speaker 1>He basically quit doing it because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a pretty straight scientists,</v>

4696
04:13:36.421 --> 04:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was measuring heart rate and pulse</v>

4697
04:13:38.501 --> 04:13:41.370
<v Speaker 1>and all that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to look at the physiology and</v>

4698
04:13:41.371 --> 04:13:45.520
<v Speaker 1>then the people he was giving these</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals to kept coming back and</v>

4699
04:13:45.521 --> 04:13:48.160
<v Speaker 1>telling him these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy stories.</v>

4700
04:13:49.060 --> 04:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I just,</v>

4701
04:13:51.960 --> 04:13:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it was too much for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4702
04:13:53.291 --> 04:13:54.520
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4703
04:13:54.760 --> 04:13:56.470
<v Speaker 1>because they all said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say,</v>

4704
04:13:56.471 --> 04:13:57.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a dream.</v>

4705
04:13:57.371 --> 04:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the most real thing that ever</v>

4706
04:13:59.471 --> 04:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say,</v>

4707
04:14:00.311 --> 04:14:00.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4708
04:14:00.791 --> 04:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetypal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>

4709
04:14:03.220 --> 04:14:04.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4710
04:14:04.211 --> 04:14:05.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was no archetipal experience.</v>

4711
04:14:05.861 --> 04:14:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I went somewhere else and I saw things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm back and I don't care what you</v>

4712
04:14:09.671 --> 04:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>think and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows,</v>

4713
04:14:11.741 --> 04:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all subjective.</v>

4714
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the weird thing about it is that</v>

4715
04:14:15.671 --> 04:14:19.540
<v Speaker 1>everyone's reporting the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you account for that?</v>

4716
04:14:19.720 --> 04:14:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4717
04:14:20.981 --> 04:14:23.170
<v Speaker 1>when they take these psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>

4718
04:14:23.171 --> 04:14:25.030
<v Speaker 1>they basically say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

4719
04:14:25.031 --> 04:14:27.910
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it more or less killed me.</v>

4720
04:14:29.100 --> 04:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4721
04:14:31.760 --> 04:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I dissolved to skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I climbed a tree that Unites</v>

4722
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Heaven and earth and I went into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of the gods and they gave me some</v>

4723
04:14:39.461 --> 04:14:41.620
<v Speaker 1>information and I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4724
04:14:42.010 --> 04:14:42.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4725
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know what to make of</v>

4726
04:14:44.771 --> 04:14:46.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly,</v>

4727
04:14:46.571 --> 04:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what len describes when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>describes the shamanic is traumatic</v>

4728
04:14:50.170 --> 04:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>procession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the shamanic initiation and you</v>

4729
04:14:53.620 --> 04:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dissolution to a skeleton first</v>

4730
04:14:55.961 --> 04:14:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and then like a death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic death or experienced as an</v>

4731
04:14:59.321 --> 04:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>actual death and then bang up into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of the gods and then they come</v>

4732
04:15:03.461 --> 04:15:04.294
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

4733
04:15:05.270 --> 04:15:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a medieval representation.</v>

4734
04:15:09.080 --> 04:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>The tunnel that people travel through at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of their life to,</v>

4735
04:15:12.560 --> 04:15:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find the light,</v>

4736
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>which is a very common near death</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience report.</v>

4737
04:15:16.460 --> 04:15:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And people don't have any idea what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell to do with those reports except</v>

4738
04:15:20.270 --> 04:15:20.721
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4739
04:15:20.721 --> 04:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot</v>

4740
04:15:25.041 --> 04:15:28.970
<v Speaker 1>more random in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is there's a rebirth after</v>

4741
04:15:28.971 --> 04:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

4742
04:15:31.040 --> 04:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Scandinavian representation</v>

4743
04:15:34.011 --> 04:15:36.470
<v Speaker 1>of that tree that unites Earth with</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>

4744
04:15:36.860 --> 04:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

4745
04:15:39.171 --> 04:15:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It has a snake snakes down here eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4746
04:15:41.980 --> 04:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the Amazonian</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

4747
04:15:45.960 --> 04:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you account for that?</v>

4748
04:15:48.500 --> 04:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>We know those pictures are so similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just,</v>

4749
04:15:52.060 --> 04:15:55.040
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4750
04:15:55.041 --> 04:15:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in trees for a long time,</v>

4751
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:59.000
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

4752
04:15:59.001 --> 04:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

4753
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:04.010
<v Speaker 1>millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were lots of snakes around</v>

4754
04:16:04.011 --> 04:16:04.520
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

4755
04:16:04.520 --> 04:16:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that reality is a tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's surrounded by a snake that's in</v>

4756
04:16:09.101 --> 04:16:09.651
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4757
04:16:09.651 --> 04:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>it's down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deep.</v>

4758
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about it that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

4759
04:16:14.340 --> 04:16:16.700
<v Speaker 1>not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we normally think of truth,</v>

4760
04:16:16.701 --> 04:16:19.310
<v Speaker 1>but truth true in an entirely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

4761
04:16:20.120 --> 04:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>So and all that's pretty damn strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll stop with this.</v>

4762
04:16:24.171 --> 04:16:26.360
<v Speaker 1>My son drew this when he was seven years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

4763
04:16:26.690 --> 04:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Blew me away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4764
04:16:28.071 --> 04:16:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had it laminated.</v>

4765
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And so here is what it is on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side,</v>

4766
04:16:33.561 --> 04:16:36.350
<v Speaker 1>that's the order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Yin Yang thing that's</v>

4767
04:16:36.351 --> 04:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>order left side chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4768
04:16:39.080 --> 04:16:41.690
<v Speaker 1>And those are all mushroom houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was amazing.</v>

4769
04:16:42.440 --> 04:16:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this river that runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>right down the middle,</v>

4770
04:16:46.131 --> 04:16:50.690
<v Speaker 1>like the line for order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this tree that goes up</v>

4771
04:16:50.691 --> 04:16:52.430
<v Speaker 1>to heaven and that's having up there.</v>

4772
04:16:52.430 --> 04:16:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like their St Peter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the pearly gates,</v>

4773
04:16:54.801 --> 04:16:58.520
<v Speaker 1>there's the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he never went to church,</v>

4774
04:16:58.521 --> 04:17:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what the hell?</v>

4775
04:17:00.621 --> 04:17:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a little bug there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes up and down from heaven to earth.</v>

4776
04:17:05.360 --> 04:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>And that was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought he had a very organized</v>

4777
04:17:09.350 --> 04:17:10.280
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kid.</v>

4778
04:17:10.281 --> 04:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>He was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stable kid.</v>

4779
04:17:11.751 --> 04:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And still listen who drew that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

4780
04:17:14.690 --> 04:17:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just bloody well unbelievable.</v>

4781
04:17:17.840 --> 04:17:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And I still think that when I look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4782
04:17:19.851 --> 04:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great example of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>

4783
04:17:23.060 --> 04:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll see you Tuesday.</v>

4784
04:17:28.420 --> 04:17:30.380
<v Speaker 19>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I'm going to read something wrote</v>

4785
04:17:32.170 --> 04:17:37.170
<v Speaker 19>in the first part beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 19>which is a section called the prejudices</v>

4786
04:17:37.951 --> 04:17:42.951
<v Speaker 19>of philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And it's a really good example of the</v>

4787
04:17:43.231 --> 04:17:48.231
<v Speaker 19>density of this book.</v>
<v Speaker 19>One of the ways of conceptualizing</v>

4788
04:17:48.331 --> 04:17:50.960
<v Speaker 19>beyond good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And I think this is true for most great</v>

4789
04:17:50.970 --> 04:17:54.900
<v Speaker 19>works of</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's true most works is that</v>

4790
04:17:58.270 --> 04:17:59.103
<v Speaker 6>the</v>

4791
04:18:00.260 --> 04:18:05.260
<v Speaker 19>author of the work</v>
<v Speaker 19>collects unconsciously collect patterns</v>

4792
04:18:08.280 --> 04:18:13.280
<v Speaker 19>from his or her interaction with the</v>
<v Speaker 19>world and then gives them initial</v>

4793
04:18:14.371 --> 04:18:15.270
<v Speaker 19>formulation</v>

4794
04:18:18.480 --> 04:18:23.480
<v Speaker 19>and the patterns can be deep and</v>
<v Speaker 19>multilevel and the initial formulation</v>

4795
04:18:26.281 --> 04:18:31.281
<v Speaker 19>translates them into not so much ideas</v>
<v Speaker 19>as into the seeds of future ideas and</v>

4796
04:18:33.540 --> 04:18:38.540
<v Speaker 19>the more poetically arthur happens to be</v>
<v Speaker 19>the more the case that his or her</v>

4797
04:18:40.320 --> 04:18:45.320
<v Speaker 19>ratings contained within it.</v>
<v Speaker 19>The seeds of future ideas and where the</v>

4798
04:18:45.631 --> 04:18:48.720
<v Speaker 19>romantic philosophers are.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Authors and I think Nietzsche and</v>

4799
04:18:48.721 --> 04:18:53.721
<v Speaker 19>Dostoevsky or or in some sense foremost</v>
<v Speaker 19>among them are particularly notable.</v>

4800
04:18:54.560 --> 04:18:59.560
<v Speaker 19>Further ability to do exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Now in this particular paragraph,</v>

4801
04:19:01.050 --> 04:19:04.050
<v Speaker 19>just particular paragraph not only</v>
<v Speaker 19>serves as an example of that,</v>

4802
04:19:05.070 --> 04:19:10.070
<v Speaker 19>but it also serves as a self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 19>reflection on that because Nietzsche is</v>

4803
04:19:10.171 --> 04:19:15.171
<v Speaker 19>writing a paragraph here that is full of</v>
<v Speaker 19>the seeds of ideas that will actually</v>

4804
04:19:17.430 --> 04:19:20.460
<v Speaker 19>bloom flower to a great degree in the</v>
<v Speaker 19>20th century.</v>

4805
04:19:21.450 --> 04:19:23.810
<v Speaker 19>But while he's simultaneously revealing</v>
<v Speaker 19>these,</v>

4806
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:26.220
<v Speaker 19>those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 19>he's also telling you exactly how he's</v>

4807
04:19:26.221 --> 04:19:28.350
<v Speaker 19>doing it and how it is that philosophers</v>
<v Speaker 19>do it.</v>

4808
04:19:28.770 --> 04:19:31.860
<v Speaker 19>So it source.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It's a spectacular accomplishment.</v>

4809
04:19:33.090 --> 04:19:37.530
<v Speaker 19>I'm going to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 19>probably phrase by phrase and then take</v>

4810
04:19:37.531 --> 04:19:40.710
<v Speaker 19>it apart because it's so dance and</v>
<v Speaker 19>beyond good and evil is like that.</v>

4811
04:19:40.740 --> 04:19:41.760
<v Speaker 19>It's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You,</v>

4812
04:19:41.761 --> 04:19:43.470
<v Speaker 19>when Nisha was writing beyond good and</v>
<v Speaker 19>evil,</v>

4813
04:19:44.070 --> 04:19:48.270
<v Speaker 19>he wasn't very well.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And because of that he had to spend a</v>

4814
04:19:48.271 --> 04:19:50.790
<v Speaker 19>lot of time thinking and not very much</v>
<v Speaker 19>time writing.</v>

4815
04:19:50.791 --> 04:19:54.300
<v Speaker 19>And because he was also brilliant beyond</v>
<v Speaker 19>comprehension,</v>

4816
04:19:54.810 --> 04:19:59.810
<v Speaker 19>his ability to distill what he was</v>
<v Speaker 19>thinking into incredibly rich phrases</v>

4817
04:20:02.310 --> 04:20:04.680
<v Speaker 19>this.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And I think at some sense it's beyond</v>

4818
04:20:04.681 --> 04:20:08.910
<v Speaker 19>parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Mean often if I'm reading a book,</v>

4819
04:20:09.690 --> 04:20:14.690
<v Speaker 19>if it has any utility at all market,</v>
<v Speaker 19>usually I fold over the top of the page</v>

4820
04:20:14.821 --> 04:20:17.070
<v Speaker 19>or sometimes put a yellow sticky note I</v>
<v Speaker 19>want to do.</v>

4821
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:20.630
<v Speaker 19>If I find a place where there's an idea</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's worth returning to,</v>

4822
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:22.210
<v Speaker 19>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 19>um,</v>

4823
04:20:23.540 --> 04:20:27.690
<v Speaker 19>that's particularly worth understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And you can't do that with a book like</v>

4824
04:20:27.691 --> 04:20:30.810
<v Speaker 19>beyond good and evil because what ends</v>
<v Speaker 19>up happening is you have to mark every</v>

4825
04:20:30.811 --> 04:20:34.680
<v Speaker 19>sentence and obviously marketing every</v>
<v Speaker 19>sentence isn't any better than not</v>

4826
04:20:34.681 --> 04:20:37.590
<v Speaker 19>marking any sentences at all.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So</v>

4827
04:20:47.850 --> 04:20:51.780
<v Speaker 19>I guess I also might as well tell you</v>
<v Speaker 19>why it is worth bothering with a book</v>

4828
04:20:51.781 --> 04:20:56.781
<v Speaker 19>like this at all because it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 19>difficult book and it's also the sort of</v>

4829
04:20:56.821 --> 04:21:01.821
<v Speaker 19>book that will rattle you up,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so need you is is very interested in the</v>

4830
04:21:01.831 --> 04:21:06.831
<v Speaker 19>problem of my value and the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 19>value is not the problem of what is the</v>

4831
04:21:09.671 --> 04:21:12.730
<v Speaker 19>world made out or even how does the</v>
<v Speaker 19>world function,</v>

4832
04:21:12.731 --> 04:21:17.620
<v Speaker 19>which are more in some sense more</v>
<v Speaker 19>specifically scientific questions,</v>

4833
04:21:17.621 --> 04:21:21.010
<v Speaker 19>but how is it that you should conduct</v>
<v Speaker 19>yourself in the world?</v>

4834
04:21:21.430 --> 04:21:26.430
<v Speaker 19>How should you act?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And people act towards aims in a sense.</v>

4835
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:31.060
<v Speaker 19>Because we're active creatures and we're</v>
<v Speaker 19>moving from one point to another.</v>

4836
04:21:31.660 --> 04:21:36.660
<v Speaker 19>We're moving towards things that we want</v>
<v Speaker 19>and that means that we're guided by our</v>

4837
04:21:37.541 --> 04:21:42.541
<v Speaker 19>desires and we're not only guided by</v>
<v Speaker 19>desires in so far as we have individual</v>

4838
04:21:42.671 --> 04:21:47.671
<v Speaker 19>desires were guided by the structure</v>
<v Speaker 19>that consists of how those desires are</v>

4839
04:21:50.711 --> 04:21:51.790
<v Speaker 19>related to one another.</v>

4840
04:21:52.540 --> 04:21:55.330
<v Speaker 19>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 19>if you have a room full of people,</v>

4841
04:21:56.800 --> 04:22:01.800
<v Speaker 19>say a room full of children,</v>
<v Speaker 19>they're active and they're each pursuing</v>

4842
04:22:02.471 --> 04:22:05.710
<v Speaker 19>their individual desires,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but at some point they may choose to</v>

4843
04:22:05.711 --> 04:22:10.510
<v Speaker 19>organize themselves into a game and if</v>
<v Speaker 19>they organize themselves into a game,</v>

4844
04:22:10.660 --> 04:22:13.360
<v Speaker 19>what they're doing for all intents and</v>
<v Speaker 19>purposes,</v>

4845
04:22:13.361 --> 04:22:17.710
<v Speaker 19>is producing a little society,</v>
<v Speaker 19>little micro society within that micro</v>

4846
04:22:17.711 --> 04:22:21.220
<v Speaker 19>society.</v>
<v Speaker 19>They're deciding what desires will be</v>

4847
04:22:21.221 --> 04:22:24.850
<v Speaker 19>currently expressed and how they'll</v>
<v Speaker 19>exist in relationship to one another,</v>

4848
04:22:24.851 --> 04:22:29.851
<v Speaker 19>and that means that they can cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 19>without too much conflict and that they</v>

4849
04:22:30.581 --> 04:22:35.581
<v Speaker 19>can jointly moved towards a joint ame</v>
<v Speaker 19>without</v>

4850
04:22:39.520 --> 04:22:42.670
<v Speaker 19>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and gather all the benefits that might</v>

4851
04:22:42.671 --> 04:22:45.850
<v Speaker 19>be associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And that might be the accomplishment of</v>

4852
04:22:45.851 --> 04:22:46.840
<v Speaker 19>the Ame,</v>
<v Speaker 19>whatever it is,</v>

4853
04:22:46.841 --> 04:22:50.560
<v Speaker 19>but it also might be just the enjoyment</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's to be had in the pursuit of that</v>

4854
04:22:50.561 --> 04:22:53.650
<v Speaker 19>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Now people do that</v>

4855
04:22:57.280 --> 04:23:00.850
<v Speaker 19>socially because we have to do that in</v>
<v Speaker 19>order to get along with other people</v>

4856
04:23:00.851 --> 04:23:03.880
<v Speaker 19>because our desires have to be melded</v>
<v Speaker 19>with those of other people,</v>

4857
04:23:04.180 --> 04:23:09.180
<v Speaker 19>but we also do it psychologically and</v>
<v Speaker 19>those two things exist in a dance</v>

4858
04:23:09.221 --> 04:23:12.070
<v Speaker 19>because as I'm interacting with other</v>
<v Speaker 19>people,</v>

4859
04:23:14.610 --> 04:23:19.610
<v Speaker 19>the demands of the fact that we're</v>
<v Speaker 19>interacting make require each of us to</v>

4860
04:23:20.970 --> 04:23:24.660
<v Speaker 19>arrange our desires in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 19>acceptable to everyone else,</v>

4861
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:27.420
<v Speaker 19>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 19>while we're doing that,</v>

4862
04:23:27.450 --> 04:23:32.220
<v Speaker 19>we're also observing the process by</v>
<v Speaker 19>which those desires are ordered and then</v>

4863
04:23:32.221 --> 04:23:35.730
<v Speaker 19>we internalize that process and use that</v>
<v Speaker 19>to order our own desires.</v>

4864
04:23:36.000 --> 04:23:41.000
<v Speaker 19>And so there's a constant</v>
<v Speaker 19>mutually informative dance between the</v>

4865
04:23:41.581 --> 04:23:45.420
<v Speaker 19>individual and the group and the</v>
<v Speaker 19>culmination of that is the organization</v>

4866
04:23:45.421 --> 04:23:50.421
<v Speaker 19>of society and the simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 19>organization of the psyche and it's that</v>

4867
04:23:50.581 --> 04:23:55.260
<v Speaker 19>process that Nietzsche is talking about</v>
<v Speaker 19>in these paragraphs.</v>

4868
04:23:55.740 --> 04:23:58.620
<v Speaker 19>Now you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

4869
04:23:58.621 --> 04:24:03.621
<v Speaker 19>what's the utility of articulating such</v>
<v Speaker 19>things and them and understanding them,</v>

4870
04:24:04.821 --> 04:24:09.350
<v Speaker 19>and the answer in some ways is</v>
<v Speaker 19>straightforward.</v>

4871
04:24:11.700 --> 04:24:14.490
<v Speaker 19>If you don't want to run a foul of your</v>
<v Speaker 19>own desires,</v>

4872
04:24:14.491 --> 04:24:18.960
<v Speaker 19>you have to organize them.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Because some of them are short term and</v>

4873
04:24:18.961 --> 04:24:22.980
<v Speaker 19>some of them are medium term and some of</v>
<v Speaker 19>them are long term and some of the main</v>

4874
04:24:23.190 --> 04:24:26.580
<v Speaker 19>this and some of the main that,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and it isn't necessarily the case that</v>

4875
04:24:26.581 --> 04:24:30.780
<v Speaker 19>those desires allow for mutual</v>
<v Speaker 19>fulfillment.</v>

4876
04:24:30.781 --> 04:24:33.810
<v Speaker 19>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 19>maybe you're very interested in pursuing</v>

4877
04:24:33.811 --> 04:24:37.620
<v Speaker 19>a sexual relationship with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but you're also very interested in</v>

4878
04:24:37.621 --> 04:24:41.820
<v Speaker 19>having a family and some stability in</v>
<v Speaker 19>your life or maybe you're interested in</v>

4879
04:24:41.821 --> 04:24:45.540
<v Speaker 19>pursuing a sexual relationship with a</v>
<v Speaker 19>whole sequence of people,</v>

4880
04:24:45.541 --> 04:24:48.750
<v Speaker 19>but you're also interested in having a</v>
<v Speaker 19>family of stabilizing your life.</v>

4881
04:24:48.780 --> 04:24:53.780
<v Speaker 19>It's not obvious that those desires can</v>
<v Speaker 19>exist in the same universe without</v>

4882
04:24:54.751 --> 04:24:59.220
<v Speaker 19>producing what you might think about as</v>
<v Speaker 19>a war and some of that might be a</v>

4883
04:24:59.221 --> 04:25:02.520
<v Speaker 19>psychological war,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but some of it's also going to be a war</v>

4884
04:25:02.850 --> 04:25:07.050
<v Speaker 19>that actually occurs in existence.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>

4885
04:25:07.051 --> 04:25:10.350
<v Speaker 19>you're fighting through the</v>
<v Speaker 19>contradictory consequences of wanting to</v>

4886
04:25:10.351 --> 04:25:14.070
<v Speaker 19>pursue many people and formulate a</v>
<v Speaker 19>stable relationship with one person.</v>

4887
04:25:17.780 --> 04:25:18.980
<v Speaker 19>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 19>part of the reason that you want to</v>

4888
04:25:18.981 --> 04:25:23.150
<v Speaker 19>think about these sorts of things is</v>
<v Speaker 19>because if you think about them and get</v>

4889
04:25:23.151 --> 04:25:28.151
<v Speaker 19>your thoughts and your value system</v>
<v Speaker 19>intelligently and coherently cogently</v>

4890
04:25:32.121 --> 04:25:36.620
<v Speaker 19>laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 19>then when you act out that value system</v>

4891
04:25:36.621 --> 04:25:39.380
<v Speaker 19>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you're going to run into less conflict</v>

4892
04:25:39.381 --> 04:25:42.650
<v Speaker 19>and less uncertainty and less misery and</v>
<v Speaker 19>you're going to have a higher</v>

4893
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:45.680
<v Speaker 19>probability of getting what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 19>you want,</v>

4894
04:25:46.400 --> 04:25:49.970
<v Speaker 19>but you're also going to have a higher</v>
<v Speaker 19>probability of getting what you want in</v>

4895
04:25:49.971 --> 04:25:54.971
<v Speaker 19>a way that allows you to cooperate with</v>
<v Speaker 19>other people without entering into too</v>

4896
04:25:55.161 --> 04:26:00.050
<v Speaker 19>much conflict with them.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so in some sense the purpose that</v>

4897
04:26:00.051 --> 04:26:02.120
<v Speaker 19>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the reason that you think are the</v>

4898
04:26:02.121 --> 04:26:07.121
<v Speaker 19>purpose of thinking is so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 19>sort out how you're going to move</v>

4899
04:26:08.001 --> 04:26:13.001
<v Speaker 19>forward in the world without having to</v>
<v Speaker 19>directly run headlong into all the</v>

4900
04:26:14.481 --> 04:26:15.980
<v Speaker 19>obstacles that you might run into.</v>

4901
04:26:15.980 --> 04:26:19.430
<v Speaker 19>If you were doing such a thing blindly.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

4902
04:26:19.431 --> 04:26:23.030
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>why would you bother reading philosophy</v>

4903
04:26:23.031 --> 04:26:25.940
<v Speaker 19>or the philosophy written by someone</v>
<v Speaker 19>who's great?</v>

4904
04:26:25.941 --> 04:26:29.390
<v Speaker 19>And the answer to that is this.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That they can help you think these</v>

4905
04:26:29.391 --> 04:26:34.391
<v Speaker 19>things through in a manner that you</v>
<v Speaker 19>would not be capable of doing on your</v>

4906
04:26:34.791 --> 04:26:35.810
<v Speaker 19>own.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>

4907
04:26:35.811 --> 04:26:38.480
<v Speaker 19>because Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I mean it's,</v>

4908
04:26:38.540 --> 04:26:41.570
<v Speaker 19>it's difficult to estimate how</v>
<v Speaker 19>intelligent Nietzsche it was,</v>

4909
04:26:41.571 --> 04:26:45.590
<v Speaker 19>but I suspect he was perhaps one in a</v>
<v Speaker 19>billion,</v>

4910
04:26:46.310 --> 04:26:51.310
<v Speaker 19>which would put him far beyond the 99</v>
<v Speaker 19>point nine 99th percentile and there's a</v>

4911
04:26:52.671 --> 04:26:57.671
<v Speaker 19>massive difference between the ability</v>
<v Speaker 19>of people to think as you move farther</v>

4912
04:26:58.581 --> 04:27:03.581
<v Speaker 19>and farther out into the extremes</v>
<v Speaker 19>intelligence and when you have the</v>

4913
04:27:03.991 --> 04:27:07.380
<v Speaker 19>writings of someone who's one in a</v>
<v Speaker 19>billion,</v>

4914
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:11.760
<v Speaker 19>then you can interact with those</v>
<v Speaker 19>writings in a way that enables you,</v>

4915
04:27:11.761 --> 04:27:16.761
<v Speaker 19>if you'll put the time into</v>
<v Speaker 19>benefit from the spectacular fact of</v>

4916
04:27:17.741 --> 04:27:21.640
<v Speaker 19>that intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Nisha was a full professor by the time</v>

4917
04:27:21.641 --> 04:27:25.330
<v Speaker 19>he was 24 at a time when he didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 19>have to write a dissertation.</v>

4918
04:27:25.331 --> 04:27:29.140
<v Speaker 19>They just made him a full professor at a</v>
<v Speaker 19>time where that was.</v>

4919
04:27:29.620 --> 04:27:30.580
<v Speaker 19>That never happened.</v>

4920
04:27:37.330 --> 04:27:41.710
<v Speaker 19>So this is what he has to say and the</v>
<v Speaker 19>prejudice is a philosopher is just the</v>

4921
04:27:41.711 --> 04:27:44.410
<v Speaker 19>first chapter of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Beyond good and evil.</v>

4922
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:51.790
<v Speaker 19>It is gradually become clear to me what</v>
<v Speaker 19>every Greek philosophy up until now has</v>

4923
04:27:52.251 --> 04:27:57.251
<v Speaker 19>consisted of namely the confession of</v>
<v Speaker 19>its originator and the species of</v>

4924
04:27:58.251 --> 04:28:01.310
<v Speaker 19>involuntary and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiography.</v>

4925
04:28:03.390 --> 04:28:05.750
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's deceptive.</v>

4926
04:28:06.980 --> 04:28:10.130
<v Speaker 19>That's a deceptively simple sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Even though it's not a particularly</v>

4927
04:28:10.131 --> 04:28:13.580
<v Speaker 19>simple sentence because it.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It stands on its head.</v>

4928
04:28:13.581 --> 04:28:17.510
<v Speaker 19>What people generally assume about the</v>
<v Speaker 19>process of thinking.</v>

4929
04:28:20.000 --> 04:28:21.710
<v Speaker 19>You generally think that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 19>thinking,</v>

4930
04:28:21.711 --> 04:28:23.860
<v Speaker 19>you're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 19>as I mentioned before,</v>

4931
04:28:23.880 --> 04:28:26.730
<v Speaker 19>the structure of the objective world</v>
<v Speaker 19>need shoes,</v>

4932
04:28:26.810 --> 04:28:31.250
<v Speaker 19>is making an entirely different point</v>
<v Speaker 19>here and what he's fundamentally doing</v>

4933
04:28:31.251 --> 04:28:35.300
<v Speaker 19>is treating the philosopher not as a</v>
<v Speaker 19>rational being,</v>

4934
04:28:35.301 --> 04:28:38.870
<v Speaker 19>but as a living being,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and there's a big difference between</v>

4935
04:28:38.871 --> 04:28:41.660
<v Speaker 19>being a rational being and being a</v>
<v Speaker 19>living being.</v>

4936
04:28:41.930 --> 04:28:45.230
<v Speaker 19>Because if you're living being your</v>
<v Speaker 19>primary goal is to do whatever it is</v>

4937
04:28:45.231 --> 04:28:47.540
<v Speaker 19>that furthers your life and if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 19>rational being,</v>

4938
04:28:47.541 --> 04:28:52.010
<v Speaker 19>then your primary goal is to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 19>it is that a rational being might do.</v>

4939
04:28:52.400 --> 04:28:56.840
<v Speaker 19>And you could say that a living being</v>
<v Speaker 19>should first and foremost be a rational</v>

4940
04:28:56.841 --> 04:29:01.220
<v Speaker 19>being and in some sense that's the</v>
<v Speaker 19>message of the of the Western</v>

4941
04:29:01.221 --> 04:29:04.550
<v Speaker 19>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 19>But it's by no means self evident that</v>

4942
04:29:04.551 --> 04:29:07.180
<v Speaker 19>that's the case and it's certainly not</v>
<v Speaker 19>something that Nietzsche,</v>

4943
04:29:07.330 --> 04:29:08.810
<v Speaker 19>Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 19>he doesn't believe that people are</v>

4944
04:29:08.811 --> 04:29:11.750
<v Speaker 19>rational beings,</v>
<v Speaker 19>certainly not primarily,</v>

4945
04:29:11.751 --> 04:29:14.990
<v Speaker 19>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 19>he isn't exactly convinced that they</v>

4946
04:29:14.991 --> 04:29:16.850
<v Speaker 19>should be so.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So for example,</v>

4947
04:29:16.851 --> 04:29:20.870
<v Speaker 19>one of niches,</v>
<v Speaker 19>most famous maximums is that truth</v>

4948
04:29:20.871 --> 04:29:25.190
<v Speaker 19>serves life and that's a very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 19>different idea.</v>

4949
04:29:25.191 --> 04:29:29.270
<v Speaker 19>Then the purpose of truth say the</v>
<v Speaker 19>accurate representation of the objective</v>

4950
04:29:29.271 --> 04:29:31.790
<v Speaker 19>world.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Those aren't the same thing at all.</v>

4951
04:29:31.970 --> 04:29:32.990
<v Speaker 19>Now you could ask,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

4952
04:29:32.991 --> 04:29:34.970
<v Speaker 19>what does it mean for truth to serve</v>
<v Speaker 19>life?</v>

4953
04:29:34.971 --> 04:29:38.360
<v Speaker 19>And if you construe truth that way,</v>
<v Speaker 19>what would truth look like?</v>

4954
04:29:38.780 --> 04:29:42.890
<v Speaker 19>And you know the mere statement,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the truths should serve life doesn't</v>

4955
04:29:43.220 --> 04:29:45.380
<v Speaker 19>offer you the answers to those</v>
<v Speaker 19>questions,</v>

4956
04:29:45.650 --> 04:29:46.483
<v Speaker 19>but</v>

4957
04:29:48.720 --> 04:29:50.580
<v Speaker 19>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's the beginning of a different</v>

4958
04:29:50.581 --> 04:29:53.880
<v Speaker 19>metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And in some sense of metaphysics,</v>

4959
04:29:53.881 --> 04:29:58.881
<v Speaker 19>which is say the universe within which a</v>
<v Speaker 19>philosopher might operate a metaphysics</v>

4960
04:29:59.350 --> 04:30:04.350
<v Speaker 19>is the initial structure of</v>
<v Speaker 19>presuppositions within which a view of</v>

4961
04:30:05.921 --> 04:30:10.921
<v Speaker 19>the world is organized.</v>
<v Speaker 19>One presupposition might be human beings</v>

4962
04:30:12.861 --> 04:30:17.861
<v Speaker 19>are rational and that we're attempting</v>
<v Speaker 19>to formulate and improve our sense of</v>

4963
04:30:18.701 --> 04:30:21.190
<v Speaker 19>the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 19>our formulation of the objective world,</v>

4964
04:30:21.191 --> 04:30:25.510
<v Speaker 19>and another would be that you would be.</v>
<v Speaker 19>These aren't rational or irrational and</v>

4965
04:30:25.511 --> 04:30:27.940
<v Speaker 19>that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 19>What we're motivated to do is to live</v>

4966
04:30:28.150 --> 04:30:31.810
<v Speaker 19>whatever that means and that the purpose</v>
<v Speaker 19>of our thinking and our philosophy</v>

4967
04:30:31.811 --> 04:30:35.670
<v Speaker 19>should be to facilitate our living and</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's neat use.</v>

4968
04:30:35.740 --> 04:30:40.740
<v Speaker 19>That's one of the foundation</v>
<v Speaker 19>blocks of niches philosophy.</v>

4969
04:30:43.420 --> 04:30:46.900
<v Speaker 19>So He's a moral philosopher</v>
<v Speaker 19>fundamentally because morality is about</v>

4970
04:30:46.901 --> 04:30:50.560
<v Speaker 19>values and the values essentially values</v>
<v Speaker 19>are</v>

4971
04:30:52.230 --> 04:30:54.060
<v Speaker 19>you could say values are what you aim</v>
<v Speaker 19>for,</v>

4972
04:30:54.061 --> 04:30:58.140
<v Speaker 19>but it's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Values actually constitute the lens</v>

4973
04:30:58.141 --> 04:31:01.560
<v Speaker 19>through which you view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So it's partly what you're aiming at,</v>

4974
04:31:01.561 --> 04:31:05.370
<v Speaker 19>but it's also partly your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 19>who you are now and where you are.</v>

4975
04:31:05.580 --> 04:31:10.110
<v Speaker 19>And it's also part that your conception</v>
<v Speaker 19>of how you're going to get to where it</v>

4976
04:31:10.111 --> 04:31:15.111
<v Speaker 19>is that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And it's also partly the psychological</v>

4977
04:31:16.021 --> 04:31:20.310
<v Speaker 19>system that you use to parse up the</v>
<v Speaker 19>world so that it reveals to you the</v>

4978
04:31:20.311 --> 04:31:23.610
<v Speaker 19>pathway that you could take to get to</v>
<v Speaker 19>what you want to value values,</v>

4979
04:31:23.611 --> 04:31:26.100
<v Speaker 19>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and then it's more than that because you</v>

4980
04:31:26.101 --> 04:31:30.150
<v Speaker 19>could say that you have added value</v>
<v Speaker 19>which contains all of that,</v>

4981
04:31:30.151 --> 04:31:33.570
<v Speaker 19>but then you can say that you have a set</v>
<v Speaker 19>of values which is the arrangement of</v>

4982
04:31:33.571 --> 04:31:35.580
<v Speaker 19>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then you can say that you have a set</v>

4983
04:31:35.581 --> 04:31:37.950
<v Speaker 19>of values that's the arrangement of all</v>
<v Speaker 19>that,</v>

4984
04:31:38.130 --> 04:31:42.510
<v Speaker 19>that you have to arrange with other</v>
<v Speaker 19>people and then you could say that you</v>

4985
04:31:42.511 --> 04:31:45.570
<v Speaker 19>have all that and you have to arrange it</v>
<v Speaker 19>with other people and you have to</v>

4986
04:31:45.571 --> 04:31:49.230
<v Speaker 19>arrange it across different spans of</v>
<v Speaker 19>time because what you want today and</v>

4987
04:31:49.231 --> 04:31:52.590
<v Speaker 19>what you want next week and what you</v>
<v Speaker 19>want next month are not necessarily the</v>

4988
04:31:52.591 --> 04:31:55.860
<v Speaker 19>same thing and one does not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 19>lead into the other.</v>

4989
04:31:56.400 --> 04:32:00.150
<v Speaker 19>So to be a moral philosopher is to</v>
<v Speaker 19>examine how that,</v>

4990
04:32:01.170 --> 04:32:04.140
<v Speaker 19>what that system is and how it operates</v>
<v Speaker 19>and how it came about.</v>

4991
04:32:04.200 --> 04:32:06.730
<v Speaker 19>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 19>one of the things that nature says is it</v>

4992
04:32:06.731 --> 04:32:09.990
<v Speaker 19>has gradually become clear to me what</v>
<v Speaker 19>every Greek philosophy up until now is</v>

4993
04:32:09.991 --> 04:32:14.280
<v Speaker 19>consisted of namely the confession of</v>
<v Speaker 19>its originator and the species of</v>

4994
04:32:14.281 --> 04:32:16.610
<v Speaker 19>involuntary and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiography.</v>

4995
04:32:17.160 --> 04:32:21.390
<v Speaker 19>So his claim fundamentally is that no</v>
<v Speaker 19>matter what the philosopher thinks he's</v>

4996
04:32:21.391 --> 04:32:23.370
<v Speaker 19>doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>he's reading philosophy.</v>

4997
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:28.550
<v Speaker 19>What he's actually doing is revealing</v>
<v Speaker 19>and articulating his being,</v>

4998
04:32:30.990 --> 04:32:31.940
<v Speaker 19>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

4999
04:32:31.941 --> 04:32:35.580
<v Speaker 19>where did that be income from?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And the answer to that is,</v>

5000
04:32:35.640 --> 04:32:38.100
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>partly it's you could consider it a</v>

5001
04:32:38.101 --> 04:32:42.600
<v Speaker 19>biological function in so far as that we</v>
<v Speaker 19>have value structures that are built</v>

5002
04:32:42.601 --> 04:32:45.840
<v Speaker 19>into us that are in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 19>We would say the process of a very long</v>

5003
04:32:45.841 --> 04:32:49.830
<v Speaker 19>evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but because you're also a cultural</v>

5004
04:32:49.860 --> 04:32:54.210
<v Speaker 19>phenomena and because the manner in</v>
<v Speaker 19>which you've arranged your values and</v>

5005
04:32:54.211 --> 04:32:59.211
<v Speaker 19>your desires has been conditioned to the</v>
<v Speaker 19>degree by the process of enculturation</v>

5006
04:33:00.711 --> 04:33:03.290
<v Speaker 19>that you were subjected to when you</v>

5007
04:33:05.740 --> 04:33:10.510
<v Speaker 19>confessed and an autobiographical manner</v>
<v Speaker 19>and articulate that what you're also</v>

5008
04:33:10.511 --> 04:33:15.511
<v Speaker 19>doing is really capitulating the entire</v>
<v Speaker 19>structure of your culture.</v>

5009
04:33:15.730 --> 04:33:17.230
<v Speaker 19>It's in you and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5010
04:33:17.231 --> 04:33:18.930
<v Speaker 19>where is it in you?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And that,</v>

5011
04:33:19.060 --> 04:33:20.200
<v Speaker 19>and what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you mean,</v>

5012
04:33:20.201 --> 04:33:25.201
<v Speaker 19>part of it means is that you act out a</v>
<v Speaker 19>pattern of behavior and that pattern of</v>

5013
04:33:25.451 --> 04:33:30.451
<v Speaker 19>behavior is like a dance that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 19>manifesting to a symphonic score.</v>

5014
04:33:30.761 --> 04:33:35.761
<v Speaker 19>It's unbelievably complicated and it has</v>
<v Speaker 19>its psychological elements and some of</v>

5015
04:33:36.251 --> 04:33:37.930
<v Speaker 19>those are conscious and some of them</v>
<v Speaker 19>aren't.</v>

5016
04:33:37.960 --> 04:33:40.690
<v Speaker 19>Some of them are just implicit in bedded</v>
<v Speaker 19>in the way you act,</v>

5017
04:33:40.691 --> 04:33:42.940
<v Speaker 19>in the way you perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And what the philosopher is attempting</v>

5018
04:33:42.941 --> 04:33:47.941
<v Speaker 19>to do is to reveal those to himself and</v>
<v Speaker 19>to articulate them so that the entire</v>

5019
04:33:48.791 --> 04:33:51.120
<v Speaker 19>structure can be analyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well.</v>

5020
04:33:51.130 --> 04:33:54.220
<v Speaker 19>So niches,</v>
<v Speaker 19>first proposition is that when a</v>

5021
04:33:54.400 --> 04:33:58.000
<v Speaker 19>philosopher is thinking that what he's</v>
<v Speaker 19>doing is not thinking,</v>

5022
04:33:58.270 --> 04:34:01.360
<v Speaker 19>it's revealing himself in an</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiographical sense,</v>

5023
04:34:01.361 --> 04:34:04.600
<v Speaker 19>under the guise of rational thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so then it becomes something more</v>

5024
04:34:04.601 --> 04:34:05.470
<v Speaker 19>like a story.</v>

5025
04:34:06.380 --> 04:34:07.213
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5026
04:34:08.570 --> 04:34:11.720
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>any governors all about in the first two</v>

5027
04:34:11.721 --> 04:34:14.630
<v Speaker 19>phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So that gives you some example,</v>

5028
04:34:14.840 --> 04:34:17.060
<v Speaker 19>some indication of what this book is</v>
<v Speaker 19>like,</v>

5029
04:34:19.430 --> 04:34:22.790
<v Speaker 19>a species of involuntary unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiography.</v>

5030
04:34:26.360 --> 04:34:28.160
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's a more complicated idea too</v>

5031
04:34:28.161 --> 04:34:29.150
<v Speaker 19>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5032
04:34:29.151 --> 04:34:32.330
<v Speaker 19>why would someone be driven in an</v>
<v Speaker 19>involuntary way,</v>

5033
04:34:32.580 --> 04:34:37.340
<v Speaker 19>in an unconscious way to describe their</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiography,</v>

5034
04:34:38.250 --> 04:34:39.083
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

5035
04:34:39.330 --> 04:34:43.110
<v Speaker 19>that's a very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It might be that one of the reasons that</v>

5036
04:34:43.111 --> 04:34:45.930
<v Speaker 19>people valued one another is because we</v>

5037
04:34:47.860 --> 04:34:52.390
<v Speaker 19>engaged in the process of sharing deeply</v>
<v Speaker 19>autobiographical information.</v>

5038
04:34:53.260 --> 04:34:55.450
<v Speaker 19>You tell me your story and I tell you my</v>
<v Speaker 19>story,</v>

5039
04:34:55.451 --> 04:34:56.650
<v Speaker 19>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5040
04:34:56.651 --> 04:34:58.510
<v Speaker 19>why?</v>
<v Speaker 19>Why do we even bother with such things?</v>

5041
04:34:58.511 --> 04:35:02.350
<v Speaker 19>And the answer to that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 19>If you can tell me about the pain and</v>

5042
04:35:02.351 --> 04:35:07.351
<v Speaker 19>tragedy that you've encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 19>then that gives me a better way of that</v>

5043
04:35:07.811 --> 04:35:11.800
<v Speaker 19>gives me a better vision of the dangers</v>
<v Speaker 19>of the world without actually having to</v>

5044
04:35:11.801 --> 04:35:14.590
<v Speaker 19>expose myself to those dangerous except</v>
<v Speaker 19>in simulation.</v>

5045
04:35:14.591 --> 04:35:17.320
<v Speaker 19>I might feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I might feel bad about your tragic</v>

5046
04:35:17.321 --> 04:35:19.960
<v Speaker 19>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but I'm not bleeding for them.</v>

5047
04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:23.590
<v Speaker 19>And then there's always the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 19>that you'll also tell me how you solved</v>

5048
04:35:23.591 --> 04:35:26.650
<v Speaker 19>your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 19>In which case I can either avoid that</v>

5049
04:35:26.651 --> 04:35:30.310
<v Speaker 19>problem entirely or if I do encounter a</v>
<v Speaker 19>consultant without having to go through.</v>

5050
04:35:30.460 --> 04:35:34.540
<v Speaker 19>Maybe it took you decades to formulate</v>
<v Speaker 19>your solution to that problem and you</v>

5051
04:35:34.541 --> 04:35:37.120
<v Speaker 19>can tell me your story and then I have</v>
<v Speaker 19>the information,</v>

5052
04:35:37.540 --> 04:35:40.000
<v Speaker 19>and so that's part of what human beings</v>
<v Speaker 19>are always trading.</v>

5053
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:42.850
<v Speaker 19>That's why we talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That's why we can communicate,</v>

5054
04:35:43.300 --> 04:35:44.440
<v Speaker 19>and so Nietzsche would say,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5055
04:35:44.441 --> 04:35:46.600
<v Speaker 19>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It's involuntary unconscious,</v>

5056
04:35:46.960 --> 04:35:51.460
<v Speaker 19>involuntary unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 19>He's alluding to the fact that that</v>

5057
04:35:51.461 --> 04:35:54.000
<v Speaker 19>proclivity is so deeply embedded in</v>
<v Speaker 19>people.</v>

5058
04:35:54.250 --> 04:35:58.890
<v Speaker 19>The desire to make an autobiographical</v>
<v Speaker 19>recounting that</v>

5059
04:36:02.060 --> 04:36:06.680
<v Speaker 19>it serves as a kind of motivation that</v>
<v Speaker 19>we don't question for doing almost</v>

5060
04:36:06.681 --> 04:36:09.220
<v Speaker 19>everything that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So you know,</v>

5061
04:36:09.240 --> 04:36:12.890
<v Speaker 19>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 19>people do such things as a 10 movies and</v>

5062
04:36:12.891 --> 04:36:17.530
<v Speaker 19>plays and they usually do that happily,</v>
<v Speaker 19>especially if the movie or the play is a</v>

5063
04:36:17.540 --> 04:36:19.940
<v Speaker 19>high quality.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And the same thing happens when people</v>

5064
04:36:19.941 --> 04:36:20.840
<v Speaker 19>are reading novels.</v>

5065
04:36:23.130 --> 04:36:27.370
<v Speaker 19>They're attracted to such things.</v>
<v Speaker 19>They have a built in value and it's very</v>

5066
04:36:27.371 --> 04:36:30.190
<v Speaker 19>rarely the case that people will ever</v>
<v Speaker 19>question why it is that they're doing</v>

5067
04:36:30.191 --> 04:36:31.300
<v Speaker 19>such things.</v>
<v Speaker 19>In fact,</v>

5068
04:36:31.600 --> 04:36:34.540
<v Speaker 19>you see this quite commonly with</v>
<v Speaker 19>students who were first introduced to</v>

5069
04:36:34.541 --> 04:36:39.541
<v Speaker 19>the study of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 19>The introduction of the idea that you</v>

5070
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:44.551
<v Speaker 19>should analyze what it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 19>engaged in when you're reading actually</v>

5071
04:36:47.260 --> 04:36:51.910
<v Speaker 19>comes as unwelcome news to most people</v>
<v Speaker 19>who are inclined towards fiction because</v>

5072
04:36:51.911 --> 04:36:54.670
<v Speaker 19>they don't want to interfere with the</v>
<v Speaker 19>process of engagement,</v>

5073
04:36:54.970 --> 04:36:57.100
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>automatic unconscious engagement with</v>

5074
04:36:57.101 --> 04:37:01.360
<v Speaker 19>the material by detaching themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 19>having to think about what they're</v>

5075
04:37:01.361 --> 04:37:04.660
<v Speaker 19>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So that's why it's an involuntary</v>

5076
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:05.700
<v Speaker 19>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It's,</v>

5077
04:37:05.730 --> 04:37:06.610
<v Speaker 19>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's,</v>

5078
04:37:06.700 --> 04:37:10.690
<v Speaker 19>it's one of the things within which</v>
<v Speaker 19>thoughts operates rather than one of the</v>

5079
04:37:10.691 --> 04:37:15.691
<v Speaker 19>things on which thought operates.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Then he says,</v>

5080
04:37:16.961 --> 04:37:20.830
<v Speaker 19>the moral or immoral purpose in which</v>
<v Speaker 19>every philosophy has constituted.</v>

5081
04:37:21.420 --> 04:37:24.760
<v Speaker 19>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the moral or immoral purpose in every</v>

5082
04:37:24.761 --> 04:37:29.761
<v Speaker 19>philosophy has constituted the true</v>
<v Speaker 19>vital germ out of which the entire plant</v>

5083
04:37:30.820 --> 04:37:32.890
<v Speaker 19>has always grown.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well.</v>

5084
04:37:32.891 --> 04:37:37.000
<v Speaker 19>That's a hell of a thing to say too,</v>
<v Speaker 19>because what niche is alluding to there</v>

5085
04:37:37.001 --> 04:37:38.120
<v Speaker 19>in some senses that</v>

5086
04:37:45.500 --> 04:37:49.640
<v Speaker 19>the philosopher Kant help and that would</v>
<v Speaker 19>be in some sense also the person who was</v>

5087
04:37:49.641 --> 04:37:54.200
<v Speaker 19>recounting their autobiography can't</v>
<v Speaker 19>help but tell you what they're up to.</v>

5088
04:37:55.160 --> 04:37:59.000
<v Speaker 19>Even though they might not know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and this is something that you own</v>

5089
04:37:59.001 --> 04:38:02.120
<v Speaker 19>because you almost carl,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you'll know the cyclist psychoanalyst</v>

5090
04:38:02.121 --> 04:38:07.121
<v Speaker 19>was a great student of nature and you</v>
<v Speaker 19>came to believe that we all inhabited</v>

5091
04:38:09.650 --> 04:38:12.140
<v Speaker 19>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 19>The stories were stories we didn't have</v>

5092
04:38:12.141 --> 04:38:15.950
<v Speaker 19>in the garage with the structures of</v>
<v Speaker 19>value within which we live and that</v>

5093
04:38:15.951 --> 04:38:20.951
<v Speaker 19>those stories essentially had an ethic</v>
<v Speaker 19>or a moral and then you you can start</v>

5094
04:38:21.531 --> 04:38:24.950
<v Speaker 19>thinking about what the ethics and the</v>
<v Speaker 19>morals might be and you kind of have</v>

5095
04:38:24.951 --> 04:38:28.010
<v Speaker 19>some sense of that because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 19>There's comedic stories and tragic</v>

5096
04:38:28.011 --> 04:38:31.220
<v Speaker 19>stories and there's evil characters in</v>
<v Speaker 19>good and characters and so forth.</v>

5097
04:38:31.221 --> 04:38:34.550
<v Speaker 19>Those are architected characters,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but part of the point that niches</v>

5098
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:37.550
<v Speaker 19>attempting to make here is that the</v>
<v Speaker 19>philosopher is in fact aiming at</v>

5099
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:41.120
<v Speaker 19>something with his life,</v>
<v Speaker 19>with all of his actions.</v>

5100
04:38:41.180 --> 04:38:44.750
<v Speaker 19>He might not even know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but partly what he's doing in his</v>

5101
04:38:44.751 --> 04:38:49.400
<v Speaker 19>attempt to philosophize is to articulate</v>
<v Speaker 19>that in reveal it to himself and to</v>

5102
04:38:49.401 --> 04:38:50.234
<v Speaker 19>other people.</v>

5103
04:38:54.410 --> 04:38:56.150
<v Speaker 19>So then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5104
04:38:56.360 --> 04:38:58.040
<v Speaker 19>what is it that the person is off to</v>
<v Speaker 19>you?</v>

5105
04:38:58.041 --> 04:39:01.440
<v Speaker 19>And I would say in some sense that's the</v>
<v Speaker 19>ultimate question and so neat you here</v>

5106
04:39:01.520 --> 04:39:03.980
<v Speaker 19>in this paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it is also dealing with the,</v>

5107
04:39:04.550 --> 04:39:09.170
<v Speaker 19>with the ultimate question in life,</v>
<v Speaker 19>which might be well to what is your life</v>

5108
04:39:09.710 --> 04:39:11.270
<v Speaker 19>aimed?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And you might say,</v>

5109
04:39:11.271 --> 04:39:13.820
<v Speaker 19>well it's not entered anything into.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I don't know.</v>

5110
04:39:13.860 --> 04:39:16.040
<v Speaker 19>I don't seem to have any coherent set of</v>
<v Speaker 19>beliefs.</v>

5111
04:39:16.041 --> 04:39:18.380
<v Speaker 19>I don't know what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I don't believe in anything even.</v>

5112
04:39:18.880 --> 04:39:22.670
<v Speaker 19>But that's not the case because if you</v>
<v Speaker 19>didn't believe in anything you couldn't</v>

5113
04:39:22.671 --> 04:39:26.000
<v Speaker 19>see.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You have to believe in something to be</v>

5114
04:39:26.001 --> 04:39:29.330
<v Speaker 19>able to see because you point your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 19>and things and you can organize your</v>

5115
04:39:29.360 --> 04:39:33.380
<v Speaker 19>vision without having an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so the very act of interacting with</v>

5116
04:39:33.381 --> 04:39:38.381
<v Speaker 19>the world presupposes an ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then all those micro ethics that you</v>

5117
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:43.850
<v Speaker 19>contain within you are organized into</v>
<v Speaker 19>some sort of structure either badly or</v>

5118
04:39:43.851 --> 04:39:44.600
<v Speaker 19>well.</v>

5119
04:39:44.600 --> 04:39:48.890
<v Speaker 19>And that structure roughly has an aim</v>
<v Speaker 19>and you might know it and you might not.</v>

5120
04:39:48.920 --> 04:39:50.370
<v Speaker 19>But that doesn't mean that this</v>
<v Speaker 19>therapist.</v>

5121
04:39:50.371 --> 04:39:52.070
<v Speaker 19>So,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so one other thing that needs he is</v>

5122
04:39:52.071 --> 04:39:56.330
<v Speaker 19>alluding to is that you believe things</v>
<v Speaker 19>whether or not you think you believed</v>

5123
04:39:56.331 --> 04:39:58.070
<v Speaker 19>them,</v>
<v Speaker 19>in fairness,</v>

5124
04:39:58.100 --> 04:39:58.990
<v Speaker 19>believing them,</v>
<v Speaker 19>unknowing,</v>

5125
04:39:59.090 --> 04:40:01.430
<v Speaker 19>you believed them,</v>
<v Speaker 19>aren't even the same thing,</v>

5126
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:06.170
<v Speaker 19>and so the people believe all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 19>things that they don't know about and</v>

5127
04:40:06.171 --> 04:40:08.570
<v Speaker 19>that partly what they're doing when</v>
<v Speaker 19>they're doing philosophy is to try and</v>

5128
04:40:08.590 --> 04:40:10.400
<v Speaker 19>figure out what those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 19>When you know,</v>

5129
04:40:10.401 --> 04:40:12.680
<v Speaker 19>when you can also ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well where did they come from?</v>

5130
04:40:13.580 --> 04:40:14.840
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>they partly came from you,</v>

5131
04:40:14.841 --> 04:40:17.390
<v Speaker 19>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you're an old thing.</v>

5132
04:40:18.440 --> 04:40:22.700
<v Speaker 19>Your physical form is three and a half</v>
<v Speaker 19>billion years old and you're the process</v>

5133
04:40:22.701 --> 04:40:26.270
<v Speaker 19>of all that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>All of the death and struggling that</v>

5134
04:40:26.271 --> 04:40:31.271
<v Speaker 19>went along the entire course of that</v>
<v Speaker 19>three and a half billion years is you</v>

5135
04:40:31.491 --> 04:40:36.491
<v Speaker 19>carry that with you and then on top of</v>
<v Speaker 19>that inside you is the consequence of</v>

5136
04:40:37.251 --> 04:40:40.640
<v Speaker 19>the entire cultural history of complex</v>
<v Speaker 19>life.</v>

5137
04:40:40.820 --> 04:40:43.700
<v Speaker 19>That's all inside youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then on top of that,</v>

5138
04:40:43.701 --> 04:40:46.730
<v Speaker 19>some of that's articulated more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 19>some it's acted out,</v>

5139
04:40:47.060 --> 04:40:49.550
<v Speaker 19>dramatized,</v>
<v Speaker 19>represented infection and that sort of</v>

5140
04:40:49.551 --> 04:40:51.500
<v Speaker 19>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then some of it's articulated,</v>

5141
04:40:51.980 --> 04:40:56.980
<v Speaker 19>but there's way more at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Then it is fully articulate and so god</v>

5142
04:40:57.321 --> 04:41:00.110
<v Speaker 19>only knows what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then you might say,</v>

5143
04:41:00.111 --> 04:41:00.944
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>who cares?</v>

5144
04:41:00.960 --> 04:41:03.350
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the problem with that is that you care</v>

5145
04:41:03.351 --> 04:41:05.630
<v Speaker 19>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's the definition of caring and</v>

5146
04:41:05.631 --> 04:41:10.631
<v Speaker 19>second of all that determines the the</v>
<v Speaker 19>way that you'll move through your life</v>

5147
04:41:12.170 --> 04:41:16.340
<v Speaker 19>and everything that happens to you</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's good or evil or good or bad is</v>

5148
04:41:16.341 --> 04:41:19.370
<v Speaker 19>going to be a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 19>manifestation of that ethic in the</v>

5149
04:41:19.371 --> 04:41:20.204
<v Speaker 19>world.</v>

5150
04:41:23.700 --> 04:41:25.710
<v Speaker 19>So and now,</v>
<v Speaker 19>Nina is saying something else too.</v>

5151
04:41:25.711 --> 04:41:30.711
<v Speaker 19>When he says the moral or immoral</v>
<v Speaker 19>purpose in whichever in the moral or</v>

5152
04:41:31.291 --> 04:41:36.090
<v Speaker 19>immoral purpose in every philosophy as</v>
<v Speaker 19>constituted the true vital germ out of</v>

5153
04:41:36.091 --> 04:41:38.040
<v Speaker 19>which the entire plant is always</v>
<v Speaker 19>growing.</v>

5154
04:41:39.710 --> 04:41:44.280
<v Speaker 19>He's saying that the philosopher can't</v>
<v Speaker 19>help but reveal his age and his writings</v>

5155
04:41:44.910 --> 04:41:49.650
<v Speaker 19>and then he's saying something else</v>
<v Speaker 19>which is that he might be malevolent and</v>

5156
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:52.820
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>modern people are very comfortable with</v>

5157
04:41:52.821 --> 04:41:57.260
<v Speaker 19>ideas like malevolence because</v>
<v Speaker 19>malevolence is an idea that's related to</v>

5158
04:41:57.261 --> 04:42:02.261
<v Speaker 19>evil and modern people think of</v>
<v Speaker 19>themselves as beyond good and evil to</v>

5159
04:42:02.601 --> 04:42:05.570
<v Speaker 19>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 19>They don't believe in the reality of</v>

5160
04:42:05.571 --> 04:42:08.630
<v Speaker 19>those concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And of course in this book is also</v>

5161
04:42:08.631 --> 04:42:12.650
<v Speaker 19>questioning our,</v>
<v Speaker 19>at least our a priori presuppositions</v>

5162
04:42:12.651 --> 04:42:16.250
<v Speaker 19>about what do they need the lore,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but that doesn't mean that he doesn't</v>

5163
04:42:16.251 --> 04:42:20.390
<v Speaker 19>believe that they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That doesn't mean that he doesn't</v>

5164
04:42:20.391 --> 04:42:22.130
<v Speaker 19>believe that they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Yes,</v>

5165
04:42:22.131 --> 04:42:23.660
<v Speaker 19>I guess that's.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I guess that's right.</v>

5166
04:42:27.480 --> 04:42:29.010
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>this is one of the things I've thought</v>

5167
04:42:29.011 --> 04:42:32.130
<v Speaker 19>about when I was thinking about when</v>
<v Speaker 19>I've thought about how Hitler guide,</v>

5168
04:42:32.830 --> 04:42:33.930
<v Speaker 19>no,</v>
<v Speaker 19>Hitler died.</v>

5169
04:42:35.730 --> 04:42:39.510
<v Speaker 19>Hitler committed suicide in the bunker</v>
<v Speaker 19>underneath Berlin when Europe was in</v>

5170
04:42:39.511 --> 04:42:40.344
<v Speaker 19>flames.</v>

5171
04:42:41.770 --> 04:42:42.680
<v Speaker 6>And so one</v>

5172
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:49.510
<v Speaker 19>conclusion that a psychoanalytically</v>
<v Speaker 19>minded historian could derive from that</v>

5173
04:42:49.701 --> 04:42:53.780
<v Speaker 19>is that's what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Right?</v>

5174
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:59.110
<v Speaker 19>And then that opens up an entire vast</v>
<v Speaker 19>nest of snakes because one of the things</v>

5175
04:43:00.591 --> 04:43:01.790
<v Speaker 19>that you might ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5176
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:04.040
<v Speaker 19>how is it that someone would desire</v>
<v Speaker 19>that?</v>

5177
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:05.840
<v Speaker 19>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 19>could that even be desired?</v>

5178
04:43:05.870 --> 04:43:08.110
<v Speaker 19>Is that actually something that anyone</v>
<v Speaker 19>could even desire?</v>

5179
04:43:09.620 --> 04:43:13.010
<v Speaker 19>Then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well why is it that someone would design</v>

5180
04:43:13.011 --> 04:43:15.950
<v Speaker 19>that?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And then the next thing you might ask is</v>

5181
04:43:16.130 --> 04:43:20.540
<v Speaker 19>if a human being could desire that and</v>
<v Speaker 19>hit there was a human being then exactly</v>

5182
04:43:20.541 --> 04:43:23.240
<v Speaker 19>what does that say about you?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And you might say,</v>

5183
04:43:23.241 --> 04:43:24.770
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I could never desire such a thing,</v>

5184
04:43:25.220 --> 04:43:27.680
<v Speaker 19>but following the long,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the train of the argument that we've</v>

5185
04:43:27.681 --> 04:43:29.780
<v Speaker 19>been laying out,</v>
<v Speaker 19>just like what makes you think you're a</v>

5186
04:43:29.781 --> 04:43:31.790
<v Speaker 19>reliable judge of what it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 19>up to.</v>

5187
04:43:33.440 --> 04:43:34.700
<v Speaker 19>So,</v>
<v Speaker 19>okay,</v>

5188
04:43:34.701 --> 04:43:39.701
<v Speaker 19>so now we've unpack three sentences and</v>
<v Speaker 19>we'll continue on with the same</v>

5189
04:43:40.880 --> 04:43:45.880
<v Speaker 19>paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Indeed to understand how the most</v>

5190
04:43:45.981 --> 04:43:50.450
<v Speaker 19>abstract metaphysical assertions of a</v>
<v Speaker 19>philosopher have been arrived at.</v>

5191
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:55.430
<v Speaker 19>It is always well.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And why is to first ask oneself what</v>

5192
04:43:55.431 --> 04:44:00.431
<v Speaker 19>morality do they or does he aim at?</v>
<v Speaker 19>So what the question is,</v>

5193
04:44:01.790 --> 04:44:02.870
<v Speaker 19>what's the personality?</v>

5194
04:44:04.490 --> 04:44:05.323
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5195
04:44:06.840 --> 04:44:10.170
<v Speaker 19>there's an entire narrative snakes</v>
<v Speaker 19>underneath that sentence,</v>

5196
04:44:10.260 --> 04:44:15.260
<v Speaker 19>that sequence of propositions as well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and one of them is,</v>

5197
04:44:27.250 --> 04:44:28.900
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>what does it mean that people are up to</v>

5198
04:44:28.901 --> 04:44:31.590
<v Speaker 19>something?</v>
<v Speaker 19>What does it mean that the rating itself</v>

5199
04:44:37.000 --> 04:44:39.310
<v Speaker 19>accordingly,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I do not believe that an impulse to</v>

5200
04:44:39.311 --> 04:44:43.690
<v Speaker 19>knowledge is the father of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but that another impulse here as</v>

5201
04:44:43.691 --> 04:44:48.691
<v Speaker 19>elsewhere has only made use of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 19>and mistaken knowledge as an</v>

5202
04:44:51.050 --> 04:44:54.410
<v Speaker 19>but whoever considers the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 19>impulses of man with a view to</v>

5203
04:44:54.411 --> 04:44:57.290
<v Speaker 19>determining how far are be up here after</v>
<v Speaker 19>this inspiring.</v>

5204
04:44:57.320 --> 04:45:00.050
<v Speaker 19>No,</v>
<v Speaker 19>this is partly why this is going to</v>

5205
04:45:00.051 --> 04:45:02.510
<v Speaker 19>require editing so complicated to go</v>
<v Speaker 19>through</v>

5206
04:45:08.400 --> 04:45:10.440
<v Speaker 19>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I do not believe that an impulse</v>

5207
04:45:10.450 --> 04:45:12.240
<v Speaker 19>technologist,</v>
<v Speaker 19>the part of philosophy,</v>

5208
04:45:13.440 --> 04:45:15.480
<v Speaker 19>but then another impulse here is</v>
<v Speaker 19>elsewhere,</v>

5209
04:45:15.690 --> 04:45:19.590
<v Speaker 19>has only made use of knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 19>mistaken knowledge as an instrument.</v>

5210
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:22.290
<v Speaker 19>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so let's take that apart accordingly.</v>

5211
04:45:22.291 --> 04:45:26.400
<v Speaker 19>I do not believe that an impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 19>knowledge is the father of philosophy.</v>

5212
04:45:27.720 --> 04:45:30.990
<v Speaker 19>So one of the claims,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I suppose this would be an enlightenment</v>

5213
04:45:31.050 --> 04:45:36.050
<v Speaker 19>claim is that people do have a drive to</v>
<v Speaker 19>knowledge and that that drive is in fact</v>

5214
04:45:37.080 --> 04:45:42.080
<v Speaker 19>what underlies the production of such</v>
<v Speaker 19>things as philosophy but need to</v>

5215
04:45:42.270 --> 04:45:46.530
<v Speaker 19>questions that because he's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 19>bring us back to consideration of the</v>

5216
04:45:46.531 --> 04:45:51.531
<v Speaker 19>fact that you can't separate the</v>
<v Speaker 19>philosophers mind from the philosophers</v>

5217
04:45:51.840 --> 04:45:55.050
<v Speaker 19>Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 19>He's first and foremost a living</v>

5218
04:45:55.140 --> 04:45:59.820
<v Speaker 19>creature and that he's up to something</v>
<v Speaker 19>and the question is what is it that he's</v>

5219
04:45:59.821 --> 04:46:03.390
<v Speaker 19>up to?</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so you can see the earliest</v>

5220
04:46:03.391 --> 04:46:07.830
<v Speaker 19>manifestations in a paragraph like this</v>
<v Speaker 19>of what later developed into</v>

5221
04:46:07.831 --> 04:46:12.831
<v Speaker 19>deconstructionist thought and that that</v>
<v Speaker 19>was mostly French continental</v>

5222
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:18.470
<v Speaker 19>philosophers who pursued that particular</v>
<v Speaker 19>line of reasoning and it.</v>

5223
04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:24.180
<v Speaker 19>It is derived exactly from this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 19>statement by nature.</v>

5224
04:46:24.960 --> 04:46:26.660
<v Speaker 19>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 19>someone like Garrett,</v>

5225
04:46:26.661 --> 04:46:30.930
<v Speaker 19>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 19>it doesn't matter what the content of</v>

5226
04:46:30.931 --> 04:46:34.050
<v Speaker 19>the text is.</v>
<v Speaker 19>What matters is that the text can be</v>

5227
04:46:34.051 --> 04:46:38.010
<v Speaker 19>used as a tool for power and then</v>
<v Speaker 19>whether the person who wrote the text</v>

5228
04:46:38.011 --> 04:46:40.320
<v Speaker 19>knew it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that's what they were doing and they</v>

5229
04:46:40.321 --> 04:46:44.670
<v Speaker 19>were doing it in a way to privilege</v>
<v Speaker 19>themselves above other people and that's</v>

5230
04:46:44.671 --> 04:46:45.421
<v Speaker 19>really,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I would say,</v>

5231
04:46:45.421 --> 04:46:49.200
<v Speaker 19>the fundamental deconstructionist claim</v>
<v Speaker 19>and it's a powerful claimants and</v>

5232
04:46:49.380 --> 04:46:52.770
<v Speaker 19>utterly corrupt claim,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but it's a really powerful claim and</v>

5233
04:46:52.771 --> 04:46:57.771
<v Speaker 19>it's related directly to the sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 19>things that need you was referring to in</v>

5234
04:46:57.811 --> 04:47:00.450
<v Speaker 19>this paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 19>What is it that the person is truly up</v>

5235
04:47:00.451 --> 04:47:01.171
<v Speaker 19>to?</v>
<v Speaker 19>Now,</v>

5236
04:47:01.171 --> 04:47:03.160
<v Speaker 19>the problem with the deconstructionist</v>
<v Speaker 19>claim,</v>

5237
04:47:03.161 --> 04:47:03.930
<v Speaker 19>Ms Dot,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's an.</v>

5238
04:47:03.930 --> 04:47:07.530
<v Speaker 19>It's an open invitation to cynicism to</v>
<v Speaker 19>thoughtless citizens.</v>

5239
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:11.820
<v Speaker 19>I can just make the presupposition that</v>
<v Speaker 19>whatever it is that you're telling me,</v>

5240
04:47:12.360 --> 04:47:15.210
<v Speaker 19>you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you're telling me merely to dominate</v>

5241
04:47:15.660 --> 04:47:18.270
<v Speaker 19>regardless of what it is that you claim</v>
<v Speaker 19>to be doing.</v>

5242
04:47:19.050 --> 04:47:22.710
<v Speaker 19>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 19>The problem with that approach is that</v>

5243
04:47:24.600 --> 04:47:29.280
<v Speaker 19>it's predicated on the implicit</v>
<v Speaker 19>assumption that the only value that</v>

5244
04:47:29.281 --> 04:47:32.850
<v Speaker 19>people actually have is the value to is</v>
<v Speaker 19>the desire to dominate.</v>

5245
04:47:33.300 --> 04:47:36.390
<v Speaker 19>And of course that's a purely like that</v>
<v Speaker 19>could be the case.</v>

5246
04:47:36.391 --> 04:47:41.040
<v Speaker 19>And I also think that it's even</v>
<v Speaker 19>reasonable to posit that to some degree</v>

5247
04:47:41.041 --> 04:47:44.370
<v Speaker 19>that it is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but to take that from a contributing</v>

5248
04:47:44.371 --> 04:47:48.490
<v Speaker 19>factor and to make that the highest God</v>
<v Speaker 19>because that's essentially what the</v>

5249
04:47:48.520 --> 04:47:52.510
<v Speaker 19>deconstructionists are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Those are entirely different things and</v>

5250
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:57.750
<v Speaker 19>you have to be aware of people who</v>
<v Speaker 19>take a single causal element and</v>

5251
04:47:58.360 --> 04:48:03.360
<v Speaker 19>elevated to the stature of single</v>
<v Speaker 19>comprehensive cause.</v>

5252
04:48:04.600 --> 04:48:07.510
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>it's more reasonable to assume that</v>

5253
04:48:07.511 --> 04:48:11.590
<v Speaker 19>people are complex in their motivations</v>
<v Speaker 19>and that many different strands of</v>

5254
04:48:11.860 --> 04:48:15.910
<v Speaker 19>biological and cultural motivation are</v>
<v Speaker 19>in some sense primary.</v>

5255
04:48:15.911 --> 04:48:20.500
<v Speaker 19>And then what happens is that they come</v>
<v Speaker 19>together to weave a tapestry rather than</v>

5256
04:48:20.501 --> 04:48:24.520
<v Speaker 19>to make the automatic assumption that</v>
<v Speaker 19>you can reduce the entire set of human</v>

5257
04:48:24.521 --> 04:48:27.270
<v Speaker 19>motivations to a single principle like</v>
<v Speaker 19>that power.</v>

5258
04:48:27.490 --> 04:48:29.830
<v Speaker 19>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I would say niche is also responsible to</v>

5259
04:48:29.831 --> 04:48:32.460
<v Speaker 19>some degree for the deconstructionists</v>
<v Speaker 19>claim,</v>

5260
04:48:32.680 --> 04:48:37.680
<v Speaker 19>that it's power because one of his most</v>
<v Speaker 19>famous other instance was that the</v>

5261
04:48:37.800 --> 04:48:41.410
<v Speaker 19>fundamental motivating force in life is</v>
<v Speaker 19>the will to power.</v>

5262
04:48:42.520 --> 04:48:46.390
<v Speaker 19>But he wasn't so much because nature is</v>
<v Speaker 19>a subtle thinker.</v>

5263
04:48:46.420 --> 04:48:50.830
<v Speaker 19>He wasn't so much attempting to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 19>human motivation to power.</v>

5264
04:48:51.280 --> 04:48:56.020
<v Speaker 19>He was attempting to redefine what it</v>
<v Speaker 19>was that we conceptualized as power,</v>

5265
04:48:56.770 --> 04:48:59.530
<v Speaker 19>whereas that isn't what the</v>
<v Speaker 19>deconstruction certainly get all because</v>

5266
04:48:59.531 --> 04:49:01.990
<v Speaker 19>fundamentally they're Marxists and they</v>
<v Speaker 19>believe that,</v>

5267
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:04.330
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>will they just ensconced themselves</v>

5268
04:49:04.331 --> 04:49:09.331
<v Speaker 19>within an economic viewpoint where</v>
<v Speaker 19>within a philosophical viewpoint where</v>

5269
04:49:09.821 --> 04:49:14.821
<v Speaker 19>economics is paramount and where all</v>
<v Speaker 19>that matters is power construed as</v>

5270
04:49:15.730 --> 04:49:19.280
<v Speaker 19>socioeconomic domination,</v>
<v Speaker 19>fundamental,</v>

5271
04:49:19.930 --> 04:49:23.040
<v Speaker 19>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and that's in turn is embedded in</v>

5272
04:49:23.060 --> 04:49:24.550
<v Speaker 19>metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That's even deeper,</v>

5273
04:49:24.551 --> 04:49:27.460
<v Speaker 19>which is the metaphysics of presumed</v>
<v Speaker 19>that people are fundamentally</v>

5274
04:49:27.461 --> 04:49:30.250
<v Speaker 19>materialist and all of those things are</v>
<v Speaker 19>quick.</v>

5275
04:49:30.450 --> 04:49:31.840
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>all of those things are highly</v>

5276
04:49:31.841 --> 04:49:36.841
<v Speaker 19>questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So I'm going to skip ahead a little bit</v>

5277
04:49:48.261 --> 04:49:53.261
<v Speaker 19>with the paragraph when it talks about</v>
<v Speaker 19>the motivations of you might consider</v>

5278
04:49:56.351 --> 04:50:00.030
<v Speaker 19>them</v>
<v Speaker 19>people who were working in the middle</v>

5279
04:50:00.031 --> 04:50:03.630
<v Speaker 19>ranks of bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 19>whether they're scientific or otherwise,</v>

5280
04:50:03.930 --> 04:50:07.440
<v Speaker 19>so they're in some sense acting as</v>
<v Speaker 19>columns in a particular machine.</v>

5281
04:50:07.441 --> 04:50:09.720
<v Speaker 19>And so that's what he's describing here.</v>
<v Speaker 19>He says,</v>

5282
04:50:14.450 --> 04:50:18.500
<v Speaker 19>in the case of scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 19>or in the case of really scientific men,</v>

5283
04:50:20.180 --> 04:50:23.870
<v Speaker 19>it may be there may really be such a</v>
<v Speaker 19>thing as an impulse,</v>

5284
04:50:23.871 --> 04:50:27.470
<v Speaker 19>didn't punch some kind of small</v>
<v Speaker 19>independent clockwork,</v>

5285
04:50:27.500 --> 04:50:32.500
<v Speaker 19>which when well wound up works away</v>
<v Speaker 19>industriously to that end without the</v>

5286
04:50:33.171 --> 04:50:38.171
<v Speaker 19>rest of the scholarly impulses taking</v>
<v Speaker 19>any material part there in the actual</v>

5287
04:50:38.691 --> 04:50:41.840
<v Speaker 19>interests of the scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 19>therefore are generally and quite</v>

5288
04:50:41.841 --> 04:50:46.070
<v Speaker 19>another direction.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It is the family or moneymaking or in</v>

5289
04:50:46.071 --> 04:50:49.040
<v Speaker 19>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It is in fact almost indifferent at what</v>

5290
04:50:49.041 --> 04:50:52.750
<v Speaker 19>point of research his little machine is</v>
<v Speaker 19>placed and whether the hopefully you</v>

5291
04:50:52.760 --> 04:50:56.660
<v Speaker 19>don't worker becomes a good fit.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Ologist someone who's studied the origin</v>

5292
04:50:56.661 --> 04:50:59.060
<v Speaker 19>of words,</v>
<v Speaker 19>a mushroom specialist for a chemist.</v>

5293
04:50:59.300 --> 04:51:01.730
<v Speaker 19>He's not characterize becoming this by</v>
<v Speaker 19>this.</v>

5294
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:04.520
<v Speaker 19>He's not characterized by becoming this</v>
<v Speaker 19>or that</v>

5295
04:51:09.450 --> 04:51:11.940
<v Speaker 19>niches point.</v>
<v Speaker 19>They're fundamentally is that even when</v>

5296
04:51:11.941 --> 04:51:14.280
<v Speaker 19>you do analyze people who in whom</v>

5297
04:51:16.330 --> 04:51:21.330
<v Speaker 19>the will to knowledge might actually be</v>
<v Speaker 19>offered it even though he wouldn't be</v>

5298
04:51:21.461 --> 04:51:25.240
<v Speaker 19>willing to grant it.</v>
<v Speaker 19>The status of highest motivating power</v>

5299
04:51:25.720 --> 04:51:28.960
<v Speaker 19>that even in those people were that</v>
<v Speaker 19>Wilton always does exist.</v>

5300
04:51:28.961 --> 04:51:33.880
<v Speaker 19>The probability that that is in turn</v>
<v Speaker 19>subordinated to some other principle</v>

5301
04:51:34.060 --> 04:51:36.220
<v Speaker 19>that's higher in the value hierarchy is</v>
<v Speaker 19>very,</v>

5302
04:51:36.221 --> 04:51:40.750
<v Speaker 19>very high and it's hard to tell exactly</v>
<v Speaker 19>what that additional principle might be,</v>

5303
04:51:40.751 --> 04:51:44.200
<v Speaker 19>but he points out such things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Maybe they're primarily interested in</v>

5304
04:51:44.201 --> 04:51:46.750
<v Speaker 19>serving the interests of their family or</v>
<v Speaker 19>they're,</v>

5305
04:51:46.890 --> 04:51:50.320
<v Speaker 19>I'm really interested in making money or</v>
<v Speaker 19>maybe they're primarily interested in</v>

5306
04:51:50.321 --> 04:51:53.860
<v Speaker 19>status and maybe they're interested in</v>
<v Speaker 19>status status becomes a because it makes</v>

5307
04:51:53.861 --> 04:51:56.110
<v Speaker 19>them more sexually attractive and that</v>
<v Speaker 19>sort of thing.</v>

5308
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:57.680
<v Speaker 19>So,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but the,</v>

5309
04:51:58.490 --> 04:51:59.323
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5310
04:52:00.430 --> 04:52:05.430
<v Speaker 19>the question of what is it that's</v>
<v Speaker 19>lurking in the background is always</v>

5311
04:52:05.650 --> 04:52:07.870
<v Speaker 19>paramount,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so</v>

5312
04:52:10.010 --> 04:52:11.610
<v Speaker 6>not there.</v>

5313
04:52:15.020 --> 04:52:20.020
<v Speaker 19>Detour in this particular paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 19>whoever considers the fundamental</v>

5314
04:52:24.461 --> 04:52:29.461
<v Speaker 19>impulses of man with a view to</v>
<v Speaker 19>determining how far they may have here</v>

5315
04:52:29.741 --> 04:52:34.741
<v Speaker 19>acted as inspiring Jenai</v>
<v Speaker 19>or his demons will find that they have</v>

5316
04:52:35.921 --> 04:52:40.240
<v Speaker 19>all practice philosophy at one time or</v>
<v Speaker 19>another and then each of them would have</v>

5317
04:52:40.241 --> 04:52:45.241
<v Speaker 19>been only too glad to look upon itself</v>
<v Speaker 19>as the ultimate end of existence and the</v>

5318
04:52:45.611 --> 04:52:48.550
<v Speaker 19>legitimate lord over all of the other</v>
<v Speaker 19>impulses.</v>

5319
04:52:49.500 --> 04:52:54.500
<v Speaker 19>That's another like the beyond good and</v>
<v Speaker 19>evil to think of it as a book is a</v>

5320
04:52:54.701 --> 04:52:56.080
<v Speaker 19>really foolish</v>

5321
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:03.480
<v Speaker 19>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You don't [inaudible] this is what a</v>

5322
04:53:03.481 --> 04:53:07.190
<v Speaker 19>book is when people think about a book.</v>
<v Speaker 19>No,</v>

5323
04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:12.230
<v Speaker 19>it's like a material entity say eight</v>
<v Speaker 19>inches high and six inches wide and two</v>

5324
04:53:13.681 --> 04:53:17.490
<v Speaker 19>inches thick and weighs a pound and it's</v>
<v Speaker 19>made of paper and it's between two to</v>

5325
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:22.440
<v Speaker 19>two covers you and that's a materialist.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That's the eight priority sort of</v>

5326
04:53:22.441 --> 04:53:27.441
<v Speaker 19>axiomatic book niches beyond good and</v>
<v Speaker 19>evil isn't a book at all.</v>

5327
04:53:28.771 --> 04:53:33.771
<v Speaker 19>It's a series of bombs at each sentence</v>
<v Speaker 19>is a ball and each sentence blows things</v>

5328
04:53:35.731 --> 04:53:39.690
<v Speaker 19>up that people don't even know exist.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so one of the things with this</v>

5329
04:53:39.691 --> 04:53:40.770
<v Speaker 19>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 19>for example,</v>

5330
04:53:41.550 --> 04:53:46.550
<v Speaker 19>here's how he's conceptualizing being so</v>
<v Speaker 19>the first thing he talks about is that</v>

5331
04:53:47.550 --> 04:53:49.910
<v Speaker 19>the.</v>
<v Speaker 19>There are fundamental impulses that you</v>

5332
04:53:49.920 --> 04:53:51.510
<v Speaker 19>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

5333
04:53:51.511 --> 04:53:53.800
<v Speaker 19>So that begs the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 19>What?</v>

5334
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:57.330
<v Speaker 19>What do you mean by impulse and what do</v>
<v Speaker 19>you mean by fundamental?</v>

5335
04:53:58.410 --> 04:54:01.800
<v Speaker 19>And both of those are extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 19>complicated problems.</v>

5336
04:54:01.950 --> 04:54:05.190
<v Speaker 19>So an impulse you can take it to the</v>
<v Speaker 19>impulses that drive.</v>

5337
04:54:05.940 --> 04:54:08.040
<v Speaker 19>You can think about it as a biological</v>
<v Speaker 19>instinct.</v>

5338
04:54:09.460 --> 04:54:11.640
<v Speaker 19>He could think about it as an aim or a</v>
<v Speaker 19>goal.</v>

5339
04:54:12.000 --> 04:54:13.890
<v Speaker 19>You can think about it as an act of</v>
<v Speaker 19>will.</v>

5340
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:18.810
<v Speaker 19>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 19>there's endless questions that hang off</v>

5341
04:54:18.811 --> 04:54:21.810
<v Speaker 19>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but we could start with the idea that we</v>

5342
04:54:22.830 --> 04:54:25.860
<v Speaker 19>perhaps can't define it,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but we are willing to go with the</v>

5343
04:54:25.861 --> 04:54:29.640
<v Speaker 19>proposition that people do have the</v>
<v Speaker 19>impulses and I think maybe that's</v>

5344
04:54:29.641 --> 04:54:33.840
<v Speaker 19>manifest to you more.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Most particularly when you're attempting</v>

5345
04:54:33.841 --> 04:54:38.841
<v Speaker 19>to do something voluntarily and</v>
<v Speaker 19>something in voluntarily interferes with</v>

5346
04:54:39.511 --> 04:54:40.261
<v Speaker 19>that.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>

5347
04:54:40.261 --> 04:54:45.180
<v Speaker 19>so maybe you're sitting down to to try</v>
<v Speaker 19>to get some work done in the work is not</v>

5348
04:54:45.181 --> 04:54:49.500
<v Speaker 19>of any particular intrinsic interest,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but you regarded it as necessary.</v>

5349
04:54:49.770 --> 04:54:52.170
<v Speaker 19>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 19>necessary element in some higher order</v>

5350
04:54:52.171 --> 04:54:54.780
<v Speaker 19>scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so you're attempting to organize</v>

5351
04:54:54.781 --> 04:54:59.370
<v Speaker 19>yourself so you will in fact concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 19>on that particular relatively mundane</v>

5352
04:54:59.371 --> 04:55:00.204
<v Speaker 19>activity.</v>

5353
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:03.960
<v Speaker 19>But what you find when you sit down to</v>
<v Speaker 19>actually engage in that is you can't do</v>

5354
04:55:03.961 --> 04:55:06.960
<v Speaker 19>it.</v>
<v Speaker 19>You have to go do the dishes or you have</v>

5355
04:55:06.961 --> 04:55:11.490
<v Speaker 19>to clean under the bed or you have to</v>
<v Speaker 19>have a sexual fantasy or you or.</v>

5356
04:55:11.550 --> 04:55:14.310
<v Speaker 19>Or there's some other thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 19>could do that's useful.</v>

5357
04:55:14.311 --> 04:55:17.850
<v Speaker 19>But that you wouldn't normally do that</v>
<v Speaker 19>you'll go do instead or that you fall</v>

5358
04:55:17.851 --> 04:55:22.230
<v Speaker 19>asleep or that you get hungry or like</v>
<v Speaker 19>there's an endless number of that's</v>

5359
04:55:22.231 --> 04:55:27.231
<v Speaker 19>called them impulses that might arise to</v>
<v Speaker 19>interfere with your conscious movement</v>

5360
04:55:27.361 --> 04:55:28.370
<v Speaker 19>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>

5361
04:55:28.500 --> 04:55:31.280
<v Speaker 19>exactly what are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>

5362
04:55:31.320 --> 04:55:36.320
<v Speaker 19>nature certainly conceptualizes the</v>
<v Speaker 19>human being as a place where those</v>

5363
04:55:37.171 --> 04:55:42.060
<v Speaker 19>things live and he does mean live too</v>
<v Speaker 19>because it wouldn't refer to the Ms Dot</v>

5364
04:55:42.060 --> 04:55:47.060
<v Speaker 19>d dot demons or or gs without</v>
<v Speaker 19>introducing the metaphoric conception of</v>

5365
04:55:48.541 --> 04:55:51.450
<v Speaker 19>something that lives.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And so partly what nature reveals in</v>

5366
04:55:51.451 --> 04:55:54.120
<v Speaker 19>those sentences that he conceptualized</v>
<v Speaker 19>as a human being,</v>

5367
04:55:54.121 --> 04:55:58.140
<v Speaker 19>as the dwelling place of spirits.</v>

5368
04:55:59.700 --> 04:56:03.270
<v Speaker 19>And some of them are genie.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Let's say that's the root word of</v>

5369
04:56:03.271 --> 04:56:06.120
<v Speaker 19>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 19>That's the terribly powerful thing that</v>

5370
04:56:06.121 --> 04:56:08.660
<v Speaker 19>exists in the terribly small</v>
<v Speaker 19>compartment,</v>

5371
04:56:08.720 --> 04:56:10.260
<v Speaker 19>right,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that you have to call forth.</v>

5372
04:56:10.440 --> 04:56:14.010
<v Speaker 19>And some of them are demons and demons</v>
<v Speaker 19>are things that have their own</v>

5373
04:56:14.011 --> 04:56:17.250
<v Speaker 19>autonomous will and the generally aren't</v>
<v Speaker 19>aiming for the good.</v>

5374
04:56:18.540 --> 04:56:20.550
<v Speaker 19>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 19>so those are all things need.</v>

5375
04:56:20.551 --> 04:56:23.460
<v Speaker 19>She just lays out as implicit parts of</v>
<v Speaker 19>the sentence.</v>

5376
04:56:23.461 --> 04:56:26.760
<v Speaker 19>So we activates all those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 19>whether you know it or not,</v>

5377
04:56:26.970 --> 04:56:29.190
<v Speaker 19>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 19>to the degree that you processed the</v>

5378
04:56:29.191 --> 04:56:32.460
<v Speaker 19>sentence and those things start to take</v>
<v Speaker 19>on a life of virtue of their own,</v>

5379
04:56:32.461 --> 04:56:35.010
<v Speaker 19>those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and so</v>

5380
04:56:37.410 --> 04:56:40.920
<v Speaker 19>then he adds another dimension of</v>
<v Speaker 19>complexity to that by saying,</v>

5381
04:56:41.680 --> 04:56:43.500
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>you're full of demons in</v>

5382
04:56:43.640 --> 04:56:47.130
<v Speaker 6>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and gds and</v>

5383
04:56:48.240 --> 04:56:51.360
<v Speaker 19>they're all doing their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 19>whatever that happens to be,</v>

5384
04:56:52.140 --> 04:56:55.920
<v Speaker 19>but each of them,</v>
<v Speaker 19>if left to their own devices,</v>

5385
04:56:55.921 --> 04:56:59.430
<v Speaker 19>would attempt to remake the entire world</v>
<v Speaker 19>in there</v>

5386
04:57:01.020 --> 04:57:01.853
<v Speaker 6>form.</v>

5387
04:57:02.820 --> 04:57:04.390
<v Speaker 19>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 19>I,</v>

5388
04:57:04.440 --> 04:57:09.440
<v Speaker 19>I thought this from a,</v>
<v Speaker 19>from a narrative point of view or from a</v>

5389
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:11.230
<v Speaker 19>symbolic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 19>in,</v>

5390
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:12.150
<v Speaker 19>in,</v>
<v Speaker 19>in,</v>

5391
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:14.270
<v Speaker 19>in old stories and folktales and</v>
<v Speaker 19>fairytales,</v>

5392
04:57:14.370 --> 04:57:15.510
<v Speaker 19>you often have a</v>

5393
04:57:17.530 --> 04:57:18.460
<v Speaker 6>cyclops</v>

5394
04:57:19.620 --> 04:57:23.580
<v Speaker 19>one I giants,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and there's a sexual connotation to that</v>

5395
04:57:24.930 --> 04:57:27.900
<v Speaker 19>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 19>which is apropos that the psychoanalysts</v>

5396
04:57:27.901 --> 04:57:29.880
<v Speaker 19>would,</v>
<v Speaker 19>would certainly point out.</v>

5397
04:57:29.940 --> 04:57:34.940
<v Speaker 19>But the one idea is that this thing is</v>
<v Speaker 19>gigantic wants one thing.</v>

5398
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:41.470
<v Speaker 19>And so that's another way that Nietzsche</v>
<v Speaker 19>is conceptualizing the fundamental</v>

5399
04:57:44.800 --> 04:57:49.060
<v Speaker 19>structure of the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 19>It's a dwelling place full of one I</v>

5400
04:57:49.130 --> 04:57:51.580
<v Speaker 19>giants.</v>
<v Speaker 19>And they're constantly.</v>

5401
04:57:51.850 --> 04:57:52.600
<v Speaker 19>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>one thing,</v>

5402
04:57:52.600 --> 04:57:55.060
<v Speaker 19>one way of looking at is they're</v>
<v Speaker 19>constantly at war.</v>

5403
04:57:55.360 --> 04:57:59.050
<v Speaker 19>One of them wants to be the largest one.</v>
<v Speaker 19>I giant and dominate everything else.</v>

5404
04:57:59.140 --> 04:58:02.530
<v Speaker 19>Then one of the things that so Nietzsche</v>
<v Speaker 19>thinks that argument further and he</v>

5405
04:58:02.531 --> 04:58:05.350
<v Speaker 19>says,</v>
<v Speaker 19>not only is this always happening in</v>

5406
04:58:05.351 --> 04:58:08.230
<v Speaker 19>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but then if you look at philosophy,</v>

5407
04:58:08.290 --> 04:58:13.290
<v Speaker 19>what it is is it's a continual</v>
<v Speaker 19>revelation of the attempt of some</v>

5408
04:58:13.630 --> 04:58:18.630
<v Speaker 19>singular minded psychic monster</v>
<v Speaker 19>psychological monster to dominate the</v>

5409
04:58:19.811 --> 04:58:24.220
<v Speaker 19>entire psychological structure that are</v>
<v Speaker 19>for the entire cultural structure and</v>

5410
04:58:24.221 --> 04:58:26.080
<v Speaker 19>therefore the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and then you can.</v>

5411
04:58:26.350 --> 04:58:31.350
<v Speaker 19>You can see in that the entire religious</v>
<v Speaker 19>structure struggle of mankind to take</v>

5412
04:58:33.130 --> 04:58:38.130
<v Speaker 19>this vast polytheistic vision of reality</v>
<v Speaker 19>and to organize it into some sort of</v>

5413
04:58:40.841 --> 04:58:45.070
<v Speaker 19>monotheistic,</v>
<v Speaker 19>an integrated structure which you could</v>

5414
04:58:45.071 --> 04:58:49.780
<v Speaker 19>also consider indistinguishable from the</v>
<v Speaker 19>civilizing.</v>

5415
04:58:50.020 --> 04:58:54.850
<v Speaker 19>The impulse that operates in human</v>
<v Speaker 19>beings to become civilized.</v>

5416
04:58:55.360 --> 04:58:59.170
<v Speaker 19>Because on the one hand it might be a</v>
<v Speaker 19>terrible thing that one,</v>

5417
04:58:59.190 --> 04:59:02.530
<v Speaker 19>one monster emerges to attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 19>dominate all the others.</v>

5418
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:05.260
<v Speaker 19>But then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 19>there's no difference between that and</v>

5419
04:59:05.261 --> 04:59:07.990
<v Speaker 19>organizing something.</v>
<v Speaker 19>Because to organize something is to</v>

5420
04:59:07.991 --> 04:59:12.991
<v Speaker 19>bring it all into a hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 19>structure with some sort of singular</v>

5421
04:59:13.121 --> 04:59:16.960
<v Speaker 19>value at the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and then the question might be,</v>

5422
04:59:16.961 --> 04:59:18.880
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>what should that singular value be?</v>

5423
04:59:19.450 --> 04:59:23.650
<v Speaker 19>And then niche you would that pis at the</v>
<v Speaker 19>whole argument back into the first</v>

5424
04:59:23.651 --> 04:59:25.780
<v Speaker 19>sentences that he wrote at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 19>of the paragraph,</v>

5425
04:59:25.781 --> 04:59:27.160
<v Speaker 19>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>

5426
04:59:27.610 --> 04:59:31.540
<v Speaker 19>what is it that the philosophers up to?</v>
<v Speaker 19>What is the force that he surfing?</v>

5427
04:59:31.930 --> 04:59:34.900
<v Speaker 19>What is the unifying impulse?</v>
<v Speaker 19>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

5428
04:59:34.901 --> 04:59:38.740
<v Speaker 19>If there's a unifying impulse and he's</v>
<v Speaker 19>not only fallen prey to some internal</v>

5429
04:59:38.770 --> 04:59:41.810
<v Speaker 19>demon,</v>
<v Speaker 19>if there's a unifying impulse to bring</v>

5430
04:59:41.811 --> 04:59:45.740
<v Speaker 19>all of this together into some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 19>functional structure,</v>

5431
04:59:45.741 --> 04:59:47.510
<v Speaker 19>what exactly might that look like?</v>

5432
04:59:51.390 --> 04:59:55.290
<v Speaker 19>For every impulse is imperious and as</v>
<v Speaker 19>such attempts to philosophize.</v>

5433
04:59:55.540 --> 05:00:00.540
<v Speaker 19>That's part of that sort of niches,</v>
<v Speaker 19>idea of will to power in its nascent</v>

5434
05:00:02.851 --> 05:00:07.851
<v Speaker 19>form.</v>
<v Speaker 19>All of these unconscious entities that</v>

5435
05:00:08.490 --> 05:00:12.750
<v Speaker 19>inhabit the human psyche are all alive</v>
<v Speaker 19>and they're trying to live.</v>

5436
05:00:12.751 --> 05:00:15.630
<v Speaker 19>They're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 19>They're trying to climb up the dominance</v>

5437
05:00:15.631 --> 05:00:17.610
<v Speaker 19>hierarchy and dominate because of</v>
<v Speaker 19>course,</v>

5438
05:00:17.611 --> 05:00:21.810
<v Speaker 19>that's partly what life does because</v>
<v Speaker 19>let's say from an evolutionary</v>

5439
05:00:21.811 --> 05:00:25.740
<v Speaker 19>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and this is probably more true for males</v>

5440
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:30.830
<v Speaker 19>because they are less</v>
<v Speaker 19>effective in their attempts to replicate</v>

5441
05:00:33.300 --> 05:00:37.110
<v Speaker 19>the distinction between climbing up a</v>
<v Speaker 19>dominance hierarchy.</v>

5442
05:00:37.120 --> 05:00:40.230
<v Speaker 19>Whatever that might happen to be and</v>
<v Speaker 19>success is.</v>

5443
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:45.450
<v Speaker 19>There may be no distinction at all,</v>
<v Speaker 19>and then you might say,</v>

5444
05:00:45.451 --> 05:00:47.160
<v Speaker 19>well,</v>
<v Speaker 19>that just shows that there's nothing but</v>

5445
05:00:47.161 --> 05:00:47.450
<v Speaker 19>we'll</v>

5446
05:00:47.450 --> 05:00:48.890
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

5447
05:00:50.630 --> 05:00:53.810
<v Speaker 19>that still doesn't answer.</v>
<v Speaker 19>One of the most fundamental questions is</v>

5448
05:00:53.811 --> 05:00:58.811
<v Speaker 19>that power in relationship to what?</v>
<v Speaker 19>Because that's the question.</v>
