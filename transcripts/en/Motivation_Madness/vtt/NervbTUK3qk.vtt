1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 2>truth of the matter is that most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't realize that the majority of</v>

3
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:17.681
<v Speaker 2>people or suffer the first major heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack on Monday morning between 8:00 AM</v>

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 2>and 9:00 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting ready to go to jobs that</v>

5
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 2>they don't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs that are making them sick.</v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you could love doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week that will bring a</v>

7
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 2>smile to your face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to start saying yes to your</v>

8
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to start saying yes to your</v>

9
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 2>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes to your unfolding future.</v>

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes to your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 2>every year I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my year,</v>

12
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>but ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one good year won't be enough for me.</v>

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>How many of you could use a good decade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hands,</v>

14
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's what I want to do.</v>

16
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to share with you how you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>begin to make this your decade.</v>

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 2>How many of you know within yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask yourself the question,</v>

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 2>have I done all that I am capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing or being in living up to my</v>

19
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 2>potential?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have to really add,</v>

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>enter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

21
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I have not done all that I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hands please.</v>

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

23
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what we know that people don't do</v>

24
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 2>what they know in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they do is they operate within</v>

25
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 2>the context of the vision they have of</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to share with you is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin to get a larger vision of</v>

27
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>yourself and how to begin to make this</v>
<v Speaker 2>your decade.</v>

28
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Because in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very challenging.</v>

29
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's going to require a lot of work on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your part,</v>

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 2>an ongoing process of personal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional self mastery,</v>

31
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to require that you began</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see yourself worthy of the</v>

32
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 2>requirements in terms of effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of commitment,</v>

33
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 2>in terms of action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of preparation or whatever it</v>

34
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 2>is that you need to do in order to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life where you want to take it.</v>

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>So one of the first things I asked you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is I want you to look at your life</v>

36
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>right now and think about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important to you.</v>

37
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Something that gives your life a sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of value.</v>

38
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Think about something that you'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have or something that you'd like to</v>

39
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 2>create for you or your family or for</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

40
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Once you hold this thought in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

41
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things I want you to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is don't worry about the inner</v>

42
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 2>conversation that you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about how you're going to do</v>

43
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to come.</v>

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>You're going to develop a plan of</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

45
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 2>You will find the way you will become</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of person that can attract the</v>

46
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resources and everything you need in</v>

47
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 2>order to make that become reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want you to be mindful of your</v>

48
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>inner conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember once I was sitting in an</v>

49
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 2>audience and Zig Ziglar who I consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest motivational</v>

50
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>speakers on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was giving a speech and I was out in</v>

51
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 2>the audience and I saw him going back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth and within myself.</v>

52
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do that.</v>

53
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I leaned over to the guy next to me.</v>

54
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do they pay him to do that?</v>

55
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,000.</v>

56
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I can do that.</v>

57
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>And I admired him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the way when I was driving</v>

58
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>from Tampa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida back to Miami for my inner</v>

59
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 2>conversation kicked in and it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Les Brown,</v>

60
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a college education.</v>

61
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>Les Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

62
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the contacts.</v>

63
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 2>You've never worked for a major</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation.</v>

64
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>What makes you think that you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>more in one hour talking then you've</v>

65
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>made working for a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you a question.</v>

66
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>How many of you ever thought about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you wanted to do and you talk</v>

67
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>you out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hand please.</v>

68
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>That inner conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

69
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 2>is the reason that most people take</v>
<v Speaker 2>their greatness,</v>

70
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>take their ideas to the graveyard with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

71
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealthiest place on the planet of</v>

72
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>minister said recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so true.</v>

73
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not the gold mines and the various</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of the world or the diamond mines.</v>

74
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 2>The wealthiest place on the planet is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the graveyard.</v>

75
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Because in the graveyard we will find</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventions that we never,</v>

76
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>ever were exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

77
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 2>dreams that never became reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopes and aspirations that were never</v>

78
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:07.561
<v Speaker 2>acted upon because most people allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>that inner conversation for whatever</v>

79
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the keep them from ever pursuing their</v>

80
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let us begin to look at what's</v>

81
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 2>required in order to to make this our</v>
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>

82
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that most people don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach their goals or live up to their</v>

83
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 2>true potential?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is fear</v>

84
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 2>and there are only two kinds of fears</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're born with the fear of falling</v>

85
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 2>and the fear of a loud sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the fears we learn like the fear</v>

86
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 2>of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next is the fear of success.</v>

87
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>As one of the major challenges I had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with,</v>

88
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I was working on a major project and</v>
<v Speaker 2>after it began to grow and it was</v>

89
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>extremely successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I panicked and I walked away from and</v>

90
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>then gave it to someone else because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't believe that I could handle it.</v>

91
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that keeps most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from reaching their goals so that a lot</v>

92
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 2>of people become comfortable,</v>

93
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>they stop growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stop wanting anything,</v>

94
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>they become satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stop looking at ways in which they</v>

95
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>can improve themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped putting things in front of</v>

96
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something by a great man,</v>

97
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 2>George Bernard Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said something to the effect that</v>

98
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 2>to have succeeded as to have finished</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones business on earth,</v>

99
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 2>like the male spider who was killed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female spider.</v>

100
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>The moment he has succeeded in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>courtship and he's.</v>

101
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:36.831
<v Speaker 2>It goes on to say I like a state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual becoming with a goal in front</v>

102
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 2>and not behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember after giving a speech at a</v>

103
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>major corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gentleman came up to me,</v>

104
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 2>he was up in years and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 2>that's real great motivation for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>young guys,</v>

106
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 2>but I've done all my work is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>else for me to do.</v>

107
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

108
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you've got a lot to give.</v>

109
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that still here means that your</v>

110
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>business is not through yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that keeps us from</v>

111
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:08.021
<v Speaker 2>reaching our goal is not feeling worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where a lot of people get stuck</v>

112
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>because see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't feel worthy of your goal,</v>

113
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you will begin to unconsciously engage</v>
<v Speaker 2>in self destructive behavior like</v>

114
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>procrastinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly putting things off,</v>

115
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 2>squandering your time and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is made up.</v>

116
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Something else that keeps us from</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching our goal and that is many times</v>

117
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:36.251
<v Speaker 2>because we spend so much time</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining and blaming everybody or</v>

118
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.400
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reminded of a friend of mine who</v>

119
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>talked about the fact that one day he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was walking by this house and some</v>

120
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 2>people sitting on a porch and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog on the porch and this dog was just</v>

121
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 2>moaning and groaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was curious and he asked the</v>

122
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>honest said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this dog moaning and groaning and</v>

123
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 2>the owners that because he's laying on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nail,</v>

124
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.211
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

125
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't he get all his is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting bad enough for him to get off?</v>

126
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 2>How many of you know people will moan</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Groan and complain about life all</v>

127
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

128
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 2>They might Moan and Groan about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

129
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of you,</v>

130
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.760
<v Speaker 2>and they just Moan and Groan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>complain all the time and never do</v>

131
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't gotten to the point where</v>

132
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 2>they're sick and tired of being sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>

133
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 2>They just have enough energy to complain</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and they consider that they in</v>

134
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe that that's equivalent to</v>

135
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 2>doing something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just complaining.</v>

136
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can get you where you want to go.</v>

137
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 2>That cannot create your reality for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that keep most people</v>

138
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 2>from realizing their true greatness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their true potential circumstances,</v>

139
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 2>their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many people who believe</v>

140
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>because of where they're born because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the area where they are in life and</v>

141
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 2>where they find themselves.</v>

142
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 2>That's all they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given my circumstances,</v>

143
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing</v>

144
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

145
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I know something about you even not</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing you that you've got greatness</v>

146
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 2>within you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the ability to do things that</v>

147
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't even begin to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have talents and skills in you that</v>

148
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you haven't even began to reach for yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one could have convinced me,</v>

149
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>given my circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given my background,</v>

150
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that I would be doing what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

151
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I was born in Liberty City on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 62nd street,</v>

152
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 2>my twin brother and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were six weeks of age,</v>

153
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 2>we were adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in fifth grade,</v>

154
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I was identified as Emr labeled</v>
<v Speaker 2>educable,</v>

155
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>mentally retarded and put back from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth grade into the fourth grade and</v>

156
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>stayed in that category until I got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of high school.</v>

157
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I have no college training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's what happened.</v>

158
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I had an intervention in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man who saw something in me at a time</v>

159
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that I did not see something in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never forget being in his one day</v>

160
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>waiting on a friend of mine who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>there to rehearse for play.</v>

161
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>He did not show up and he asked me to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to the board and write something on</v>

162
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>the board and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that,</v>

163
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:05.791
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

164
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:07.090
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

165
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.123
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

166
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a special education class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

167
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

168
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>go up to the board and write what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to tell you.</v>

169
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that,</v>

170
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:20.301
<v Speaker 2>so why not educable mentally retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he came from behind his desk.</v>

171
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ever say that again.</v>

172
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Someone's opinion of you does not have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become your reality,</v>

173
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 2>and that changed my life.</v>

174
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that once a person's mind is expanded</v>

175
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 2>with an idea or concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can never be satisfied to going back</v>

176
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>to where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of you are going to experience a</v>

177
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you are going to go back and</v>

178
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 2>look at your dreams and brush them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you are going to begin to look</v>

179
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>at yourself and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

180
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 2>look here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I have not done all that I can do</v>

181
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever goal that you have in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that to be a goal that will</v>

182
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>challenge you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that will make you stretch.</v>

183
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 2>It was osborne who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you attempt to do something</v>

184
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>beyond that which you've already</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastered,</v>

185
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you will never grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you looked at at some</v>

186
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>point in time when you decided that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do it,</v>

187
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that you talk yourself out of it?</v>

188
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back out there,</v>

189
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 2>how you going to do it that will come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in due time so you don't get in life</v>

190
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

191
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 2>you get in life what you are not what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

192
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and see the good news is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>always become more by working to develop</v>

193
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first process of making this your</v>

194
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 2>decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to begin to take a look at</v>

195
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>your life and look at where are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

196
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>What are your strengths?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are your weaknesses?</v>

197
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 2>What gives your life a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment,</v>

198
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>a sense of joy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does a full rich life means to you?</v>

199
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you could love doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week that are bringing a</v>

200
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:49.521
<v Speaker 2>smile to your face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that and all the areas of</v>

201
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your professional life,</v>

202
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 2>your personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family life,</v>

203
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.390
<v Speaker 2>your spiritual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you'd like to have?</v>

204
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Once you begin to determine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes you to the next step,</v>

205
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 2>and that is once you decide what it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want,</v>

206
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 2>now you've got to decide that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve that.</v>

207
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Repeat after me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

208
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I deserve the best that life has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>offer.</v>

209
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 2>I deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Define my purpose in life.</v>

210
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Shake somebody's hand on your right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and say,</v>

211
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:25.404
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're perfect.</v>

212
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you know by actively pursuing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose,</v>

213
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.510
<v Speaker 2>it could perhaps extend your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number one killer in this country of</v>

214
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 2>all the diseases we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease,</v>

215
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>that's the number one killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you asked most people what is it</v>

216
00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 2>that that the majority of people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>their first harm tag.</v>

217
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Some people will tell you as a result of</v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity or smoking cigarettes or high</v>

218
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol or high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of those are contributing</v>

219
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

220
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 3>the truth of the matter is that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't realize that the majority</v>

221
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:14.611
<v Speaker 3>of people suffer the first major heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack on Monday morning between 8:00 AM</v>

222
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>and 9:00 AM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People getting ready to go to jobs that</v>

223
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 3>they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs that are making them sick.</v>

224
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not pursuing your goal,</v>

225
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 3>you are literally committing spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

226
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 3>When you have some goal out here that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stretching for and reaching for,</v>

227
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that takes you out of your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll find out some talents and</v>

228
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 3>abilities you have that you didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have.</v>

229
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I started speaking just to elementary</v>
<v Speaker 3>school kids because I knew they didn't</v>

230
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:49.531
<v Speaker 3>know what I was talking about and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me all God is that we lack Yo.</v>

231
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I graduated up to junior high</v>

232
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 3>school and then the senior high school</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then to various community groups and</v>

233
00:12:56.501 --> 00:13:01.010
<v Speaker 3>church groups and civic associations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the colleges and to businesses non</v>

234
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 3>traveling across the country and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling nationally and</v>

235
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 3>internationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never would have discovered what</v>

236
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to do right now if I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to take a track chance and</v>

237
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to believe in yourself.</v>

238
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 3>I was doing work for a major corporation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were having a major downsizing</v>

239
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.960
<v Speaker 3>because that's another terminology for</v>
<v Speaker 3>major fairings and so the people that</v>

240
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 3>were working there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they approached them and said,</v>

241
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are eligible for early retirement.</v>

242
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.750
<v Speaker 3>We will give you a buyout package of</v>
<v Speaker 3>$300,000 if you take it within this time</v>

243
00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 3>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

244
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 3>after this timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we have the downsizing,</v>

245
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.470
<v Speaker 3>you might be among the people cut and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will lose all of the benefits that</v>

246
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about right now and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most you can get us two weeks severance</v>

247
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.050
<v Speaker 3>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

248
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 3>only 50 percent of the people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>eligible.</v>

249
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Tuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

250
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 3>If I'd been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have gone to ask for your check.</v>

251
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Less than Marvin told me to get his</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackie's home with</v>

252
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Mama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank.</v>

253
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I would have taken that money so quick</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had other people checks less.</v>

254
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Got Your check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

255
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:29.000
<v Speaker 3>life is too short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to pledge.</v>

256
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Save is too short and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being miserable.</v>

257
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.480
<v Speaker 3>It's too sharp for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

258
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.440
<v Speaker 3>there's no safe position in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you why it's a quiet secret</v>

259
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:44.250
<v Speaker 3>that most people don't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get out of life alive.</v>

260
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't get out of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no safe position you can in</v>

261
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.190
<v Speaker 3>the bleachers or you could die on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

262
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 3>You might as well come out on the field</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Hamilton.</v>

263
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

264
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.430
<v Speaker 3>You want to make this your decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to decide to be bold,</v>

265
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.360
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to be bold in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to take life on.</v>

266
00:15:12.361 --> 00:15:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was at a major corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to give a presentation and there</v>

267
00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 3>were two guys sitting across from me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy said to the other fellow,</v>

268
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.860
<v Speaker 3>looking at the last two finalists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that involved my firm and their firm</v>

269
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

270
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.970
<v Speaker 3>looking at the credentials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy doesn't have any credentials.</v>

271
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.450
<v Speaker 3>We have an advantage here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got two phds between us.</v>

272
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I got up and I went in the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>start talking to myself.</v>

273
00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:34.200
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's round.</v>

274
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.370
<v Speaker 3>What do you care about their two phd's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have six children</v>

275
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.040
<v Speaker 3>and a mama to take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went in that meeting and first of</v>

276
00:15:44.041 --> 00:15:45.600
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went at walking bowl,</v>

277
00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Speaker 3>looking good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling good and smelling good.</v>

278
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

279
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Is that tape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we started negotiating and operate</v>

280
00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:02.530
<v Speaker 3>in a spirit of absolute certainty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at them as if the only reason</v>

281
00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:04.690
<v Speaker 3>that they were born was to give me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract.</v>

282
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Speaker 3>They survived one out of 9 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>sperms to carry out this transaction.</v>

283
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And I got the contract.</v>

284
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

285
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Got</v>

286
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Most people go through life trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>creep.</v>

287
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.541
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

288
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:24.490
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to be casual about it.</v>

289
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:25.211
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

290
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:26.980
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go for live being casual.</v>

291
00:16:26.981 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 3>You'll end up a casualty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

292
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be bold in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to take life on.</v>

293
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's something else you must be</v>

294
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

295
00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.530
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when things don't happen,</v>

296
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 3>when they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to happen,</v>

297
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.890
<v Speaker 3>they become negative and they turn out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stop projecting a lot of negative</v>

298
00:16:44.891 --> 00:16:46.050
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

299
00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:47.620
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to make a conscious,</v>

300
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:49.720
<v Speaker 3>deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>determined effort to be positive.</v>

301
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Because see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know within yourself,</v>

302
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:53.380
<v Speaker 3>things are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work out for you.</v>

303
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.090
<v Speaker 3>When you will know within yourself that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some way somehow you're going to make</v>

304
00:16:58.091 --> 00:16:59.380
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just some,</v>

305
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 3>these are just some of the hoops you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to flip through in order to get</v>

306
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:03.340
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

307
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who went to get a job</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people didn't hire me.</v>

308
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:09.270
<v Speaker 3>He was so negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well to hell with you then.</v>

309
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:09.811
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

310
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just don't have a job that</v>

311
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.720
<v Speaker 3>don't burn your bridges behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

312
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.490
<v Speaker 3>talk about the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mama.</v>

313
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to reach your goal and have</v>

314
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:28.360
<v Speaker 3>a competitive edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be hungry.</v>

315
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.660
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people love me to tell this</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

316
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:33.250
<v Speaker 3>When I got out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

317
00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:37.720
<v Speaker 3>my first major goal was to buy my mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>a home in my hero in broadcasting was</v>

318
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Paul Harvey and I wanted to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in broadcasting and I love the</v>

319
00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:44.410
<v Speaker 3>disc jockeys that were on the air and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to become a disc jockey and Mr</v>

320
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Washington said something to me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget who was my mentor in</v>

321
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Highschool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repeat this.</v>

322
00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Whitney is his quote,</v>

323
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.070
<v Speaker 2>it's better to be prepared</v>
<v Speaker 2>for an opportunity and not have one than</v>

324
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 2>to have an opportunity and not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared.</v>

325
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 2>So I started working to develop my</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication skills and expand my</v>

326
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started visualizing myself being a</v>

327
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>disc jockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw myself on there having a talk show</v>

328
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 2>and playing records and people listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

329
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>That was my vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my dream.</v>

330
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I held that in mind constantly and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would practice all the time.</v>

331
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Practice makes what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not this,</v>

332
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dislodge that from your mind.</v>

333
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Practice only makes improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfection doesn't exist.</v>

334
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 2>They need to take it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictionary.</v>

335
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist.</v>

336
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Practice only makes improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can always better your best.</v>

337
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>You have not done your best work yet as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long as you're here,</v>

338
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 2>you have a chance to transcend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't believe in perfection.</v>

339
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't exist.</v>

340
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 2>It only makes improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would practice,</v>

341
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice everyday,</v>

342
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>

343
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 2>And finally I went over to this radio</v>
<v Speaker 2>station asking God for job and Mr</v>

344
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Birdwell and I said,</v>

345
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Like to get a job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working on Miami beach at at the</v>

346
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Fontainebleau hotel at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jackie gleason and June Taylor</v>

347
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 2>dancers were famous and my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>program on television,</v>

348
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 2>most people would not remember John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barris for Tipton.</v>

349
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How many of you remember that protocol?</v>

351
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The millionaire.</v>

352
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 2>That was my favorite program on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

353
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 2>If this is my fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 2>and every time we would drive from Bondi</v>
<v Speaker 2>beach,</v>

355
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I would fantasize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

356
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the house where I give him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

357
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm my by my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That home over there.</v>

358
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's my fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went up to visit butterball and he</v>

359
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have any radio experience?</v>

360
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.603
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sir,</v>

361
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.680
<v Speaker 2>you have any background in journalism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

362
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.690
<v Speaker 2>no sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

363
00:19:29.691 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but I could never get experience if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give me the opportunity.</v>

364
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I've been practicing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

365
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry we don't have any job for you.</v>

366
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you sir.</v>

367
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know my reasons for being</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

368
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 2>My reason why I wanted to use radios</v>
<v Speaker 2>have means to earn the money to buy my</v>

369
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 2>mother a home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back to the radio station again.</v>

370
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you doing Mr Butterball?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did Not tell you.</v>

375
00:19:52.721 --> 00:19:54.320

<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

376
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.340
<v Speaker 2>But I thought maybe somebody got fired</v>
<v Speaker 2>or resigned.</v>

377
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.174
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

378
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I went the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you doing this to butterball?</v>

379
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.140
<v Speaker 2>He said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just didn't take it personally.</v>

00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:08.320
<v Speaker 2>How you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you all have any jobs in there?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yesterday and the day before.</v>

382
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have any work while I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe somebody died so I didn't know.</v>

383
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went the next day,</v>

384
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 2>showed up like nothing was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw him for the first time.</v>

385
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.770
<v Speaker 2>How you doing Mr Butterball y'all have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

386
00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why make yourself useful?</v>

387
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Go get me some food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

388
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 2>yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See many times when you want more,</v>

389
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be willing to pay your</v>
<v Speaker 2>dues,</v>

390
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>so I became the errand boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and we'll get their lunch and</v>

391
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.630
<v Speaker 2>their dinner and all kinds of food for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

392
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 2>After awhile I would take the food to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the control room and I would not</v>

393
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>leave until they would ask me to and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched him working the controls and</v>

394
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I've memorized their hand movements and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty soon they would trust me with</v>

395
00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 2>their cars to go pick up entertainers</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came into town.</v>

396
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Entertainers like Sam Cooke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Diana Ross and the supremes,</v>

397
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>the four tops and the temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will drive them all over Miami beach</v>

398
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 2>in the disc jockeys cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any driver's license,</v>

399
00:20:58.211 --> 00:20:58.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'll drive</v>

400
00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.593
<v Speaker 1>like I had.</v>

401
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I was at the radio station and a</v>

402
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:14.670
<v Speaker 2>guy by the name of rock was drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was on there.</v>

403
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It was a Saturday afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one there.</v>

404
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 2>None of the other jobs were available</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was looking at him through the</v>

405
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:25.620
<v Speaker 2>control room window</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>drink rock drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to get him tomorrow?</v>

407
00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:37.790
<v Speaker 2>If you'd asked me</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is on the phone,</v>

408
00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.200
<v Speaker 2>rang was a general manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

409
00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:40.370
<v Speaker 2>hello?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

412
00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.860
<v Speaker 2>He said rock can't finish his program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>other djs that come in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes sir.</v>

415
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I hung the phone up.</v>

00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't eat with your shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take your shoes off so you</v>

461
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 2>can wiggle your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was my dream.</v>

462
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>That was my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

463
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 3>saw that and that drove me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my reason for being so.</v>

464
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 3>One of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In order to make this your decade,</v>

465
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 3>in order to reach your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to find some reasons that</v>

466
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 3>make you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some reasons that will make you hang in</v>

467
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 3>there when times get rough because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get rough.</v>

468
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be very challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you decide that you want to</v>

469
00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 3>grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you decide that you want to go</v>

470
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 3>to another level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all hell will break,</v>

471
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 3>lose everything that will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other that can happen will happen,</v>

472
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and at the worst possible moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it Murphy's law.</v>

473
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you decide that you want to go</v>

474
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>to another vibration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you get into an airplane,</v>

475
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they tell you to do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what?</v>

476
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Fasten your seatbelt because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to experience some turbulence when</v>

477
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 3>you're going up and some of you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>already experiencing that turbulence.</v>

478
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Don't be frightened by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whenever you decide you want to go to</v>

479
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 3>another level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to fasten your psychological,</v>

480
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:43.340
<v Speaker 3>your mental and your spiritual seatbelt</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to be awhile</v>

481
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 3>before you experienced a comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude.</v>

482
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.830
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's there,</v>

483
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to go through this phase</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

484
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:52.350
<v Speaker 3>This is how you grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how you develop.</v>

485
00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is like a rollercoaster.</v>

486
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you're up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you're down.</v>

487
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes things go well and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't go well,</v>

488
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 3>but in the down moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you discover who you are</v>

489
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 3>during the down moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this prosperous time,</v>

490
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 3>you put it in your pocket and the lean</v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

491
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 3>you put it in your hall and that's when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you discover who you are.</v>

492
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

493
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Five reasons that empower you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that you deserve your goal?</v>

494
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:27.640
<v Speaker 3>What are the five reasons that you won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>give up when life catch you?</v>

495
00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:31.450
<v Speaker 3>On the blind side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the messenger of misery visits you,</v>

496
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.070
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What will keep you in the game when life</v>

497
00:25:36.071 --> 00:25:38.200
<v Speaker 3>knocked you to the canvas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

498
00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:42.670
<v Speaker 3>the buster douglas that fought in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last fight was not the buster Douglas,</v>

499
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the buster douglas that got knocked</v>

500
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:49.840
<v Speaker 3>down while I'm fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson had gotten out on alcohol</v>

501
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>recovery center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mother had died.</v>

502
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.570
<v Speaker 3>His wife was ill with a terminal</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness.</v>

503
00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:00.250
<v Speaker 3>He was considered a nothing a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he got knocked down,</v>

504
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 3>buster Douglas had a reason to get back</v>
<v Speaker 3>up because he said,</v>

505
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm dedicating this fight to the memory</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my momma,</v>

506
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.400
<v Speaker 3>but when he fought the last fight that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had and it got knocked down and had a</v>

507
00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:17.401
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed $24,000,000 in his pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got up.</v>

508
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.700
<v Speaker 3>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurry up and count me out.</v>

509
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

510
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you leave us on somebody to get</v>

511
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:41.040
<v Speaker 3>hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to have some reasons that</v>

512
00:26:41.041 --> 00:26:42.840
<v Speaker 3>when life knocks you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gone.</v>

513
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 3>How long it's going to knock you down</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people disappoint you,</v>

514
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:49.550
<v Speaker 3>and that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they been you in,</v>

515
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.100
<v Speaker 3>that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they lied to you and that's going</v>

516
00:26:52.101 --> 00:26:52.711
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they say,</v>

517
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can count on me and they won't show</v>

518
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 3>up and that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're wanting to throw in the</v>

519
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>towel and give up yourself and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

520
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 3>When live collapse on you and catch you</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the blind side,</v>

521
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 3>it drops you to your knees and start</v>
<v Speaker 3>choking you.</v>

522
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 3>You got a dream though I ain't got no</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams and that's going to happen.</v>

523
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 3>What reason can you remember that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can call on that you can reach on,</v>

524
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 3>that could make you get back up.</v>

525
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Find that reason.</v>

526
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 3>It was alive and knocked me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

527
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.190
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this because I want to make my</v>

528
00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:23.680
<v Speaker 3>momma proud of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this because I want my</v>

529
00:27:23.681 --> 00:27:25.480
<v Speaker 3>children to have a better life than what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

530
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this because all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been told I'll be a loser that I</v>

531
00:27:28.961 --> 00:27:31.750
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't make it all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people say made me take them</v>

532
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:34.750
<v Speaker 3>back to the welfare department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this to make them a lot.</v>

533
00:27:34.751 --> 00:27:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I believe like Frank Sinatra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

534
00:27:36.671 --> 00:27:39.610
<v Speaker 3>the best revenge and life is massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

535
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this so I can become massively</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and what that kind of courage</v>

536
00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:46.540
<v Speaker 3>with that kind of affirmation and reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>to empower me,</v>

537
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I got a saying that when life knocks you</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

538
00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:50.650
<v Speaker 3>try and land on your back because if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can look up,</v>

539
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:51.543
<v Speaker 3>you can get off.</v>

540
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

541
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.550
<v Speaker 3>When you run out of money,</v>

542
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 2>when things don't work out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things happened that you could not</v>

543
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 2>anticipate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the reasons that you can think</v>

544
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 2>of that can keep this strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can keep you in the game,</v>

545
00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 2>that will be your rod and staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comfort you that can be your bridge</v>

546
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 2>over troubled waters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those reasons.</v>

547
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 2>A very important Nietzsche said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know the why for living,</v>

548
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.690
<v Speaker 2>you can endure almost anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so find out the reasons that you do what</v>

549
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out the reasons that will make you</v>

550
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will make you walk by faith and not</v>

551
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:37.680
<v Speaker 2>by sight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will make you pursue your dream</v>

552
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 2>when everybody is against you or don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in you no more,</v>

553
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>and let me tell you something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely feeling.</v>

554
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a lonely feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly people that you're doing it</v>

555
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 2>for or people that stand to benefit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

556
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 2>or people who should be the number one</v>
<v Speaker 2>members in the encouragement club,</v>

557
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.070
<v Speaker 2>but they ended up saying you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

558
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 2>and they become members of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discouragement club.</v>

559
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts very badly.</v>

560
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have people that you love close to you.</v>

561
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.410
<v Speaker 2>They look at you with that look and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you try something else?</v>

562
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you give up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

563
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 2>but this is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have got to do this less.</v>

564
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>You had a good job at sears.</v>

565
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Bad Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you</v>

566
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.690
<v Speaker 3>mama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't go back and see.</v>

567
00:29:23.691 --> 00:29:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do.</v>

568
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I got to be my own boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

569
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

570
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:28.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

571
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 2>it's ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you work on a job that's</v>

572
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:34.800
<v Speaker 2>dead in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the ceiling already.</v>

573
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like going in the middle of a movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after you've seen the movie setting</v>

574
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 2>back through that over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something</v>

575
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.911
<v Speaker 3>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

576
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 3>the heroes not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what the outcome is already and</v>

577
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:48.640
<v Speaker 3>so that's why a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady was telling me,</v>

578
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>she said when she went to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob,</v>

579
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.960
<v Speaker 3>like a refrigerator fell on her shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as she stepped in because she</v>

580
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 3>knew she could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd gone as far as she could go see</v>

581
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 3>they're paying or just enough to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>them from quitting and she's work just</v>

582
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 3>hard enough just to keep from getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>

583
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 3>How many of you know people like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raise your hand,</v>

584
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.750
<v Speaker 3>why you didn't raise your hand you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want or</v>

585
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll just leave it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just here's something else.</v>

586
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Make a commitment to be happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't have.</v>

587
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 3>You're laughing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so life is too short.</v>

588
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Going through and look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully tie to Douglas.</v>

589
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we take life too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

590
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Make a commitment to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find little things just to get tickled</v>

591
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:36.070
<v Speaker 3>about and laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find ways to be happy in the moment.</v>

592
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

593
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll be happy when I pay off all my</v>
<v Speaker 3>bills.</v>

594
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll be happy when I get by divorce.</v>

596

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

597
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll be happy with the children.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

600
00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 3>there are no guarantees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying you're going to be here</v>

601
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

605
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 3>all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take somebody that's had on your right</v>

606
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 3>and left and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deserve to be happy.</v>

607

<v Speaker 3>Make a commitment to be happy because</v>
<v Speaker 3>life now has new meaning for you.</v>

617
00:31:45.441 --> 00:31:48.140
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of emotional,</v>

618
00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:51.020
<v Speaker 3>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and spiritual energy to reach our goal,</v>

620
00:31:56.601 --> 00:32:00.350
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are two kinds of relationships.</v>

621
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:04.640
<v Speaker 3>It's Simon talks about this nourishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships and toxic relationships,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all the relationships that inspire you,</v>

623
00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.930

<v Speaker 3>they bring the best out of you.</v>

624
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Toxic relationships or relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people that always criticize you.</v>

625
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.230
<v Speaker 3>All they can do is find fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they can do is just explore your</v>

626
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:23.660
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they can do is remind you of the</v>

627
00:32:23.661 --> 00:32:27.830
<v Speaker 3>mistakes that you've made in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are bad for your health.</v>

628
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Toxic people can run your blood pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

629
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.510
<v Speaker 3>One applicant spoils the whole barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One negative inner greater energy</v>

630
00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:40.511
<v Speaker 3>drainer can spa your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people lives have been ruined</v>

631
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 3>because somebody wasn't good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

632
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 3>there are some people that aren't good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

633
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they aren't good for you.</v>

634
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Got To get them out of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

635
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people put up with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>foolishness because they don't want to</v>

636
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 3>die by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I believe.</v>

637
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I believe in a one to a box theory.</v>

638
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question</v>

639
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 3>of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make a list of who you communicate with</v>

640
00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 3>most and ask yourself the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of person am I becoming</v>

641
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 3>because of this relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it helping me to grow mentally and</v>

642
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 3>emotionally and spiritually?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I becoming a better person because of</v>

643
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 3>this relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they bring out the best in me?</v>

644
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 3>They'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They inspire me.</v>

645
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 3>They encouraged me to develop my</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

646
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Do they make me stretch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got to look at the people in your</v>

647
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:42.110
<v Speaker 3>life and find out what kind of person</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you becoming?</v>

648
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Because of that relationship my mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to say,</v>

649
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 3>birds of a feather flock together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You run around with losers.</v>

650
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 3>You will end up a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unconsciously,</v>

651
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.030
<v Speaker 3>unconsciously you will pick up their</v>
<v Speaker 3>wage.</v>

652
00:33:55.031 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 3>You'll pick up their habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll pick up,</v>

653
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 3>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their attitude about life.</v>

654
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 3>If you around cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative people all the time,</v>

655
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.530
<v Speaker 3>you will become cynical and negative.</v>

656
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many of us are living out the lives of</v>

657
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living out their conclusions,</v>

658
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 3>living out of their consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is that you begin to</v>

659
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 3>look at looking at your life and looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what it is that you want to achieve.</v>

660
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Another crucial thing that you must do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is align yourself with powerful people.</v>

661
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Align yourself with people that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage you,</v>

662
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 3>people that can empower you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you can learn from,</v>

663
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 3>people that you can grow from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very important,</v>

664
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.650
<v Speaker 3>so if you have people around you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can contribute to your growth.</v>

665
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 3>When I wanted to become a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I joined the National Speakers</v>

666
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be around the Dr Norman</v>

667
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Vincent Peale's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Zig Ziglars,</v>

668
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.280
<v Speaker 3>the Dwayne dyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

669
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be around people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing what I wanted to do.</v>

670
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn from them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to do that too.</v>

671
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 3>You want to align yourself with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who think like you,</v>

672
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.210
<v Speaker 3>people who dream like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who want more out of life,</v>

673
00:35:03.211 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 3>people that are stretching and searching</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seeking some higher ground in life</v>

674
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to the majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said,</v>

675
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 3>always strive to get on top and life</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's the bottom that's</v>

676
00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 3>overcrowded and so you don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the bottom.</v>

677
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to be on the bottom.</v>

678
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:19.550
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take any effort to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>loser.</v>

679
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take any motivation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't drive in order to stay down there</v>

680
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 3>on a low level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it calls on everything in you.</v>

681
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to harness your will to say,</v>

682
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to challenge myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I have to pull myself out of</v>

683
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 3>bed to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less things I know I shouldn't do.</v>

684
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't do things I shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

685
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I found that the biggest enemy you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with is yourself.</v>

686
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 3>There's an old African proverb that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

687
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 3>if there's no enemy within the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside can do us no harm.</v>

688
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>So think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

689
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

690
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>begin to look toward making this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your decade as you begin to look toward</v>

691
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.170
<v Speaker 3>making your life different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll begin to look at yourself.</v>

692
00:36:08.171 --> 00:36:12.220
<v Speaker 3>You've got to redefine yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are you right now and who must you</v>

693
00:36:12.221 --> 00:36:16.600
<v Speaker 3>become in order to create what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else has changed about you?</v>

694
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.060
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you're doing right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a liability for you as you</v>

695
00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:25.420
<v Speaker 3>begin to look toward the future and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>inventory of yourself?</v>

696
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.530
<v Speaker 3>What is it about you right now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to leave this behind because</v>

697
00:36:29.531 --> 00:36:34.480
<v Speaker 3>this no longer fits looking at where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go and the kind of person that</v>

698
00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:37.090
<v Speaker 3>you must become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of standards that you have for</v>

699
00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you must do differently?</v>

700
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Repeat after to me please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to keep on getting what</v>

701
00:36:43.721 --> 00:36:44.554
<v Speaker 3>you're getting.</v>

702
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Keep on doing what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that doesn't take an Einstein for</v>

703
00:36:51.491 --> 00:36:55.060
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense unless you change your</v>

704
00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:57.190
<v Speaker 3>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you change the way you're</v>

705
00:36:57.191 --> 00:36:59.350
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you change your behavior,</v>

706
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.080
<v Speaker 3>you're going to continue to produce the</v>
<v Speaker 3>results in your life.</v>

707
00:37:02.081 --> 00:37:03.280
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us are winters,</v>

708
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.840
<v Speaker 3>but some of us are producing results</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't want and so all you have</v>

709
00:37:07.841 --> 00:37:10.130
<v Speaker 3>to look at your game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at your strategy.</v>

710
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.870
<v Speaker 3>How is it that you have been been?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you've been doing to</v>

711
00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:16.930
<v Speaker 3>produce this so you have a director,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the producer,</v>

712
00:37:16.931 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 3>you're writing the script,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the star of your life,</v>

713
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.170
<v Speaker 3>and as you begin to look at your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can decide whether or not it's a</v>

714
00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:27.010
<v Speaker 3>smash and whether or not it's a flop</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in your hands.</v>

715
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Look at your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at where you want to go.</v>

716
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about your circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about your age.</v>

717
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Have a friend who was up in age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 70 and she wanted to build a</v>

718
00:37:36.911 --> 00:37:41.470
<v Speaker 3>multimillion dollar complex name is Dr</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Coleman Lenders and bankers say,</v>

719
00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:43.300
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're too old.</v>

720
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.860
<v Speaker 3>She ignored them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That building now stands ladies and</v>

721
00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:50.650
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen on long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollar structure,</v>

722
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but are a lot of people who would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to that,</v>

723
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.840
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of people that would not have</v>
<v Speaker 3>even gotten to that point,</v>

724
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.920
<v Speaker 3>they were to talk themselves out of even</v>
<v Speaker 3>going down to the bank to ask for it</v>

725
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.710
<v Speaker 3>because they've already said no to</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

726
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:03.970
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time now.</v>

727
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:07.690
<v Speaker 3>If you want to make this your decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to start saying yes to your</v>

728
00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:10.270
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to start saying yes to your</v>

729
00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes to your unfolding future,</v>

730
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:17.140
<v Speaker 3>yes to your potential as opposed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

731
00:38:17.141 --> 00:38:19.600
<v Speaker 3>C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>87 percent of our self talk is negative.</v>

732
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.360
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to make a conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberate,</v>

733
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 3>determined effort to say yes to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>

734
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not me?</v>

735
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't spend time like most people going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through life complaining.</v>

736
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't try and get on talk shows and tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody how life has done you.</v>

737
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's happening in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent don't care.</v>

738
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>And 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gladys,</v>

739
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright?</v>

740
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you know that you all go wrong,</v>

741
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 3>what they did to get away from me before</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come back,</v>

742
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.280
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

743
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Ramana said something very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

744
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.820
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what happens to you.</v>

745
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.840
<v Speaker 3>The only thing matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do about it?</v>

746
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.910
<v Speaker 3>That's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

747
00:39:17.911 --> 00:39:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Life knocked you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do about how long are you</v>

748
00:39:20.731 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 3>going to sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what that did to me?</v>

749
00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Who was the head I racquet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use that energy to get up</v>

750
00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.830
<v Speaker 2>from and move on and get on with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

751
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.910
<v Speaker 2>You got to learn to let the past go so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can grow.</v>

752
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Many people never act on their dreams</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they allow their past</v>

753
00:39:38.841 --> 00:39:41.930
<v Speaker 2>experiences to determine what their</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities are.</v>

754
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you've done in the past that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a reflection of your possibilities.</v>

755
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.510
<v Speaker 2>That's just a reflection of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

756
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.210
<v Speaker 2>That's just a reflection of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>development and your growth.</v>

757
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.240
<v Speaker 2>The future is unfolding for you right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

758
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 2>The future is unlimited for you right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

759
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.700
<v Speaker 2>No one knows where you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what you are,</v>

760
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.810
<v Speaker 2>what you're capable of lava,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's possible for you.</v>

761
00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

762
00:40:05.121 --> 00:40:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one could have convinced me that I</v>

763
00:40:09.171 --> 00:40:10.940
<v Speaker 2>was able to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never forget.</v>

764
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I was speaking in Detroit in a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school friend of mine saw me afterwards</v>

765
00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and he was backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

766
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it's the same person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought for a moment and I said,</v>

767
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.790
<v Speaker 2>it's not the person you know you go,</v>

768
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.740
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't live here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the</v>

769
00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:35.000
<v Speaker 2>power to change our personal history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing the direction of our lives,</v>

770
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:38.150
<v Speaker 2>changing our thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing where we want to go,</v>

771
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.830
<v Speaker 2>exploring new horizons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you began to look at this decade</v>

772
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:46.580
<v Speaker 2>and affirming that this is your decade</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you set goals that will make you</v>

773
00:40:46.581 --> 00:40:49.310
<v Speaker 2>stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will bring out the best in you as</v>

774
00:40:49.311 --> 00:40:54.020
<v Speaker 2>you begin to remove the negative toxic</v>
<v Speaker 2>people from your life as you decide to</v>

775
00:40:54.021 --> 00:40:57.350
<v Speaker 2>take some chances in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that's very</v>

776
00:40:57.351 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This God said,</v>

777
00:40:58.311 --> 00:41:01.670
<v Speaker 2>if you're not willing to risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot grow and if you cannot grow,</v>

778
00:41:01.671 --> 00:41:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you cannot become your best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you cannot become your best,</v>

779
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't be happy and what else</v>

780
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.380
<v Speaker 2>is there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget.</v>

781
00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:17.300
<v Speaker 2>When I reached my first major goal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying my mother left home,</v>

782
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I never forget what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to have this experience</v>

783
00:41:21.621 --> 00:41:25.700
<v Speaker 2>when you reach some major goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I drove up to the house and I got</v>

784
00:41:25.701 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 2>out and I gave mom a key and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mama,</v>

785
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.580
<v Speaker 2>this is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget the look on her face.</v>

786
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:35.414
<v Speaker 2>She said.</v>

787
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well my God,</v>

788
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.300
<v Speaker 2>no one could have convinced me when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted you off that this would happen.</v>

789
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.340
<v Speaker 2>She's so thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

790
00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you</v>
<v Speaker 2>me so many damn problem.</v>

791
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

792
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had a lot of energy,</v>

793
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but no one knew what I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>

794
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a great philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerta.</v>

795
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.460
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a man the way that he is,</v>

796
00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:18.490
<v Speaker 2>he only becomes worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at him as if he were what he</v>

797
00:42:18.491 --> 00:42:20.770
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes what he should be.</v>

798
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 2>And what Mr Washington did was he looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond my faults and saw my needs and he</v>

799
00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:29.020
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see something in you.</v>

800
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

801
00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I hope he's right and I want to live up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his expectations.</v>

802
00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:37.930
<v Speaker 2>He no one rises to low expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

803
00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:40.720
<v Speaker 2>here's one last thing I like to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you going to make this your decade,</v>

804
00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:45.930
<v Speaker 2>find some cause that you believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is my profession,</v>

805
00:42:46.301 --> 00:42:50.200
<v Speaker 2>but my greatest joy in life is working</v>
<v Speaker 2>with young kids.</v>

806
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Every Monday I fly up to Chicago to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>with 600 young kids and Christ Universal</v>

807
00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Temple Church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with them to develop a sense of</v>

808
00:42:58.901 --> 00:43:00.040
<v Speaker 2>purpose and direction.</v>

809
00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.900
<v Speaker 2>With alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've developed a training program.</v>

810
00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:06.310
<v Speaker 2>If they're addicted to drugs or alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we help them to get into a permanent</v>

811
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 2>recovery program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>

812
00:43:08.621 --> 00:43:12.100
<v Speaker 2>we help them to develop a vision of</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves where drugs and alcohol does</v>

813
00:43:12.101 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 2>not fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it when I go into the Cook County</v>

814
00:43:15.521 --> 00:43:20.521
<v Speaker 2>jail and see the look on these young men</v>
<v Speaker 2>faces that anger and the self hatred and</v>

815
00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:24.580
<v Speaker 2>then when we leave there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the difference in them as we begin</v>

816
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 2>to touch a spark in them as Mr</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington touched in me and there's no.</v>

817
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:33.610
<v Speaker 2>You cannot put a dollar price on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my reason for being.</v>

818
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:36.340
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you would like to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet?</v>

819
00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.370
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you'd like to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

820
00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.020
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone paid a price for us to be here.</v>

821
00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I believe that we live in the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>country in the world that gives us an</v>

822
00:43:44.261 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to make a difference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

823
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.750
<v Speaker 2>We are blessed to have been dropped off</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this part of the planet.</v>

824
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.780
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine was in Manila and saw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumper sticker say Yankee,</v>

825
00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:57.781
<v Speaker 2>go home and take me with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you began to look at your life,</v>

826
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.280
<v Speaker 2>decide what kind of legacy do I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead?</v>

827
00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.280
<v Speaker 2>What kind of statement do you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make with your life?</v>

828
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 2>What three things you want said when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

829
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.290
<v Speaker 2>what contribution do you want to make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you want to do.</v>

830
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you want to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your life.</v>

831
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I know about you and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and about you and about you.</v>

832
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 2>That you have greatness within you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have things and gifts and</v>

833
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 2>talents that you've been bestowed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as you work consciously making a</v>

834
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberate,</v>

835
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 2>determined effort to cultivate and bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out and develop a sense of purpose</v>

836
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and knowing that your life can make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference and decided to make and leave</v>

837
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 2>a legacy with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say to you that the planet will never</v>

838
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 2>be the same again because you showed up</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you begin to look toward the future</v>

839
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 2>and affirmed that this is your decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I like to leave with you,</v>

840
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 2>that I'm known by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become my motto and it says simply</v>

841
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you want to do?</v>

842
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 2>My goal is to be the best son that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat up my mother.</v>

843
00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.320
<v Speaker 2>My goal is to be the best father that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be to my children and my goal is to</v>

844
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:04.380
<v Speaker 2>create a drug free America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be the best motivator that I can be.</v>

845
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Whatever your goal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I like to leave with you</v>

846
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 2>says simply this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you want a thing bad enough to</v>

847
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:13.890
<v Speaker 2>go out and fight for it to work day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

848
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 2>for it to give up your time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your peace,</v>

849
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Speaker 2>and your sleep for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If all that you dream and scheme is</v>

850
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 2>about it and life seems useless and</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless without it,</v>

851
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you'd gladly sweat for it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fret for it and plan for it and lose all</v>

852
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>your terror of the opposition for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you simply go after this thing</v>

853
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:34.290
<v Speaker 2>that you want with all of your capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthen sagacity,</v>

854
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 2>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope and confidence and stern</v>

855
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 2>pertinacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If neither cold poverty,</v>

856
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:43.080
<v Speaker 2>famish or go sickness or pain of body</v>
<v Speaker 2>and brain can keep you away from the</v>

857
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 2>thing that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If dogged and grim you besiege and</v>

858
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.880
<v Speaker 2>visited with the help of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get it.</v>

859
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 2>This is Mrs Mamie Brown's baby boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leslie Calvin Brown saying it's been a</v>

860
00:45:51.481 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 2>plum pleasing pleasure.</v>

861
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
