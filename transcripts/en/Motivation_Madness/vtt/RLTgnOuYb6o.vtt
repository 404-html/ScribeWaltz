1
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.660
<v Speaker 1>The three things that I want to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

2
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>just these three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do 10 I could do a whole life</v>

3
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:18.451
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just these three things will carry</v>

4
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you if you let them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First and foremost,</v>

5
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>knowing who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing who you are,</v>

6
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>being able to answer this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who am I and what do I want?</v>

7
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times when I go out of the country,</v>

8
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I am baffled by that question to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your occupation?</v>

9
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I've I've stood there for 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>am I talk show hosts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than a talk show hosts and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>business woman,</v>

12
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm business woman more than a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Am I an entrepreneur more than do her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just leave it blank or self</v>

14
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.474
<v Speaker 1>employed.</v>

15
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not asking for the roles that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>play as daughters.</v>

16
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:10.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the roles that you play as a</v>

17
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a friend,</v>

18
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>as a sister?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a lawyer,</v>

19
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you're going to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a pharmacist.</v>

20
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking the bigger question of who am</v>
<v Speaker 1>I?</v>

21
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Who am I really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My answer is I am God's child.</v>

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am that which is born of all that is I</v>

23
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>am as shot and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spiritual being,</v>

24
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:45.481
<v Speaker 1>having a human experience come trailing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breadth of the ancestors yet,</v>

25
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but trailing the breadth of the angels</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understanding that because I am</v>

26
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:58.741
<v Speaker 1>connected to the source of all that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is possible is possible for me.</v>

27
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>That's who I am and what do I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just be successful in</v>

28
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:14.344
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

29
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just make a mark or have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a legacy.</v>

30
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that question for me is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fulfill the highest,</v>

31
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>truest expression of myself as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

32
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to fulfill the promise that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creator dreamed when he dreamed the</v>

33
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>cells that made up me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I want?</v>

34
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You must have some kind of vision for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

35
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a direction in which</v>

36
00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you choose to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never was the kind of woman who liked</v>

37
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>to get in a car and just go for a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a boyfriend would say,</v>

38
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>let's just go for a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where we go.</v>

39
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>We</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we have a destination.</v>

40
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Is there a plan or we just ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've learned is that to great</v>

41
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:27.740
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be in the driver's seat of</v>

42
00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Speaker 1>your own life because if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life will drive you.</v>

43
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.373
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

44
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 1>knowing who you really are in this space</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time that we embody,</v>

45
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>that's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

46
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

47
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you must find a way to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King said that not</v>

48
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody can be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody can be great because</v>

49
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.991
<v Speaker 1>greatness is determined by service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we live in a world where everybody</v>

50
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:15.361
<v Speaker 1>wants to be famous and where we admire</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for just being famous,</v>

51
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>we think being known brings us value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is all of that will fade in</v>

52
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>time in three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to name the housewives</v>

53
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.803
<v Speaker 1>of Atlanta.</v>

54
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.880
<v Speaker 1>The real truth is that service and</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance service and the</v>

55
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>significance that you bring to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>service is that which is lasting.</v>

56
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So to be able to whatever your</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation or job or talent or gift is.</v>

57
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Our honorees today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting doctorate degrees too,</v>

58
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>apparently opposite fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>HIV and aids and the spoken word,</v>

59
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but what they have in common is service</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the spoken word in service to</v>

60
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:17.361
<v Speaker 1>community and the world using your</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and information about HIV and</v>

61
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 1>AIDS and medicine in service to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and if you look at all the most</v>

62
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>successful people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they know it or not,</v>

63
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.630
<v Speaker 1>they have that paradigm of service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talking about Mark</v>

64
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg and IPO</v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

65
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Jay z rapid service through the word to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people through song.</v>

66
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.240
<v Speaker 1>For many years I was really just happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be on TV and people would stop and</v>

67
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:51.571
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

68
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you on tv?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being on TV.</v>

70
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice job</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was about the time that I received</v>

71
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:06.221
<v Speaker 1>my honorary doctorate from spelman</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 1993 so I don't know if that had</v>

72
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.920
<v Speaker 1>something to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of myself as Doctor Winfrey.</v>

73
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Then I went back and I took a long look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what it was I was doing on on TV and</v>

74
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>made a decision that I was no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to just be on tv,</v>

75
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>but I was going to use TV as a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a force for good and not be used by</v>

76
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will tell you</v>

77
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.370
<v Speaker 1>my decision to make that significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>change in the way I operated on</v>

78
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:51.961
<v Speaker 1>television using television as a service</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed my career exponentially service</v>

79
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>through medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So service through art,</v>

80
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.860
<v Speaker 1>using whatever it is you produce your</v>
<v Speaker 1>product as a way of giving back to the</v>

81
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you shift the paradigm of whatever</v>

82
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 1>it is you choose to do to service and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring significance to that,</v>

83
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>success will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>

84
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.390
<v Speaker 1>follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Service and significance equals success.</v>

85
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.880
<v Speaker 1>That's number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three.</v>

86
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It's so simple but so hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always do the right thing.</v>

87
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.633
<v Speaker 2>Always</v>

88
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>be excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People notice,</v>

89
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>think of how you notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Taco Bell,</v>

90
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>somebody gives you extra napkin and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce.</v>

91
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>You notice you want to go back to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

92
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause even at Taco bell excellence shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

93
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Be Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let excellence be your brand.</v>

94
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Everybody talks about building a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never even knew what that was.</v>

95
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>When people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a brand,</v>

96
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I would say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just oprah.</v>

97
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 1>What I recognize now is that my choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it every way in every example,</v>

98
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>in every experience to do the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

99
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>And the excellent thing is what has</v>
<v Speaker 1>created the brand.</v>

100
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Years ago I did an ad for Revlon for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

101
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 1>an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>they were doing called unforgettable</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

103
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And what I know is that when you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent,</v>

104
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>you become unforgettable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People remember you,</v>

105
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got us of what it is.</v>

106
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>You become an unforgettable woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what we all want.</v>

107
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>We want to be unforgettable and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgettable.</v>

108
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.660
<v Speaker 1>So doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when nobody knows you're doing the</v>

109
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll always bring the right thing to</v>

110
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you that.</v>

111
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the third law of motion is</v>

112
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>always at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For every action there's an equal and</v>

113
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>opposite reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so true in all of our lives.</v>

114
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what Newton said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celia and the color purple said it.</v>

115
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Everything you even try to do that</v>

116
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.320
<v Speaker 2>all ready done to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britt</v>

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 1>thing you even tried to do to me already</v>
<v Speaker 1>done to you so you don't have to worry</v>

118
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>about revenge or getting back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

119
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.690
<v Speaker 1>making sure they pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to do the right thing and</v>

120
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll follow you even when people don't</v>

121
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:16.270
<v Speaker 1>support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember many times on my shelf,</v>

122
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>there are many shows y'all never saw and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you didn't see them is</v>

123
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:26.141
<v Speaker 1>because I got the last boat and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember 2010 my team,</v>

124
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>hardest working team in television had</v>
<v Speaker 1>done this interview with a woman who</v>

125
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.290
<v Speaker 1>turns out she was a Sunday school</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher by day and a sex addict ignite.</v>

126
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

127
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got her going out.</v>

128
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>We got her with the men and we get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show her and she was willing to show us</v>

129
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.460
<v Speaker 1>if ref Fang.</v>

130
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I sat down with a woman for an interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was taped and during the process of</v>

131
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:05.600
<v Speaker 1>the interview I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing this?</v>

132
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.771
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

133
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell my story and I want to</v>

134
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:10.760
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

135
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:12.080
<v Speaker 1>do you have children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

136
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:13.910
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a 10 year old son.</v>

137
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I knew right then this is never going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the light of day.</v>

138
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So we got off the air and I said to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>

139
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>we are not going to air that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

140
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.950
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My producer said,</v>

141
00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:32.951
<v Speaker 1>why she knew she was being filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew what she was saying.</v>

142
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:38.381
<v Speaker 1>She knows what I said because her son</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never get over it.</v>

143
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Her son will never get over it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not worth a rating point to me,</v>

144
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.030
<v Speaker 1>not worth the rating point to me to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a 10 year old boy who's</v>

145
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>destroyed because his mother went on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah Winfrey show and told all her</v>

146
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:01.651
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the right thing even when other</v>

147
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>people think it may not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes when you make a decision</v>

148
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>to do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately you're faced with doubt.</v>

149
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Was that the right thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the right decision?</v>

150
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the right thing?</v>

151
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You always know it's the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When in the end there is peace.</v>

152
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You are rewarded by peace and knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you did the right thing.</v>

153
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing I have come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know in doing the right thing and making</v>

154
00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:38.981
<v Speaker 1>the right choices is understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about yesterday.</v>

155
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>All of you leaving here have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for enormous success.</v>

156
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:56.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a price that comes with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't always like you</v>

157
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and they're not always happy for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you surround yourself with people</v>

158
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.140
<v Speaker 1>who are not accustomed to your success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become fearful.</v>

159
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.000
<v Speaker 1>They become scared because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflecting back something to them,</v>

160
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but they don't recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're not going to say,</v>

161
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very fearful,</v>

162
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.673
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

163
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.350
<v Speaker 1>because you were reflecting back to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I don't recognize.</v>

164
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.920
<v Speaker 1>They're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they're going to say.</v>

165
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.670
<v Speaker 1>They're going to say who she thinks she</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

166
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.900
<v Speaker 1>who she thinks she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That only happens when you are around</v>

167
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:47.031
<v Speaker 1>people who do not mean and want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to the best for you people who</v>

168
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>want the best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be your best.</v>

169
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So my greatest advice to you is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround yourself with people who are</v>

170
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>going to fill your cup until your cup</v>
<v Speaker 1>runneth over.</v>

171
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So when people say you're so full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

172
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

173
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

174
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so full,</v>

175
00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:24.411
<v Speaker 1>my cup runneth over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to know that once you're a cup</v>

176
00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:32.151
<v Speaker 1>runneth over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot spend your life with your</v>

177
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:37.941
<v Speaker 1>gallon size offerings offering them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pint size people.</v>

178
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You have got to surround yourself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>size people who can hang in the same</v>

179
00:14:55.161 --> 00:15:00.161
<v Speaker 1>company with you so that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering your gallons to those little</v>

180
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>pipes out there who can't hold it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

181
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>choice to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that song.</v>

182
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I love hearing you all sing that song</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I know for sure is that the</v>

183
00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:20.701
<v Speaker 1>biggest choices begin and in with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your internal big questions.</v>

184
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Who do I want to be in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My relationship to source energy to all</v>

185
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>that is God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about what you believe</v>

186
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 1>in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about your experience of</v>

187
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:42.130
<v Speaker 1>that which is all life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is divine and universal.</v>

188
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being connected and aligned with that.</v>

189
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.130
<v Speaker 1>When you are tuned in and charged into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

190
00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:57.780
<v Speaker 1>whenever you feel empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go inside yourself and you connect</v>

191
00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:02.781
<v Speaker 1>to the source and you know that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are possible</v>

192
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to choose to do the right thing in</v>

193
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.830
<v Speaker 1>service and significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>

194
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 1>you will create a vessel of service for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself first because you have to honor</v>

195
00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>yourself first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to give to yourself first.</v>

196
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you have nothing to give away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will create a vessel for yourself or</v>

197
00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:38.050
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your community and the world and those</v>

198
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.290
<v Speaker 1>three things will not only lead you to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed life.</v>

199
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I stand as a witness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life is so blessed I can't even take</v>

200
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it in.</v>
