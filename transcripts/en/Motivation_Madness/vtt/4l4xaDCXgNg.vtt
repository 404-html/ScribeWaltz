1
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I'll say is I challenged</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there might be a founder here in</v>

2
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the audience that's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something big.</v>

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the birthday paradox,</v>

4
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's absolutely the chance that</v>

5
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>someone in this room here today will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO,</v>

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>cto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder of like one of the world's most</v>

7
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 1>changing companies in the next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He live in a really special place where</v>

8
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>people get to work on ideas where</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure is tolerated.</v>

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>If you travel overseas to other places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why silicon valley is</v>

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>so different and it's because failure is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerated.</v>

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I realized that I loved doing lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different stuff.</v>

12
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I loved technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that I loved doing lots of</v>

13
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to boarding school and I was</v>

14
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>the guy hanging a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>an antenna outside of my dorm room</v>
<v Speaker 1>window to do a pirate radio station.</v>

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I was designing flyers for dances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was deejaying,</v>

17
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>like I just love doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

18
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And when I read the required reading in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

19
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>our junior year was this book called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new new thing,</v>

20
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of the Netscape Saga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that and I said to myself like,</v>

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>this feels like an area of the world I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come to and be myself and do lots of</v>

23
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>different things and see what sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little schizophrenic and how I treat</v>

24
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>different ideas and go from thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

25
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of the ethos of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur to teach myself ruby on</v>

26
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a really awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>skill.</v>

28
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>So I learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned about databases and learned</v>

29
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>enough to be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the lessons in</v>

30
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be the best,</v>

31
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be dangerous.</v>

32
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn just enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to build an idea,</v>

33
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>concept it and show it to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it turns out there are lots of</v>

34
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>other people including all 170 employees</v>
<v Speaker 1>that work at instagram who are much</v>

35
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>better at doing all that stuff than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

36
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>But you'd need to find people who can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn to the idea that you build and</v>

37
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>then they ended up taking it and make an</v>
<v Speaker 1>even better.</v>

38
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone's experience is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

39
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in this room has to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there is a perfect next move</v>

40
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and throw it out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no perfect.</v>

41
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Next move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the privilege of going to a Marine</v>

42
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:16.661
<v Speaker 1>base once and talking to marines about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they plan their next move.</v>

43
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>There's this phrase called bias towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

44
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you can spend all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time thinking about what the perfect</v>

45
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>next move is trying to plan.</v>

46
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to work at Google?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to work at Microsoft?</v>

47
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Like which one Mckinsey or Bain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the next perfect move and spending</v>

48
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of time trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>

49
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>The marine say you can spend all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you want,</v>

50
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but by the time you figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

51
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>So like sometimes you need to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradeoff of what is the action I can</v>

52
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>take with the appropriate amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and risk to move because</v>

53
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>moving and progress is what gets us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step by moving and learning.</v>

54
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>It all adds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That summation of your experience over</v>

55
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years is what makes you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing tomorrow that will be</v>

56
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other jobs that I had offered,</v>

57
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>there were like two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple at a startup,</v>

58
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>one at Microsoft and Google.</v>

59
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I took the lowest salary of anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the offers that I had because I</v>

60
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>wanted to work in a specific job at</v>
<v Speaker 1>google.</v>

61
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care what job it was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just cared that it was at Google and I</v>

62
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>would surround myself by amazing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first lesson that I learned</v>

63
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>is like go to where the people are short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term longterm tradeoffs.</v>

64
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Just go to where the people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being at Google and going to Corp Dev</v>

65
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>was an interesting move because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

66
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to be nurse startups again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot about startups in</v>

67
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to be back in the startup</v>

68
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>world and then 2008 happened and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure how many people remember 2008 in</v>

69
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy kind of went to crap.</v>

70
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking at my boss and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

71
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

72
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>can we buy this company is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

73
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>can we buy this company note one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

74
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>and I won't even name the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a really interesting company.</v>

75
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Ended up doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had purchased it,</v>

76
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually not going to do many</v>

77
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>deals now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should probably just go golfing and</v>

78
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>for like a 20 something year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking to themselves like I want to</v>

79
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>make a difference in the world and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss is telling you to go golfing.</v>

80
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.741
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe I should just leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did and I actually,</v>

81
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a chapter in between Google and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bourbon that not many people know about,</v>

82
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but I ended up joining a startup of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ex Google folks called nextstop.</v>

83
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Hugely transformational for me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's where I cut my teeth,</v>

84
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>learning to program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning to build a site and everything</v>

85
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I learned in that year at next stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>before starting bourbon was actually</v>

86
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made me ready to go do bourbon.</v>

87
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every move you think needs to be</v>

88
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out just like surround yourself</v>

89
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>by great people where you can learn the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most and great things will happen.</v>

90
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't go golfing and that's rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>number two.</v>

91
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I never know I will be able to survive</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 20 years.</v>

92
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So I call myself like a blind man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riding on the back of a blind tiger for</v>

93
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.900
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survived to today,</v>

94
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Stu surviving that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to make this company lost 102</v>

95
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.990
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we finished only 16 years.</v>

96
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 2>There are 86 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started in 1999 because in China</v>

97
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to be make company for</v>
<v Speaker 2>last 100 years that this become a</v>

98
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Speaker 2>slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody take it too seriously.</v>

99
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to give,</v>

100
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the KPI to your people should be very</v>

101
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>specific and people know it's a serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

102
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 2>two years that we were born in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alibaba,</v>

103
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:28.920
<v Speaker 2>so will last a century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a one year and this central one</v>

104
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 2>to have a winder years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next century,</v>

105
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 2>one year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

106
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 2>two crossroads centers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very specific.</v>

107
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So we're in our company.</v>

108
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.350
<v Speaker 2>We never talked to your succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful or not because we think</v>

109
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 2>they're 86 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next 86 years.</v>

110
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 2>There are many chance that failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we say don't talk about</v>

111
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 2>your successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty six years later we'll talk about</v>

112
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:52.880
<v Speaker 2>it and this is something we know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make this thing happen.</v>

113
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think generally I'm a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nectar two or three years maybe have</v>

114
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

115
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>well anticorruption this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think about anticorruption and rule</v>

116
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 2>by law is laying a great foundation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market.</v>

117
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Common economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go to business by</v>

118
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have an unfair</v>

119
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.610
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The market Kami is by rule by law and</v>

120
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:23.611
<v Speaker 2>market economy is very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transparent and fair and I think this</v>

121
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>year does here bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is why we need</v>

122
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why we need the business to</v>

123
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>drive the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the positive and people when</v>

124
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 2>people worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy when people too happy.</v>

125
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I started worrying because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't worry about the things the</v>

126
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 2>president is worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about the things that nobody worry</v>

127
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 2>about and this is the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm positive because I'm not,</v>

128
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not stupid.</v>

129
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I know you have a problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to solve the problems.</v>

130
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.930
<v Speaker 2>They by little and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

131
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Play one game a little bit with me for</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a minute.</v>

132
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:08.961
<v Speaker 3>I'd like for the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have you have you pretend I've made</v>

133
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 3>you a great offer and I've told you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could pick any one of your</v>

134
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:17.100
<v Speaker 3>classmates and you now know each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably pretty well after being here</v>

135
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:19.020
<v Speaker 3>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take 24 hours.</v>

136
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.270
<v Speaker 3>If they got all burned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pick any one of your classmates</v>

137
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.710
<v Speaker 3>and you got 10 percent of their earnings</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of their lives.</v>

138
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I asked you what goes through your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>in determining which one of those you</v>

139
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>would pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't pick the one with the richest</v>

140
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.700
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't count.</v>

141
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:36.534
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to,</v>

142
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Speaker 3>got to do this on merit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you probably wouldn't pick the</v>

143
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 3>person that gets the highest grades in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the class.</v>

144
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with getting the</v>

145
00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:46.930
<v Speaker 3>highest grades in the class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

146
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.210
<v Speaker 3>that isn't going to be the quality that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sets apart a big winner from the</v>

147
00:07:52.621 --> 00:07:53.430
<v Speaker 3>rest of the pack.</v>

148
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about who you would pick and why.</v>

149
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.770
<v Speaker 3>And I think you'll find when you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

150
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 3>you'll pick some individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've all got the ability,</v>

151
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be here otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the energy.</v>

152
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.953
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

153
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

154
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 3>the initiative is here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intelligence is here,</v>

155
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 3>but some of you are going to be bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>winners than others.</v>

156
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 3>And it gets down to a bunch of qualities</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

157
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interestingly enough,</v>

158
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.850
<v Speaker 3>our self made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

159
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.010
<v Speaker 3>it's not how tall you are is not where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can kick a football,</v>

160
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 3>60 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not whether you could run the</v>

161
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 3>hundred yard dash 10 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether the best looking person in the</v>

162
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole bunch of qualities that</v>

163
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:33.880
<v Speaker 3>really come out of Ben Franklin or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy scout coater,</v>

164
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 3>so whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

165
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's integrity is honesty,</v>

166
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:41.130
<v Speaker 3>it's generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being willing to do more than your</v>

167
00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 3>share.</v>

168
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.850
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just all those qualities that are</v>

169
00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:47.670
<v Speaker 3>self selected and then if you look on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side of the ledger,</v>

170
00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 3>because there's always a catch to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>free gifts and Jeannie jokes.</v>

171
00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:54.690
<v Speaker 3>So you'll also have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the fun part,</v>

172
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 3>you also have to sell short one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>your classmates and pay 10 percent of</v>

173
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 3>what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who do you think is going to do the</v>

174
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 3>worst in the class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is way more fun and think about it</v>

175
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 3>again and again it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't the person with the lowest</v>

176
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 3>grades or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything of the sort.</v>

177
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 3>It's the person who just doesn't shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the character department.</v>

178
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 3>We look for three things when we hire</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

179
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.120
<v Speaker 3>we look for intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we look for in,</v>

180
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 3>for initiative or energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we look for integrity and if they</v>

181
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 3>don't have the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first tool will kill you because if</v>

182
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get somebody without</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity,</v>

183
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 3>you want them lazy and dumb.</v>

184
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want a smart and energetic.</v>

185
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

186
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 3>is that third quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everything about that quality is</v>

187
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:40.310
<v Speaker 3>your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

188
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't change the way you were wired</v>

189
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can change a lot of what you do</v>

190
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 3>with that wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you write down the qualities of</v>

191
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 3>that person that you'd like to buy to 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of.</v>

192
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Look at that list and ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything on that list?</v>

193
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There aren't.</v>

194
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 3>There won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at the person,</v>

195
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 3>you're so short and you look at those</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualities that you don't like,</v>

196
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 3>if you see any of those in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you or whatever it may be,</v>

197
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 3>selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get rid of that.</v>

198
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not ordained.</v>

199
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you follow that,</v>

200
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 3>you and Ben Franklin did this and my old</v>
<v Speaker 3>boss Ben Graham did this at early ages</v>

201
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 3>and their young teens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just been granted looked around and</v>

202
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do I admire,</v>

203
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wanted to be admired himself.</v>

204
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 3>why do I buy these other people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

206
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 3>if I admire them for these reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe other people would hire me if I</v>

207
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 3>behave in a similar matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had,</v>

208
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 3>he decided what kind of a person he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be.</v>

209
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 3>And if you follow that at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be the person you want to buy 10</v>

210
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:42.961
<v Speaker 3>percent of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

211
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 3>that's the goal at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

212
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's achievable by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by everybody in this room.</v>

213
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Learning to tell a story is critically</v>
<v Speaker 4>important because that's how the money</v>

214
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The money flows as a function of the</v>

215
00:10:57.251 --> 00:11:00.310
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what are the critical things I would</v>

216
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:03.970
<v Speaker 4>encourage you to learn that's way more</v>
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>

217
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 4>important in my world and anything else</v>
<v Speaker 4>is how to ask a question because you</v>

218
00:11:10.571 --> 00:11:15.571
<v Speaker 4>want to have the person comfortably</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling you what he thinks is important</v>

219
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 4>so that you get for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand the product or the</v>

220
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 4>market well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're listening so we have learned to</v>

221
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:31.381
<v Speaker 4>string questions in a way that provides</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entrepreneur with a way to explain</v>

222
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.760
<v Speaker 4>what he wants to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long it's going to take,</v>

223
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.540
<v Speaker 4>who the competition is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money he needs,</v>

224
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 4>without feeling threatening for many of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the investments we've made.</v>

225
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 4>We didn't understand the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we constantly work on developing the</v>

226
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>
