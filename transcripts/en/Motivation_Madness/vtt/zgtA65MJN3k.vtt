1
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing mankind's ability to</v>

2
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the means to fight your fears,</v>

3
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>to begin your journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journey into the unknown,</v>

4
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>the journey to reach this bold word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journey that'll get you lost along</v>

5
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will find yourself in the dark,</v>

6
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>struggling alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are the tests that the</v>

7
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>universe will place in front of you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how strong your desire really is.</v>

8
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Their destiny will never be reached if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't depart,</v>

9
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>you must never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand the work.</v>

10
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Concrete does not voluntarily admit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles that are to come,</v>

11
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but simply allows you to chance to greet</v>
<v Speaker 1>them yourself.</v>

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>You will feel as though you are blindly</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through life,</v>

13
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but asked you to close your eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust your mind.</v>

14
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Trust your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust her spirit,</v>

15
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your future is simply a vision of the</v>

16
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>paradise you have created in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must venture into the unknown with</v>

17
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance that everything you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

18
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purpose,</v>

19
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

20
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a purpose,</v>

21
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>to create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

22
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>we're all here on this planet for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific reason.</v>

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>We must find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Define it and never stopped believing in</v>

24
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>our destiny because life has no meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you create it.</v>

25
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>It is the obstacle that we overcome that</v>
<v Speaker 1>grant us the true beauty and life,</v>

26
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>the beauty that confirms that everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have ever struggled for,</v>

27
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it was worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find trust in your faith and what</v>

28
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the universe has for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find what you have always been</v>

29
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is not about the</v>

30
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the journey.</v>
