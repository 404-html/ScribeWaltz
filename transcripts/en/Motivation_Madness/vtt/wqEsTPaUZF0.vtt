1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't need to have all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but you better have most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>

3
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>educational goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans for old time outside of work.</v>

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I attention to your mental and physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>etc. You know those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is about.</v>

7
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If You don't have any of those things,</v>

8
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>well then all you've got left is misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering.</v>

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad,</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad deal for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>so once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you set up that goal structure,</v>

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really in many in many ways,</v>

13
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should be doing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities is,</v>

14
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you should be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to figure out who it is that</v>

15
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And you aim at that and then use</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you learned as a means of</v>

17
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>building that person that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean want to be.</v>

19
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean should be even those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

20
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Those things are going to overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's important to distinguish</v>

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>between those because that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is back down to the micro</v>

22
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>routine analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started saying,</v>

23
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to make yourself</v>

24
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>more industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specify your damn goals because how are</v>

26
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you going to hit something if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it is that isn't going to</v>

27
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often people won't specify their</v>

28
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>goals too because they don't like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>specify conditions for failure.</v>

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you keep yourself all vague and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foggy,</v>

30
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>which is real easy because that's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of not doing as well,</v>

31
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know when you fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people might say,</v>

32
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to know when I fail</v>

33
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>because that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll keep myself blind about when I</v>

34
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

35
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you'll fail all the time.</v>

36
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Then you just won't know it until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed so badly that you're done.</v>

37
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And that can easIly happen by the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 40.</v>

38
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would recommend that you don't let</v>

39
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's willful blindness,</v>

40
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have known,</v>

41
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but you chose not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

42
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So once you get your goal structure set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

43
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:53.911
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>if I could have this life looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be worth living despite the</v>

45
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>anxiety provoking and threatening and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some suffering and</v>

47
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>loss involved in all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the goal is to have a vision</v>

48
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:12.141
<v Speaker 1>for your life such that all things</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered that justifies your effort.</v>

49
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then what do you do?</v>

50
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Well then then you turn down to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro routines like,</v>

51
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm aiming for.</v>

52
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>How does that instantiates itself day to</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

53
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>month to month.</v>

54
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's where something like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule can be unbelievably useful.</v>

55
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>google calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like naked damn schedule and stick</v>

56
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

57
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>so what's the rule with the schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bloody prison.</v>

58
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing that people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

59
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:38.251
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to follow a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

61
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of schedule are you setting</v>

62
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.224
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

63
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>

64
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

65
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I just go play video games</v>
<v Speaker 1>because who wants to do all these things</v>

66
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>that I have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong.</v>

67
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Set the damn schedule up so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the day you want.</v>

68
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

69
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got tomorrow.</v>

70
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to set it up so it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best possible day I could have</v>

71
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it look like?</v>

72
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Well then you schedule that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a bit of</v>

73
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that's going to go along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because if you have any sense,</v>

74
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>insist upon is that at the end of the</v>

75
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in worse shape than you were</v>

76
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>then at the beginning of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a stupid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,</v>

78
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you just dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig yourself a hole,</v>

79
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.830
<v Speaker 1>and then you bury yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

80
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a good strategy.</v>

81
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe 20 percent of your day has to</v>

82
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>be responsibility and obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's more than that,</v>

83
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>depending on how far behind you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even that you can,</v>

84
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

85
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>well I've got these responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to schedule the damn things in.</v>

86
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>What's the right ratio of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reward?</v>

87
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself that just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd negotiate with someone who is</v>

88
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>

89
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.321
<v Speaker 1>It'S like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

90
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you got to work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

91
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

92
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are you going to do for me</v>

93
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that makes it likely that I'll work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you while you could ask yourself that,</v>

94
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do an hour of,</v>

95
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility and then you play a</v>
<v Speaker 1>video game for 15 minutes.</v>

96
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever turns your crank man.</v>

97
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate with yourself and</v>

98
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>not tyrannized yourself like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating with someone that you care</v>

99
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>for that you would like to be productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a good life.</v>

100
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you make the schedule.</v>

101
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at the day and you</v>

102
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:25.571
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>if I had that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

104
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're useless and horrible.</v>

106
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>So you'll probably only hit it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 70 percent accuracy,</v>

107
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>but that beats the hell out of zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit it even with 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>

109
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 1>another rule is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim for 51 percent the next week or 50</v>

110
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and a half percent for god's sake or</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to hit that</v>

111
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220
<v Speaker 1>position where things start to loop back</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively in spiral you upward and so,</v>

112
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way that you can work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness is a plan a life</v>

113
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:02.851
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to have and and you do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly by referring to social norms.</v>

114
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>That's more or less rescuing your father</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale,</v>

115
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>but the other way you do that is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a little conversation with</v>

116
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>yourself about as if you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who you are because you know what</v>

117
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't do what you're told.</v>

118
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>You won't do what you tell yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

119
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>You must have noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a bad employee and a</v>

120
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>worse boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in both of those work for you,</v>

121
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you want to do.</v>

122
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And then when you tell yourself what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

123
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should fire yourself and find</v>

124
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>someone else to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

125
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but you know what my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to understand that</v>

126
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not your own servant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

127
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you're someone that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with and that's.</v>

128
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And you're someone that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>present the opportunity of having a good</v>

129
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>life too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard for people because they</v>

130
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 1>don't like themselves very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

131
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>they're always like cracking the whip</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then procrastinating and cracking</v>

132
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the whip and then procrastinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

133
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so boring and such a pathetic way</v>

134
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>of spending your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what that's like because</v>

135
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>you probably wasted like six hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

136
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think we did an economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation about that a while back,</v>

137
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an</v>

138
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

139
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting paid that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're young.</v>

141
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>And so this is investment time and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do now is going to multiply its</v>

142
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>effects in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

143
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>

144
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you waste six hours a day and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

145
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>then you're wasting about $2,000 a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>or about $100,000 a year.</v>

146
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So like go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's costing you every</v>

147
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>hour and you need to know what your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is worth.</v>

148
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's not 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 30 whatever.</v>

149
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere in that range.</v>

150
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you should be asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is when you spend an hour was</v>

151
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:43.604
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

152
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>what have I paid someone 50 bucks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had that hour?</v>

153
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like well maybe you should do</v>

154
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>something else with your time.</v>

155
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And it depends on whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that your time is worthwhile.</v>

156
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing about not assuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is if you assume your time isn't</v>

157
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you don't just sit</v>

158
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>around sort of randomly in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility list bliss.</v>

159
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you suffer existentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems like a stupid</v>

160
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.701
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>if you take people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've told you this,</v>

162
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>and you expose them voluntarily to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they are avoiding and are</v>

163
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>that they know they need to overcome in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to meet their goals,</v>

165
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>their self defined goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can teach people to stand up in</v>

166
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the face of the things they're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

167
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the upper limits to that art</v>

168
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>because you might ask yourself like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing</v>

169
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>what you knew you needed to do by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaf,</v>

170
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>by your own definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

171
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Within the value structure that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>

172
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be like?</v>

173
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>there are remarkable people who come</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world from time to time and</v>

175
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>there are people who do find out over</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades long periods what they could be</v>

176
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:59.051
<v Speaker 1>like if they were who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they said if they spoke their being</v>

177
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>forward and they get stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and stronger and we don't know</v>

178
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>the limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not know the limits to that.</v>

179
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>in part perhaps the reason that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering unbearably can be left at your</v>

181
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>feet because you're not everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be and you know it.</v>

182
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a terrible thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit and it's a terrible thing to</v>

183
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's real promise in it,</v>

184
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it means that</v>

185
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there's another way that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could look at the world and the number</v>

186
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>another way that you could act in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

187
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>So what it would reflect back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be much better than what it</v>

188
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 1>reflects back to you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of that is,</v>

189
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that many people did that</v>

190
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 1>because we've done a lot as human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

191
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>We've done a lot of remarkable things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told you alReady,</v>

192
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I think before the today for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 250,000 people will be lifted out</v>

193
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>of abject poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about 300,000 people attached to the</v>

194
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>electrical power grid we're making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were lifting people out of</v>

195
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>collectively at a faster rate that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever occurred in the history of</v>

196
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>humankind by a huge margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's been going on unbelievably</v>

197
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>quickly since the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the un and plan to have poverty between</v>

198
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.390
<v Speaker 1>2000 and 2015 and it was accomplished by</v>
<v Speaker 1>2030.</v>

199
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's inequality developing in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>places and you hear lots of political</v>

200
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>agitation about that.</v>

201
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>But overall the tide is lifting everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and that's a great thing.</v>

202
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how fast we can multiply</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if people got their act together</v>

203
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and really aimed at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

204
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience is with people that were</v>

205
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>probably running at about 51 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity.</v>

206
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Something mean you can think about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourselves.</v>

207
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I often ask undergraduates how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day you waste or how many hours</v>

208
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>a week you waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The classic answer is something like</v>

209
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>four to six hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>inefficient studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching things on youtube that not only</v>

211
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>do you not want to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't even care about that make</v>

212
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you feel horrible about watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you're done,</v>

213
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 1>that's probably four hours right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>

214
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 hours a week.</v>

215
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 hours a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's two and a half full work weeks.</v>

216
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.950
<v Speaker 1>It's half a year of work weeks per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your time is worth $20 an hour,</v>

217
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>which is a radical underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 50.</v>

218
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deferred wages,</v>

219
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're wasting 20 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting $50,000 a year and you</v>

220
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 1>are doing that right now and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're young wasting $50,000 a</v>

221
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>year as a way bigger catastrophe than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be for me to waste it because I'm</v>

222
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>not going to last nearly as long and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your life isn't everything,</v>

223
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could ask yourself,</v>

224
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you just stopped</v>

225
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>wasting the opportunities that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>

226
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You be who knows how much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>

227
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>10 times more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 times more efficient.</v>

228
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's the prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how efficient,</v>

229
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>efficient people get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely off the charts.</v>

230
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we all got our act together</v>

231
00:10:56.581 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>collectively and stopped making things</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse because that's another thing</v>

232
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>people do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do they not do what they should</v>

233
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>to make things better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actively attempt to make things</v>

234
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:11.931
<v Speaker 1>worse because they're spiteful or</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful or arrogant or deceitful or</v>

235
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:17.331
<v Speaker 1>homicidal or genocidal or all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things all bundled together in an</v>

236
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>absolutely pathological package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people stopped really,</v>

237
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>really trying just to make things worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how much better they</v>

238
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>would get just because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird dynamic that's</v>

239
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>part of the existential system of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>between human vulnerability,</v>

240
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>social judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of which are are,</v>

241
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are major causes of suffering and the</v>

242
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>failure of individuals to adopt the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that they know they</v>

243
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>should adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's interesting</v>

244
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like one of the another thing</v>

245
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I've often asked my undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>

246
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that,</v>

247
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>that people have that people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience and you know what the</v>

248
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.240
<v Speaker 1>conscience is.</v>

249
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this feeling or voice you have in</v>

250
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 1>your head just before you do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know is stupid,</v>

251
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>telling you that probably you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that stupid thing.</v>

252
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen to it strangely</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

253
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 1>but you go ahead and do it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course exactly what the</v>

254
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 1>conscience told you was going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably happens so that you feel even</v>

255
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>stupider about it than you would if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened by accident because you know,</v>

256
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I knew this was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a warning it was going to happen</v>

257
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>and I went and did it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing too is that that</v>

258
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>conscience operates within people and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand what the hell</v>

259
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

260
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you abided by your</v>

261
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>conscience for five years or for 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

262
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>What sort of position might you be in?</v>

263
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 1>What sort of family might you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of relationship might you be</v>

264
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 1>able to forge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can be bloody sure that a</v>

265
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:53.911
<v Speaker 1>relationship that's forged on the basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of who you actually are is going to be a</v>

266
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>lot stronger and more welcome than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's forged on the basis of who you</v>

267
00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

268
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thAt means that the person you're with</v>

269
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 1>has to deal with the full force of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all your ability and your</v>

270
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very,</v>

271
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>very dIfficult thing to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do negotiate it well,</v>

272
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 1>at least you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere solid to stand and</v>

273
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a real life and it's a great</v>

274
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>basis upon which to bring children into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

275
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can have an actual</v>

276
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>relationship with them instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>torturing them half to death,</v>

277
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:31.771
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens in a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendously large minority of cases.</v>

278
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that too because,</v>

279
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'll close with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I wanted to introduce social</v>

280
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>nixon's readings to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

281
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.550
<v Speaker 1>because It isn't merely that your fate</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on whether or not you get your</v>

282
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>act together and to what degree you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're going to live out</v>

283
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 1>your own genuine being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only your fate,</v>

284
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it's the fate of everyone that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>networked with.</v>

285
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

286
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 9 billion,</v>

287
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>7 billion people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to peak at about $9 million</v>

288
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll decline rapidly,</v>

289
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but 7 billion people in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>

290
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You're just one little dust mote among</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 7 billion.</v>

291
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it really doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or don't do,</v>

292
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>but that's simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong model because you're at</v>

293
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the center of a network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a node in a network.</v>

294
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's even more true now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have social media,</v>

295
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know a thousand people at least</v>

296
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 1>over the course of your life and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a thousand people each and that</v>

297
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>puts you one person away from a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two persons away from a billion.</v>

298
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you're connected and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you do,</v>

299
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.830
<v Speaker 1>they're like dropping a stone in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ripples move outward and they effect</v>

300
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>things in ways that you can't fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehend.</v>

301
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And it means that the things that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you don't do are far more</v>

302
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>important than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you act that way,</v>

303
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terror of realizing that is that it</v>

304
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>actually starts to matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

305
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than living a meaningless</v>

306
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better for it to matter.</v>

307
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>But I mean if you really asked yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be so sure if you had the</v>

308
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.510
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can live with no responsibility</v>

309
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:09.344
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

310
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>The price I pay is that nothing matters</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I can reverse it and everything</v>

311
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 1>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take the responsibility</v>

312
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so obvious to me thAt people</v>

313
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>would take the meaningful path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say,</v>

314
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilists suffer dreadfully because</v>

315
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no meaning in their life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs still suffer.</v>

316
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the advantages,</v>

317
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they have no responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the payoff.</v>

318
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

319
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:33.831
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

320
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't help being nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my belief systems have collapsed.</v>

321
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:37.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

322
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've just allowed them to</v>

323
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>collapse because it's a hell of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier than acting them out.</v>

324
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And the price you pay is a meaningless</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

325
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 1>but you can always whine about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will feel sorry for you and you</v>

326
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 1>have the option of taking the pathway of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the martyr,</v>

327
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's a pretty good deal.</v>

328
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they are,</v>

329
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.040
<v Speaker 1>when the alternative is to bear your</v>
<v Speaker 1>burden properly and to live forthrightly</v>

330
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what units and figured out and so</v>

331
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>many people in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just him,</v>

332
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 1>even though he's the best example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you live a pathological life,</v>

333
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize your society and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough people do that,</v>

334
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>then it's hell really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

335
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 1>and you can read the gulag archipelago</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have the fortitude to do that and</v>

336
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll see exactly what hell is like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can decide if that's a place</v>

337
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to visit or even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>

338
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 1>if it's a light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a place you'd like to visit and</v>

339
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>take all your family and friends because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened in the 20th</v>

340
00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:40.580
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to think about motivation will think</v>

341
00:16:40.581 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 1>about it from the hypothalamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

342
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 1>So we could say one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation does is set goals.</v>

343
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.010
<v Speaker 1>We can say that emotions track progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards goals,</v>

344
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to use that schema even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's not exactly right.</v>

345
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

346
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>motivation determines where you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to aim.</v>

347
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to aim at something to eat</v>

348
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and then that will organize your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions so that you zero out</v>

349
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>everything that isn't relevant to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>task,</v>

350
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>which is almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You concentrate on those few things that</v>

351
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>are going to facilitate your movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

352
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces positive emotion,</v>

353
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>as you move through the world towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal and you see that things are</v>

354
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>laying themselves out that facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your movement forward,</v>

355
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>those things cause positive emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter anything that gets in</v>

356
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that produces negative emotion and</v>

357
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it can be like threat because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to encounter something that</v>

358
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:30.254
<v Speaker 1>gets in the way.</v>

359
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 1>It can be anger so that you move it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

360
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It can be frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

361
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>grief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those would,</v>

362
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a response that serious to an</v>

363
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 1>obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would probably punish the little</v>

364
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:43.060
<v Speaker 1>motivated frame right out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>so you walked downstairs and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're contracting company</v>

366
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>instead of wrecking ball through your</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>

367
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing.</v>

368
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to keep eating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,</v>

369
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that little frame is going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>punished out of existence and some new</v>

370
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 1>goal is going to pop up and instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

371
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we're going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort out is how do you decide when</v>

372
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you've encountered an obstacle that's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>big that you should just quit and go do</v>

373
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:09.810
<v Speaker 1>something else because that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

374
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

375
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you can get into counter productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>persistence pretty easily.</v>

376
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know how people solve that</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

377
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a really complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

378
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:24.861
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna work on that scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals</v>

379
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that are directly relevant to biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival that produces a frame of</v>

380
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a goal,</v>

381
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not a drive and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of behaviors.</v>

382
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a little personality and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality has a viewpoint.</v>

383
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It has thoughts that go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has perceptions,</v>

384
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 1>it has action tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

385
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>You can see this in addiction most</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>

386
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that you find often</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who are alcoholic is they</v>

387
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 1>lie all the time and that's because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

388
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>They built a little alcohol dependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality inside of themselves or a</v>

389
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 1>big one might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 90 percent of their</v>

390
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 1>personality and one of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that component</v>

391
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 1>consists of is all the rationalizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've used over the years to</v>

392
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 1>justify their addiction to themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to other people and so the addiction</v>

393
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 1>has a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and so when the person is off or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're addicted to meth or something</v>

395
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we know the addiction is more.</v>

396
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 1>It's more short term powerful than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

397
00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:30.880
<v Speaker 1>than an alcohol addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say anything and the the,</v>

398
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the words are just tools used to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal and if they happen to</v>

399
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 1>be deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

400
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just practical tools to get</v>

401
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get towards the goal</v>

402
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and you take a nice shot of math or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

403
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you reinforce all those rationales that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use to get the drug and then the</v>

404
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 1>next time you're even a better deceiver</v>
<v Speaker 1>and liar.</v>

405
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna say motivations.</v>

406
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.410
<v Speaker 1>One way of thinking about as they set</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

407
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:57.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

408
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 1>They produce a whole framework of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

409
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that framework of</v>

410
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:04.440
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then emotions emerged inside of</v>

411
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

412
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So the world is framed.</v>

413
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set goals.</v>

414
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 1>You could say the world has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>framed.</v>

415
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>SO motivation sets that frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruise goals,</v>

416
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and actions and inactions</v>

417
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 1>track progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So positive emotion says you're moving</v>

418
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>forward properly towards your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you encounter something you don't</v>

419
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop.</v>

420
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>That's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

421
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not where we thought we were.</v>

422
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we should stop because we don't know</v>

423
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 1>where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing.</v>

424
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Stop frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more powerful negative</v>

425
00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 1>emotions like pain they might make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of there.</v>

426
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So emotions forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

427
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.500
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your emotions within that</v>

428
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

429
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is embedded in your body.</v>

430
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Your emotions are in like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>offshoots of action tendencies.</v>

431
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to think about it</v>

432
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 1>because action is everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

433
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 1>So what are some basic motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of these are regulated by the</v>

434
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

435
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.670
<v Speaker 1>aNd that that tells you just how</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to control system it is.</v>

436
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's useful to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the hypothalamus is that it has</v>

437
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 1>projections going up from it that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tree trunks and inhibitory</v>

438
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>projections coming down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like grape vines.</v>

439
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of control your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus as long as it's not on too</v>

440
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's on in any serious way,</v>

441
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It winds.</v>

442
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So partly what you do to stop yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from falling under the dominion of your</v>

443
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:38.050
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus is to never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever be anywhere where it's action is</v>

444
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

445
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go into a biker bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might find yourself in a</v>

446
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 1>situation where panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defensive aggression is immediately</v>

447
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't want that.</v>

448
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't want the panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want the terror,</v>

449
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the frenzied fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want any of that.</v>

450
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have to run away in</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute panic,</v>

451
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 1>so you just don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a huge,</v>

452
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of how we regulate our</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions is just by never going anywhere</v>

453
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 1>where we have to experience them and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has very little to do with internal</v>

454
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.600
<v Speaker 1>inhibitory control and everything to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with staying where you belong.</v>

455
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.820
<v Speaker 1>The myth of mental illness by thomas sad</v>
<v Speaker 1>as zed,</v>

456
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.020
<v Speaker 1>a s zed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's classic.</v>

457
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You should read it if you're interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology,</v>

458
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.710
<v Speaker 1>read it like it's a class and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said,</v>

459
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 1>most people have problems in living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have psychological problems.</v>

460
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And so I've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite my love for the psychoanalysts,</v>

461
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:41.620
<v Speaker 1>very frequently what I'm doing as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist is helping people have a life</v>

462
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that would work.</v>

463
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can parameterize that.</v>

464
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about some friends that you feel</v>

465
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 1>kind of like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about an intimate relationship with</v>

466
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 1>someone that you can trust that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a future.</v>

467
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a career that puts you in a</v>

468
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy somewhere so at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least you've got some possibility of</v>

469
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>rising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some possibility of stabilizing yourself</v>

470
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Speaker 1>and their schedule and a routine because</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can live without a routine.</v>

471
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You just forget that if you guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a routine,</v>

472
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend you get one going</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you cannot be mentally healthy</v>

473
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 1>without a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to pick a time to get up</v>

474
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever time you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pick one and stick to it because</v>

475
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:31.261
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you disregulate your circadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythms and they regulate your mood and</v>

476
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the morning.</v>

477
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I had lots of clients who have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders.</v>

478
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I had one client who was literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving,</v>

479
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 1>very smart girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>

480
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>There's very little that she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kind of tried to subsist on like</v>

481
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 1>half a cup of rice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came to me and said,</v>

482
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come home.</v>

483
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>All I want to do is watch the same movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over.</v>

484
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is that weird?</v>

485
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on how hard you work.</v>

486
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little weird.</v>

487
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Whatever familiar you're looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort.</v>

488
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So I did an analysis of her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like three quarters of a cup of</v>

489
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 1>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're starving,</v>

490
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.150
<v Speaker 1>eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she modified her diet and you're all.</v>

492
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Our anxiety went away and she had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

493
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

494
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So schedule.</v>

495
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain will thank you for it.</v>

496
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 1>It will stabilize your nervous system</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bit of a plan.</v>

497
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a career.</v>

498
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You need something productive to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>

499
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 1>You need to regulate your use of drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol.</v>

500
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Most particularly alcohol because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>does even a lot of people</v>

501
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.400
<v Speaker 1>need a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the family,</v>

502
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you have your parents and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice if you all got along.</v>

503
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You can work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to work on it and</v>

504
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>you know you probably need children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>

505
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is,</v>

506
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and if you're missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:25:06.301 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you may have a good reason to not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating on one of those dimensions.</v>

508
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you that if you're not</v>

509
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 1>operating reasonably well on four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned six,</v>

510
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're not operating reasonably well</v>
<v Speaker 1>on at least three of them,</v>

511
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically thriving and that's more</v>

512
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic in some sense than</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

513
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

514
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 1>HumAn beings have a nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's things we need and if we have</v>

515
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 1>them well that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't have them well then we</v>

516
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>feel the lack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So behaviorists,</v>

517
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychologists concentrate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more on that sort of thing.</v>

518
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's practical.</v>

519
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It's strategizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a career plan,</v>

520
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to negotiate because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bloody important.</v>

521
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out how to say what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to tell the truth.</v>

522
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 1>He figure out how to listen to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner in particular because if you</v>

523
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 1>listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will actually tell you what they</v>

524
00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>want and sometimes you can give it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and maybe they'll return the favor</v>

525
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 1>and if you practice that for like 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

526
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe you're constantly giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other what you want.</v>

527
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray.</v>

528
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.070
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's two of you under both</v>

529
00:26:23.071 --> 00:26:28.071
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and it's better to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>two brains than one because people think</v>

530
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>differently because of their temperament</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly.</v>

531
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And so the negotiation is where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom arises and it's part of the</v>

532
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:39.890
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychological transformation that's</v>

533
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>attendant on an intimate relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one the fundamental purposes</v>

534
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 2>of a longterm intimate relationship.</v>
