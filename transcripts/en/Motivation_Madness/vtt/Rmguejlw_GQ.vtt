<v Speaker 1>down the street.</v>

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>If you succeed everywhere else and fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have peace and joy and love in your</v>

20
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it profit you to have all of</v>

21
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>this stuff allow outside and have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

22
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>to lay your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rest your mind,</v>

24
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>to know that this is solid and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't shake and this won't bring it is</v>

25
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to you.</v>

26
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucks us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they sense danger or trouble or</v>

27
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>become a weary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always go running into their holes.</v>

28
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That is a safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a secure place.</v>

29
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>He's grounded there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's going to come,</v>

30
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to deal with it because I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place of grounding.</v>

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birds of the air have nests.</v>

32
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a lot of things that one</v>

33
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>of the environment I want to get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I could make it to this nest,</v>

34
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I could get in this place where it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get me if my nes is solid,</v>

35
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>if it's secure and I had the bill list</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess,</v>

36
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to work on this nes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of you who say you don't</v>

37
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>understand my situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand my house,</v>

38
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

39
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand my circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

40
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand that nes must be</v>
<v Speaker 1>built from broken branches.</v>

41
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>If you can build a whole mess from</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken branches,</v>

42
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you can reel a whole house with broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

43
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's gotta be built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem today is we want prefab</v>

44
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:36.181
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to go get somebody else's</v>

45
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 1>husband</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it is to develop.</v>

46
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to do the work of building</v>

47
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to scream at the child,</v>

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>they want to beat the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to yell at the child,</v>

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>but the child has learned a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior from what was a model in front</v>

50
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>of them and you have to get down all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground level wherever they are.</v>

51
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a juvenile detention</v>
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

52
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you got to go where they are and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>building that child block by block by</v>

53
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild people were talking about you.</v>

54
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Well they're criticizing you while</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

55
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>where's your garb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were a Christian.</v>

56
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't have time to worry about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think over outside because his</v>

57
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>family thing is too important to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to be yelling back at my</v>

58
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to build something out of</v>

59
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>these broken pieces that God has given</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

60
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glory to God,</v>

61
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:44.751
<v Speaker 1>where my parents said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what good is it to build a house?</v>

62
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>If you lose the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build the child.</v>

63
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>The child will outlast the house bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child,</v>

64
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>the child will take care of you when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all bill the trial.</v>

65
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm over broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the crazy.</v>

66
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm only got them new beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the question.</v>

67
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.440

<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

68
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.520

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

69
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 1>get down on the floor and start building</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because you can have a mess if you</v>

70
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>can't work with broken branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken husbands,</v>

71
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>broken wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in your house has cracked</v>

72

<v Speaker 1>got her hair done.</v>

77
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Look at the males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Males all shined up pointing that you</v>

<v Speaker 1>somewhere</v>

81
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and the only reason you don't know it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you haven't got close enough to</v>

82
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>see where the cracks are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These three areas,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've got a heavy Kebab and support.</v>

85
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I know you all think that once you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>

86
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do speak in tongues of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight on Jesus.</v>

87
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.620
<v Speaker 1>The Jesus bus is going to come get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take you to be with Jesus,</v>

88
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but while you're waiting at the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hungry.</v>

89
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.690
<v Speaker 1>When I got rid of talk to my wife about</v>
<v Speaker 1>life insurance,</v>

90
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

91
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to talk about it.</v>

92
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want him up discuss it with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all here.</v>

93
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to discuss about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

94
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave you.</v>

95
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it too cause I ain't gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

96
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

97
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be crying and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be hauling and you're going to</v>

98
00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.110
<v Speaker 1>be screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will have to go to the bathroom</v>

99
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 1>so you will need toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't get thirsty.</v>

100
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So he couldn't leave water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't leave.</v>

101
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.380
<v Speaker 1>He will get hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to meet food and if we</v>

102
00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:56.180
<v Speaker 1>don't have no gas or you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a bleed,</v>

103
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I have never seen anybody so brief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't go to the bathroom and</v>

104
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>eat and live and breathe and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring you back to reality.</v>

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>When you look up the word infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find that it means unbeliever.</v>

122
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

123
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 1>But if you dig deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find it is not just an</v>

124
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 1>unbeliever who could have never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to the gospel.</v>

125
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>If somebody who's been exposed to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected it</v>

<v Speaker 1>and terrorists,</v>

129
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.890
<v Speaker 1>they refer to us as infidels because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purest form of the word infidel,</v>

130
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a to have rejected the truth.</v>

<v Speaker 1>An infant of the Bible says you are</v>

155
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>worse than an infidel if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide for your house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're worse than an infidel because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were exposed to something that you</v>

159
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>rejected though you stayed in the house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>primary meaning you rejected an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

164
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>You know how you would judge it an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity because you felt like you</v>

165
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>were rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why you felt like you were</v>

166
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>rejected because she didn't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.500
<v Speaker 1>How do you break the infidel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infidelity.</v>

168
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.970
<v Speaker 1>When we start having real conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>about expectations and responsibilities</v>

169
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.570
<v Speaker 1>mutually and you live up to yours and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live up to my,</v>

170
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>then there's not abandonment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we're not abandoned then we don't</v>

171
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:39.831
<v Speaker 1>have to fake like we love each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which creates resentment because love is</v>

172
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>hard to be fate.</v>

173
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>So I will stop paying you money to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>me go live.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to the Potter's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so,</v>

176
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:21.050
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of times we give you stuff to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace us.</v>

177
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to feel in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me some tea when I fill in his room,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel in this room than there are a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people in this room who have</v>

179
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:33.771
<v Speaker 1>abandoned kids cause he hurts you</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents cause they disappointed you</v>

180
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 1>spouses because he didn't get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

181
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel in this room a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are still there but not there,</v>

182
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and so you live in your life like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden.</v>

183
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.570

<v Speaker 1>but it's not grounded.</v>

184
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
<v Speaker 1>not grounded can blow away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can blow away and it's expensive to</v>

186
00:12:13.161 --> 00:12:16.100
<v Speaker 1>lose it emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mentally,</v>

187
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.770
<v Speaker 1>it's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generationally.</v>

188
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you can't survive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you can't make it on</v>

<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

191
00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:26.090

<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

192
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there will be a deduction.</v>

193
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I start showing them miracles,</v>
