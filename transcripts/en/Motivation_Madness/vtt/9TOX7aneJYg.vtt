1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even make a resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2
00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they made him from years and</v>

3
00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>years and years and they know they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to follow through.</v>

4
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to disappoint yourself?</v>

5
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to be upset with yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why even bother to set a new standard</v>

6
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>for this year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the same as last year.</v>

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Many of us don't act because we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's approval.</v>

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>We want everybody to like us and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept us.</v>

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of us don't do the things that we</v>

11
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>want to do and don't act because of lack</v>
<v Speaker 2>of self confidence.</v>

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe enough in ourselves.</v>

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>There's no denying that inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's gonna make you</v>

14
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>happy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're ahead and the decades ahead,</v>

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be having you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where on a regular basis you</v>

16
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>feel like your life is making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's gotta be a vision that's</v>

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you know it's going to be</v>

18
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>a gift to make sure that it happens.</v>

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>If you want to do anything worthwhile in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started working to develop</v>

22
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.541
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

23
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I want you to practice everyday being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disc jockey.</v>

24
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have any job now.</v>

25
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

26
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 2>You said that it's better to be prepared</v>
<v Speaker 2>for an opportunity and not have one than</v>

27
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 2>to have an opportunity and not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared.</v>

28
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 2>No excuse that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you decided that you want to do this,</v>

29
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 2>if it becomes hot and do it hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it difficult.</v>

30
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.973
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

31
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Beginning of the year we have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

32
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but it goes beyond tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something inside of us that makes</v>

33
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>us want to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of it is the calendar</v>

34
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>gives us this idea that we get to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh start,</v>

35
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>that we get to start from fresh and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this great victory and it's really,</v>

36
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the calendar itself is quite arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful to use it,</v>

37
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>but if you didn't use it effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's use the calendar to serve you</v>

38
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just see what does it really take</v>

39
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>to make this thing happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no denying that inside</v>

40
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's going to make you</v>

41
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're adding the decades ahead.</v>

42
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be having you up an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where on a regular basis you</v>

43
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>feel like your life is making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thank you.</v>

44
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>What would your life be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to keep your commitment?</v>

45
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 2>It is important and the area of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating yourself.</v>

46
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 2>It's important to know why you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

47
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>because that mine will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why bother?</v>

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Why go through all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is too hard.</v>

49
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw in the towel.</v>

50
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth it.</v>

51
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>If you make the changes in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be proud this year and</v>

52
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>no amount of money or accolades from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people can mirror the feeling of</v>

53
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>being proud of knowing you've taken back</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of your life or you've taken a</v>

54
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>great life to another level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you do that,</v>

55
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you have something you can give other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

56
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Would it be your kids and your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your family and ultimately that's</v>

57
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>why it's about.</v>
