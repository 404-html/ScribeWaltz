1
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>What are the major secrets of success is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always knew more than you're paid for</v>

2
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you will always be paid more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what you're getting now.</v>

3
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must use your time well every</v>

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.431
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hour,</v>

5
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>this life is not a rehearsal for</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else in life.</v>

7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>This is the real thing.</v>

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of this course is not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make you an expert,</v>

9
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but to give you the tools of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts,</v>

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>all successful people in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit these points reasonably</v>

11
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made a decision that what you want</v>

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>is the greatest amount of practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usable information in the shortest</v>

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are quite capable in your own</v>

14
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>business and in your own activities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this material away and select from</v>

15
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it what you need at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must have a very,</v>

16
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>very strong desire to be successful in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in order to attempt the</v>

17
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>business enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like embarking on a journey across</v>

18
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>an uncharted ocean because no matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you start off with as a compass or</v>

19
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>a destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tides and the winds are going to</v>

20
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>change your direction very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

21
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>It must have very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong desire.</v>

22
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>You must really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to be independent.</v>

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>You must really want a ton of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must want the freedom.</v>

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You must want the success because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be buffeted by the storms of</v>

25
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>business life and without a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense desire.</v>

26
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be washed overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that you have to have</v>

27
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>is you have to have very clear burning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling goals to which you're</v>

28
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to determine exactly</v>

29
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>what it is you want to accomplish in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of income,</v>

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>in terms of business growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you want to be in one,</v>

31
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:40.881
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

32
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>10 years and you have to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're doing on a day to day</v>

33
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:49.481
<v Speaker 1>basis is consistent with your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we have found is that</v>

34
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>if you are not doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributes to achieving your aim,</v>

35
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>then what you're doing probably detracts</v>
<v Speaker 1>from achieving your aim and one of the</v>

36
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:03.011
<v Speaker 1>major reasons for failure in life is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to focus single mindedly on</v>

37
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>one thing at a time.</v>

38
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about this over and over as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through the course.</v>

39
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in this course is aimed at</v>

40
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>giving you the targets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinpoint targets for you to focus on</v>

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.460
<v Speaker 1>in each area of business development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the key things that you have to</v>

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>hone in on and concentrate on in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be successful?</v>

43
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.610
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must absolutely believe yourself to</v>

44
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>be capable in this field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we find is that</v>

45
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are unique and have</v>

46
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>remarkable talents and couldn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal things in a short period of</v>

47
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the great majority of business</v>

48
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 or 90% are of primarily average</v>

49
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not great geniuses.</v>

50
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>They don't have extraordinarily high Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>is but they do have a very strong belief</v>

51
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>in themselves and their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>

52
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe themselves especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be inferior to anybody else and they</v>

53
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>don't believe that other people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially more talented or more capable</v>

54
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my years of experience,</v>

55
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I have sometimes heard about business</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and heard about business</v>

56
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>people running these organizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how phenomenally talented they must be</v>

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>and then when I go to work to consult</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these organizations and I spent</v>

58
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>hours with these same people that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>read about in the newspapers,</v>

59
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I sit down and I find that really quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people,</v>

60
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they just happened to be focused or</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized along a particular line and</v>

61
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>happen to be doing things a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than other people are doing</v>

62
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>and we can think of all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of that.</v>

63
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>John D Rockefeller said that the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important requirements for business</v>

64
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>success or patients and foresight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially patients,</v>

65
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do not have patients,</v>

66
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't be successful in business</v>
<v Speaker 1>because almost everything in business is</v>

67
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>timing.</v>

68
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a too soon and there's a too</v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

69
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes as business people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always want things to soon,</v>

70
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>we always want things to happen at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year in advance of their scheduled</v>

71
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And very often we push and we press to</v>

72
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>make things happen early and it causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but difficulties.</v>

73
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And of course the ability to delay</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>

74
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>We live in a society where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants everything.</v>

75
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a society where we have been</v>

76
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>raised on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that they're 30 60 and 90</v>

77
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>minutes solutions to all the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of life.</v>

78
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And we have a tendency as adults having</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown up with 20 or 30 years of</v>

79
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>television to always be looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick solutions.</v>

80
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>We see all our life that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental and complex problems of</v>

81
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>human existence are solved in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>short TV segments.</v>

82
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And they're very most we're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear as a miniseries.</v>

83
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>We have to realize that sometimes people</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

84
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>market problems take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was in a very,</v>

85
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>very tight fix in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had over ordered,</v>

86
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>we had bought too much of a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

87
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>We had overextended our lines of credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person that I was working for,</v>

88
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>we we're talking about whether or not we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

89
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined the possibilities of the company.</v>

90
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I never forget him saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

91
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it's too early to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

92
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been in business for six months.</v>

93
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months is not enough in the</v>

94
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

95
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>we have to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's give it another few months.</v>

96
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting enough,</v>

97
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>as a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an aggressive impetuous person,</v>

98
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>another few months seemed like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>

99
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but as it happened another few months</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the difference between failure and</v>

100
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>tremendous success for that business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just took a little bit longer for the</v>

101
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>business to get into the marketplace.</v>

102
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we always make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake with is we think when we</v>

103
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>introduced a new product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know it's a great product,</v>

104
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>everybody's going to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's gonna recognize the same</v>

105
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recognize however,</v>

106
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>people change their opinions and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas toward products very,</v>

107
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to be in the</v>

108
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>marketplace for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months,</v>

109
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

110
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years before the product finally</v>

111
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>takes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Home computers is a perfect example.</v>

112
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Like Ibm decided there was no future in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the home computer market and so they</v>

113
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>decided to stay out of it completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly the market exploded and</v>

114
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody came to different conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally you'll find that one of the</v>

115
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>keys to success in business is what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>called method.</v>

116
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Working systematically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patiently doing the right things,</v>

117
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dotting the i's,</v>

118
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>crossing the t's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then doing them as quickly as</v>

119
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>possible are the basic elements.</v>

120
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep doing the right things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right way,</v>

121
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be successful over time.</v>

122
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You put all the odds on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

123
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>every single thing we talk about in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

124
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I have either done wrong and it's cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a lot of money,</v>

125
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>or I've worked with corporations who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done them wrong,</v>

126
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and many of those corporations have gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt as a result and lost</v>

127
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I used to hear some of these</v>

128
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:21.831
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

129
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't particularly like that.</v>

130
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That's not convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't fit with my schedule.</v>

131
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So I would ignore that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

132
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ignore that point and the rule</v>

133
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>won't apply to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this once.</v>

134
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And when you've ended up selling your</v>
<v Speaker 1>house and selling your car in order to</v>

135
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>pay your bills because the market didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you to get away with it,</v>

136
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>even once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you learn the lesson next time you</v>

137
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

138
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.373
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

139
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final analysis,</v>

140
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who you are that makes the</v>

141
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>difference in success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the internal,</v>

142
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the personal qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense desire,</v>

143
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>intense goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense belief in your ability to</v>

144
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing drive patients and the</v>

145
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>ability to delay gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opportunity area that we're in</v>

146
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the one of the greatest</v>

147
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>areas of opportunity in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is that we have entered into</v>

148
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>the age of the entrepreneur as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the intrepreneur if you like,</v>

149
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are more corporations being</v>

150
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>formed now in our country than at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other period in history and the rate of</v>

151
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>company formation is accelerating</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically and this is only the</v>

152
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>registered corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of sole proprietorships and</v>

153
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>partnerships that are forming that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even get registered in the corporate</v>

154
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>registries is absolutely astronomical.</v>

155
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It's up something like 500% over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years.</v>

156
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Today in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are something like a million</v>

157
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>businesses alone being incorporated</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

158
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago it was 200,000 businesses a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

159
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all those businesses,</v>

160
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>80% will fail in the first four to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

161
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>This is a part of a dynamic economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the purposes of this course is to</v>

162
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>make sure that your business doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail and that if you're in business and</v>

163
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>your business is not as prosperous as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like it to be,</v>

164
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that it become more prosperous rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than less prosperous of over 800,000</v>

165
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 1>millionaires in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 80% of them are self made.</v>

166
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Over 80% of those millionaires started</v>
<v Speaker 1>off with nothing penniless,</v>

167
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>with an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a product or a service,</v>

168
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>and they built their business to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where it is today.</v>

169
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And we know by examining the careers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lives of most self made millionaires</v>

170
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain things that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did and they're all in this course.</v>

171
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>We find that there are three major</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why so many businesses fail.</v>

172
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Number one is lack of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know how to run a business</v>

173
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two is lack of support.</v>

174
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>They cannot get the support they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their suppliers,</v>

175
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>from their creditors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their bankers,</v>

176
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>from their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their customers and so on.</v>

177
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And number three is lack of capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of money.</v>

178
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.380
<v Speaker 1>They cannot get enough money to tide</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

179
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Over the inevitable tough times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of this course,</v>

180
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>the key objective of this course is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the knowledge necessary to be</v>

181
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>able to get the support and the capital</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you require.</v>

182
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 1>We know that it is not a terribly</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult matter to borrow funds for a</v>

183
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>good business idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know how to put together a</v>

184
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>business plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single commercial bank in our</v>

185
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>society is there for one specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

186
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>which is to make loans to business.</v>

187
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They'd like to make loans to consumers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like to make loans on homes.</v>

188
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>But basically their reason is to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>good business loans.</v>

189
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you have the knowledge necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put together the right business plan</v>

190
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>and the right business program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be able to make the</v>

191
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>applications to raise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>the various finances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

193
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it is the knowledge of doing the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and doing right things right.</v>

194
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>That gets you the support necessary in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to generate the markets,</v>

195
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>to get the suppliers to back you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get the capital in order to</v>

196
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>produce the product or service and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

197
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So they all tie together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the knowledge must come first and</v>

198
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>more people fail from lack of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for any other reason.</v>

199
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the key requirements for</v>

200
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>business success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we say,</v>

201
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>business is an art as well as a science.</v>

202
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of practical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgement,</v>

203
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:47.770
<v Speaker 1>foresight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and luck.</v>

204
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Really successful in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must never forget the basics.</v>

205
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking last night that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business is like a child.</v>

206
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Every single child is unique and</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct.</v>

207
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>It has unique and distinct influences</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on it.</v>

208
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It develops a unique personality and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter how many children you have and</v>

209
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>have two children in the same and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>only have two people the same in the</v>

210
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses are exactly the same.</v>

211
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>They all require a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing,</v>

212
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>caring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support,</v>

213
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

214
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 1>They all have phases that they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through from infancy through to</v>

215
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>adolescence and adulthood and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough,</v>

216
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>because business is so big and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important in western society,</v>

217
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not billions of dollars have been</v>

218
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>spent studying of businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are enormous faculties and some of</v>

219
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the most intelligent men and women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world are working simply fulltime,</v>

220
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 1>40 50 hours a week studying what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful businesses work.</v>

221
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And so it is possible just like there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are many thousands of psychologists,</v>

222
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors and so on working on studying</v>

223
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:45.810
<v Speaker 1>what makes healthy children healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

224
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are ways to raise healthy</v>

225
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's waste to retail the business.</v>

226
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So what are the basics of business</v>
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>

227
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Number one role of business in a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>society is to organize and coordinate</v>

228
00:10:56.761 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the factors of production to produce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goods and services that people want at</v>

229
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are willing and able to pay the</v>

230
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 1>role of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the role of the business</v>

231
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entrepreneur is to combine resources</v>

232
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>to take men materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>

233
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>capital and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Combined them into products and services</v>

234
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>and get them to the market in size and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shapes,</v>

235
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>qualities and quantities that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to buy,</v>

236
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 1>are willing to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All businesses that are successful are</v>

237
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

238
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>All businesses that are unsuccessful are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it wrong.</v>

239
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is that that it is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

240
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>needs and desires of the customers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine all business activity.</v>

241
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 1>It is not what producers produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is what customers want.</v>

242
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>That determines business activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

243
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>if a company is producing what customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and producing it in a cost</v>

244
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>efficient and effective way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will grow and prosper.</v>

245
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>If a company is not growing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>prospering and that's the first corolla</v>

246
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>rate and it means it is not producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goods and services that people want.</v>

247
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.730
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always us.</v>

248
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>We are always personally as business</v>
<v Speaker 1>people responsible for the success or</v>

249
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>lack of success of our enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either we're doing it right and if we're</v>

250
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>doing it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace will tell us if we're</v>

251
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 1>doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The marketplace will tell us,</v>

252
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's always like people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace that know what's right,</v>

253
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's best as customers for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same services we want at the very</v>

254
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>most for the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we are also ruthless,</v>

255
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.810
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding and this oil.</v>

256
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody can offer it to us cheaper,</v>

257
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.874
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

258
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>we'll buy it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have people who will work for a</v>

259
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>company or work with a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy from a company for 20 years and a</v>

260
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>new company will spring up on the block</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all transfer their business</v>

261
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 1>across the street to that company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was doing some work in</v>

262
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>the financial industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that if one financial</v>

263
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>institution raised its deposit rates by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eighth of a percent,</v>

264
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it would be like tilting a big tub of</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

265
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>That money and deposits would start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow to it from all other financial</v>

266
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why even an eighth of a percent</v>

267
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person could deal with a bank or a</v>

268
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>trust company or a savings and loan for</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>

269
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 1>The instant that another savings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loan offers an eighth of a percent more,</v>

270
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll walk right across the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their money for that eighth of a</v>

271
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 1>percent and this is just the way we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings.</v>

272
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>We all want to be better off in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

273
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Then we are in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

274
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>every action we take is to improve our</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

275
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since we are always acting to</v>

276
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>improve our condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always want to improve our condition</v>

277
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 1>in the very most possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody is buying from us,</v>

278
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it's because they have come to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that all things being equal,</v>

279
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>what we are offering is at that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that time better than what</v>

280
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>anybody else is offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they are not buying from us,</v>

281
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>they have made the decision that what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are offering is not as good as what</v>

282
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 1>somebody else is offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>

283
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about this in marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

284
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 1>we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

285
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 1>customers always make rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

286
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 1>which means that customers are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

287
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always find it interesting when I talked</v>

288
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>to business people and business people</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

289
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:48.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>these customers just don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're missing.</v>

291
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Customers are stupid.</v>

292
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't see that what we're offering</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is the very best they could get</v>

293
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 1>through the very finest quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very cheapest.</v>

294
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no customers or very smart customers are</v>

295
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

296
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>customers are geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Customers can discern the right</v>

297
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 1>differences every single day of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

298
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and it is never the customer who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

299
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 1>It's always the businessperson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the hallmarks of</v>

300
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>successful businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

301
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.320
<v Speaker 1>if we're not selling enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're not doing enough business,</v>

302
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 1>it's because of something that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

303
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

304
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 1>we know in a dynamic market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are always opportunities for those</v>

305
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>who can find new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

306
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper ways to serve customers with</v>

307
00:14:29.951 --> 00:14:32.860
<v Speaker 1>what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the largest firms in the world</v>

308
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>today did not exist 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many billion dollar</v>

309
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>organizations that they were not even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person's mind 10 years ago,</v>

310
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and there are many billion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations of 10 and 20 years ago</v>

311
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>that don't exist anymore or that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>in greatly reduced form.</v>

312
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 1>We live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

313
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>in a dynamic market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are always companies and</v>

314
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>individuals coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are always companies and</v>

315
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>individuals going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always happening.</v>

316
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 1>We see it with changing economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing demands,</v>

317
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 1>change and trends and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're a customer needs</v>

318
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>unmet or better or cheaper ways to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

319
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>There are money making opportunities for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative and rt,</v>

320
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 1>which means that as long as people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have everything they want in life,</v>

321
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>there are always opportunities to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>and build successful businesses.</v>

322
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>The only question is do we take the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out what it is that people want?</v>

323
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>They're always business opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those who are willing to lower their</v>

324
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

325
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 1>to offer new products or services or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your customers.</v>

326
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.853
<v Speaker 1>We've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>done a lot of research on employment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find that one of the things that</v>

328
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 1>stops individuals who are unemployed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting reemployed on of the major</v>

329
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>things is they keep insisting that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do what they were doing before</v>

330
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 1>they got laid off or before their</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry collapsed and they want to keep</v>

331
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 1>on doing that.</v>

332
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 1>And then when somebody to hire them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that here in this place where they</v>

333
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 1>are living because it's convenient for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

334
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize that in order to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>reemployed as an individual,</v>

335
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>if your industry is changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your skills are becoming obsolete for</v>

336
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to become reemployed,</v>

337
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to restructure what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering.</v>

338
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to either offer it to new</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets,</v>

339
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to change your wage levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to demand less.</v>

340
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I've counseled with people who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was already $30,000 a year and I got</v>

341
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>laid off and I cannot find another job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

342
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mean you cannot find another job?</v>

343
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So I've been everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find another job.</v>

344
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutical hiring in your industry.</v>

345
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hiring,</v>

346
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:19.410
<v Speaker 1>but they're only paying $20,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

347
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:20.210
<v Speaker 1>do you know why?</v>

348
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has happened is that the market</v>

349
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>value of the service you offer has</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped to $20,000 a year.</v>

350
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer 30 you may have been paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 under unique circumstances,</v>

351
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but where do you have a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to earn $30,000 trudging the</v>

352
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>streets looking for a job that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>there or taking a job at $20,000 and</v>

353
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 1>increasing your value with companies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We often find that we offer our products</v>

354
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:46.550
<v Speaker 1>and services at the very most that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get for those products and services,</v>

355
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the market will take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaboom and the price will drop out of</v>

356
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 1>our products and services if we continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to demand the same prices where we</v>

357
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 1>continue to try to sell the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>products at the same price as to the</v>

358
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:00.040
<v Speaker 1>same markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very often the market was saying,</v>

359
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>

360
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Often we have to lower our prices.</v>

361
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Often we have to change our customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I'd like to point out is that</v>

362
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:11.381
<v Speaker 1>a business enterprise is like a bundle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resources as a bundle of resources.</v>

363
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It can be turned in any direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a bundle of capabilities,</v>

364
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:17.690
<v Speaker 1>talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be turned to manufacturing and</v>

365
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 1>selling dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be turned in another direction to</v>

366
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing computers.</v>

367
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It can go into real estate development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can market food products.</v>

368
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>In something like 70 or 80% of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses that we surveyed,</v>

369
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 1>we found that the people who achieve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest success in entrepreneurial</v>

370
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 1>activities did not achieve them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas where they first started.</v>

371
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They achieved them in areas different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what they started.</v>

372
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 1>The most important single skill in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business is the ability to get the goods</v>

373
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 1>out of the woods and move them to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

374
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Consumer accompanied can absorb mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every single area of endeavor,</v>

375
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but it cannot absorb mistakes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing because if marketing stops,</v>

376
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the company stops to profits are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>a result.</v>

377
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Profits are not the objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who start into business with the</v>

378
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>goal of serving customers well by giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>them the products or services they want</v>

379
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 1>or usually successful and and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>profits follow customers pay all wages,</v>

380
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 1>not corporations and everyone has at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least one customer.</v>

381
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we have to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again is who is our</v>

382
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 1>customer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is your customer?</v>

383
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Who do I have to satisfy in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful?</v>

384
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>And then as you'll see as we go on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit later,</v>

385
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 1>who is my biggest customer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who do I have to satisfy the most in</v>

386
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 1>order to be the most successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to work for the chairman of a</v>

387
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>large conglomerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I mentioned before and very early</v>

388
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 1>in my career with the chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I was doing about five or</v>

389
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>six things simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made the decision that I had only one</v>

390
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 1>customer and that organization and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer was the chairman.</v>

391
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>And as long as I satisfied that</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer,</v>

392
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I could be slow or slack or make</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes in any area.</v>

393
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 1>But as long as this chairman was happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything would be fine.</v>

394
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 1>If I did brilliantly in every area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't satisfy the chairman,</v>

395
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be in serious trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd suggest that has a very,</v>

396
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>very good strategy or your success will</v>
<v Speaker 1>always be determined by what you do,</v>

397
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the demand for your product or service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the difficulty of replacing you.</v>

398
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.350
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing is how valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your service to other people?</v>

399
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 1>How valuable is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell how valuable it is by how</v>

400
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:16.260
<v Speaker 1>much people are willing to pay you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

401
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And the same strategies adhere here</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a corporation,</v>

402
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 1>doing everything possible to increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of what you do for your</v>

403
00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 1>company makes you a more valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

404
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Xerox had an advertisement that came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago and the advertisement</v>

405
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 1>showed I sort of a little cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the first cartoon,</v>

406
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>there was a little boy with the lemonade</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>

407
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 1>said lemonade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 cents a glass scrawled on a sign.</v>

408
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And he's sitting there with a picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some glasses and it's shows on</v>

409
00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>another little boy walking up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up his own lemonade stand next</v>

410
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:49.290
<v Speaker 1>door to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his little sign said lemonade,</v>

411
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 1>5 cents a glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it shows the two of them</v>

412
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 1>looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here they have the identical product</v>

413
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 1>with the identical stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last little caption showed</v>

414
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the second person who had entered the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemonade market with a rose in each</v>

415
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it says when people compete products</v>

416
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 1>and get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

417
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>he had added a little bit of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>special and it was the little bit extra</v>

418
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that made all the difference.</v>

419
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wish to earn more,</v>

420
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you must concentrate on increasing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>value of your services that you will</v>

421
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>always be rewarded in direct proportion</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what you do and the value of what</v>

422
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your whole job in life is simply,</v>

423
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>this is to increase your value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do everything possible to increase your</v>

424
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening to tapes like this is a very,</v>

425
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 1>very important investment in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

426
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market only pays superior rewards</v>

427
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 1>for superior goods and services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pays average rewards for average</v>

428
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:52.411
<v Speaker 1>goods and services and it pays inferior</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewards for inferior goods and services.</v>

429
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important,</v>

430
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and we talk about this in the session on</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic marketing,</v>

431
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to identify what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that you do in an excellent fashion.</v>

432
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you would do that is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

433
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>that's so special that you're better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else was doing it because</v>

434
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>unless you can answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not ready to go into business.</v>

435
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next is that it's business success</v>

436
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 1>comes from direct developing excellence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a particular market related area.</v>

437
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I give you a perfect example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing excellence.</v>

438
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Ibm and one of my favorite examples is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most successful companies in</v>

439
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IBM has developed excellence in a</v>

440
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 1>particular area and that is service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've developed excellence in a key</v>

441
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 1>area and the market pays them a premium</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

442
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 1>makes them one of the most profitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most successful companies on earth</v>

443
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's because they recognize very</v>
<v Speaker 1>early in business that service was a a</v>

444
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:43.231
<v Speaker 1>key consideration to the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would rather have leisure than</v>

445
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a great demand,</v>

446
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:49.510
<v Speaker 1>a great desire within the human soul to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it easy to put up your feet,</v>

447
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to relax,</v>

448
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 1>to just take it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However it is the successful people who</v>

449
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:57.370
<v Speaker 1>pay the extra price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go the extra mile,</v>

450
00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 1>do the extra little things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the extra habits to get up extra</v>

451
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>early in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the extra courses,</v>

452
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 1>read the extra books and so on.</v>

453
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Those are the keys to success in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

454
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's always doing the little bit extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you always know that if you are</v>

455
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>contributing greater value than you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking out,</v>

456
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 1>then you know that you are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing in success and you're always</v>

457
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>growing in income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're only contributing exactly as</v>

458
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 1>much as you're taking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you're staying.</v>

459
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're contributing less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're taking out,</v>

460
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:31.780
<v Speaker 1>it means that you're falling behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the master key to riches is self</v>

461
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the seven personal qualities</v>

462
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that assured success in business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

463
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you must know yourself and know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is you want in life.</v>

464
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Goal orientation is an essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement of all successful people and</v>

465
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 1>as we'll talk about later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know lack of goal orientation goes</v>

466
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 1>hand in hand with failure and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single walk of life,</v>

467
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody should be able to wake you up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at three o'clock in the morning and</v>

468
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 1>asked you what is your major definite</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose in life?</v>

469
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>What is your number one goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to accomplish more than</v>

470
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>anything else in the next three to five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

471
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And you should be able to wake up out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sound sleep and tell that person</v>

472
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must know it crystal clear.</v>

473
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>We know that our goals always determine</v>
<v Speaker 1>the direction that we go in life.</v>

474
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something by thorough last</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

475
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It says that you should go confidently</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the direction of your dreams.</v>

476
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It says that try to live the life that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have imagined for yourself and you</v>

477
00:23:24.391 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>will be astonished at how far and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast you actually go in life if you</v>

478
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 1>always tried to live consistent with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dreams about yourself for the</v>

479
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Conrad Hilton said that you've got</v>

480
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 1>to have a dream if you want to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream come true.</v>

481
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Most self made millionaires compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to billionaires.</v>

482
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Most people starting their businesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare themselves to millionaires,</v>

483
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 1>but once they get to be a millionaire</v>
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>

484
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 1>they start to compare themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaires.</v>

485
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how poorly I'm doing in comparison</v>

486
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 1>to the billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in every case,</v>

487
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it's the vision that is the activating</v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

488
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 1>The greater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more compelling,</v>

489
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 1>the more burning that division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea of where you want to go and</v>

490
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:08.080
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find that companies that achieved</v>

491
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 1>great things always have somebody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company who has a mission,</v>

492
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.070
<v Speaker 1>the wants to do something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

493
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a gentleman at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university and not long ago who spent 25</v>

494
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 1>years from the time he entered</v>
<v Speaker 1>biochemistry in his late teens.</v>

495
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>He spent 25 years and his whole dream in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life was to make a major contribution to</v>

496
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:29.700
<v Speaker 1>DNA research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic molecule of all of human life.</v>

497
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>That's all they wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for 25 years he had that as a vision</v>

498
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and as a mission and in the 25th year he</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a major breakthrough,</v>

499
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 1>which is now put him in line for a Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 1>prize and you'll probably go down in</v>

500
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>history as one of the great biochemist</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the century and this is what kept the</v>

501
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 1>person going for 25 years was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>

502
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the ability to focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

503
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>The ability to focus as we've said and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say over again is the absolute</v>

504
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 1>critical requirement for success in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business to set targets and to aim at</v>

505
00:24:58.401 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 1>those targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

506
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can be as successful</v>

507
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:04.520
<v Speaker 1>as other people are because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more advantages and more benefits and</v>

508
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:07.130
<v Speaker 1>more intelligence and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you believe it?</v>

509
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.230
<v Speaker 1>A person who is focused of average</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence can run circles around a</v>

510
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 1>person who is a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the focus.</v>

511
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That is why people come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities with phd degrees and with</v>

512
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:23.921
<v Speaker 1>master's degrees and with sometimes five</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 15 years of advanced education and</v>

513
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 1>they can barely make a living and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people quit school in grade 10 and grade</v>

514
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>11 and they come out of school and five</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 10 years later they have their own</v>

515
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 1>successful businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the basic talents,</v>

516
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 1>although talents are important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>education is important.</v>

517
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the ability to focus the talents</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have,</v>

518
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.200
<v Speaker 1>like a an arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

519
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:46.550
<v Speaker 1>like a sniper to be able to hit specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>targets and that's why you don't have to</v>

520
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:48.620
<v Speaker 1>think of yourself in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

521
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Many of us hesitate about going ahead in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business because we think that somehow</v>

522
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 1>we lack the talents and abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at other people who are</v>

523
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>successful in their businesses and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think those people must have unique</v>

524
00:25:58.431 --> 00:25:59.264
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>

525
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It's only when you get to know these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and meet these people that you</v>

526
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:04.550
<v Speaker 1>begin to realize that they're no</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from you or I.</v>

527
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 1>The only difference between a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>business person or let us say a person</v>

528
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 1>who was launched the business in one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>

529
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>is what is the person who launched the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business has done it.</v>

530
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.800
<v Speaker 1>A person who has not has not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this by studying,</v>

531
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like hundreds if not thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of entrepreneurs.</v>

532
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next personal quality that assures</v>

533
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 1>success as you must determine the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will have to pay in order to be</v>

534
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 1>successful and then resolve to pay that</v>
<v Speaker 1>price for every single thing you want in</v>

535
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:28.850
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a price,</v>

536
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to has to be paid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature always demands of the price to be</v>

537
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:37.661
<v Speaker 1>paid in advance and the price in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business success is invariably hard,</v>

538
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:38.600
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>

539
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 1>In order to be successful in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work hard.</v>

540
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>In order to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work harder.</v>

541
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.090
<v Speaker 1>In order to be even more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work harder.</v>

542
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no substitute for hard work in</v>

543
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people say,</v>

544
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

545
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 1>look at that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the right to sell or distribute</v>

546
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 1>a product or service and they made it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four or five years.</v>

547
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 1>You never realize that behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>

548
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 1>that person was probably working 1618</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day probably for five years</v>

549
00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 1>before they got their break in five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years after they got their break.</v>

550
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 1>All you see at the end result is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice House and a nice car.</v>

551
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I reason I mentioned this is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start a business,</v>

552
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:13.651
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

553
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'll have to work a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra hours a day.</v>

554
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as somebody once told me,</v>

555
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 1>when you start your own business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have to work half the time.</v>

556
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You only have to work half days from</v>
<v Speaker 1>then on and you can decide which 12</v>

557
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:26.640
<v Speaker 1>hours it's going to be.</v>

558
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>In a recent study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found that in our society you work</v>

559
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>eight hours a day for survival and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything over that you work for</v>

560
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're only working eight hours a</v>

561
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:43.740
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't do anything more than survive</v>

562
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 1>every additional hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're working for yourself or</v>

563
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:52.071
<v Speaker 1>someone else is for success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very important that you keep</v>

564
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 1>putting in those additional hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's extra reading,</v>

565
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 1>extra study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra work.</v>

566
00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 1>There are many universities and many</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and professors who have</v>

567
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 1>studied millionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make this a business.</v>

568
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I've studied millionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing them,</v>

569
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.430
<v Speaker 1>bringing them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

570
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>looking at their lifestyles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at their habits to find out what</v>

571
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing they all have in common is</v>

572
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:16.821
<v Speaker 1>that they are always thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and they work extremely hard.</v>

573
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Number three characteristic is self</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

574
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to accept a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your life and for</v>

575
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:24.990
<v Speaker 1>everything that you are or ever will be.</v>

576
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Our great old saying if it's to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to me,</v>

577
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acceptance of personal</v>

578
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens too is the hallmark of the truly</v>

579
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly successful peak performing</v>

580
00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the opposite of accepting full</v>

581
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:44.040
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is making excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many people have said that making</v>

582
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>excuses is a disease that is faithful to</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

583
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 1>No matter what difficulty or handicap</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have,</v>

584
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there is somebody else who has had far</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater difficulties or handicaps than</v>

585
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you who has gone on to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

586
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And there are probably thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have had difficulties in</v>

587
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 1>handicap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is far greater than any you will ever</v>

588
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>imagine in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've gone on to be successful in</v>

589
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>

590
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:08.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the key to maturity is that</v>

591
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must make a total commitment to your</v>

592
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

593
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Burn your bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total commitment is absolutely essential</v>

594
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.350
<v Speaker 1>in order to be successful in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Charlie Jones,</v>

595
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 1>the great humorous says that the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>keys to success are simply this set</v>

596
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>goals he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then make a total commitment to</v>

597
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>achieving those goals and then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing dissuade you.</v>

598
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Burn your bridges behind you and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing dissuade you from going for that</v>

599
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to straddle.</v>

600
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many people who have started a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business on the side and then what they</v>

601
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 1>tried to do is they tried to stay with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their main line of work and they've</v>

602
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 1>tried to make their business successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>too and do you know what happens?</v>

603
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Almost invariably their work</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorates to the point where their</v>

604
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 1>employment is threatened and they lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>their money and their business.</v>

605
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I found over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again,</v>

606
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and I've been told this by hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

607
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 1>is that businesses required tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

608
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>total commitment and full time</v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment.</v>

609
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be willing to work hard to go</v>

610
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the extra mile and to always do more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you're paid for.</v>

611
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 1>One of the major secrets of success is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always do more than you're paid for and</v>

612
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 1>then you will always be paid more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting now.</v>

613
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must use your time well every</v>

614
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.721
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every hour,</v>

615
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this life is not a rehearsal</v>

616
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 1>for anything else in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the real thing.</v>

617
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And all successful business people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all self made millionaires look upon</v>

618
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:33.730
<v Speaker 1>their time as a resource and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>very careful with it.</v>

619
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 1>They spend their time the way they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend money.</v>

620
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number seven,</v>

621
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.160
<v Speaker 1>back your plans with determination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>persistence and resolve in advance that</v>

622
00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll never give up experiment and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop new products and processes</v>

623
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 1>within the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they come up with something,</v>

624
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 1>they can often become the head of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>division to manufacture that particular</v>

625
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

626
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Three m will actually create a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>around people who come up with new</v>

627
00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 1>products and services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single company today needs men and</v>

628
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:04.450
<v Speaker 1>women who are talented and who will stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the company with their talents</v>

629
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 1>and skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same requirements that are</v>

630
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 1>necessary for entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>

631
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 1>daring risk taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on are also required for</v>

632
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.340
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the people that we have studied</v>

633
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:20.200
<v Speaker 1>who have become extremely successful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>become extremely wealthy in business are</v>

634
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 1>people who never started a business on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

635
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Seven common characteristics of 83 self</v>
<v Speaker 1>made millionaires in a 20 year study of</v>

636
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>1500 men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They followed them for something like 20</v>

637
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:33.850
<v Speaker 1>years to find out how well these men or</v>
<v Speaker 1>women would do in life.</v>

638
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they found at the end of the 20</v>

639
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>83 of the 1500 men and women had become</v>

640
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 1>millionaires and they went back and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied the millionaires and they found</v>

641
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:46.390
<v Speaker 1>these qualities and characteristics.</v>

642
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 1>They found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one is that none of them ever set</v>

643
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:51.550
<v Speaker 1>out simply to make money or to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

644
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Many of the others who did not become</v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaires set out and they had one</v>

645
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 1>goal in life and that was to make lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>

646
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I made it everything humanly possible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 20 years to make lots of money and</v>

647
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 1>not one succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones who didn't set out to become</v>

648
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:09.310
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just set out to do something that they</v>

649
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed and they became totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed in their work and the word that</v>

650
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 1>they use throughout the study is</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorption.</v>

651
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And I pass this on to you because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every case where I've seen a successful</v>

652
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:23.440
<v Speaker 1>man or woman in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have been totally absorbed in what</v>

653
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've just been completely involved.</v>

654
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.660
<v Speaker 1>They were not speculators or risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>takers.</v>

655
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 1>There was not one investment scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one speculation,</v>

656
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 1>not one gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one stock market method.</v>

657
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>The only people who made money</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently and became wealthy</v>

658
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 1>consistently were the ones who are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excellent job making a lot of money</v>

659
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and then holding onto the money when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made it.</v>

660
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they say success has a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyer than failure.</v>

661
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.890
<v Speaker 1>We suddenly have successes and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>started throwing the money around and we</v>

662
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 1>get into things that we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about and then we get into</v>

663
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 1>those things and they start sucking up</v>
<v Speaker 1>additional funds that we have,</v>

664
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but we can often go broke going down a</v>
<v Speaker 1>side road.</v>

665
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Most became millionaires almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowingly.</v>

666
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 1>One year their accountant said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

667
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 1>do you know how much you're worth this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year for it?</v>

668
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.501
<v Speaker 1>And said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

669
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're worth a million $100,000 it</v>

670
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 1>couldn't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally they did not make their</v>

671
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 1>money investing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made their money doing their work</v>

672
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>and if they invested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they invested their money in their work,</v>

673
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 1>in their business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own companies.</v>

674
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.380
<v Speaker 1>They didn't invest it outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conclusion the researchers reached</v>

675
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 1>after 20 years of study was simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

676
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You'll always be most successful doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you most enjoy.</v>

677
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest barometer doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you most enjoy.</v>

678
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you think of a business or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're in a business now and</v>

679
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll do some testing on this in a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

680
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you ask yourself this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I really enjoy what I'm doing?</v>

681
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.471
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

682
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to stay at it till I make</v>

683
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember a woman came to me and she</v>

684
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:49.520
<v Speaker 1>was having great trouble in the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>estate industry.</v>

685
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.331
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

686
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I've done everything that you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've set goals.</v>

687
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I've worked toward those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed my time well and and so on and</v>

688
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still not achieving anything</v>

689
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 1>near what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

690
00:33:58.311 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I haven't sold the house in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

691
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:00.531
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

692
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:01.281
<v Speaker 1>what is your goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

693
00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to win the million dollar award.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the very top of the</v>

694
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>multiple listing service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to win that price.</v>

695
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:07.621
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

696
00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 1>what would you do if you did win that</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollar award?</v>

697
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:10.971
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

698
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I'd quit this lousy business and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into something I really liked.</v>

699
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.251
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

700
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:17.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

701
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate this.</v>

702
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I hate real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate selling house.</v>

703
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I hate the hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

704
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm determined to stay in if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

705
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 1>and I explained to her that in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single case,</v>

706
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 1>if you don't love what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be successful at it.</v>

707
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 1>The three keys are know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

708
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 1>become excellent in your chosen field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in what you're doing and love</v>

709
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those three,</v>

710
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll guarantee you success more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

711
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Faster in life than any of the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>keys that I've ever seen in all the</v>

712
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.160
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

713
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Five key abilities of successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>business people.</v>

714
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:50.501
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment and judgment comes simply from</v>

715
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.080
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes and learning from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that every single wise,</v>

716
00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.230
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature individual was once young and</v>

717
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 1>impetuous and foolish and did wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senseless,</v>

718
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>brainless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>

719
00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>idiotic things.</v>

720
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:10.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how they became wise and mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scars and pain that make you wise</v>

721
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 1>and put the little crinkles in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>corners.</v>

722
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So the key thing is not avoiding making</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes because you're going to make</v>

723
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to learn from every mistake.</v>

724
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 1>This is the hallmark of leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never use the word failure.</v>

725
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.700
<v Speaker 1>They'll use the word mistake though you</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

726
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 1>They'll use glitch and they find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who move ahead the fastest</v>

727
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.160
<v Speaker 1>are the ones who make the most mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earliest and learn the most lessons</v>

728
00:35:34.161 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the something about nature and the</v>

729
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 1>business world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very unrelenting in that if you</v>

730
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 1>make a mistake in business and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from it,</v>

731
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 1>nature will enable you to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake again and if you don't learn</v>

732
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 1>from it the second time in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep putting you through that</v>

733
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>hurdle or over that hoop and throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you flat on your face until you learn</v>

734
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 1>the lesson and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

735
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

736
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I finally learned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that anymore.</v>

737
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you have judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have wisdom.</v>

738
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you go on to the next hurtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

739
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 1>the hurdles never stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most successful multimillionaires</v>

740
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 1>and billionaires that you read about in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspapers and the magazines have</v>

741
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles,</v>

742
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setbacks,</v>

743
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 1>obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeats disappointments every single</v>

744
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between winners and</v>

745
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 1>losers is that winners pick themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

746
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 1>learn what they can salvage the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>best they can from it and carry on.</v>

747
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>And losers think that these mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these setbacks,</v>

748
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 1>these heartaches are happening to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in history.</v>

749
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Watch for the trends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many successful business people say that</v>

750
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.020
<v Speaker 1>trend analysis is the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>single skill of the business person,</v>

751
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.410
<v Speaker 1>which means foresight to think what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to happen in the future as a</v>

752
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:47.610
<v Speaker 1>result of what is happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leadership is the ability to inspire,</v>

753
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 1>to elicit extraordinary performance from</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people.</v>

754
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Leadership is a key quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

755
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 1>of successful business people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>

756
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you can only inspire others to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which you are yourself</v>

757
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:01.410
<v Speaker 1>inspired and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be really excited about what</v>

758
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you expect to inspire others to be</v>

759
00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 1>excited about helping you do what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all great businesses have inspiring</v>

760
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:11.730
<v Speaker 1>leaders at the head of the businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communications ability is absolutely</v>

761
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:14.910
<v Speaker 1>critical for successful business people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means three things.</v>

762
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 1>The ability to interact effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on one,</v>

763
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 1>the ability to make presentations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand up in front of groups or to</v>

764
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:25.740
<v Speaker 1>make presentations to lenders or to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>presentations to customers and the</v>

765
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:30.150
<v Speaker 1>ability to write effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Drucker says the three key tools</v>

766
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 1>of the executive are the report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presentation in the meeting.</v>

767
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you are poor at any one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of communications,</v>

768
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you owe it to yourself to become better.</v>

769
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales ability,</v>

770
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 1>the ability to influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persuade,</v>

771
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 1>motivate people to act in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always astonished when people come</v>

772
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 1>to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start a business,</v>

773
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get somebody who could sell</v>

774
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the product for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell them,</v>

775
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have somebody who can sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>the product for you,</v>

776
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>don't put a penny into the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thousands,</v>

777
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>a million products out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving because there's nobody to</v>

778
00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:01.770
<v Speaker 1>sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to sell is one of the rarest</v>

779
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>qualities in all of business enterprise</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the big successful companies in</v>

780
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the world spend millions of dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year training their salespeople.</v>

781
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So if you are not good at selling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to start a business or you want</v>

782
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>to build a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you owe it to yourself to become good at</v>

783
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owe it to yourself to back off and</v>

784
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:22.950
<v Speaker 1>take the time to practice because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales ability is learned.</v>

785
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:23.911
<v Speaker 1>Some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

786
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I've just don't have the gift of Gab or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a good salesman.</v>

787
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was a good typist when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

788
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could ride a bicycle when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

789
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could drive a car when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

790
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can run a computer when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

791
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could sell when they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

792
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 1>They all learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key is this,</v>

793
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>is that if there are skills that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential for success,</v>

794
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.350
<v Speaker 1>your job is to learn those skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to deny it,</v>

795
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.141
<v Speaker 1>not to delay it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

796
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>not to put it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to find excuses,</v>

797
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it.</v>

798
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Career advancement strategies,</v>

799
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 1>what do we call the niche?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strategy is terribly important.</v>

800
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's based on an enormous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>research I did at the university and</v>

801
00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 1>that other people had done and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your business environment and</v>

802
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the critical parts of your</v>

803
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 1>business environment?</v>

804
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>What are the areas that represent your</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of strength,</v>

805
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 1>but especially what are your areas of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness in a business?</v>

806
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 1>You will find that it's like a chain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business always collapses,</v>

807
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.960
<v Speaker 1>always breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At its weakest link,</v>

808
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.020
<v Speaker 1>the business always collapses at its</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakest point.</v>

809
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And in looking at the purpose of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

810
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 1>we know that the purpose of a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a customer is to serve a</v>

811
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 1>customer efficiently and economically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cashflow is the lifeblood of an</v>

812
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're working for a company,</v>

813
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to decide is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to move ahead rapidly in this</v>

814
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get myself into an area in the</v>

815
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:39.940
<v Speaker 1>company that is vital to the survival of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company.</v>

816
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're in an area of the</v>

817
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:44.980
<v Speaker 1>company that is irrelevant to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival of the company,</v>

818
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you can never become valuable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>important and highly paid and</v>

819
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:49.174
<v Speaker 1>responsible.</v>

820
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So what we do is we know that any</v>
<v Speaker 1>interruption to cashflow threatens the</v>

821
00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 1>survival of the enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we look at where is the biggest</v>

822
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 1>interruption to cashflow likely to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

823
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually the most important function is</v>

824
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important single function in an</v>

825
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 1>organization is marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If sales stop,</v>

826
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the business collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 to 80% of all businesses that run</v>

827
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>into trouble run because sales slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

828
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>If marketing is the key area in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

829
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you owe it to yourself to become great</v>
<v Speaker 1>at marketing,</v>

830
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>to get into the marketing area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into sales,</v>

831
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 1>get into strategic market and get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the company.</v>

832
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second part that may be important is</v>

833
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 1>finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the organization that you're with is</v>

834
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon financial institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to borrow a lot of money.</v>

835
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It has to raise capital in the stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

836
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>If that's the key to its success and</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>

837
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 1>then you owe it to yourself to get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that area because the company's growth</v>

838
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>will be determined by how successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are and if you can be fundamentally</v>

839
00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:47.110
<v Speaker 1>important in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really dramatically increase</v>

840
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 1>your value in a short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The production area is very interesting</v>

841
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and I read a study actually done by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Alberta where they went</v>

842
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>into a brewery and they were looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of critical environments and</v>

843
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.950
<v Speaker 1>they found that in the brewery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important single function in</v>

844
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the brewery was the production area that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breweries,</v>

845
00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty largely fixed they delivery</v>

846
00:41:08.681 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The distribution system was pretty much</v>

847
00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:13.050
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its market share was established it</v>

848
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 1>manufactured beer and sold it on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular systematic basis.</v>

849
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that could cause the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shutdown of the organization and the</v>

850
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 1>cutoff of cashflow was if the equipment</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke down.</v>

851
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Now the equipment was maintained by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance engineers had meant that the</v>

852
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 1>head maintenance engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the most important single person</v>

853
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.080
<v Speaker 1>in the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was more important than the president</v>

854
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and the who was the head engineer was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest paid next to the president.</v>

855
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 1>He had the greatest perks because if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do his job properly,</v>

856
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:42.920
<v Speaker 1>the whole company came to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is often the case in</v>

857
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:45.530
<v Speaker 1>organizations that depend on production</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

858
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Food distribution is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

859
00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't get to the stores on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know if it gets to the store is a</v>

860
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 1>week late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's too bad you have to throw</v>

861
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 1>it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is fashion.</v>

862
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.330
<v Speaker 1>The people in the fashion industry who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in control of the distribution,</v>

863
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 1>the outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stores that sell,</v>

864
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 1>the fashions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving the fashions from production to</v>

865
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 1>the stores as quickly as possible are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are key in the fashion</v>

866
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

867
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Fashions are timely?</v>

868
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get it to the right source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it there six months later in perfect</v>

869
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:16.490
<v Speaker 1>condition is not quite good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

870
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 1>If it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about record distribution?</v>

871
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 1>How about distribution of books or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else?</v>

872
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Anything that can become dated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The distribution function is vital that</v>

873
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 1>people who are essential in distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the most valuable people in the</v>

874
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Research is important.</v>

875
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Look at Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the most important single</v>

876
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.030
<v Speaker 1>function in Silicon Valley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's making people millionaires.</v>

877
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 1>It's research coming up with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>products and processes.</v>

878
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 1>They know that the market will gobble up</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the new products that they can come</v>

879
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 1>out with if the products will serve a</v>
<v Speaker 1>market need.</v>

880
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>It is coming up with the products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the engineers,</v>

881
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the technicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research and development specialists</v>

882
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that are getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

883
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:50.211
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

884
00:42:50.211 --> 00:42:53.990
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$500,000 a year and of course regulatory</v>

885
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

886
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 1>If you have to work with government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at in Washington DC,</v>

887
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 1>jam with lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim with representatives,</v>

888
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 1>senior representatives of major</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries and industrial groups because</v>

889
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they require protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they require a tax benefits,</v>

890
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 1>they require relaxation of environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>controls and so on.</v>

891
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Those become absolutely vital elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a business and finally labor and</v>

892
00:43:14.711 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 1>the people who are superb at dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Labor are critical.</v>

893
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only reason I point out these points</v>

894
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

895
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:21.740
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

896
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

897
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:27.590
<v Speaker 1>regulatory and labor is that in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>business you will find by checking one</v>

898
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're having troubles in your</v>

899
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weaknesses in one of these areas,</v>

900
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 1>if it's in your own business or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other company,</v>

901
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 1>that you can use this as a checklist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

902
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>where are we falling down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

903
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 1>the company always collapses on the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the weakest pillar.</v>

904
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge is power,</v>

905
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>specialized knowledge or skills and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital area.</v>

906
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Enhanced promotability control of vital</v>
<v Speaker 1>information is power.</v>

907
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>The more I learn that makes me important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that company,</v>

908
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.510
<v Speaker 1>the better off I am and I learned a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good lesson.</v>

909
00:43:56.511 --> 00:43:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Very early is learn all you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never tell all you know.</v>

910
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 1>If you tell all you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is they don't need you</v>

911
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strive for excellence.</v>

912
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Be the most knowledgeable person in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen area within the organization.</v>

913
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Do it quietly and pretty soon the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewards will start to flow to you.</v>

914
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the reasons for business</v>

915
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:18.860
<v Speaker 1>failure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my estimation there are 14 major</v>

916
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 1>reasons for business failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

917
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>reason for business failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of direction,</v>

918
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:27.260
<v Speaker 1>the failure to establish specific goals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plans to achieve them.</v>

919
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have specific goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you become reactive.</v>

920
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You are either acting on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment or you are reacting.</v>

921
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Most companies in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% are in a reactive mode in that</v>

922
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not acting at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just simply reacting to what</v>

923
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 1>happens every single day because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have clear goals and plans to</v>

924
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 1>achieve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of a complete business plan is a</v>

925
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 1>major reason for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why that is is because the</v>

926
00:44:56.431 --> 00:45:00.810
<v Speaker 1>ability to put together a business plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a major act of business competence.</v>

927
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 1>The reason people don't put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

928
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it's primarily because they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

929
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The reason that they fail is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how.</v>

930
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.970
<v Speaker 1>When they develop the competence to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together a business plan,</v>

931
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>they also develop other competencies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go with it.</v>

932
00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Impatience is a major cause of business</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

933
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Trying to do too much too soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to cover too much greed is a</v>

934
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 1>major cause of business failure.</v>

935
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.640
<v Speaker 1>A very good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very successful consultants that Brian,</v>

936
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the secret to success in business is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rich slowly.</v>

937
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to get rich all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rich a little bit at a time.</v>

938
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Do it slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to get rich,</v>

939
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 1>waiting an extra year isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt you.</v>

940
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 1>More people lose their shirts because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get involved in what you might call</v>

941
00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:42.600
<v Speaker 1>a get rich quick scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's going to make them rich</v>

942
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 1>in hurry and they're not going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a lot of work so they plunge and</v>

943
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the plunge sets them back sometimes five</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 10 years in terms of their savings.</v>

944
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>action without thinking,</v>

945
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 1>as Peter Drucker says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the cause of every failure.</v>

946
00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Action without thinking impetuousness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause of every failure and</v>

947
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 1>especially not listening to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>

948
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.030
<v Speaker 1>not listening to your gut feeling.</v>

949
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have is intuition.</v>

950
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to your gut feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will almost always give you the right</v>

951
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regard to people.</v>

952
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Do not ignore your intuition with regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>

953
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Five for cost control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overspending,</v>

954
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 1>especially at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost invariably when people start a</v>

955
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will buy things that they would</v>

956
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>never think of buying if they'd been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business for six months.</v>

957
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Basic rule at the beginning of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business is save every single penny.</v>

958
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.310
<v Speaker 1>The basic rule is simply this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conserve cash,</v>

959
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.040
<v Speaker 1>conserve cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conserve cash every day.</v>

960
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Get up in the morning and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I do today to conserve cash?</v>

961
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Biggest mistakes that I've ever made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business are plunging into two and three</v>

962
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and five year leases right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a business and then finding</v>

963
00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 1>that the business won't sustain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor quality of product,</v>

964
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.720
<v Speaker 1>nothing will sink of business faster.</v>

965
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to sell and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get repeat business.</v>

966
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Many people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

967
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:57.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may not be a very good product,</v>

968
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sell lots of it and then I'll make</v>

969
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 1>some money and then I'll do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

970
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that the more you advertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor product,</v>

971
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the less it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you advertise a good product,</v>

972
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the better it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't ever handle a poor quality</v>

973
00:47:10.921 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever justify trying to sell a poor</v>

974
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:17.100
<v Speaker 1>quality product because it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to haunt you in sufficient</v>

975
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>working capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means an expectation of immediate</v>

976
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 1>cash flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest mistake that people make is</v>

977
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:25.470
<v Speaker 1>they think that they're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive cashflow in 30 to 60 days.</v>

978
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.690
<v Speaker 1>They talked to people and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>reassure them.</v>

979
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the key there to remember is that if</v>

980
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you set a break even point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need six months capital in order to</v>

981
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 1>open up.</v>

982
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have six months of capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then open up on a smaller scale and</v>

983
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:43.480
<v Speaker 1>second of all take whatever you consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be your break even point.</v>

984
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 1>So you think you're going to break even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in three months.</v>

985
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Multiply that times three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law of three comes out in every</v>

986
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Speaker 1>single study of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every single product or process.</v>

987
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Always take your most conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most reasonable break even point and</v>

988
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:02.890
<v Speaker 1>multiply it by three is that far more</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic and make sure you have enough</v>

989
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 1>capital to last that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number eight is bad or nonexistent.</v>

990
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Budgeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to develop pro formas and</v>

991
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 1>budgets for operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people actually start a business</v>

992
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and embark upon what we call guaranteed</v>
<v Speaker 1>losses because they haven't done</v>

993
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:20.290
<v Speaker 1>budgeting and they haven't worked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it's going to cost and how much</v>

994
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:22.470
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't worked out that they're</v>

995
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 1>making a loss on every single item that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're selling.</v>

996
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You've heard the old saying of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

997
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:28.330
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose money on every item I sell,</v>

998
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but I make it up on the volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many business people</v>

999
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 1>actually operate on that and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of sitting down and doing a pro</v>

1000
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 1>forma working out all their costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their expenses and how much they're</v>

1001
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 1>likely to have at the end in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>

1002
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 1>they find that in many cases they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any profits at all and yet they're</v>

1003
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 1>working their heart out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't understand they're doing so</v>

1004
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:53.590
<v Speaker 1>much business but they're going broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>day by day.</v>

1005
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>So just the fact that you draw up</v>
<v Speaker 1>budgets and pro formas is a very,</v>

1006
00:48:58.121 --> 00:48:59.980
<v Speaker 1>very good discipline and we'll show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do that later.</v>

1007
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Inadequate financial records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most accountants will tell you surest</v>

1008
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 1>way to go broke is to treat your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeping as though it were an</v>

1009
00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant sideline through all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>receipts in a box and get to them at the</v>

1010
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.503
<v Speaker 1>end of the year.</v>

1011
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the things which I do recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1012
00:49:12.891 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not good at bookkeeping,</v>

1013
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hire somebody else.</v>

1014
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Number 10 major reasons for business</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

1015
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 1>loss of momentum in the sales</v>
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>

1016
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.660
<v Speaker 1>which leads to a loss of cashflow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the business venture.</v>

1017
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 1>So number one reason for business</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

1018
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get too busy doing other things</v>

1019
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and they think that sales will just keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>on coming in and Lo and behold,</v>

1020
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.950
<v Speaker 1>sales are like watering a pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going with that.</v>

1021
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:38.410
<v Speaker 1>You keep pumping the pump and the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps flowing.</v>

1022
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you stopped pumping the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump?</v>

1023
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 1>The water stops flowing with sales and</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

1024
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to be pumping that pump all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1025
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The instant that the strong executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important people take their</v>

1026
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 1>hands off that pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sales and marketing effort just</v>

1027
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 1>burns to a halt and the whole company</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls apart.</v>

1028
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I worked for two companies now that got</v>
<v Speaker 1>so carried away with their success that</v>

1029
00:49:58.331 --> 00:50:02.350
<v Speaker 1>they became administrative companies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they felt that sales but just come to</v>

1030
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 1>them because they had established</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the marketplace.</v>

1031
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a matter of setting up</v>

1032
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:09.070
<v Speaker 1>administrative systems within nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1033
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:13.320
<v Speaker 1>One company that went from zero to $3</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in business in four years that</v>

1034
00:50:13.321 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>men are worked all their lives for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

1035
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 1>They built their company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had made it in life.</v>

1036
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Nine months later they were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I business consultant came in and told</v>

1037
00:50:20.741 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do now is where do you</v>

1038
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>work on administration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set up your internal systems,</v>

1039
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>your internal controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got so carried away with it.</v>

1040
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Nine months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company was dead.</v>

1041
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>All the top salespeople left and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market has turned their back on them and</v>

1042
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 1>walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1043
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 1>failure to anticipate market trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in demand,</v>

1044
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 1>changes in customer preference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in the economic situation.</v>

1045
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 1>When gasoline prices go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that going to do when interest</v>

1046
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 1>rates go up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that going to do when the real</v>

1047
00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 1>estate industry increases or decreases?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it going to do to your</v>

1048
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 1>business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching economic trends is very</v>

1049
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number 12 lack of managerial ability or</v>

1050
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just simply don't have the</v>

1051
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 1>experience or the ability to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1052
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 1>People don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand about pro farmers.</v>

1053
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand about budgets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand about selling or</v>

1054
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 1>marketing or advertising and long</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

1055
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:07.370
<v Speaker 1>most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't take any advice either.</v>

1056
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.600
<v Speaker 1>So you can always get experience or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability if you do it slowly,</v>

1057
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you try to do it all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is instead of accelerating</v>

1058
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 1>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set yourself back five or 10 years</v>

1059
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 1>didn't decisiveness is a major reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>for failure.</v>

1060
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 1>The inability to make decisions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of difficulties.</v>

1061
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Things start to go wrong and what do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is you put off making hard decisions.</v>

1062
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is inability to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

1063
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.820
<v Speaker 1>delaying decisions because of fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting people's feelings,</v>

1064
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 1>keeping on incompetent people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in business.</v>

1065
00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Relationships that aren't working for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of hurting somebody's feelings is</v>

1066
00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the major causes for failure in</v>
<v Speaker 1>small and medium sized businesses.</v>

1067
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting statistic came out of some</v>

1068
00:51:48.921 --> 00:51:52.250
<v Speaker 1>very large consulting studies that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>done a few years ago is that if we</v>

1069
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 1>cannot immediately cut off the deadwood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep working with only people who</v>

1070
00:51:56.031 --> 00:51:59.300
<v Speaker 1>can do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chances are they'll drag a sender and</v>

1071
00:51:59.301 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 1>afterwards you know what they'll hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>you for having kept them on for so long.</v>

1072
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Bad human relations with staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppliers,</v>

1073
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:08.720
<v Speaker 1>creditors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of all business failures come from</v>

1074
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 1>an inability to get along with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1075
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Number 14 which underlies everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>diffusion of effort,</v>

1076
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.990
<v Speaker 1>lack of priorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going off on tangents and the inability</v>

1077
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 1>to concentrate on doing the right things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing things one at a time.</v>

1078
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the reasons for business</v>

1079
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's 10 reasons for business</v>

1080
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of which are the converse of the</v>

1081
00:52:26.691 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 1>reasons for business failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one is the product or service is</v>

1082
00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:33.590
<v Speaker 1>well suited to the needs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements of the current market.</v>

1083
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two is there is a complete</v>

1084
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 1>business plan developed before</v>
<v Speaker 1>commencing business operations.</v>

1085
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 1>The development of a business plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it is laborious,</v>

1086
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 1>is a sign of managerial competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you and it tells the world that</v>

1087
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you're qualified to start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inability or unwillingness to</v>

1088
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:54.740
<v Speaker 1>develop a plan tells the world that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not competent.</v>

1089
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete market analysis is followed</v>

1090
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 1>by a development of an advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion and sales program.</v>

1091
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit down and you determine who is</v>

1092
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:06.260
<v Speaker 1>your competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is your market,</v>

1093
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>where do you sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who buys,</v>

1094
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 1>why they buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what benefits they buy,</v>

1095
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:12.050
<v Speaker 1>what you do better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to sell to and so on,</v>

1096
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.000
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about in a subsequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

1097
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you design your sales programs</v>

1098
00:53:16.701 --> 00:53:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

1099
00:53:18.231 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sat down with a person who was going to</v>

1100
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:23.630
<v Speaker 1>open a store in a shopping center and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through the financial analysis.</v>

1101
00:53:23.631 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to lease them in the space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

1102
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I went through the financial analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that that person would</v>

1103
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 1>have to have something like 38 customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day,</v>

1104
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:38.331
<v Speaker 1>spending an average of $25 per person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to survive selling the products</v>

1105
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that they were selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their average sale was $12 per</v>

1106
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1107
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And it was a small rural shopping center</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would never be able to survive.</v>

1108
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I just worked him through it based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to sell in order to</v>

1109
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna be able to do it in</v>

1110
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.820
<v Speaker 1>this location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1111
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:51.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1112
00:53:51.511 --> 00:53:51.931
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1113
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he opened the store anyway and he</v>

1114
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 1>lost five years to say it went broke six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months later.</v>

1115
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So the financial analysis and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing analysis is important.</v>

1116
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Tight financial controls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good budgeting,</v>

1117
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 1>accurate bookkeeping and accounting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic rule to remember and running a</v>

1118
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:09.780
<v Speaker 1>business and I've worked with some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most successful business people in</v>

1119
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the world is frugality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frugality,</v>

1120
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 1>frugality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>

1121
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:15.690
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>

1122
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.530
<v Speaker 1>pinch every penny until it screams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very,</v>

1123
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 1>very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said before,</v>

1124
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.740
<v Speaker 1>conserve cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go cheap,</v>

1125
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 1>every single penny that you possibly can</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy used equipment,</v>

1126
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.750
<v Speaker 1>used furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use carpeting,</v>

1127
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 1>rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth space and so on would be very,</v>

1128
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 1>very careful about expenses.</v>

1129
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>A high degree of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capability and integrity on the part of</v>

1130
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:36.960
<v Speaker 1>the key staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>

1131
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Hire only the people you need and hire</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who can do what you need them to</v>

1132
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to train people on the job,</v>

1133
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 1>especially in a small and medium sized</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1134
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Good internal efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good time management,</v>

1135
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.960
<v Speaker 1>clear job descriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear and measurable output</v>

1136
00:54:51.961 --> 00:54:53.460
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1137
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows what they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1138
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 1>knows the most important things they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get done and manages their</v>

1139
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 1>time well in order to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number seven is determination,</v>

1140
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 1>persistence and patience on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business owners,</v>

1141
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the business principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number eight is good communications</v>

1142
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 1>amongst the staff and open door policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better.</v>

1143
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 1>The communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more everybody knows within an</v>

1144
00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 1>organization they better that</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisation functions.</v>

1145
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.600
<v Speaker 1>We find that in every single case where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem organization,</v>

1146
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>you have secrecy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have poor communications amongst the</v>

1147
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 1>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor communications,</v>

1148
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:27.204
<v Speaker 1>up and down.</v>

1149
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.480
<v Speaker 1>People are playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool and your big companies like IBM and</v>

1150
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Hewlett Packard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's on a first name basis.</v>

1151
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can have any information they</v>
<v Speaker 1>need in order to do their job well.</v>

1152
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Number nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong momentum in the sales department</v>

1153
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:45.081
<v Speaker 1>and an emphasis on marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks marketing all the time,</v>

1154
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:50.670
<v Speaker 1>which leads us to number 10 a concern</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the customer at all times is a top</v>

1155
00:55:50.671 --> 00:55:53.430
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single successful company that</v>

1156
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen has one characteristic</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst all the people in that company.</v>

1157
00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It's love for the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love for the customer.</v>

1158
00:56:01.321 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 1>They love their customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very concerned if a customer</v>

1159
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:06.210
<v Speaker 1>has a problem or a complaint or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty,</v>

1160
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 1>they're are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very concerned about it and you'll find</v>

1161
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that right from the switchboard all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way through.</v>

1162
00:56:11.281 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 1>When you call a good company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they treat you like you're really,</v>

1163
00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:15.444
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

1164
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I used to work for a large department</v>
<v Speaker 1>store chain that subsequently had a lot</v>

1165
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:22.590
<v Speaker 1>of financial problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clerks would be so busy doing their</v>

1166
00:56:22.591 --> 00:56:25.660
<v Speaker 1>busy work behind the counters that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>a customer actually came along,</v>

1167
00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:28.870
<v Speaker 1>they'd be irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look up as though you were actually</v>

1168
00:56:28.871 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 1>interrupting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had lost all sight of the fact that</v>

1169
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 1>all of the arrangement of the counters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mirror,</v>

1170
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 1>today's and everything else was for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the customer came in and what</v>

1171
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 1>happens is they treat customers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

1172
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.580
<v Speaker 1>They'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Geeze,</v>

1173
00:56:41.581 --> 00:56:43.240
<v Speaker 1>well I can't do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on coffee,</v>

1174
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 1>or could you hurry up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost my lunch break.</v>

1175
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I was doing some consulting with a firm</v>
<v Speaker 1>just last week where the manager was</v>

1176
00:56:49.751 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 1>appalled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody came in to buy $800 worth of</v>

1177
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:56.380
<v Speaker 1>merchandise at a quarter to five that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be installed and it took about 20</v>

1178
00:56:56.381 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 1>minutes to install it and the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1179
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry we can't take the business.</v>

1180
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to come back tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we shut down at five o'clock and</v>

1181
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:08.390
<v Speaker 1>it takes 20 minutes to install it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turned an $800 customer or ways</v>

1182
00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 1>that we never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never knew where that customer ever came</v>

1183
00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 1>back or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1184
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it was certainly disconcerting to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are people doing that.</v>

1185
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We spend a fortune advertising to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to come in and they come in and</v>

1186
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 1>they want to buy and we tell them to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>away because it's just not convenient</v>

1187
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.550
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what the person had to do?</v>

1188
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 1>They had to go drinking at five o'clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their buddies and they didn't want</v>

1189
00:57:28.871 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 1>to be late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So be very careful about that.</v>

1190
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Those are the reasons for business</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

1191
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Now what we're going to do is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>brief exercise.</v>

1192
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask you to answer some</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and these questions are very</v>

1193
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1194
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.550
<v Speaker 1>They're important for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're important for tomorrow,</v>

1195
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:46.810
<v Speaker 1>they're important for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they enable you to focus on the very</v>

1196
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 1>most important things that you could or</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing within your business.</v>

1197
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to give you one minute to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer each of these questions and I</v>

1198
00:57:55.241 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 1>want you to write them as fast as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

1199
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Write the first things that come to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1200
00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first number one question is list</v>

1201
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:07.710
<v Speaker 1>five jobs or fulltime activities paid or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpaid that you have done in your life.</v>

1202
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's the first five that come to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just five jobs or full time activities.</v>

1203
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's been paid charitable,</v>

1204
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.110
<v Speaker 1>whether it's been in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's been a with a social</v>

1205
00:58:17.111 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 1>organisation politically right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first five fulltime activities that</v>

1206
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:23.080
<v Speaker 1>you have engaged in since you left high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

1207
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.710
<v Speaker 1>however many you have now go quickly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>question number two and write down the</v>

1208
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:34.210
<v Speaker 1>one thing that you enjoy most about each</v>
<v Speaker 1>job or fulltime activity and the order</v>

1209
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that you wrote the jobs.</v>

1210
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you enjoyed the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What parts of the work did you enjoy?</v>

1211
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 1>What Park gave you the greatest amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of satisfaction in that work?</v>

1212
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>When you look back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes your heart glow,</v>

1213
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 1>if you like or makes you happy when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that particular activity?</v>

1214
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I go to question number three again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking back over the jobs,</v>

1215
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:56.350
<v Speaker 1>what did you do best in each job or</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity?</v>

1216
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.640
<v Speaker 1>What were you best at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What part of the job or activity did you</v>

1217
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:02.920
<v Speaker 1>do the best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most capable?</v>

1218
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you were doing five or 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

1219
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 1>what part of it did you excel at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of it where you at the very</v>

1220
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:10.690
<v Speaker 1>best at your performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your skills,</v>

1221
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 1>your capability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the very finest and that</v>

1222
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:16.000
<v Speaker 1>particular area of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now go to question number four.</v>

1223
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 1>What was your major accomplishment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those jobs are fulltime</v>

1224
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.033
<v Speaker 1>activities?</v>

1225
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 1>What one thing did you accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it a technical thing?</v>

1226
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Was it an interpersonal thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What thing did you achieve that you</v>

1227
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 1>remember the most as being the highlight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that job?</v>

1228
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or activity?</v>

1229
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Just think through if in in retrospect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that you did or the one</v>

1230
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 1>thing that you accomplished or achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully in that job.</v>

1231
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was just learning the lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1232
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 1>learning something important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of value that you got</v>

1233
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 1>additional training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it happens to be,</v>

1234
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 1>write it out as quickly as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1235
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 1>go on to the next question wherever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to the next question.</v>

1236
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Now list five activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

1237
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or situations in your life that have</v>

1238
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 1>given you immense personal satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feeling of importance of self liking</v>

1239
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and self worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been getting married.</v>

1240
01:00:06.801 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It could have been getting a degree or</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate.</v>

1241
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It could've been anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1242
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>The first five that come to mind as</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible.</v>

1243
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>My question number six if you could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any job or be in any business,</v>

1244
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>what do you think you would enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most?</v>

1245
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a billionaire who control a</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of organizations came up to you</v>

1246
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and said you could have any job you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted or be in any business in the</v>

1247
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one would you choose?</v>

1248
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>What job would you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you want to work for someone else?</v>

1249
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Who would you want to work for yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to work for yourself,</v>

1250
01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>what business would you want to be in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of position would you like to</v>

1251
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>have in that business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1252
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>The very first thing that comes to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1253
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>question number seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do you want to be earning in</v>

1254
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>one year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In three years and five years?</v>

1255
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>In 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1256
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>very important that you have an idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what these figures are and don't be too</v>

1257
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>concerned about how correct or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate you are.</v>

1258
01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Just write down what you consider to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable goal to achieve in the next</v>

1259
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:02.954
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1260
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>

1261
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>The wonderful thing about that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of people walking around,</v>

1262
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll never write down a financial goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their whole life and they cannot</v>

1263
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>understand why they did not improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>their financial conditions.</v>

1264
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>The very taking of that exercise that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just did moves you into the top 5%</v>

1265
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>in the world in terms of future planning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will be astonished.</v>

1266
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I've had people take that exercise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never look at it again till two years</v>

1267
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>later and then open it up and look at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

1268
01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>by dog gone it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have achieved those financial</v>

1269
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just writing it down,</v>

1270
01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>programmed it into the brain and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous two years,</v>

1271
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>the opportunities to achieve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial goals came to them.</v>

1272
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Question number eight and the final</v>

1273
01:01:42.441 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>question in this session.</v>

1274
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that we had a bottle of pills</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guaranteed you against failure and</v>

1275
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>the question is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what one great thing would you dare to</v>

1276
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:58.610
<v Speaker 1>attempt if you knew you could not fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of you would get one of these</v>

1277
01:01:58.611 --> 01:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take this pill,</v>

1278
01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you'd be guaranteed of success 100% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any one thing that you attempted in your</v>

1279
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in your business and your</v>

1280
01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>career world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one great thing would you aim for</v>

1281
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>if you absolutely knew beyond a doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could not fail,</v>

1282
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that comes to mind,</v>

1283
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>the answers to the on what jobs you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you accomplished in those jobs,</v>

1284
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>what you enjoyed most will be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good indicator of what you should</v>

1285
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>be doing in terms of your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your career,</v>

1286
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your future planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very often we find ourselves doing</v>

1287
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>something later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very different from all the</v>

1288
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>things that gave us joy and satisfaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>at earlier periods in our life.</v>

1289
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And we wonder why we are not excited</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get up in the morning.</v>

1290
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>The key is to go back and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you've done before that</v>

1291
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>really made you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really made you feel great about</v>

1292
01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave you a feeling of importance</v>

1293
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>and self esteem and try to structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>your activities.</v>

1294
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So you're doing work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1295
01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of work with the kind of products</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of people in the kind of</v>

1296
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:05.730
<v Speaker 1>environment that recreates those</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that for you are unique and</v>

1297
01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that will enable you to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're capable of achieving</v>

1298
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 1>in business.</v>
