00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go through them a math book in a</v>

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to see about chop.</v>

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>They got down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What job?</v>

4
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.543
<v Speaker 1>Stockbroker</v>

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 2>not an astronaut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to what Jim Valvano said.</v>

7
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>21 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most poignant seven words ever</v>

8
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 2>uttered in any speech anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give up.</v>

9
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those great people didn't.</v>

10
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>So I now have a responsibility to also</v>
<v Speaker 2>not ever give up.</v>

11
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just listened to what the man said.</v>

12
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 2>But I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some times in life where you</v>

13
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 2>fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you don't have the swing to</v>

14
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:15.854
<v Speaker 2>get that gun.</v>

15
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I will try 100 times to get up any five</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail 100 times.</v>

16
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 2>If I fail and I give up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that I'm ever going to get</v>

17
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.740
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

18
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>If I fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try again and again and again for as</v>

19
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>long as I try it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say change to be getting up</v>

20
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 2>when the secret is inactive it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who's done something great,</v>

21
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't resiliency.</v>

22
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 2>They have the ability to bounce back all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grades.</v>

23
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 2>They didn't wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

24
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 2>stay on course guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot pass it.</v>

25
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 2>If you quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee he's going to fail,</v>

26
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen if you keep going.</v>

27
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel pain.</v>

28
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I heard I opened my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I create victory,</v>

29
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but do not give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel no fear.</v>

30
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I fear no man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I create a conqueror.</v>

31
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I hold the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make a choice.</v>

32
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Just decide what is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you're going to be,</v>

33
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>how you're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just decide and then from that point,</v>

34
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 2>the universe is going to get out your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

35
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 2>We can have another bad year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get to the point where</v>

36
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 2>enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You much easier to come up with excuses</v>

37
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 2>why you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do what is easy,</v>

38
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
<v Speaker 2>your life will be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do want to say is complain about</v>
