1
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to skip the flattery and the Atta</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys because I do know this.</v>

2
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The sooner that we become less impressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our life,</v>

3
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>with our accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our career,</v>

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>with whatever that prospect is in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>

5
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:26.351
<v Speaker 1>the sooner we become less impressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more involved with that and these</v>

6
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sooner we get a whole lot better</v>

7
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.383
<v Speaker 2>doing them.</v>

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I've learned in my journey.</v>

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Most of them experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them I heard in passing,</v>

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>many of them I'm still practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of them I do believe are true.</v>

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may be truth to me,</v>

12
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>but don't think that that makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine because you cannot own the truth.</v>

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So please think of these as signpost</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches,</v>

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>paradigms that gives some science to</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>yours to steal yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to share,</v>

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>like into your own lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to personally apply in your own lives,</v>

17
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>in your own way should you choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life's not easy.</v>

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Life is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not.</v>

20
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to make it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life's not fair.</v>

21
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It never was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

22
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it won't ever be,</v>

23
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>do not fall into the trap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entitlement trap of feeling like</v>

24
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are not.</v>

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get on with it,</v>

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things are more rewarding when you</v>

27
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>break a sweat to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

28
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable is the stupidest word.</v>

29
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>The dictionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>should never come out of our mouth.</v>

30
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Think about it to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

31
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>what an unbelievable play a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an unbelievable book and</v>

32
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable active Kurt.</v>

33
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.303
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>it may be spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be phenomenal,</v>

35
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>most excellent or outstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unbelievable.</v>

36
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Give others and yourself more credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happened.</v>

37
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>You witnessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just did it.</v>

38
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the other side of</v>

39
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that side,</v>

40
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>when we humans under perform or act out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our best character,</v>

41
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man flies a suicide jet into the World</v>

42
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Trade Center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions die from diseases everyday that</v>

43
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>we have cures for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>

44
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the builder swears that he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your house built by Thanksgiving</v>

45
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>and you can't move in until Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next year.</v>

46
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Our best friends lied to us and we lie</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ourselves all the time.</v>

47
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

48
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just happens and it happens everyday.</v>

49
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that we homo sapiens earthlings</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is unbelievable,</v>

50
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and if there's one thing you can depend</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

51
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>people being</v>

52
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.613
<v Speaker 2>it's people,</v>

53
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>so we shouldn't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the trickiest mammals walking the</v>

54
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about the monkeys.</v>

55
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so acknowledged the acts of greatness as</v>

56
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>real and do not be naive about mankind's</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for evil,</v>

57
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>nor be in denial of our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings.</v>

58
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Happiness is an emotional response to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

59
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.390
<v Speaker 1>If I win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be happy.</v>

60
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:24.650
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

61
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>It's an if then cause and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had pro quo standard that we cannot</v>

62
00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:34.280
<v Speaker 1>sustain because we immediately raise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we attain it.</v>

63
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.690
<v Speaker 1>You see happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness demands a certain outcome.</v>

64
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It is result reliant and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if happiness is what you're after,</v>

65
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be let down</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently and you're going to be</v>

66
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of your time.</v>

67
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Joy though you always a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something else.</v>

68
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Joy is not a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a response to some result.</v>

69
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant joy is the feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have from doing what we are fashioned</v>

70
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter the outcome.</v>

71
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Now personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an actor,</v>

72
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I started enjoying my work and literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>being more happy when I stopped trying</v>

73
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>to make the daily Labor a means to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain end.</v>

74
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

75
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I need this film to be a box office</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

76
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need my performance to be</v>

77
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:27.431
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

78
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:32.431
<v Speaker 1>I need the respect of my peers are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those are reasonable aspirations,</v>

79
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the work,</v>

80
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>the daily making of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doing of the deed became the reward</v>

81
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>in itself for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got more box office,</v>

82
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>more accolades and respect than I ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>had before.</v>

83
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy is always in process.</v>

84
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>It's under construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in constant approach,</v>

85
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>alive and well in the doing of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fashioning to do and enjoying it.</v>

86
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define success for yourself.</v>

87
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Define success for yourself and check</v>
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>

88
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm in south of New Orleans a few years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and I went to a Voodoo shop</v>

89
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and they had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

90
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.960
<v Speaker 1>this wooden partition against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at these columns,</v>

91
00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>and in these columns where all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>vials of these magic potion,</v>

92
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.620
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the headings above each potion,</v>

93
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 1>defining what they would give you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like fertility,</v>

94
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

95
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 1>legal help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

96
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

97
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which column is empty?</v>

98
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>My nae have to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money is king.</v>

99
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Today is what make the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the world go round.</v>

100
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It is success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we have,</v>

101
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:54.591
<v Speaker 1>the more successful we are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that our cultural values</v>

102
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>have even been financial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humility is not in vogue anymore.</v>

103
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's too passive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a get rich quick on the Internet,</v>

104
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>riches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes of fame world that we live in</v>

105
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and we see it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all want to succeed.</v>

106
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question that we got to ask</v>

107
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>ourselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what success is to us?</v>

108
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>What success is to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more money as fine?</v>

109
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing against money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

110
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a healthy family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a happy marriage.</v>

111
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's to help others to be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be spiritually sound,</v>

112
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.200
<v Speaker 1>leave the world a little bit better</v>
<v Speaker 1>place than you found it.</v>

113
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Continue to ask yourself that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your answer may change over time and</v>

114
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do yourself this favor.</v>

115
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't choose anything that will</v>

116
00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>jeopardize yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prioritize who you are,</v>

117
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.700
<v Speaker 1>who you want to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't spend time with anything that</v>

118
00:06:56.701 --> 00:07:01.701
<v Speaker 1>antagonizes your character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't drink the koolaid and it tastes</v>

119
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will get cavities.</v>

120
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live is not a popularity contest.</v>

121
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Be Brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the hill.</v>

122
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>But first answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my hill?</v>

123
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>So me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I,</v>

124
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.330
<v Speaker 1>how do I define success for me myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 1>for me it's a measurement of five</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

126
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>We got fatherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got being a good husband.</v>

127
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I've got my health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

128
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:26.851
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spirit.</v>

129
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:29.220
<v Speaker 1>We've got career and we'd have</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships.</v>

130
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.920
<v Speaker 1>These are what's important to me in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life right now.</v>

131
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.710
<v Speaker 1>So I try to measure these five things</v>
<v Speaker 1>each day.</v>

132
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I check in with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to see whether or not I'm in the,</v>

133
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

134
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the debit section or the credit section</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each one man in the red or I'm in</v>

135
00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You follow for instance,</v>

136
00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>sometimes say my career's rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

137
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it's way up here in the black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see my relationship with my wife</v>

138
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe could use a little bit more of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

139
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I got to pick up the slack on being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better husband.</v>

140
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Get that one out of the red or say my</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual health could use some</v>

141
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.700
<v Speaker 1>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's down here,</v>

142
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friendships and my social life there</v>

143
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.160
<v Speaker 1>in high gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I've got to recalibrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checks and balances.</v>

145
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go to church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember to say thank you more often</v>

146
00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got to take the talent because I</v>

147
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:22.671
<v Speaker 1>want to keep all five in healthy shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that if I don't take care of</v>

148
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't keep up maintenance on them,</v>

149
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>one of them is going to get weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

150
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna dip too deep into the debit</v>
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>

151
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get sick,</v>

152
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first we have to define success for</v>

153
00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:43.980
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and then we have to put in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>work to maintain it.</v>

154
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Take that daily tally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to our garden,</v>

155
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 1>keep the things that are important to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>in good shape mean.</v>

156
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

157
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.780
<v Speaker 1>let's admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all got to wolves in a suit,</v>

158
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>a good one and a bad and they both want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat</v>

159
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.140
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell.</v>

160
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.450
<v Speaker 1>We just got to feed that goodman a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more than the other one.</v>

161
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>

162
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>process of elimination is the first step</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our identity,</v>

163
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Aka where you are not is as important as</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

164
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 92.</v>

165
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I got my first job as an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three lines,</v>

166
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>three days work in a film called dazed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and confused.</v>

167
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

168
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

169
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.463
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

170
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>So this director of that film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Linklater,</v>

171
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>he kept inviting me back to set each</v>
<v Speaker 1>night putting me in more scenes which</v>

172
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:45.740
<v Speaker 1>led to more lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of which I happily said yes to.</v>

173
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm having a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were telling me I'm good at what</v>

174
00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing and they're writing me a check</v>
<v Speaker 1>for $325 a day.</v>

175
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell yeah.</v>

176
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Give me more scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what I'm doing.</v>

177
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the shoot,</v>

178
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three lines and turned into over</v>

179
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:04.511
<v Speaker 1>three weeks work and it was mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Woodson's 1970 Chevelle that we</v>

180
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:06.680
<v Speaker 1>went to go get aerosmith tickets in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

181
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It was bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

182
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago I'm watching this film</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and I noticed two seems I really</v>

183
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have been in and one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>

184
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.000
<v Speaker 1>my character wooderson I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accept screen left to head somewhere</v>

185
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>and then I reentered the screen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>double check if any of the other</v>

186
00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>characters wanted to go with me now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewatching the film and you agree,</v>

187
00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:38.330
<v Speaker 1>if you know wooderson what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kristen's not a guy who would ever say</v>

188
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 1>later and then come back to see if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were sure you didn't want to go.</v>

189
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Now when waterson leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orders is gone.</v>

190
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>He does not stutter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step,</v>

191
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.470
<v Speaker 1>flinch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewind as twice or solicit.</v>

192
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waterson,</v>

193
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>there's better things to do like liking</v>
<v Speaker 1>those high school girls,</v>

194
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:57.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I get older and they stayed the</v>

195
00:10:57.111 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 1>same age point is I should not have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that thing.</v>

196
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't have come back,</v>

197
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 1>should've exited screen left and never</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>

198
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>but back then making my first film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting invited back to the set,</v>

199
00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:14.590
<v Speaker 1>cashing that check and having a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted more screen time.</v>

200
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be in the scene longer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and come back into the scene.</v>

201
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I shouldn't have been there.</v>

202
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Wooderson shouldn't have been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just as important where we are not</v>

203
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are.</v>

204
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first step that leads to our</v>

205
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is usually not.</v>

206
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I know who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who I am.</v>

207
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:44.040
<v Speaker 1>That's not the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first step,</v>

208
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.440
<v Speaker 1>she usually I know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not</v>

209
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Process of elimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defining ourselves by what we are not is</v>

210
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>the first step that leads us to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who we are.</v>

211
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>You know that group of friends that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out with that there really might</v>

212
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 1>not bring out the best in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they gossip too much or that</v>

213
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of shady really aren't going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for you in a pinch,</v>

214
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 1>or how about that bar that we keep going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that we always seem to have the worst</v>

215
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:18.350
<v Speaker 1>hangover from or that computer screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

216
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That computer screen that keeps giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>us an excuse not to get out of the house</v>

217
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and engage with the world and get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>real human interaction or how about that</v>

218
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>food that would keep eating this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tastes so good going down,</v>

219
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.070
<v Speaker 1>it makes us feel like crap the next week</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we feel lethargic and we keep</v>

220
00:12:34.071 --> 00:12:34.904
<v Speaker 1>putting on weight,</v>

221
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.030
<v Speaker 1>well those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those places,</v>

222
00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:41.600
<v Speaker 1>those things stopped giving them your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and energy.</v>

223
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Just don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them down and when you do this,</v>

224
00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:48.920
<v Speaker 1>when you do put them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you could go in there and you</v>

225
00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:53.300
<v Speaker 1>couldn't given them your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inadvertently find yourself spending</v>

226
00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:58.301
<v Speaker 1>more time and in more places that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy for you that bring you more joy.</v>

227
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you just eliminated the WHO's</v>

228
00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:04.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the Watson,</v>

229
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.950
<v Speaker 1>the winds that were keeping you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your identity,</v>

230
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.751
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust me,</v>

231
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:11.900
<v Speaker 1>too many options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you the too many options will</v>

232
00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:16.520
<v Speaker 1>make a tyrant of is all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so get rid of the excess,</v>

233
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the wasted time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decrease your options.</v>

234
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.240
<v Speaker 1>If you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have accidentally,</v>

235
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>almost innocently put in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is important to you by process of</v>

236
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:33.750
<v Speaker 1>elimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one who we are is hard.</v>

237
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to give yourself a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eliminate who you are,</v>

238
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>not first and you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find yourself where you need to be.</v>

239
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm a six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't leave crumbs and the beauty of</v>

240
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.620
<v Speaker 1>delayed gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what a crumbs.</v>

241
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.720
<v Speaker 1>The crumbs I'm talking about are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices that we make that make us have</v>

242
00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:05.721
<v Speaker 1>to look over our shoulder in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't pay that guy back the money</v>

243
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.840
<v Speaker 1>that you owed him and tonight you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw him.</v>

244
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Three rail is behind you.</v>

245
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.143
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

246
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You slept around on your spouse and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just found out that Tamara,</v>

247
00:14:18.201 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>she and the lady you were having an</v>
<v Speaker 1>affair with are going to be at the same</v>

248
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.590
<v Speaker 1>PTA meeting.</v>

249
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.893
<v Speaker 4>Shit again.</v>

250
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You drank too much last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too hung over to drive.</v>

251
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Your son is 8:00 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday morning baseball practice.</v>

252
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>These are the crumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come in the form of regret,</v>

253
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>guilt and remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leave trump's today.</v>

254
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They will cause you more stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

255
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>and they disallow you from creating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>customized future in which you do not</v>

256
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.740
<v Speaker 1>have to look over your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's flip the script.</v>

257
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Instead of creating outcomes that take</v>
<v Speaker 1>from us,</v>

258
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>let's create more outcomes that pay us</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

259
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Fill us up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your fire lit,</v>

260
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>turn you on for the most amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your future.</v>

261
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>These are the choices I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the beauty of delayed</v>

262
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tee yourself up.</v>

263
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Do yourself a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make the choices,</v>

264
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>the purchases today that pay you back</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

265
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Residuals in my business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it mailbox money.</v>

266
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>If I do my job well today and that movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps rerunning on TV,</v>

267
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.790
<v Speaker 1>five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting checks in the mailbox.</v>

268
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a heck of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whether it's prepping the coffee</v>

269
00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>maker the night before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all you got to do is press the button</v>

270
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 1>in the morning or getting ready for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>job interview early so you don't have to</v>

271
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 1>cram the night before or chooses not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hook up with that married woman because</v>

272
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to feel horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it tomorrow and her husband</v>

273
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:53.891
<v Speaker 1>carries a gun or paying your debts on</v>
<v Speaker 1>time so that when you do see that guy</v>

274
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.870
<v Speaker 1>three rows back tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to hunker down you seed</v>

275
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 1>hoping that he don't see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get some Roi.</v>

276
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Return on investment.</v>

277
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Your investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You customize your future.</v>

278
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't leave trumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number seven,</v>

279
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 1>dissect your successes and the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosody of gratitude.</v>

280
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 1>We so often focus on failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we?</v>

281
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.550
<v Speaker 1>We studied failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obsess with failure.</v>

282
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:38.551
<v Speaker 1>We dissect failure in our failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissect them so much.</v>

283
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:44.140
<v Speaker 1>We end up intoxicated with them to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of disillusion mean when we write</v>

284
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:46.480
<v Speaker 1>in our diary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually when we're depressed,</v>

285
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.470
<v Speaker 1>what do we gossip about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people's flaws and limitations,</v>

286
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.640
<v Speaker 1>and we can dissect ourselves into</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-loathing if we're not careful.</v>

287
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I find that most of the times our</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with what is wrong just ends</v>

288
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:02.290
<v Speaker 1>up breeding more wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more failure.</v>

289
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 1>The easiest way to dissect success</v>

290
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 1>is through gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving thanks for that,</v>

291
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>which we do have for what is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciating the simple things we</v>

292
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>sometimes take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We give thanks for these things and that</v>

293
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 1>gratitude reciprocate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating more to be thankful for it.</v>

294
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.760
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying be in denial of your</v>

295
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:34.460
<v Speaker 1>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can learn from them too,</v>

296
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:39.461
<v Speaker 1>but only if we look at them constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a means to reveal what we are good</v>

297
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:41.390
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can get better at,</v>

298
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>what we do succeed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>

299
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I've read a whole lot of my bad reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

300
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I've had quite few</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by the more talented critics.</v>

301
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>They are the ones who give constructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad reviews.</v>

302
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.800
<v Speaker 1>They reveal to me what did translate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my work,</v>

303
00:18:02.801 --> 00:18:06.130
<v Speaker 1>what came across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was seen or what was it.</v>

304
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't obsess on the unfavorable aspect</v>

305
00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:12.310
<v Speaker 1>of their views review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do see what I can learn from it</v>

306
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.550
<v Speaker 1>because their displeasure actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncovers.</v>

307
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes more apparent what I do do</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

308
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.570
<v Speaker 1>what I am successful at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I just sat back.</v>

309
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I live some verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try our best.</v>

310
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.750
<v Speaker 1>We don't always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our best.</v>

311
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Architecture is a verb as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

312
00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:38.590
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since we are the architects of our</v>

313
00:18:38.591 --> 00:18:40.420
<v Speaker 1>own lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's study the habits,</v>

314
00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:43.570
<v Speaker 1>the practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the routines that we have that lead to</v>

315
00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:46.450
<v Speaker 1>end feed our success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our joy,</v>

316
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 1>our honest pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our laughter,</v>

317
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Speaker 1>our earn tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's dissect that and give thanks for</v>

318
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.750
<v Speaker 1>those things and when we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what happens?</v>

319
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.950
<v Speaker 1>We get better at them and we have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dissect.</v>

320
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Number eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make voluntary obligations,</v>

321
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom and dad,</v>

322
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 1>since we were young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they teach us things as children,</v>

323
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentors,</v>

324
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on laws.</v>

325
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 1>They all give this guidelines for which</v>
<v Speaker 1>to navigate this life rules to abide by.</v>

326
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 1>In the name of accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about those obligations,</v>

327
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the ones that we make</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ourselves,</v>

328
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.390
<v Speaker 1>with our God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our own consciousness.</v>

329
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the you versus you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obligations we have to have now.</v>

330
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not societal laws and</v>

331
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.990
<v Speaker 1>expectations that we acknowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>endow for anyone other than ourselves.</v>

332
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.100
<v Speaker 1>These are faith based obligations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make on our own.</v>

333
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 1>These are not the lower insurance rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a good driving record.</v>

334
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You will not be fined or put in jail if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not gratify these obligations.</v>

335
00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I speak of no one else covers these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>

336
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.020
<v Speaker 1>They are your secrets with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own private counsel,</v>

337
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.100
<v Speaker 1>personal protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while nobody throws you a party,</v>

338
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:16.490
<v Speaker 1>when you abide by them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to arrest you when you</v>

339
00:20:16.491 --> 00:20:21.491
<v Speaker 1>break them either except yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some cops who got a disturbing the</v>

340
00:20:23.081 --> 00:20:25.900
<v Speaker 1>peace call at 2:30 in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were playing bongos.</v>

341
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 1>You birthday suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

342
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>that was me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honest man's pillow is,</v>

343
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:37.030
<v Speaker 1>is peace of mind and when you lay down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that pillow at night,</v>

344
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.780
<v Speaker 1>no matter who's in your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all sleep alone.</v>

345
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.370
<v Speaker 1>These are your personal jimminy cricket</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are not enough cops in the</v>

346
00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:47.660
<v Speaker 1>entire world to them.</v>

347
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.710
<v Speaker 5>It's on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on you</v>

348
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Midnight from Cannes to want.</v>

349
00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.291
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

350
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>In 1995 I got my first big paycheck as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actor.</v>

351
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 150 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film is almost boys on the side and</v>

352
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>we were shooting in Tucson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona and I had this sweet little</v>

353
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:14.160
<v Speaker 1>adobe guest house on the edge of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>swirl,</v>

354
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 1>national park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The house came with a maid.</v>

355
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 1>My first made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

356
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So I got a friend over one Friday night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're having a good time and I'm</v>

357
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.210
<v Speaker 1>telling her about how happy I am with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>

358
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>The house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the made,</v>

359
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>especially the maid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling her look like she cleans the</v>

360
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I go to work,</v>

361
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 1>she washes my clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dishes,</v>

362
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.510
<v Speaker 1>put fresh water by my bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads me cooked meal.</v>

363
00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes she even presses my jeans</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my friend,</v>

364
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 1>she smiles at me happy that I'm excited</v>
<v Speaker 1>over this.</v>

365
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:51.630
<v Speaker 1>that's great matthew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

367
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.530
<v Speaker 1>if you like your jeans pressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kinda looked up batter,</v>

368
00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:00.200
<v Speaker 1>my jaw hanging open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stuttered a moment.</v>

369
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Had that dumb ass slip that you get when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just been told the truth and you</v>

370
00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 1>didn't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he hit me.</v>

371
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I hate that line going down in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my jeans.</v>

372
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I hate that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was then for the first time that</v>

373
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I noticed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about not liking that</v>

374
00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:20.150
<v Speaker 1>starts sliding down the front of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes because I'd never had a maid</v>

375
00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Dharma jeans before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since she did.</v>

376
00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Now for the first time in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just liked it because I could get it.</v>

377
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really wanted it.</v>

378
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want it there.</v>

379
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.310
<v Speaker 1>That line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that night I learned something just</v>

380
00:22:37.311 --> 00:22:38.180
<v Speaker 1>because you can.</v>

381
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.580
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

382
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good enough reason to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

383
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Even when it means having more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be discerning,</v>

384
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 1>choose it because you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it because you want to</v>

385
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 1>never had my jeans pressed again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hate that line number 10,</v>

386
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>a roof is a man made thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may cut a little close to the bone</v>

387
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.820
<v Speaker 1>since the geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we all were there and we uh,</v>

388
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.840
<v Speaker 1>allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember where we were.</v>

389
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.300
<v Speaker 1>But in January the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

390
00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:24.150
<v Speaker 1>93,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the nfl playoffs in your Houston</v>

391
00:23:24.151 --> 00:23:29.151
<v Speaker 1>oilers for planning the buffalo bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The olders rubbed 28 to three at</v>

392
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.420
<v Speaker 1>halftime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five to three early in the third</v>

393
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.030
<v Speaker 1>frank break and the bills come back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>when?</v>

394
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:41.031
<v Speaker 1>Forty one to 38 and over time for one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest comebacks in NFL history.</v>

395
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bills one.</v>

396
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't really beat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the others lost that game.</v>

397
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 1>They beat themselves.</v>

398
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

399
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they beat themselves or how was</v>

400
00:23:58.121 --> 00:23:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it halftime,</v>

401
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.470
<v Speaker 1>they put a ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a roof,</v>

402
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.680
<v Speaker 1>a limit on their belief in themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka the prevent defense.</v>

403
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they started thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next opponent in the playoffs.</v>

404
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.841
<v Speaker 1>It halftime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

405
00:24:13.841 --> 00:24:17.230
<v Speaker 1>they were up and they came out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>played on their heels,</v>

406
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 1>lost the mental edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire second half and wall up.</v>

407
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.530
<v Speaker 1>They lost in a mere two quarters</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive coordinator,</v>

408
00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Jim Eddie went from being called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive coordinator of the year and</v>

409
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:35.971
<v Speaker 1>the man first in line to be a high a</v>
<v Speaker 1>head coach next year to a man without a</v>

410
00:24:37.571 --> 00:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>job in the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever choked?</v>

411
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has ever choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>

412
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.620
<v Speaker 1>been talking about fumbling the goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

413
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 1>second foot in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you got to the microphone,</v>

414
00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.140
<v Speaker 1>had a brain freeze on the exam that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were totally prepared for.</v>

415
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Forgot the punchline to a joke in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 40,000 graduating students at the</v>

416
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 1>University of Houston commencement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you've had that feeling of,</v>

417
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life just cannot get any better than</v>

418
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:12.310
<v Speaker 1>this moment and ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I deserve this?</v>

419
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens when we get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling tense up?</v>

420
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>We have this sort of outer body</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where we are literally three</v>

421
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.460
<v Speaker 1>seeing ourself in the third person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realized that the moment just got</v>

422
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.640
<v Speaker 1>bigger than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were felt that way,</v>

423
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.853
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

424
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's because we have created a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictitious ceiling,</v>

425
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:44.981
<v Speaker 1>a roof to our expectations of ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a limit where we think it's all too good</v>

426
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

427
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's not our right to say or believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

428
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.380
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't create these restrictions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on ourselves.</v>

429
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Blue ribbon a statue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a score,</v>

430
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.990
<v Speaker 1>a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The love of our life are euphoric.</v>

431
00:26:03.991 --> 00:26:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are we?</v>

432
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.120
<v Speaker 1>The thing that we don't deserve or</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't earned these gifts.</v>

433
00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:12.330
<v Speaker 1>When we get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all right,</v>

434
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.490
<v Speaker 1>but if we stay in process within</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

435
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.580
<v Speaker 1>in the joy of the doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will never choke at the finish line.</v>

436
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we are thinking of the finish</v>

437
00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:29.860
<v Speaker 1>line because we're not looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clock.</v>

438
00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:32.620
<v Speaker 1>We're not watching ourselves on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jumbotron,</v>

439
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.140
<v Speaker 1>performing the very act that we're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of.</v>

440
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in process.</v>

441
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The approach is the destination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're never finished.</v>

442
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Bo Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did do?</v>

443
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>He used to run over the goal line</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the endzone end of the tunnel,</v>

444
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the greatest snipers and marksman in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

445
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't aim at the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aim on the other side of the</v>

446
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do our best when our destinations are</v>

447
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>beyond the measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when our reach continually exceeds our</v>

448
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 1>grasp and when we have a more tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish lines,</v>

449
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.750
<v Speaker 1>and when we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the race is never over.</v>

450
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:14.751
<v Speaker 1>The journey has no port adventure never</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends because we are always on the way,</v>

451
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>so do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

452
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and let them let somebody else come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tap you on the shoulder and say,</v>

453
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.000
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you scored.</v>

454
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Let them run up and tap you on the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

455
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want let them come tell you you can</v>

456
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let them say I love you too.</v>

457
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Let them say thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the lid off.</v>

458
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:43.660
<v Speaker 1>The manmade roofs that we put above</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and always play like an</v>

459
00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:47.140
<v Speaker 1>underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would go number 11,</v>

460
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 1>turn the page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late and Great University of Texas</v>

461
00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:57.490
<v Speaker 1>football coach Darryl Royal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All remember when we won a national</v>

462
00:27:57.491 --> 00:27:58.540
<v Speaker 1>champion in [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>69.</v>

463
00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:01.300
<v Speaker 1>He won a couple of national</v>
<v Speaker 1>championships and it'll Darwalla.</v>

464
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He was a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good friend of many people.</v>

465
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people looked up to this man.</v>

466
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the people looked up to him was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>musician named Larry.</v>

467
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Now at this time in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry was in the prime of his country</v>

468
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 1>music career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had number one hits and his life was</v>

469
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 1>rolling and he had picked up a bad habit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a snort and the white stuff somewhere</v>

470
00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:30.990
<v Speaker 1>along the line and at one particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>party after a bathroom break,</v>

471
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Larry went confidently up to his mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darryl,</v>

472
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.090
<v Speaker 1>and he started telling the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh troy,</v>

473
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he always had,</v>

474
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and when Larry finished his story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about to walk away,</v>

475
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 1>coach royal put a gentle hand on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and he very discretely said,</v>

476
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 1>hey larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got something on your on your nose</v>

477
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:54.600
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Larry immediately hurried to the</v>

478
00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 1>bathroom mirror where he saw some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>white powder that he hadn't cleaned up</v>

479
00:28:57.811 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 1>his nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was ashamed.</v>

480
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.190
<v Speaker 1>He was embarrassed as much because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt so disrespectful to coach royal and</v>

481
00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:08.730
<v Speaker 1>as much because he'd obviously gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>too comfortable with the drug,</v>

482
00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 1>even hide it as well as he should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

483
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>the next day Larry went to coach's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

484
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>he rang the doorbell coach answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

485
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to talk to you.</v>

486
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.481
<v Speaker 1>Dale said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

487
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:19.314
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

488
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Larry confessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He purged his sins to coach.</v>

489
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 1>He told him how embarrassed he was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he had lost his way in the midst of</v>

490
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 1>all this fame and fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and towards the end of an hour,</v>

491
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was in tears,</v>

492
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>he asked coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

493
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>

494
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:44.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you think I should do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I coach being a man of few words,</v>

495
00:29:44.061 --> 00:29:45.550
<v Speaker 1>just looked at him and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>

496
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

497
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.043
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>

498
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I have never had any trouble turning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>page in the book of my life.</v>

499
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Larry got sober that day and he's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober for the last 40 years.</v>

500
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.540
<v Speaker 1>You ever get in a Rut?</v>

503
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.230
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

504
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.110
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to own them.</v>

505
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to make amends and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta move on.</v>

506
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Guilt and regret kills many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who their time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You are the author of the book of Your</v>

509
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn that page.</v>

510
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Number 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give your obstacles credit.</v>

511
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.390
<v Speaker 1>You know those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

512
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.370
<v Speaker 1>no fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tee shirts that were out,</v>

513
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to wear them 10 years ago.</v>

514
00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 1>No fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>may remember.</v>

515
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Those are just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw them everywhere.</v>

516
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.400
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

517
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't get them and I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I tried to scare myself at least</v>

518
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>once a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

519
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I get butterflies every morning before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to work.</v>

520
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous before I got here to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

521
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I think fear is a good thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

522
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Because it increases our need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that fear,</v>

523
00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say your obstacle is fear of</v>

524
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 1>rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to ask her out or you want</v>

525
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:24.130
<v Speaker 1>to ask him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you feared that he or she may say no</v>

526
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.550
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to ask your boss for that</v>

527
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 1>promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're scared.</v>

528
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 1>He's going to think you're overstepping</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bounds.</v>

529
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of denying those fears,</v>

530
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.610
<v Speaker 1>declare them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the fear out loud,</v>

531
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.220
<v Speaker 1>admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them the credit they deserve.</v>

532
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't get all macho and act like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal and don't get paralyzed by</v>

533
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:49.180
<v Speaker 1>denying that they exist and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoning your need to overcome them.</v>

534
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even subscribe to the belief that</v>

535
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>we're all destined to have to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we fear the most anyway at</v>

536
00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give your obstacles credit and you</v>

537
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 1>will one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the courage to overcome them or you</v>

538
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Speaker 1>will to see more clearly that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really worth prevailing over.</v>

539
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.970
<v Speaker 1>So be brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have courage.</v>

540
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.670
<v Speaker 1>And when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get stronger.</v>

541
00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 1>You get more aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get more respectful of yourself and</v>

542
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:20.450
<v Speaker 1>that which you fear.</v>

543
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Number 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we know when we crossed the</v>

544
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:32.270
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>13th and was asking why did I picked 13?</v>

545
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That's an unlucky member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

546
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When 13 got the bad rap and became the</v>

547
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 1>world numerology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never done me wrong.</v>

548
00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

549
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 1>13 has been a pretty lucky number for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

550
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:48.671
<v Speaker 1>And I want to tell you how</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always taken these 21 day trips by</v>

551
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 1>myself to far off places where I usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the language and nobody knows</v>

552
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 1>my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their adventures one,</v>

553
00:32:56.901 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're also a purge their cleanse</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

554
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:05.081
<v Speaker 1>they're like a 21 day fast from tension</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all the things I have in my well</v>

555
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 1>appointed life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are check out so I can check in</v>

557
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>He forced to be my own and my only</v>
<v Speaker 1>company to have a look in my mirror.</v>

558
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And we all know what can happen when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

559
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we do not like what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

560
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.420
<v Speaker 1>in 1996,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

561
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 1>right after I got famous from a film I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did couple of time to kill.</v>

562
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.863
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

563
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I headed out on one of these 21 day walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and this time to the jungles in</v>

564
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:44.141
<v Speaker 1>the mountains of Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sudden fame that I just gotten was</v>

565
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.630
<v Speaker 1>somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on balancing.</v>

566
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 1>My face was everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wanted a piece of me.</v>

567
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:52.910
<v Speaker 1>People I'd never met were swearing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they loved me everywhere I went there.</v>

568
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I was on a billboard of magazine cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

569
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 1>it was just weird overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 1>as I was asking myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the reality in this and what's</v>

571
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:04.220
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I deserve all this?</v>

572
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 1>These are all questions I was asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself who was I was another.</v>

573
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Now there's always an initiation period</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these trip,</v>

574
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.080
<v Speaker 1>an amount of time that it takes for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place to initiate the traveler,</v>

575
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the time it takes to disconnect from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

576
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:24.750
<v Speaker 1>We just left and become completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>present in the one we are traveling in</v>

577
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.361
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

578
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that initiation period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the last about 13 days,</v>

579
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 1>13 hellish days until I'm out of my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

580
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the night of the Twelfth Day.</v>

581
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 1>My 21 day trip I'm settling into camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had already hiked 80 miles to this point</v>

582
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:47.921
<v Speaker 1>and I had a three day trek atomy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machu Picchu and I was full on sick of</v>

583
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:50.390
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling with the loss of anonymity.</v>

584
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I was guilt ridden for the sins of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

585
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Had a lot of grit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lonely,</v>

586
00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 1>disgusted with my company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine grappling with these demons on this</v>

587
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.853
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't sleep</v>

588
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 1>all of these badges and banners and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations and anxieties that I was</v>

589
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:09.170
<v Speaker 1>carrying with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to free myself from them,</v>

590
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.740
<v Speaker 1>so I stripped down to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

591
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I took every moniker that gave me pride</v>
<v Speaker 1>and confidence,</v>

592
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 1>all the window dressings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the packaging around the product.</v>

593
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I discard them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of my lucky and faithful</v>

594
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 1>American cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stripped off all my talismans from</v>

595
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 1>adventures past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even discarded my late father's gold</v>

596
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:33.730
<v Speaker 1>ring with an m on it that he gave to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was.</v>

597
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a meltdown of he and my mom's</v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms and gold from mom's teeth.</v>

598
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Even got rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was naked,</v>

599
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 1>literally and figuratively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got sick,</v>

600
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.940
<v Speaker 1>felt clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt free and light</v>

601
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a muddy path on this walk.</v>

602
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned a corner and they're in the</v>

603
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 1>middle of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was was this Mirage.</v>

604
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It's magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinks and blues and red colors that I'd</v>

605
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 1>ever seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was electric,</v>

606
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 1>glowing and vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hovering just off the surface of</v>

607
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:13.800
<v Speaker 1>the jungle floor as if it was plugged</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some neon powerplant.</v>

608
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stared.</v>

609
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 1>There was no way around it.</v>

610
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 1>The jungle floor in front of me was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually thousands of butterflies</v>

611
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 1>there in my path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was spectacular,</v>

612
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>so I stayed a in somewhere in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>captivation I heard this little voice</v>

613
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 1>inside my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say these words,</v>

614
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.140
<v Speaker 1>all I want is what I can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all I can see is what's in front of</v>

615
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:45.130
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

616
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:50.520
<v Speaker 1>at that moment have I had stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipating what was around the corner</v>

617
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped thinking about what was coming</v>

618
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 1>up next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was up ahead.</v>

619
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Time slowed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was no longer in a rush to get</v>

620
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and my anxieties were greatly</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease.</v>

621
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Few hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I returned to camp.</v>

622
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Even the local Sherpas I was traveling</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

623
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 1>they they noticed calling out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's losing Mateo so he's lose,</v>

624
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:19.460
<v Speaker 1>which means you are light in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The I forgave myself.</v>

625
00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 1>That morning I let go of the guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wait,</v>

626
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it was on.</v>

627
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 1>My shoulders was lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my penance was paid,</v>

628
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 1>and I got back in good graces with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and I shook hands with myself,</v>

629
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 1>my best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that we're all stuck with</v>

630
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and from that morning on the</v>

631
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 1>adventure was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was president.</v>

632
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I was out of my own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not anticipating next.</v>

633
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I was embracing only what was in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my eyes and giving everything that</v>

634
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:45.850
<v Speaker 1>justice that he deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

635
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I crossed the truth that morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now did I find it?</v>

636
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it found me.</v>

637
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I put myself in a place to be</v>

638
00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put myself in a place to receive the</v>

639
00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:02.190
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we know when we crossed the</v>

640
00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

641
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I think the truth is all around us all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

642
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the answer,</v>

643
00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always right there or right there.</v>

644
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't always see it.</v>

645
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't always grasp it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It access it usually because we're not</v>

646
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 1>in the right place to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do</v>

647
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 1>first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we've got to put ourselves in</v>

648
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 1>the place to receive the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

649
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.040
<v Speaker 1>We live in an extremely noisy world with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of frequencies coming at us.</v>

650
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 1>We've got commitments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got deadlines,</v>

651
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 1>fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

652
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

653
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and they all make it hard to get clarity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and peace of mind,</v>

654
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>so we have to consciously put ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in places to receive that clarity.</v>

655
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Now that may be prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be meditation,</v>

656
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that may be a walkabout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be being in the right company,</v>

657
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 1>a road trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is for you.</v>

658
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Schedule that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule it</v>

659
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.800
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

660
00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:01.200
<v Speaker 1>If we hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've put ourselves in a place to hear</v>

661
00:39:01.201 --> 00:39:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it and we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's become clear,</v>

662
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.100
<v Speaker 1>a truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural and infinite.</v>

663
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Then the second part comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to personalize it.</v>

664
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Ask yourself how it works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it applies to you personally,</v>

665
00:39:13.621 --> 00:39:16.680
<v Speaker 1>why you need it in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

666
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then comes the third part.</v>

667
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Had the patience to internalize it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get it from our intellectual head.</v>

668
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about it and into our bones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our soul.</v>

669
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And our instinct now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot rush this part.</v>

670
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.520
<v Speaker 1>It does take time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we get that far,</v>

671
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.820
<v Speaker 1>we've received it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we personalize it and internalize it.</v>

672
00:39:38.821 --> 00:39:41.490
<v Speaker 1>If we make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got to have the courage to act on</v>

673
00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually take it into our daily</v>

674
00:39:43.651 --> 00:39:48.651
<v Speaker 1>lives and practice it to make it an</v>
<v Speaker 1>active part of who we are and live it</v>

675
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

676
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 1>If we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have what I believe is heaven</v>

677
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:57.060
<v Speaker 1>right here on earth.</v>

678
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ticket in it.</v>

679
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's where I want to live</v>

680
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 1>while we're here and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run across the jumbo tron.</v>

681
00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:12.681
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it a place where we break a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat where we believe,</v>

682
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 1>where we enjoyed the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeding in the places,</v>

683
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:20.520
<v Speaker 1>in ways that we're fashion to where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to look over our shoulder</v>

684
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:25.590
<v Speaker 1>because we're too busy doing what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at voluntarily keeping our own</v>

685
00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:30.480
<v Speaker 1>council because we want to traveling</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards immortal finish lines.</v>

686
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.840
<v Speaker 1>We write our own book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming our fears.</v>

687
00:40:33.841 --> 00:40:38.841
<v Speaker 1>We make friends with ourselves and Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Place and I'm talking about.</v>
