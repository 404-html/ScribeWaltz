<v Speaker 1>You can hide under here.</v>

51
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It will come where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but most people spend their life not</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to deal with the pain of</v>

54
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pain of defeat,</v>

55
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>the pain of being disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain of losing,</v>

56
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>the pain of failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain of being criticized,</v>

57
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>the pain of not being locked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain,</v>

58
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain.</v>

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>That's called life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is don't pay this everywhere,</v>

60
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>but that's why there is no gain without</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain</v>

61
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.390
<v Speaker 2>because it's the pain of regret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your experience.</v>

62
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>If I had it to do over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pain.</v>

63
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Don't you know that something when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I was in a seminar once and this lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>stood up if I had my life to live over</v>

65
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talked about all of the things that</v>

66
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.810
<v Speaker 2>she would do and you can feel the pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>of regret,</v>

67
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 2>regret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was still experiencing.</v>

68
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>She was trying not to experience the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain of defeat,</v>

69
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the pain of disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain of loss.</v>

70
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

71
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>The pain of lack of support</v>

72
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.280
<v Speaker 4>and she's still experienced pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was right there.</v>

73
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 4>We can't get around it.</v>

74
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Most people are governed by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>

75
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the fears and the opinions of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people never try anything</v>

76
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:26.651
<v Speaker 1>differently because they have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced by people in their lives that</v>

77
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>they value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be can't do it.</v>

78
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>They're living within the context of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions that other people have of then</v>

79
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the low expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people doubt themselves because</v>

80
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>when they thought about doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some critical point in the life of</v>

81
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>somebody they respected and honored</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

82
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 1>they believed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that they loved,</v>

83
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>someone they trusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

84
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they accepted that.</v>

85
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>As you look at your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself the question,</v>

86
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.680
<v Speaker 1>what would your life be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would your life look like if you</v>

87
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 1>decided not to care what people thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you?</v>

88
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.000
<v Speaker 1>What would your life be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to give up some of your fears?</v>

89
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 1>What would your life be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to become courageous?</v>

90
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 1>What would your life be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to act on your dream?</v>

91
00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:32.600
<v Speaker 1>If you did what you felt in your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what courageous means?</v>

92
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Tom Ruskin and randy reads that this had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that courage comes from a French word,</v>

93
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.730
<v Speaker 1>which means of the heart.</v>

94
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>How does it feel to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

95
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>it's college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it takes courage to lear says</v>

96
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:54.331
<v Speaker 1>most people go through life not allowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to step out because they</v>

97
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>don't want to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be blown around.</v>

98
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be moved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The courage to face of lice,</v>

99
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>whirling win of contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but courage to love yourself.</v>

100
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>The courage to love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For years I was afraid to long the</v>

101
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>courage to take a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the courage to be who you are.</v>

102
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.360
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage isn't for somebody else.</v>

103
00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:23.410
<v Speaker 1>For metals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Applause,</v>

104
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:27.040
<v Speaker 1>a moral depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courage is what at that moment feels</v>

105
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>most right for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just situational ethics,</v>

106
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.100
<v Speaker 1>but what feels right in your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word alcohol,</v>

107
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.610
<v Speaker 1>what feels right in your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One great philosopher says,</v>

108
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>car what's die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many times before their deaths,</v>

109
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the valiant never taste of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once.</v>

110
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.590
<v Speaker 1>What does that be in the valley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people aren't afraid.</v>

111
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

112
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:51.700
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that they experienced that here</v>

113
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Speaker 1>and they move forward and move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any harm?</v>

114
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Many people are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not many people along their dreams to</v>

115
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:02.560
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people applying the ideas,</v>

<v Speaker 1>delight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorma and collect dust.</v>

117
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Many people have all this talent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability that they align to be embedded</v>

118
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>inside of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will take with them to their</v>

119
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>graves because they didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to be who they are.</v>

120
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And I say as you begin to look toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and manifesting your</v>

121
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take everything in you,</v>

122
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>everything in you that your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves.</v>

123
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>The concentrated effort to begin to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

124
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:37.321
<v Speaker 1>How is it that I can express more of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it that I can bring my ideas out</v>

125
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:39.214
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

126
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.830
<v Speaker 1>how is it and start living with a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of urgency?</v>

127
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you're here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gone today.</v>

128
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Life is unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uncertain.</v>

129
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 1>There are no guarantees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no guarantees out here at all.</v>

130
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So holding back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you waiting on?</v>

131
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Ask Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the benefit of your waiting?</v>

132
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.650
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of you're not living</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dream?</v>

133
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of not listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

134
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please listen to yourself.</v>

135
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>You know the feelings that you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the feelings in your heart,</v>

136
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing it now more everyday.</v>

137
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I find that my feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can trust them.</v>

138
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.750
<v Speaker 1>And I say to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you look toward the future,</v>

139
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you look at life on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's something that you had been</v>

140
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:28.450
<v Speaker 1>given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've heard something within</v>

141
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you know that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now,</v>

142
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work for you.</v>

143
00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not giving you what you want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else that you want to</v>

144
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:40.000
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't allow that inner doubt in you to</v>

145
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>talk you out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bill,</v>

146
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 1>a case on why you can't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you why you're not good enough.</v>

147
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You ignore that inner voice and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the external voices.</v>

148
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't judge the possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you can do based upon the</v>

149
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the circumstances won't</v>

150
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>determine who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't determine what you're able to do</v>

151
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>based upon your resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't determine what's possible for you</v>

152
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>based upon where your life is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your life is right now.</v>

153
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just what it is right now,</v>

154
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but the possibilities for you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited.</v>

155
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a rebuilding process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unlimited.</v>

156
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're coming back from adversity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastation,</v>

157
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.080
<v Speaker 1>it's unlimited of what you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the capacity of human beings.</v>

158
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how many mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've made.</v>

159
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how many flops you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

160
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter how much money you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>

161
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it only as an investment.</v>

162
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>What you learned from life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not losses,</v>

163
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but investments of what's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

164
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And I say to you that once you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to yourself and as you begin</v>

165
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>to act on your dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you start just trying to find your</v>

166
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what you can,</v>

167
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>what you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will start seeing things opening up</v>

168
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started tracking people.</v>

169
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd it come from?</v>

170
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Things will start coming together.</v>

171
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Clicking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

172
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start brainstorming.</v>

173
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Ideas will come out of nowhere as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on it.</v>

174
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>The key to it is to begin to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is you want to do.</v>

175
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:13.771
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

176
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>why is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as you focus on that which you</v>

177
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which we focus on,</v>

178
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>that which we give out energy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will begin to multiply.</v>

179
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>It will began to expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will begin to develop your</v>

180
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and out of that comes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness.</v>

181
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Out of that comes a commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of that comes a passion for life.</v>

182
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Out of that calm they special power that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have in you that you haven't even</v>

183
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>called on yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

184
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the powers that we have will never</v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal themselves if we don't challenge</v>

185
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't put ourselves in the</v>

186
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>position where we have to use them.</v>

187
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most important things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a book that's a really</v>

188
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>interesting book called instant</v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaire.</v>

189
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in a position where you</v>

190
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:02.631
<v Speaker 1>can't retreat where it's do or die sake</v>
<v Speaker 1>or swell.</v>

191
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're developing credible swimming</v>

192
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find yourself struggling unlike</v>

193
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through the inspiration of desperation,</v>

194
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you'll become more creative than ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

195
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we handle that whole piece?</v>

196
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Throw your whole self into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

197
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 1>most people go at it tentatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give all their stuff.</v>

198
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>They don't concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't put everything they've got in</v>

199
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Guy wrote a book called,</v>

200
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 1>all you can do is all you can do and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do if he know.</v>

201
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you do all you can do.</v>

202
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And if we're honest this evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that we haven't done all we can</v>

203
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as we look at the future,</v>

204
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we can decide that from this day</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

205
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>As I look at my personal relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at my professional</v>

206
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at my family relationships,</v>

207
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>if I look at all the dimensions of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

208
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>looking at myself mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>

209
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>and spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do all I can do to develop</v>

210
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring my talent out here,</v>

211
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>to make a contribution to life.</v>
