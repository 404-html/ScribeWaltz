1
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never want to be that nine to five</v>

2
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>person that just lives my entire life</v>
<v Speaker 1>working the nine to five and just be</v>

3
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>happy with a modest lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being secure.</v>

5
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they want and they just want</v>

6
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>a secure lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>own a house,</v>

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be able to retire and that makes him</v>

9
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.501
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

10
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And I just believe that we should always</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>always be pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>to achieve more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become more,</v>

13
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sit at a job.</v>

14
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>The same job for 30 years is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I would ever choose to do in</v>

15
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are tied to go to college and get a</v>

17
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're taught.</v>

18
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>If you become a doctor or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're successful,</v>

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time still have a boss,</v>

20
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>so have someone you know Tony what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you still have the schedule and you</v>

21
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>have to stick to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not much different than working</v>

23
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>at Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just you're making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still on the same exact</v>

25
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

26
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>working at Mcdonald's is not sinking or</v>
<v Speaker 1>same scenario,</v>

27
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to enjoy what you're doing and</v>

29
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the lifestyle freedom,</v>

30
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 1>do what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you want the most incredible thing.</v>

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to work hard at whatever you do,</v>

32
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>whether you're working for someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>or working for yourself.</v>

33
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to put that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to end up being</v>

34
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be satisfied.</v>

35
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>But that's what keeps us going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>when you become content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then life's over.</v>

37
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

38
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mentality is what's going to make</v>

39
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 1>was having that mentality of never give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

41
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 1>keep pushing forward and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish your goals and hopefully you</v>

42
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>have more goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to move on to bigger</v>

43
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>and better things and trying to improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in every area.</v>

44
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You really have to believe what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is working.</v>

45
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And I was very important to believe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to believe to achieve.</v>

46
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not hundred percent confident</v>

47
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail.</v>

48
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is doing something,</v>

49
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe not 100% correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they truly believe in their mind</v>

50
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing the best they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly do and they believe what</v>

51
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>

52
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to have a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>success than someone that is doing it in</v>

53
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 1>100% right but aren't positive than what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

54
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind is the most powerful tool we</v>

55
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>have and in order to be a winner you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to lose.</v>

56
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

57
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you learn.</v>

58
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day I may is telling me,</v>

59
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you better get out there and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>busting your ass,</v>

60
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going forward and never stopped.</v>

61
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't miss a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>one day miss is they can't get back.</v>

63
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always look at the positive,</v>

64
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glass is always half full.</v>

65
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>If you think positive and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive,</v>

67
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

68
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you're only going to continue to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and it's being positive in every</v>

69
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is is the secret.</v>

70
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a secret to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're negative about anything,</v>

71
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>you're going fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is,</v>

72
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be better.</v>

73
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's one in every aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to better yourself in</v>

74
00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:12.951
<v Speaker 1>every way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>all work hand in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people realize when you help</v>

76
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.400
<v Speaker 1>somebody else you're helping yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it feels good,</v>

77
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.661
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

78
00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.990
<v Speaker 1>what comes around goes around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing is light in</v>

79
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Speaker 1>life to not give a shit what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think.</v>

80
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important thing.</v>

81
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And to have that kind of an attitude and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality is rare.</v>

82
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are always concerned about what</v>

83
00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 1>other people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter who they are.</v>

84
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It really doesn't matter what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>

85
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really doesn't matter if you can have</v>

86
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that kind of mentality is so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>further in life.</v>

87
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.850
<v Speaker 1>People don't like to think they like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

88
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like to think and they don't</v>

89
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>have enough confidence in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that they make on their own.</v>

90
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.480
<v Speaker 1>When they get advice from someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives them more confidence to</v>

91
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 1>believe that that's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should always be trying,</v>

92
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be better at every aspect in life.</v>

93
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:13.230
<v Speaker 1>are you a good husband?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a good wife?</v>

95
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Are you a good son?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>are you a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it could be.</v>

98
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a million things in life that we</v>

99
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

100
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I think we should constantly be trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be better in every area.</v>

101
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I kind of liked to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:32.940
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>enjoy life and that's kind of what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not stress and do what I want to do</v>

105
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 1>when I want to do it is just a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>
