1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the thing you're most scared of is</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you do.</v>

2
00:00:02.411 --> 00:00:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Love what I do still have passion for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

3
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I just tried to down there.</v>

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 2>What'd you just say your name and tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me what you do.</v>

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Chris Evans.</v>

6
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could give yourself advice,</v>

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>like look back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

8
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>and talk to the 12 year old version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What advice would you give?</v>

10
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd say the sounds in my inmate might</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem okay oversimplified,</v>

11
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

12
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.981
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a big thing for me,</v>

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny how noisy my brain is.</v>

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's praying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's noisy,</v>

15
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>it's what it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes thoughts.</v>

16
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in most of our lives of root of</v>

17
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 2>suffering is following that brain noise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and listening to that brain noise and</v>

18
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 2>actually identifying with it as if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>

19
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 2>That's just the noise your brain makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

20
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more often than not,</v>

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 2>it probably doesn't have much to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to help you.</v>

22
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.193
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

23
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 2>For Captain America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that you turned down the role a</v>

24
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 2>number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just explain why it was because</v>

25
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>it was a big commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted six movies and you know,</v>

26
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>normally you do movies one at a time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one of those movies hits and his</v>

27
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>success in your life noticeably changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 2>your personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your anonymity,</v>

29
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 2>privacy is affected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the opportunity to stop and</v>

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 2>regroup and go home and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 2>make a decision from then on how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to proceed with your life.</v>

32
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Worry was if this movie hits and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a lifestyle change and I don't react</v>

33
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>well to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an opportunity,</v>

34
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 2>the luxury to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.851
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

36
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to go back to doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>indies or maybe something else.</v>

37
00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in a couple of years I don't want</v>

38
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 2>to act anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

39
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just six movies can be spread over</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years and making a decision for a</v>

40
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>decade and it's not just a decision for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

41
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a lifestyle changes to a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your anonymity is compromised,</v>

42
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 2>then it's really not your right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>complain anymore.</v>

43
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>So if all of a sudden somebody in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family ends up in a hospital and you're</v>

44
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 2>going in and out and every day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone taking pictures of you,</v>

45
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 2>when you complain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to say,</v>

46
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>too bad you made this bed sleeping in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

47
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's a shame and that's a decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make,</v>

48
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 2>prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

49
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>this ripple effect isn't just going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be about me.</v>

50
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:19.961
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

52
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 2>is there another way to get where I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get without this?</v>

53
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go with the strings attached or</v>

54
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 2>six movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a scary loss of control that I</v>

55
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't ready to process them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said no.</v>

56
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked every human being in my life</v>

57
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 2>what they thought and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone said I should do the movie.</v>

58
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

59
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to therapy.</v>

60
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I went to therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

61
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:41.554
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to,</v>

62
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm a therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would they have to say?</v>

63
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:44.014
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 2>cause I do struggle with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get anxiety about certain things and</v>

66
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 2>press and things like that.</v>

67
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 2>all those things were tied into marvel</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities and it kind of started</v>

69
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 2>to shift on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

70
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started to feel like maybe the thing</v>

71
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>most scared of is exactly what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>

72
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is actually what you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>push yourself into.</v>

73
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>And it just started to make sense to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

74
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go for it.</v>

75
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>it was a bumpy acclimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was certainly a nerve wracking first</v>

77
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 2>couple weeks of shooting as to whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not I made the right choice.</v>

78
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>But in retrospect it certainly was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

79
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:24.391
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine him kicking myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my agent's got</v>

80
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 2>a lifetime supply and I told you since</v>
<v Speaker 2>off that one,</v>

81
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 2>the Times that I felt my best are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments that I've been able to pull that</v>

82
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:38.030
<v Speaker 2>plug and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

83
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Shh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shh,</v>

84
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.693
<v Speaker 4>shh.</v>

85
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's not quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not giving up.</v>

86
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:46.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not washing your hands of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

87
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.890
<v Speaker 2>It's rising above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's operating on a separate plane.</v>

88
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

89
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you can't dissect why that works because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reason it works doesn't speak the</v>

90
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 2>same language that the brain speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't try and say,</v>

91
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>well why Shush?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the shush is,</v>

92
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different,</v>

93
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you just</v>

94
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.671
<v Speaker 2>just feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 2>like that's better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's better.</v>

96
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>And I think back to all the time I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably spent suffering as a result of</v>

97
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>brain noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours of my life wasted.</v>

98
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'd say.</v>

99
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 5>Where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm from Boston.</v>

100
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 5>You still consider that your home?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said you were walking up there?</v>

101
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

102
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Speaker 5>I got a place back there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

103
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got nothing against that law.</v>

104
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:38.481
<v Speaker 5>I just prefer these coasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of six.</v>

105
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have three brothers and sisters,</v>

106
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:43.890
<v Speaker 5>the oldest sister and myself and younger</v>
<v Speaker 5>brother and younger sister.</v>

107
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 5>We're really close now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very tight knit family.</v>

108
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 5>We did everything together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all actors,</v>

109
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 5>so we're all very melodramatic and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>very young,</v>

110
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imaginative.</v>

111
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 5>And we play a lot of games together just</v>
<v Speaker 5>in our backyard.</v>

112
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 5>I had a great childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a great youth and my family was a</v>

113
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.240
<v Speaker 5>big part of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I loved him,</v>

114
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.250
<v Speaker 5>but going home for me is kind of where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just reconnect to that part of my mind,</v>

115
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just come out here for too long</v>

116
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.330
<v Speaker 5>and things that shouldn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start mattering.</v>

117
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:17.331
<v Speaker 5>And Lisa recharge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Initially I was really big into art,</v>

118
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 5>drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>painting and art school is going to be a</v>

119
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 5>path I was going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't start acting until I was about</v>

120
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 5>maybe 1314 my older sister was doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>plays.</v>

121
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 5>She was having a ball so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try it.</v>

122
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.763
<v Speaker 5>And it was a good time</v>

123
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>because I kept doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably had much bigger balls than I do</v>

124
00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:38.690
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I sit,</v>

125
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified before I additions.</v>

126
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I probably couldn't wait to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

127
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back to some of the things I did</v>

128
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:45.774
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 2>acting camp and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the,</v>

130
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 2>the Gusto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness.</v>

131
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.750
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who led the yearbook?</v>

132
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Were you in the virtuous burglar or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bald soprano that was in the virtue of</v>

133
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>suburb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what role did you play?</v>

134
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of plays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you that.</v>

136
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nightmares about this.</v>

137
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Were you backstage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden they're like,</v>

138
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing the Virgin's book.</v>

139
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.561
<v Speaker 2>You get a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took,</v>

140
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember my lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get out there.</v>

141
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>They'll come to you and you've come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage with a play you did 15 years ago</v>

142
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and you're forced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

143
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens when I sleep back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the good old days.</v>

144
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>97 what a time.</v>

145
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Where did that change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

146
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did the anxiety starts hitting you</v>

147
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.571
<v Speaker 2>matters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

148
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:34.180
<v Speaker 2>when you're like auditioning for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>for your work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your career,</v>

150
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:36.941
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you're an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just fun and games.</v>

152
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>You're actually trying to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and when it doesn't work out,</v>

153
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you start to kind of get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.380
<v Speaker 2>so heady game acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:46.000
<v Speaker 2>for any movie you book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably right,</v>

156
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dozens of projections and that that can</v>

157
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 6>play on you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you start to kind of put pressure on</v>

158
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:53.674
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

159
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.590
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you go through stints of</v>
<v Speaker 6>having really good auditions,</v>

160
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:58.420
<v Speaker 6>really solid additions being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm good.</v>

161
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 6>Every time I go in the room and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>centered and present and ready at the</v>

162
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 6>times you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

163
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I forget how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you're on shaky ground every</v>

164
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.420
<v Speaker 6>time you step in a room.</v>

165
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You said that there's a search to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

166
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Does that only apply to acting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything that reality looks and</v>

167
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>feels and smells and sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's not and,</v>

168
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 2>and you're completely in control of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolding.</v>

169
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's the time where I really feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most present.</v>

170
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of my addiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acting because I struggled to find</v>

171
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 2>that in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit harder when there's no script</v>

172
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 2>and this is just happening in a chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

173
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 2>but the hunt for the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 2>the hunt to be present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the goal.</v>

175
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acting is like temporary artificial</v>

176
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>substitute that it's like a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

177
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.660
<v Speaker 2>My goal in life is to find that to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>present like that in life.</v>

178
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
