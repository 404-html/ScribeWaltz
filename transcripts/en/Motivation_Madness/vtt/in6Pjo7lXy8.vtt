00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Sitting on the same football field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1993</v>

2
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>and I made a quilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>There's some people call concert versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called the confidence.</v>

4
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I said that I might be the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>player that ever woke up out of the</v>

5
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:41.351
<v Speaker 1>University of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not say that because I thought I</v>

6
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>was better than everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it there simply because I was</v>

7
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:51.991
<v Speaker 1>willing to put into work to now be back</v>
<v Speaker 1>here 18 years later,</v>

8
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>my asking nobody for nothing today I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

9
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sharing my story to tell y'all</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you'd think somebody got a</v>

10
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:16.621
<v Speaker 1>good man and always good</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you guys said in man,</v>

11
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I sat around the greatest athletes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

12
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no other man out there willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give up what I'm willing to give up.</v>

13
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I said that in 1993 when I said I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be degraded as hurricane and the only</v>

14
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>thing that I got in the middle of all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

15
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>this is the only thing in the father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

16
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>this results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other blue.</v>

17
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got no other secrets to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all.</v>

18
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I ain't come here with nothing else but</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you if you want to do something</v>

19
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.910

<v Speaker 1>there's not a person on my team is 16</v>

21
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>years that is consistently beat me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball every play.</v>

22
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Then again going to do a town</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's got everything to do with</v>

23
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else.</v>

24
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>15 straight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 four bowls late.</v>

25
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that's kept me around</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much effort.</v>

26
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240
<v Speaker 1>So when you put on this all I ever knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the effort we'll get me scene,</v>

27
