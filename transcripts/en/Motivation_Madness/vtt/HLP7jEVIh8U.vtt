1
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>The next best predictor of lifetime</v>
<v Speaker 1>success is conscientiousness.</v>

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and I've though of the two aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness say orderliness and</v>

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better predictor is industriousness.</v>

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness?</v>

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's Kinda rough too because</v>

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong genetic component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can work on micro habits with</v>

9
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>regards to your conscientiousness and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the best micro habits.</v>

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>This is partly to do with this future</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program processes.</v>

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I think the best thing you can do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to your conscientiousness is to</v>

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>set up some aims for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goals that you actually value and the</v>

13
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program helps people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And basically it does a situational</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of it helps you do a</v>

15
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>situational analysis of your life more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a psychological analysis I would</v>

16
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the questions are something like,</v>

17
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to put some effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your life and you need to be</v>

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do that.</v>

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And so what are the potential sources of</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation?</v>

21
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>You could think about them in the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five manner.</v>

22
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're extroverted,</v>

23
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>you want friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're agreeable,</v>

24
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you want an intimate relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're disagreeable,</v>

25
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you want to win competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're open,</v>

26
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you want to engage in creative activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>

27
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you want security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

28
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So those are all sources of potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation that you could draw on that</v>

29
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you could tailor to your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>your own personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there are dimensions that you</v>

31
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>want to consider your life across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we asked people about,</v>

32
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>if you could have your life the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it in three to five years,</v>

34
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>if you were taking care of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

35
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your</v>

36
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you want from your intimate</v>

37
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you like to structure your</v>

38
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>

39
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to use your time</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of your job and how are you</v>

41
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>going to regulate your mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

42
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physical health,</v>

43
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and maybe also your drug and alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

44
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to Auger down,</v>

45
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because alcoholism,</v>

46
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipes out,</v>

47
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five to 10 percent of people,</v>

48
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>so you want to keep that under control</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

49
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>and then so maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

50
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you develop a vision of what your life,</v>

51
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>what you would like your life to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that associates the,</v>

52
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>so the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the goal is established and then</v>

53
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>you break down the goal into micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that you could implement the</v>

54
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:29.271
<v Speaker 1>microprocesses become rewarding in</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion in relation to there a causal</v>

55
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>association with the goal and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangles in your,</v>

56
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>your incentive reward system.</v>

57
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the dopaminergic</v>

58
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing that keeps you</v>

59
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way it works is that it works</v>

60
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.881
<v Speaker 1>better if it produces positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it can see you moving towards a</v>

61
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>valued goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

62
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>well what's the implication of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better have a valued goal because</v>

63
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you can't get any positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation working out.</v>

64
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And so the more valuable the goal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

65
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>the more the micro processes associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that goal start to take on a</v>

66
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>positive charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is while you get</v>

67
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>up in the morning and you're excited</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the day,</v>

68
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you're ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so as far as I can tell,</v>

69
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you specify your longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

70
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you also specify a place you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay the hell away from them so that</v>

71
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified to fail as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about succeeding because that's</v>

72
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>also useful.</v>

73
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>You specify your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that,</v>

74
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you do that in some sense as a unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

75
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to specify goals that make you</v>

76
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

77
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>if that could happen as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my efforts,</v>

78
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it would clearly be worthwhile because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question always is,</v>

79
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>why do something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because doing nothing is easy.</v>

80
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You just sit there and you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

81
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>How it's real easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is why would you ever do</v>

82
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that has to be because</v>

83
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you've determined by some means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile.</v>

84
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>where should you look for worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

86
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you could consult your own temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other would be,</v>

88
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>while you kinda look at how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what it is that people accrue</v>

89
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that's valuable across the lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what,</v>

90
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>look what.</v>

91
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>So you do a structural analysis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents of human existence and</v>

92
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>already good that you need a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need friends,</v>

93
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>like you don't need to have all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

94
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but you better have most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>

95
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

96
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.760
<v Speaker 1>educational goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans for time outside of work and</v>

97
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>attention to your mental and physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

98
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>etc. You know those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is about.</v>

99
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And if You don't have any of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

100
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>well then all you've got left is misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering.</v>

101
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad,</v>

102
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad deal for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

103
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>so once you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you set up that goal structure,</v>

104
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really in many in many ways,</v>

105
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should be doing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities is that's exactly what you</v>

106
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>should be doing is trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>who it is that you're trying to be,</v>

107
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you aim at that and then use</v>

108
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>everything you learned as a means of</v>
<v Speaker 1>building that person that you want to</v>

109
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:00.440
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

110
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And and I really mean want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean should be even those</v>

111
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are going to overlap and</v>

112
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>it's important to distinguish between</v>
<v Speaker 1>those because that's partly,</v>

113
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is back down to the micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>routine analysis.</v>

114
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:12.641
<v Speaker 1>So I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to make yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>more industrious.</v>

116
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

117
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>specify your damn goals because how are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to hit something if you don't</v>

118
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>know what it is that isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

119
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And often people won't specify their</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals too because they don't like to</v>

120
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>specify conditions for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you keep yourself all vague and</v>

121
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is real easy because that's just a</v>

122
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>matter of not doing as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know when you fail and</v>

123
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:34.331
<v Speaker 1>people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to know when I fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's painful,</v>

125
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep myself blind about when I</v>

126
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

127
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you'll fail all the time.</v>

128
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Then you just won't know it until you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed so badly that you're done.</v>

129
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>And that can easily happen by the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 40.</v>

130
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would recommend that you don't let</v>

131
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's willful blindness,</v>

132
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have known,</v>

133
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>but you chose not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

134
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>So once you get your goal structure set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

135
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.721
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

136
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>if I could have this life looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be worth living,</v>

137
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety provoking and threatening,</v>

138
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's gonna be some suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss involved in all of that.</v>

139
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the goal is to have a vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your life such that all things</v>

140
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>considered that justifies your effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

141
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then then you turn down to the</v>

142
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>micro routines like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

143
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm aiming for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that instantiates itself day to</v>

144
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>week to week,</v>

145
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>month to month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where something like a</v>

146
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>schedule can be unbelievably useful.</v>

147
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Google calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like make a damn schedule and stick</v>

148
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

149
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>so what's the rule with the schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bloody prison.</v>

150
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing that people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

151
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't like to follow a schedule.</v>

152
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of schedule are you</v>

153
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:48.870
<v Speaker 1>setting up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

154
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>

155
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and then I just go play video games</v>
<v Speaker 1>because who wants to do all these things</v>

157
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>that I have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong.</v>

158
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Set the damn schedule up so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the day you want.</v>

159
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like okay,</v>

160
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I've got tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to set it up so it was</v>

161
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>the best possible day I could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically speaking,</v>

162
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>what would it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you schedule that and</v>

163
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that's going to go along</v>

164
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 1>with that because if you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're going to</v>

165
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>insist upon is that at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

166
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you're not in worse shape than you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then at the beginning of the day,</v>

167
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a stupid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bunch of those in a row,</v>

169
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>you just dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig yourself a hole,</v>

170
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you bury yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

171
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a good strategy.</v>

172
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe 20 percent of your day has to</v>

173
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>be responsibility and obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's more than that,</v>

174
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>depending on how far behind you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even that you can.</v>

175
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>You can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

176
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>well I've got these responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to schedule the damn things in.</v>

177
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>What's the right ratio of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reward?</v>

178
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself that just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd negotiate with someone who is</v>

179
00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

180
00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta work tomorrow.</v>

181
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to work tomorrow.</v>

182
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:03.441
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

183
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>well what are you going to do for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it likely that I'll work for</v>

184
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you while you could ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do an hour of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility and then you play a</v>

186
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>video game for 15 minutes.</v>

187
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever turnS your crank man,</v>

188
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate with yourself and</v>

189
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>not tyrannized yourself like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating with someone that you care</v>

190
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>for that you would like to be productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a good life.</v>

191
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you make the schedule.</v>

192
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at the day and you</v>

193
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.401
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

194
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>if I had that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

195
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

196
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're useless and horrible.</v>

197
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So you'll probably only hit it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 70 percent accuracy,</v>

198
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>but that beats the hell out of zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

199
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit it even with 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>

200
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>another rule is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim for 51 percent the next week or 50</v>

201
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and a half percent for god's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or because you're going to hit that</v>

202
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>position where things to loop back</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively and spiral you upward.</v>

203
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>And soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way that you can work on</v>

204
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness is a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life you'd like to have and and you do</v>

205
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that partly by referring to social</v>
<v Speaker 1>norms.</v>

206
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>That's more or less rescuing your father</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale,</v>

207
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but the other way you do that is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a little conversation with</v>

208
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself about it as if you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who you are because you know what</v>

209
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't do what you're told.</v>

210
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>You won't do what you tell yourSelf to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

211
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>You must have noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a bad employee and a</v>

212
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>worse boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in both of those work for you,</v>

213
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you tell yourself what to</v>

214
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it anyways.</v>

215
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 1>You should fire yourself and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else to beat.</v>

216
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what my point is,</v>

217
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not your own servant,</v>

218
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're someone that you have to</v>

219
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're someone that you want to</v>

220
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>present the opportunity of having a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>life too.</v>

221
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard for people because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like themselves very much,</v>

222
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.960
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always like cracking the whip</v>

223
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>and then procrastinating and cracking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whip and then procrastinating and</v>

224
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:02.274
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

225
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>it's so boring and such a pathetic way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of spending your time.</v>

226
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know what that's like because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably wasted like six hours a day</v>

227
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and I think we did an economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation about that a while back,</v>

228
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an</v>

229
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

230
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting paid that now,</v>

231
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>but you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is investment time and what</v>

232
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you do now is going to multiply its</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects in the future.</v>

233
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,</v>

234
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you waste six hours a day and you</v>

235
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're wasting about $2,000 a week</v>

236
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>or about $100,000 a year.</v>

237
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 1>So like go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's costing you every</v>

238
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to know what your damn time</v>

239
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>is worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's not 50 bucks,</v>

240
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

241
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere in that range.</v>

242
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you should be asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is when you spend an hour was</v>

243
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:49.404
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

244
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>what have I paid someone 50 bucks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had that hour,</v>

245
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

246
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should do something else with</v>

247
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.230
<v Speaker 1>your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it depends on whether or not you</v>

248
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>think that your time is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing about not assuming</v>

249
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>that is if you assume your time isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>

250
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you don't just sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around sort of randomly in a state of</v>

251
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>responsibility list bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you suffer existentially</v>

252
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and so that seems like a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>

253
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

254
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can improve your</v>

255
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hannah,</v>

256
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>outline and goal that you actually would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to hit and even better,</v>

257
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>here's something else you can think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when you're negotiating in your</v>

258
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.304
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

259
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>You could say if you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic,</v>

260
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:34.801
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

261
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>we have to negotiate an agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to walk away not miserable and</v>

262
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

263
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>let's call that a baseline and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to negotiate with your</v>

264
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>wife or your husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to know.</v>

265
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>You want to negotiate so that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away miserable and resentful</v>

266
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:55.281
<v Speaker 1>because that makes you hostile and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll to hurt them and I would say that</v>

267
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to hurt them and then of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course they'll happily return the favor</v>

268
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to exist in a place where</v>

269
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you're basically hitting each other in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head repeatedly for 30 years,</v>

270
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>you go right ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't say that that's a</v>

271
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 1>particularly good way of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

272
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimal precondition for a</v>

273
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>successful negotiation is that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away resentful and angry.</v>

274
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also how you know when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something to say to someone because</v>

275
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the rule has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to walk away resentful</v>

276
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>and angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got something to say.</v>

277
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're right by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that you have something</v>

278
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a low bar.</v>

279
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I wanted to live with you for 30</v>

280
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should say,</v>

281
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>how about we walk away from our mutual</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations?</v>

282
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why not?</v>

283
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to aim for something you could</v>

284
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:47.210
<v Speaker 1>aim for that you want to negotiate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your boss for a new seller.</v>

285
00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:48.070
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

286
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I've got this damn job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much would I have to be paid?</v>

287
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So I'd be so bloody excited to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

288
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I could hardly stand it while you can at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least know what that number is.</v>

289
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And then you could go there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

290
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like to have me around.</v>

291
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing some thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you paid me this amount of</v>

292
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.050
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so thrilled to go to work that</v>

293
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 1>you could hardly even keep me away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

294
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And your boss might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

295
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually really like to have someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>around who would be so thrilled to work</v>

296
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:15.330
<v Speaker 1>that I can't get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like maybe I'll,</v>

297
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 1>well I can't give you all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you 75 percent.</v>

298
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

299
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good deal,</v>

300
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.630
<v Speaker 1>or you can be some weasley coward and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and snuggle about how awful</v>

301
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>your life is and walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely able to tolerate outcome of the</v>

302
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I wouldn't recommend that and</v>

303
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I've watched people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this repeatedly in my clinical</v>

304
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>practice because I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

305
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>We plan all the time because the rule is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're can come and see me.</v>

306
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to help you figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to have the life that you want to</v>

307
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 1>have and we're going to think about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>

308
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So you're making $50,000 a year right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

309
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be making $150,000 in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>

310
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that couldn't happen.</v>

311
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like not with that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

312
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

313
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't ask people for the damn</v>

314
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't look for a better job,</v>

315
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to come along and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>shovel a boat full of money at you.</v>

316
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:13.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

317
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if why is that impossible?</v>

318
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you people in here.</v>

319
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is wrong with you?</v>

320
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.953
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

321
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>So you probably have what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could figure out what the hell it</v>

322
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:29.590
<v Speaker 1>was and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you diligently pursued it.</v>

323
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you wouldn't whine about</v>

324
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good because people who whined</v>

325
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>about being alive or dangerous to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and other people.</v>

326
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>So you might think I can have what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

327
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but you better well figure out what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and you can't just wait for the like</v>

328
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>have what you want fairy to show up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>your doorstep and granted because</v>

329
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

330
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>So conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we talked about how you could</v>

331
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>improve that social networking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another big deal.</v>

332
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the advantages that older</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have over younger people.</v>

333
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm in my fifties,</v>

334
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of other people who are</v>

335
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 1>relatively well positioned in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and they know all</v>

336
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>sorts of people.</v>

337
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>and so when I go to one of them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do x or do you know x?</v>

338
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>They say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know someone who cat.</v>

339
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's a huge advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another thing that you want to think</v>

340
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>about as you move through life and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

341
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 1>is that use your ability to network</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

342
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean schmooze and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean go out and impress people.</v>

343
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>That's all just complete bloody rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you,</v>

344
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to surround yourself with people</v>

345
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>who are competent in multiple different</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions and you maintain your</v>

346
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:39.040
<v Speaker 1>relationships with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a trading relationship to</v>

347
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It involves research,</v>

348
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>reciprocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a huge advantage.</v>

349
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 1>A social network is a huge advantage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something extroverted people can</v>

350
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 1>be really good at because you know they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that sort of social ability and</v>

351
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

352
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So another place that you can pick up</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and power for the good,</v>

353
00:15:56.511 --> 00:16:01.511
<v Speaker 1>for the right things is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to consciously develop and maintain</v>

354
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 1>your social networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also means,</v>

355
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about friendships for a</v>

356
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you know,</v>

357
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 1>if someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend A you can tell them bad news</v>

358
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and they'll lIsten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't tell you why you know you're</v>

359
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>stupid and why that bad thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and how something worse happened</v>

360
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>to them once and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>derailed the whole conversation.</v>

361
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you can actually tell them bad news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll listen.</v>

362
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this is a weirder thing.</v>

363
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 1>You can tell them good news</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll help you celebrate.</v>

364
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good way of deciding</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you should have around you.</v>

365
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have someone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know somethIng good happens to you</v>

366
00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>and you're kind of afraid to even admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because you know god,</v>

367
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 1>something good happen to you.</v>

368
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like you let that be known and will</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly be taken away.</v>

369
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come out and you sort of tell</v>

370
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:52.900
<v Speaker 1>someone halfheartedly that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>good happened to you,</v>

371
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they give you a whack and then talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

372
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing that happened to them</v>

373
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 1>three years ago or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing that happened to someone</v>

374
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>that they knew three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like go away from that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not helpful to you and they're</v>

376
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 1>not helpful to themselves either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to surround yourself.</v>

377
00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to surround yourself with</v>

378
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>people who want the best for the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you.</v>

379
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>You can hang around with weasels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>losers that are trying to pull you down</v>

380
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>to justify the fact that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraling downhill as well.</v>

381
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upside of that is you don't have to</v>

382
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:28.190
<v Speaker 1>have any responsibility and he can all</v>
<v Speaker 1>whine about how wretched life is,</v>

383
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

384
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say it's also a bad medium</v>

385
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>to longterm plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

386
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.490
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable and desirable to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround yourself with people who were</v>

387
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 1>facilitating your development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you might say,</v>

388
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got people around,</v>

389
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're,</v>

390
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.660
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing that well and and</v>

391
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 1>there and they don't fit into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

392
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your point?</v>

393
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

394
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You feel if they'll listen and cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and move towards a better</v>

395
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

396
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>If they don't pay any attention and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing the same damn things over and</v>

397
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>over and they're not going anywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>is painful,</v>

398
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 1>then maybe the proper thing to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

399
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you just have your misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go off and have my life and maybe</v>

400
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll wake up at some point in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and think that's a better way of</v>

401
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>being because just putting up with it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they call that enabling,</v>

402
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:22.674
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You put up with that sort of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're providing tacit consent for it</v>

404
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and even tacit approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's bad idea.</v>

405
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say both the right and the</v>

406
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to surround yourself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are good for the best part of</v>

407
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:43.281
<v Speaker 1>you and that's not the same as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to elaborate on that.</v>

408
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 1>You can figure out what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skills,</v>

409
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing you can do and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to increase your probability of</v>

410
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:53.820
<v Speaker 1>success every time you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to take an opportunity that</v>

411
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 1>would provide you with a new skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it right.</v>

412
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Learn to program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to write,</v>

413
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:00.180
<v Speaker 1>learn to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read new things,</v>

414
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>learn to public speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to introduce yourself to</v>

415
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to social network,</v>

416
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.540
<v Speaker 1>learn how to go talk to your boss in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

417
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 1>This is the right way to go.</v>

418
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Talk to someone who's supervising you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this problem and here's the</v>

419
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 1>solution and so I'm coming to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about the problem and the solution.</v>

420
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like that person is going to want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to you a lot site because the</v>

421
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>other people they're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to come and say,</v>

422
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do something about it?</v>

423
00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

424
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 1>They already got 50 things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:19:29.911 --> 00:19:33.360
<v Speaker 1>so if you're the person who constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings forth a problem,</v>

426
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 1>even if they're accurate problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is why are they going to want to have</v>

427
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you're just,</v>

428
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you're just another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a problem for the people who</v>

429
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>want to give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good rule of thumb,</v>

430
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

431
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 1>if someone wants to give you money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then help them do that.</v>

432
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And if they want to give you status and</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

433
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 1>then help them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

434
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And you do that in part by bringing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions and partly you do that by</v>

435
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 1>developing your skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if things aren't going very well</v>

436
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also a good way of evaluating an</v>

437
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you take an opportunity.</v>

438
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the rule,</v>

439
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 1>take the opportunity if it will teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>you something that you can use for other</v>

440
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.160
<v Speaker 1>opportunities because then even if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>fails,</v>

441
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 1>which it probably will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because you've accrued</v>

442
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 1>something of value that you can bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to the next situation.</v>

443
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this old union idea that I told</v>

444
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you about the sharp cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

445
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>the cathedrals made in the form of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross and the cross signifies the center</v>

446
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:37.770
<v Speaker 1>of the world and the dome signifies the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky and so right below the dome at the</v>

447
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 1>center of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a cross because the cross is</v>

448
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 1>the place of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the center of the world</v>

449
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the place of sufferIng,</v>

450
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the place of conscious suffering.</v>

451
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the center of the world.</v>

452
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 2>And so inscribed on the floor is a maze</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

453
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's a big maze and it's a mandela</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

454
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 2>and there's a kind of a flower shaped</v>
<v Speaker 2>resting place right in the center.</v>

455
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 2>And what you're doing is walking in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>maze and you walk all four quadrants and</v>

456
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you get to the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where you want to be.</v>

457
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.390
<v Speaker 2>You want to be in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

458
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.200
<v Speaker 2>how do you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk everywhere and what does that</v>

459
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means every bloody time you're</v>

460
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:18.001
<v Speaker 2>offered an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it and develop your skills.</v>

461
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's better than wealth by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

462
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually constitutes wealth because</v>

463
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>wealth constitutes what you have when</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone takes all your money away,</v>

464
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real wealth.</v>

465
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>And so the way that you build up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of wealth is you turn yourself into</v>

466
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 2>someone who's competent in multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>directions and you can be doing that all</v>

467
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

468
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Especially with the kind of technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you people have access to.</v>

469
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn anything you want whenever</v>

470
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what a good deal that is,</v>

471
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>

472
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 2>there's easy fruit hanging that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could pick and I would recommend that</v>

473
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>

474
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're not doing too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you're in the middle of the</v>

475
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 2>normal distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you lose your job.</v>

476
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so let's say you're a conscientious</v>

477
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>person and we can say just for the sake</v>
<v Speaker 2>of argument,</v>

478
00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 2>that you lose your job because of mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>layoffs in your company.</v>

479
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 2>so it has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fundamentally,</v>

480
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 2>it's just like luck Of the draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

481
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 2>But then what happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

482
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

483
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go after yourself pretty hard so you're</v>

484
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 2>gonna add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're also high in</v>

485
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

486
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It's going to depress you to lose your</v>
<v Speaker 2>job and maybe you're in a situation</v>

487
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:26.110
<v Speaker 2>where you just for one reason or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

488
00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that many other</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

489
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe you should look for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you're in a depressed strata</v>

490
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 2>of the economy or you're geographically</v>
<v Speaker 2>located somewhere that makes moving</v>

491
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 2>difficult or so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

492
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.580
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you lose a job and then you start to</v>

493
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 2>get depressed because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then as you start to get depressed,</v>

494
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you know it decreases the probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to look for a job,</v>

495
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but it also maybe starts to put stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your family and it also starts to</v>

496
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:53.770
<v Speaker 2>decrease the probability that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to engage in positive social</v>

497
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now not only are you unemployed and</v>

498
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>suffering from economic stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're married just starting to</v>

499
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 2>suffer and you're starting to isolate</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself from your friends.</v>

500
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as your marriage suffers in the stress</v>

501
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 2>builds up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's going to make you more</v>

502
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>depressed and that's going to keep you</v>
<v Speaker 2>even farther away from your friends and</v>

503
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 2>that's going to decrease the likelihood</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to have enough</v>

504
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and enthusiasm to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>for another job.</v>

505
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want to add a bit of a</v>

506
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>drinking problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just for fun and you can see that</v>

507
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you can get a spiral going that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken you down.</v>

508
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>ANd there's all sorts of things because</v>

509
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.020
<v Speaker 2>lots of times people conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

510
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unemployed guy and you go to</v>

511
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:35.860
<v Speaker 2>counseling and you get a diagnosis of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

512
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about a diagnosis of</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

513
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:40.720
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like the assumption is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something gone wrong with your</v>

514
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 2>psychological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're unemployed and</v>

515
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed,</v>

516
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious at all that the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in your head.</v>

517
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

518
00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it isn't even obvious that it's a</v>

519
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 2>psychological problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a problem and problems can</v>

520
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:56.890
<v Speaker 2>take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

521
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.490
<v Speaker 2>if you're unemployed and you're under</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic stress and your marriage just</v>

522
00:24:00.491 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 2>starting to shake and you're isolating</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself from your friends and you're</v>

523
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 2>less likely to be motivated to go look</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a job,</v>

524
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of think about that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressive spiral,</v>

525
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 2>but you can also think of it as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy in some sense of external</v>

526
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 2>forces that are arguing you into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and we don't tend to</v>

527
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize psychological disorders</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

528
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but we should because lots of times when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are suffering from something that</v>

529
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 2>you could describe in psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>terminology and depression is a very</v>

530
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 2>good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious that there's something</v>

531
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 2>wrong with them psychologically.</v>

532
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Often they just are in trouble and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a category in psychological</v>

533
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:42.731
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis for client in serious trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my experience has been almost</v>

534
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>without exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people that come to see me come</v>

535
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 2>to see me because something's gone wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their life.</v>

536
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Not because they have a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

537
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

538
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 2>there are psychological inadequacies</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as they might be,</v>

539
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 2>are interfering with their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover or maybe even served as</v>

540
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>precursors to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 2>increase the probability of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>

542
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:07.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate way to conceptualize it and</v>

543
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>

544
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 2>there's you inside you and as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality psychologist in,</v>

545
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.710
<v Speaker 2>as a clinical theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of what I've talked to you guys</v>

546
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:20.711
<v Speaker 2>about is your psyche and its structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if it was like a soul that inhabited</v>

547
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's some real utility in that.</v>

548
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an individual demarcated from the</v>

549
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be set up in a healthy manner</v>

550
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not unhealthy manner.</v>

551
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.790
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an individual,</v>

552
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 2>you're connected to all these external</v>
<v Speaker 2>network dynamic networks that are</v>

553
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important and it isn't even easy</v>

554
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 2>to separate them from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

555
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 2>like you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is especially true once you</v>

556
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 2>become a parent is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your child more you than your arm?</v>

557
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's pretty obvious that parts</v>

558
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>of you that are physically linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our more key to you to you as an entity,</v>

559
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's by no means obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many people would much more</v>

560
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:00.290
<v Speaker 2>happily sacrifice at arm than a child</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>and so your boundaries are not where</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boundaries are located are not</v>

562
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 2>precisely isomorphic with the outline of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

563
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not that simple at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're embedded in all sorts of</v>

564
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 2>networks that can pull you down rapidly</v>
<v Speaker 2>or elevate you because the other thing</v>

565
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that happens is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

566
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say I've never traded with anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go up to someone and I say,</v>

567
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to trade?</v>

568
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

569
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.060
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

570
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 2>How can I trust you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

571
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have take my word for it with that's</v>

572
00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very good argument.</v>

573
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

574
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>well here's what I have to offer and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can evaluate it,</v>

575
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 2>but the person's likely to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

576
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to evaluate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm still stuck with taking your</v>

577
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a bad problem.</v>

578
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see that if ever try to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>a product in the marketplace is if you</v>

579
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if the product is new and it's</v>

580
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're forcing the person that</v>

581
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.540
<v Speaker 2>wants to buy it to evaluate it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're forcing them to take the risk of</v>

582
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 2>being wrong as well as the time it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>take to evaluate it and they don't like</v>

583
00:26:58.351 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

584
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 2>WhAt they want is what's often called</v>
<v Speaker 2>social proof,</v>

585
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

586
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:04.860
<v Speaker 2>well you want to trade with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who else have you traded with?</v>

587
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 2>And if the answer is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they are going to say,</v>

588
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an interesting person and all</v>

589
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've got these other people over</v>

590
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 2>here who've already traded with a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people and therefore the risk is</v>

591
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:21.561
<v Speaker 2>lower in part because let's say I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>supervisor and I'm going to make a</v>

592
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>decision and my primary concern is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my supervisor will not hate me for</v>

593
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 2>making the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my that my primary concern is</v>

594
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:31.470
<v Speaker 2>to make the best decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same thing.</v>

595
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It's that I want to make a decision that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get in trouble for,</v>

596
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do I do that because I need a</v>

597
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 2>post hoc justification so I buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>something from you and it turns out to</v>

598
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 2>be terrible and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get called for it,</v>

599
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 2>called on the table for it.</v>

600
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And what do I say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

601
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:48.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 2>that person was buying from it and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person was buying from,</v>

603
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from him and that person was buying from</v>

604
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 2>him like all these other people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing.</v>

605
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the error is localized</v>
<v Speaker 2>in me and that's often a very credible</v>

606
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the answer is,</v>

607
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:03.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

608
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have held you waited,</v>

609
00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 2>it took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to take a risk.</v>

610
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like out the door with you sunday</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

611
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an indication that you're not</v>

612
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of the reason that</v>

613
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 2>people's spiraled downhill into zero is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because po positive feedback,</v>

614
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.380
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback loop is a loop that</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases the probability that the loop</v>

615
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:26.880
<v Speaker 2>will continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

616
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 2>A positive feedback loop is you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced this when you hear</v>

617
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:34.671
<v Speaker 2>microphone feedback in an amplified</v>
<v Speaker 2>system so you know the microphone sends</v>

618
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 2>a message to the speakers and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers send out the message amplified</v>

619
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and then the microphone picks up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>message and it gets amplified again and</v>

620
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 2>you get this howling occur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is can be deafening but can also</v>

621
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 2>destroy the system because it'll keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>amplifying upward until the speakers</v>

622
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 2>blow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

623
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 2>That'S a positive feedback loop and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback loop can spiral you</v>

624
00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:01.401
<v Speaker 2>upward or it can spiral you downward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a virtuous circle,</v>

625
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:03.660
<v Speaker 2>a virtuous positive feedback loop is</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

626
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've traded with him and I've traded</v>

627
00:29:05.641 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 2>with him and I've traded with him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I can say to you,</v>

628
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I've traded with these three people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go talk to them and they say good</v>

629
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you say,</v>

630
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll trade with you,</v>

631
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 2>and then because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're even more likely to trade</v>

632
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the thing starts to spiral</v>

633
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>uphill and it does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a nonlinear form.</v>

634
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 2>and so because one of the things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are going to be asking yourself as</v>

635
00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what's happening is that income</v>

636
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.810
<v Speaker 2>inequality is increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

637
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.591
<v Speaker 2>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

638
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>why that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

639
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you need to know is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what income does.</v>

640
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you need an explanation</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

641
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 2>This is the explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a rule.</v>

642
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 2>If you run a trading game to its logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

643
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 2>one person ends up with all the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone else ends up with zero.</v>
