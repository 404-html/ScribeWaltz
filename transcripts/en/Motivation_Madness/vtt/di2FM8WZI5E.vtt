1
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>If you ask a disagreeable person what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he wants say or she wants,</v>

2
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.060
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want and this is how I'm</v>

4
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But agreeable people,</v>

5
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're really agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so agreeable that they often don't</v>

6
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>even know what they want because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so accustomed to living for other</v>

7
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>people and to finding out what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people weren't and to trying to make</v>

8
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>them comfortable and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's harder for them to find a</v>

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>sense of their own desires as they move</v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>there's situations where that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantageous,</v>

12
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not advantageous if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to,</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forge yourself a career at just doesn't</v>

14
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even though on average men and</v>

15
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>women don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this don't,</v>

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>aren't that much different in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their levels of agreeableness by the</v>

17
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 1>If you go out and you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>

19
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they're very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of the most agreeable people are</v>

20
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>women and all of the most disagreeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are men.</v>

21
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is the extremes are often</v>
<v Speaker 1>what matter rather than what's in the</v>

22
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways that's reflected</v>

23
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in society by the way,</v>

24
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:13.141
<v Speaker 1>is there's way more men in prison and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best personality predictor of being</v>

25
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned is to be low in</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

26
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>It makes you callous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you may think,</v>

27
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the opposite of compassion and</v>

28
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>politeness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is I think it's</v>

29
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>best sort of conceptualized as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a trading game.</v>

30
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we're going to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated trading games and if you're a</v>

31
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>very agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to bargain harder on</v>

32
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>my behalf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to bargain on your own</v>

33
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.164
<v Speaker 1>behalf.</v>

34
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're very disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the reverse.</v>

35
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this trading game for me and you</v>

36
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>are going to take care of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests where an agreeable person is</v>

37
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:47.554
<v Speaker 1>going to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

38
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>At best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is at worst,</v>

39
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>this has to be 50 50 but I'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you every way I can.</v>

40
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you have to be careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of if you're agreeable is not to be</v>

41
00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>exploited because you'll line up to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited.</v>

42
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're wired to be exploited by</v>

43
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that just doesn't work so well in</v>

44
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>that actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>

45
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens very</v>
<v Speaker 1>often in psychotherapy,</v>

46
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come to psychotherapy for</v>

47
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>multiple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is they often come</v>

48
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>because they're too agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what they get is so-called</v>

49
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's not exactly assertiveness</v>

50
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 1>that's being trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is is the ability to learn how</v>

51
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate on your own behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I tell agreeable</v>

52
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're conscientious</v>

53
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.683
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

54
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>say what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth about what you think</v>

55
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be things you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think are nasty and harsh and</v>

56
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>they probably are nasty and harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also probably true.</v>

57
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And you need to bring those up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront and deliver the message.</v>

58
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's not straightforward at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>because agreeable people do not like</v>

59
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

60
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>They smoothed the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can see,</v>

61
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>you can see why that is in accordance</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the hypothesis that I've been</v>

62
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>putting forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want conflict around infants.</v>

63
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's too damn dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want fights to break out.</v>

64
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't want anything to disturb the</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relative peace,</v>

65
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're also more prone to being</v>

66
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>hurt physically and perhaps emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also may be loath to engage in</v>

67
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the kind of high intensity conflict that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will solve problems in the short term</v>

68
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of conflict to solve</v>

69
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>problems in the short term and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that can spiral up to where it's</v>

70
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it can,</v>

71
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>if it gets uncontrolled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be safer in the short term to</v>

72
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>keep the waters smooth and to not delve</v>
<v Speaker 1>into those situations where conflict</v>

73
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>emerges.</v>

74
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is it's not a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good medium to longterm strategy,</v>

75
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause lots,</v>

76
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>lots of times there are things you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about because they're not going</v>

77
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the advantage to having a well</v>

78
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>socialized disagreeable person is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really don't let much get in their</v>

79
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get a kid who's</v>

80
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person can be quite quite the</v>

81
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>because they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very forward moving in their</v>

83
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>nature and very difficult to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't get them successfully</v>

84
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>domesticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tamed,</v>

85
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking by the time they're for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their peers,</v>

86
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>reject them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem because your</v>

87
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>job as a parent is to make your child</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially desirable by the age of four.</v>

88
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to burn that into your brain</v>

89
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>because people don't know that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job.</v>

90
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why it's easy if you think about</v>

91
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you imagine you've got to,</v>

92
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got a three year old child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of halfway through that</v>

93
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>initial period of socialization and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that child out in public,</v>

94
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want for the Child?</v>

95
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from the Chubb for the</v>

96
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the child to be able to</v>

97
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>interact with other children and adults</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the children are welcoming and</v>

98
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>smile and wanting to play with him or</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

99
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>and so the adults are happy to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child and treat him or her properly.</v>

100
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And if your child's a horrible little</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster because you're afraid of</v>

101
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>disciplining them or you don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that properly,</v>

102
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>then what they're going to do is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to experience nothing but</v>

103
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>rejection from other children and false</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiles from other parents and adults and</v>

104
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>that's so then you're throwing the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there into a world where every</v>

105
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>single face that they see is either</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile or lying and that's not</v>

106
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>something that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly conducive to the mental</v>

107
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>health or the wellbeing of your child.</v>

108
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>If your child can learn a couple simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of behavior,</v>

109
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>like don't interrupt adults when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking too much and pay attention and</v>

110
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>try not to hit the other kids over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head with the truck anymore than is</v>

111
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary then and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and share and play properly.</v>

112
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Then when they meet other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids are going to try out a few</v>

113
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>little play routines on them and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go well,</v>

114
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they're going to go off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialize each other for the rest of</v>

115
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>their lives because that's what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that from four years old onwards,</v>

116
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>the primary socialization with children</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place among other children,</v>

117
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>and so if the kids don't get in on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

118
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>they don't move into that developmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral upwards and they're left behind.</v>

119
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine how terrible that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a four year old will not play</v>

120
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.151
<v Speaker 1>with another four year old who's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a five year old certainly will not</v>

121
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>play with a five year old who's too</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

122
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>because the gap is just starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably large.</v>

123
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the kids start out behind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the peers leave them behind,</v>

124
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and then those kids are alienated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the Peer Group for the rest of</v>

125
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that grow up to be</v>

126
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>longterm antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

127
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>They're already aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't dip down.</v>

128
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens to normal boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking?</v>

129
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that aggressive two-year-old</v>
<v Speaker 1>types,</v>

130
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>they get socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their level of aggression goes down</v>

131
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>and then they hit puberty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone kicks in and Bay levels of</v>

132
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>aggression go back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why males are criminals</v>

133
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>between the ages roughly of 16 in about</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 so,</v>

134
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and it matches the creativity curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

135
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool if you look at the spike of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity among men,</v>

136
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>16 to 25 and it starts to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminality matches that absolutely</v>

137
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>

138
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of it,</v>

139
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>so the testosterone levels raise raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average level of aggression among</v>

140
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

141
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>It's more dominance than aggression</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in testosterone is by no means</v>

142
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts to decrease at about</v>

143
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>age 25 or 26 which is usually would men</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop staying up late at night,</v>

144
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>stop drinking as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a full time career and take on</v>

145
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the burdens and responsibilities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that are associated with a</v>

146
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>long term partner and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while,</v>

147
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the development of,</v>

148
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of I would,</v>

149
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call predatory aggression</v>

150
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>because I also think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agreeableness distribution is</v>

151
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>probably something like predatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression versus maternal sympathy.</v>

152
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at other,</v>

153
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>if you look at other mammals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are predators,</v>

154
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>cause we're predators as well as prey</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

155
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>If you look at other animals like bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male bear has absolutely nothing to</v>

156
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>do with the raising of the infants.</v>

157
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female bears,</v>

158
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep the mail the hell away</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's likely to kill the infants</v>

159
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no matter analogy at all in</v>

160
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>solitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male mammalian predators,</v>

161
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it's really useful to investigate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints of people who have opposing</v>

162
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>views to yours because they'll tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

163
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>not only will they tell you things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

164
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll also tell you how to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in ways that you don't see it.</v>

165
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And they'll also have skills that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that you could develop.</v>

166
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.611
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

167
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're an introverted person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very useful to watch an extroverted</v>

168
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>person because the extroverted person</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ways of being in the social world</v>

169
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>that aren't natural to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use this to improve your</v>

170
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>toolkit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>

171
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people,</v>

172
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>especially if that's alienating them</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other people,</v>

173
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it can,</v>

174
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people treat you like you're a selfish,</v>

175
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 1>arrogant son of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's because you are,</v>

176
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.651
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

177
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>so what do do about that?</v>

178
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most promising treatments,</v>

179
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>let's say for that is get the person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something for someone else once a</v>

180
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a practice and learn how to do</v>

181
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can wait the circuit up,</v>

182
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think that it's lying dormant in</v>

183
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably right.</v>

184
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a very wide range of</v>

185
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>propensities within us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are switched on genetic propensity,</v>

186
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>some are switched on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that if you put yourself in</v>

187
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>the right situation or walk yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the right exercises,</v>

188
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you can switch some of these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on as well.</v>

189
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>But it takes work and dedication and</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>

190
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to adapt yourself properly</v>

191
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>to light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should find that niche in the</v>

192
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>environment that corresponds with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

193
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't work at cross purposes to</v>

194
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>your temperament because it's just too</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn difficult.</v>

195
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But having done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should work on developing the</v>

196
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>skills and viewpoints that exist in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>space opposite to your personality</v>

197
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>because that's where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally under developed.</v>

198
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And that way I think you could extend</v>
<v Speaker 1>out your temperamental capability across</v>

199
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>a wider range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's roughly equivalent,</v>

200
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>has bringing a Richard tool kit to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

201
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're hyper extroverted,</v>

202
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you should probably learn to shut up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties now and then and listen just to</v>

203
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>see what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see if you can manage it.</v>

204
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted,</v>

205
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>well then you should learn how to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public and to end to learn how to go</v>

206
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 1>to parties without hiding in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying nothing to anyone,</v>

207
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're agreeable,</v>

208
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>then you need to learn how to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable so people can't push you</v>

209
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

210
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn.</v>

211
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn how to be agreeable so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not an evil son of a book.</v>

212
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing applies even in the</v>

213
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>conscientious domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're too conscientious,</v>

214
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn to relax and let go a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

215
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And if you're unconscientious it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get out the Google calendar man and</v>

216
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>start scheduling your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And beat yourself on the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head with a stick until you're</v>

218
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 1>disciplined enough so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually stick to something for some</v>

219
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 1>length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not living in absolute squalor,</v>

220
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>which is something that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize someone who's very</v>

221
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>disorderly for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they just,</v>

222
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't notice it doesn't bother</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

223
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they can see it,</v>

224
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have any emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>valence.</v>

225
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't have any motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>

226
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

227
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about too,</v>

228
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're choosing a partner is try not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to choose someone who's too distant from</v>

229
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you on the temperamental variables</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to have a hard time</v>

230
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>bridging the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for an introverted person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extroverted person to coexist and</v>

232
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for an orderly person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a disorderly person to coexist</v>

233
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>because they will drive each other nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you pick up?</v>

234
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so obsessed by it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic argument,</v>

235
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

236
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's useful to know about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament so that you can negotiate</v>

237
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>the space with your partner at a wet as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

238
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think you should try to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is exactly the same as you</v>

239
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>because then you don't have the benefits</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the alternative viewpoint,</v>

240
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but you got to watch it because you may</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit Eric concealable differences of</v>

241
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>various sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that most,</v>

242
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>particularly among couples who are high</v>
<v Speaker 1>and low and openness,</v>

243
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also high and low in</v>

244
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another rough one because they</v>

245
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>just cannot see how the other person</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees the world at all.</v>
