1
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to get busy on the first couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subjects for today.</v>

2
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say I'm okay.</v>

3
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's the first subject that I've found</v>
<v Speaker 1>so interesting.</v>

4
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to share it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I want to talk about personal</v>

5
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>development of the subject that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started listening to age 25.</v>

6
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That revolutionized my whole life from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mentor,</v>

7
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Mr Earl shoaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an interesting subject.</v>

8
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:36.901
<v Speaker 1>Just jot it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

9
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.901
<v Speaker 1>It's called enlightened self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened self interest.</v>

10
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating study to study the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of self interest,</v>

11
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but just make this note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>

12
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have self-interest.</v>

13
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Key is for it to be enlightened so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wins and no one loses.</v>

14
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Our first interest is to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to survive?</v>

15
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Our second interest is to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to succeed?</v>

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>What does it take for me personally to</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and to succeed?</v>

17
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Can I legitimately be interested enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the things that helped me both</v>

18
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:33.531
<v Speaker 1>succeed and survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what I discovered.</v>

19
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:38.851
<v Speaker 1>The answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible to exercise self interest,</v>

20
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but to do it in such a way that no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>loses everyone benefits.</v>

21
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Keyphrase life was not designed to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>us what we need.</v>

22
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Life was designed to give us what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>

23
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>We did not reap a harvest in the fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we need it.</v>

24
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>We reap a harvest in the fall because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve it.</v>

25
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily from a moral standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

26
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some moral laws as well,</v>

27
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>spiritual and moral laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the basic laws that simply say,</v>

28
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>if you wish to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must plant,</v>

29
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>so jot this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reaping is reserved for the planters</v>

30
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they reap is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve it.</v>

31
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>They're the planters they deserved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

32
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Interesting Bible phrase that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep knocking,</v>

33
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>you will find open doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good phrase to jot down.</v>

34
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>If you keep knocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find open doors,</v>

35
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>doors of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doors have a chance to meet someone.</v>

36
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Doors open for association doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open to find someone special doors open</v>

37
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>to find a unique business colleague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep knocking the door,</v>

38
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>the phrase says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors of opportunity are open to those</v>

39
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:14.791
<v Speaker 1>who continually knocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't find open doors of</v>

40
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:19.860
<v Speaker 1>opportunity because we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find them because we deserved only</v>

41
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:24.861
<v Speaker 1>those who knock deserve to find an open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the promise is if you continually</v>

42
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find doors of opportunity.</v>

43
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you search,</v>

44
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you will find</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll make the note.</v>

45
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's good finding is reserved for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>searchers</v>

46
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 1>because they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

47
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>at first they may have needed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they now know that just needing it</v>

48
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>is not sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they need it now,</v>

49
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they must qualify for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why you're going to be</v>

50
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>blessed with good ideas this weekend is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've come searching,</v>

51
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.310
<v Speaker 1>gotten on an airplane to come searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It in your automobile to come</v>

52
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got here searching.</v>

53
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Now you're ready to receive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for those who have search,</v>

54
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>they will find answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will find plans,</v>

55
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>imagination to stir yourself into action</v>
<v Speaker 1>for future benefit.</v>

56
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So if you search to find a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go looking,</v>

57
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to church,</v>

58
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to the seminar,</v>

59
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to the library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go to the books.</v>

60
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>If you wish to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely does a good idea,</v>

61
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.163
<v Speaker 1>interrupt you</v>

62
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.313
<v Speaker 2>rarely,</v>

63
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but if you will search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find it so we get not what we</v>

64
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:52.340
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we get what we deserve.</v>

65
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just if you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has an answer,</v>

66
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>if you keep asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers belong to you because by</v>

67
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>virtue of asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have qualified so we don't get what</v>

68
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get what we deserve.</v>

69
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.940
<v Speaker 1>The mother on welfare should be taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some small.</v>

70
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Enter the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully she can begin deserving the</v>

71
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.830
<v Speaker 1>welfare kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting it because she needs it now,</v>

72
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 1>starting to get it because she deserves</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

73
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>If the welfare worker says to Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

74
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I brought a bucket of paint and a paint</v>
<v Speaker 1>brush,</v>

75
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and the next time I come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the door is painted in the fence here</v>

76
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>in front is painted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you the check for $450.</v>

77
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Not the painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door and painting the fence is worth</v>

78
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>$450.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth that much,</v>

79
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but it is the beginning of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make that note.</v>

80
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to begin the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserving.</v>

81
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.480
<v Speaker 1>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What process should I begin engaging in</v>

82
00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>to deserve good health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deserve a good relationship,</v>

83
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>to deserve prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deserve an enterprise,</v>

84
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>to deserve the opportunity to build the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city</v>

85
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.340
<v Speaker 1>must I do to begin the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserved</v>

86
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.550
<v Speaker 1>so now the welfare worker comes back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door is painted in the fences</v>

87
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.080
<v Speaker 1>painted and now Mary gets the $450 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help take care of her children.</v>

88
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Not because she needs it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because she's beginning to deserve</v>

89
00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it and the welfare worker thinks of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other project.</v>

90
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.891
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

91
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>if these weeds are gone and this little</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden has cultivated when I come back,</v>

92
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>now that the door is painted and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fence is paid it,</v>

93
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>if the weeds are gone and this little</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden has cultivated,</v>

94
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you get the $450 and step by step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new life is emerging.</v>

95
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Learning the process of deserving it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just</v>

96
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>we teach our children at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Child says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need $10 so that language doesn't work</v>

98
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of money here and the</v>

99
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>vaults are full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to say I need $10 is not how you</v>

100
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>open the vault.</v>

101
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So the channel says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

102
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I get that $10 that I need?</v>

103
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So here's what they learned to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could I earn $10?</v>

104
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Now the vault opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the money starts to flow.</v>

105
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>How can I earn $10?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could I do to earn the money?</v>

106
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Not to get the money because you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

107
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:36.271
<v Speaker 1>but if you maybe you need the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all of us have needs here.</v>

108
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.830
<v Speaker 1>The key is to figure out how to open the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vault,</v>

109
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>how to open the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to open this unbelievable flow of</v>

110
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 1>resources to come our way and here's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>key to deserve it,</v>

111
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 1>not to need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't walk out to the field and say</v>

112
00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>to the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to crop.</v>

113
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the field says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the ground says.</v>

114
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Who is this clown that brings me his</v>
<v Speaker 1>need but brings me no seed,</v>

115
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 1>so jot that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your seed to the marketplace,</v>

116
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 1>not your need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't disclose your need to the</v>

117
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:15.930
<v Speaker 1>marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only your willingness.</v>

118
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that a little later</v>
<v Speaker 1>today</v>

119
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.900
<v Speaker 1>because the marketplace is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in your knee,</v>

120
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>but they are interested in your seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in your willingness</v>

121
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.940
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in your disciplines.</v>

122
00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:31.941
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in your eagerness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in your vitality and</v>

123
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:34.290
<v Speaker 1>your work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the marketplace is</v>

124
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your need that you're seed.</v>

125
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

126
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 1>We get what we deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Testament.</v>

127
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll move toward me,</v>

128
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll move toward you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

129
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get those occasions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet God.</v>

130
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>You must make the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God could say you don't move.</v>

131
00:08:58.031 --> 00:08:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

132
00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:00.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's arbitrary.</v>

133
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're God,</v>

134
00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:06.331
<v Speaker 1>you can make it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

135
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Speaker 1>the law says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wish to receive.</v>

136
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Now let's talk about enlightened self</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

137
00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:21.140
<v Speaker 1>If you wish to receive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would call the wish to receive</v>

138
00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:24.320
<v Speaker 1>self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's enlightened,</v>

139
00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it says.</v>

140
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I understand that in order to receive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must view</v>

141
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.780
<v Speaker 1>receiving is reserved for those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>give.</v>

142
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Receiving is not reserved for those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>need it.</v>

143
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's reserved for those who deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We deserve the receiving,</v>

144
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.640
<v Speaker 1>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

145
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>there's an extraordinary phrase in just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little context and here's what it is.</v>

146
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It's better to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is to receive.</v>

147
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Now the uneducated person would find</v>
<v Speaker 1>that difficult to ponder.</v>

148
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be better to give than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to receive?</v>

149
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you one of the better</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases for the day.</v>

150
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving starts the receiving process.</v>

151
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.783
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

152
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>so of course it's better.</v>

153
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

154
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 1>How much receiving do you wish you must</v>
<v Speaker 1>start?</v>

155
00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:23.320
<v Speaker 1>The giving process</v>

156
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.170
<v Speaker 1>for me to receive my additional fortunes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future,</v>

157
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily for the money because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need them.</v>

158
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I take them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need them,</v>

159
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but here's what I do need for someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

160
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 1>a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years from now,</v>

161
00:10:41.861 --> 00:10:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Mr Ryland net seminar helped to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life and for whatever reason,</v>

162
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I was brought here to this place for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time and later someone says that</v>

163
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.850
<v Speaker 1>seat to receive that kind of thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

164
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you cannot buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

165
00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You can't buy it with money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to earn it.</v>

166
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's expand a little further now that</v>

167
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 1>it's called the law of riches and wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our own self interest.</v>

168
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:24.181
<v Speaker 1>If we wish to be rich and wealthy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperous and healthy and all the</v>

169
00:11:24.641 --> 00:11:28.180
<v Speaker 1>valuable things we can think of for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human experience,</v>

170
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.660
<v Speaker 1>how could we get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's understanding the law of</v>

171
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.600
<v Speaker 1>enlightened self interest in the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserving.</v>

172
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.810
<v Speaker 1>The question was asked in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we be great?</v>

173
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 1>What is the key to greatness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Wealth,</v>

174
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.620
<v Speaker 1>great return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great accolades,</v>

175
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.980
<v Speaker 1>trophies to put on the mantle above the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fireplace.</v>

176
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>How can we get great respect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Richard's great abundance for</v>

177
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we get that?</v>

178
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here was the answer.</v>

179
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Find a way to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find a way to serve the mini.</v>

180
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So I paraphrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To read this service.</v>

181
00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Too many leads to greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

182
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Too many leads to greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>

183
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the best I can do is take care of</v>

184
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

185
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Self care has its own reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very limited.</v>

186
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:28.351
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

187
00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't be worried about other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

188
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I got enough problems of my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

189
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Self defense is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self preservation is okay,</v>

190
00:12:35.431 --> 00:12:40.350
<v Speaker 1>but it has a very limited reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wish to change that into</v>

191
00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:41.880
<v Speaker 1>abundance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity,</v>

192
00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:44.300
<v Speaker 1>and uniqueness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then here's what you must do.</v>

193
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Help solve other people's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help finances for someone else,</v>

194
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.400
<v Speaker 1>not just for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for someone else.</v>

195
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And in that kind of service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now begin the process of grief.</v>

196
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Someone asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I be ruler over many?</v>

197
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 1>How could I manage a lot of people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I be the leader of a vast</v>

198
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.050
<v Speaker 1>movement or enterprise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here was the answer.</v>

199
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we call that self interest of the</v>

200
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:21.621
<v Speaker 1>highest kind wishing to be the manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruler bushing to be presiding over</v>

201
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here was the answer.</v>

202
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Be Faithful when the amounts are small.</v>

203
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Be Faithful when there's just a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be disciplined when there's only a few</v>

204
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.950
<v Speaker 1>that starts to entitle you to someday be</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruler over many.</v>

205
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.351
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:42.330
<v Speaker 1>if I had a big organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd really run it with a strong hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a fabulous leader,</v>

208
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but I've only got a few and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are.</v>

209
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 1>See that that's not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wish to preside over Richard,</v>

210
00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.470
<v Speaker 1>so you must start with the amounts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>

211
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.741
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

212
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:05.570
<v Speaker 1>if I had a fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd really take good care of it,</v>

213
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.700
<v Speaker 1>but I've only got a paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it goes.</v>

214
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.470
<v Speaker 1>See not knowing where it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disqualifies you now for presiding over</v>

215
00:14:12.471 --> 00:14:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all heard that,</v>

216
00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:17.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it all goes.</v>

217
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever hear that expression or we'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>love to have you run the company.</v>

218
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:24.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where it all goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody says,</v>

219
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.070
<v Speaker 1>it just gets away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

220
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:27.600
<v Speaker 1>we'd love to have you run the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

221
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:32.601
<v Speaker 1>It just gets away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody says it's only pennies and it's</v>

222
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:36.450
<v Speaker 1>only a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is where you begin to qualify for</v>

223
00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:40.830
<v Speaker 1>abundance and riches and greatness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect is to be disciplined when the</v>

224
00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:41.700
<v Speaker 1>amounts are small.</v>

225
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Someone finds it unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:48.510
<v Speaker 1>That this many people would come here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've got to say for the whole</v>

227
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:51.240
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not where I started.</v>

228
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I started with just a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was so unfamiliar with the few</v>

229
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to translate for them in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward ways back then what had happened</v>

230
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life got changed,</v>

231
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>my income got changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my health got changed,</v>

232
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>everything got changed for the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I've lived the most</v>

233
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it started with my passion for just</v>

234
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>a few to translate for just the few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>

235
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just a few here.</v>

236
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this meeting matter when there's</v>

237
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>only a few in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer's yes,</v>

238
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>jot this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know who's in the audience,</v>

239
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a few or a thousand or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

240
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but you got to be faithful when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few.</v>

241
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Tell your story when there's just a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be just as passionate about ideas that</v>

242
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>can change someone's life when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few.</v>

243
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Now you begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fully qualified,</v>

244
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but you begin the qualification to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someday speak to many someday preside</v>

245
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.430
<v Speaker 1>over a vast crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someday be the manager or the leader of</v>

246
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 1>millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts in those early days to deserve</v>

247
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

248
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>jot this down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

250
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I held onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was it.</v>

251
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 1>This was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

252
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 1>After a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it up.</v>

253
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Found out it wasn't there,</v>

254
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.070

<v Speaker 1>Refine your philosophy,</v>

255
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.150
<v Speaker 1>refine your direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'll give yourself a chance to do</v>

256
00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:16.590
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what will happen down the road.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you will watch and see whatever you must</v>

265
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.100
<v Speaker 1>to be these three days just to come here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sit for a while and listen and</v>

266
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 1>ponder and take notes and work hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you can't absorb,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that it will start to refine your life</v>

268
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.940
<v Speaker 1>even before you get on an airplane and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly back to wherever you came from</v>

269
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.770
<v Speaker 1>before you get into your car and drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>away what we share with you here with</v>

270
00:17:22.771 --> 00:17:24.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever all the rest that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>

271
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.510
<v Speaker 1>This will be a catalyst to start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

272
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Even before you get home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start working for you.</v>

273
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Some of you are going to set some goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do the workshop tomorrow,</v>

274
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.490
<v Speaker 1>designing the next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you'll come up with some new</v>

275
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:42.240
<v Speaker 1>promises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new objectives,</v>

276
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.720
<v Speaker 1>some new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the time we're finished here,</v>

277
00:17:45.721 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 1>these two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days,</v>

278
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see yourself able to accomplish</v>

279
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>two times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times,</v>

280
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>five times more than you ever thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>was possible,</v>

281
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 1>which will make this cost of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminar small price to pay,</v>

282
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully it'll make the time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent here small price to pay compared</v>

283
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 1>to making this an investment in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and what will flow in,</v>

284
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:14.601
<v Speaker 1>in terms of money and income and return</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reward and respect and dignity and</v>

285
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>accolades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trophies,</v>

286
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that can be yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marriage that lasts forever,</v>

287
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 1>a friendship that nourishes you forever.</v>

288
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Things that you'll find that you'll keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and treasure for a lifetime.</v>

289
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully this is one of those weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of effort to learn.</v>

290
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of effort to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of effort to decide,</v>

291
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but jot this down.</v>

292
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.210
<v Speaker 1>It's all worth the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever stimulates you to think.</v>

293
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Whatever stimulates you to wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever stimulates you to react or even</v>

294
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 1>to debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you hear something,</v>

295
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:52.921
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

296
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

297
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that's still valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're awake.</v>

298
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 1>It means you're alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're alive.</v>

299
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>It means your mind is ready to take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something whether it's agreeable or not,</v>

300
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 1>agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something right,</v>

301
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what it is?</v>

302
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 1>We've got to listen to a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>voices and some are going to come from</v>

303
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the left and some are going to come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right and some are going to come</v>

304
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 1>from mysterious sources and some will</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to entice you with all kinds of</v>

305
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

306
00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Just so you're alive and alert and</v>
<v Speaker 1>awake,</v>

307
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>ready to process anything that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>

308
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 1>take the best of it and make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial for you so that tomorrow you</v>

309
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:35.961
<v Speaker 1>walk with a stronger step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next month you see a clearer vision and</v>

310
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.990
<v Speaker 1>a month from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose for your life is multiplied</v>

311
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:40.711
<v Speaker 1>by two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

312
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to create here,</v>

313
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.340
<v Speaker 1>so now to hurry and get through because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have so many subjects to cover.</v>

314
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's cover now some other things under</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal development.</v>

315
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's one that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you read and as you listen to and as</v>

316
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you study and as you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you take notes and as you fill up</v>

317
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:07.771
<v Speaker 1>your journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to work on the ideas to</v>

318
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:10.080
<v Speaker 1>make yourself valuable in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>

319
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Here's something to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under personal development,</v>

320
00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:18.391
<v Speaker 1>some things I had to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First steps to success.</v>

321
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.440
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need good ideas.</v>

322
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Just decide right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to accelerate your plan for</v>

<v Speaker 1>collecting good ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas for your life,</v>

324
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 1>ideas for your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas for your marriage,</v>

325
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:38.271
<v Speaker 1>your relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that stimulate one idea sometimes</v>

326
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 1>lead to that leads to the next leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next</v>

327
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and the four or five ideas in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really thrust acceleration into</v>

328
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have gotten unless you went</v>

329
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 1>through the first one and the second one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

333
00:21:03.691 --> 00:21:07.620

<v Speaker 1>I have to have if I didn't have a super</v>

334
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got An underline the word extreme.</v>

335
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.500

<v Speaker 1>you know possible.</v>

338
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one that can do it.</v>

339
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to be extremely healthy.</v>

340
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't let up at all in terms of diet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to have a better plan than that</v>

346
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>summer whistling in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping everything will work out.</v>

347
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Not Not a good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a good plan for how to use the</v>

348
00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:58.010
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that tomorrow.</v>

349
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Best kept secret of the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to use your time,</v>

350
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.320
<v Speaker 1>a good plan to meet the right people</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the right amount of time to</v>

351
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.330
<v Speaker 1>stimulate your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a game plan for lifestyle.</v>

352
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to succeed,</v>

353
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:22.330
<v Speaker 1>we need good ideas and good plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the next.</v>

354
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 1>We have to learn to handle the passing</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time</v>

355
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 1>because all of this takes time to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow,</v>

356
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:34.150
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting through the seasons takes time.</v>

357
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 1>The spring has a certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer as time harvest has time.</v>

358
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 1>The winter has time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning to handle the passing of time</v>

359
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>dot this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're involved in business,</v>

360
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give your project time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to give people time.</v>

361
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Give people a chance to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to grow,</v>

362
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 1>chance to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the great requirements,</v>

363
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 1>especially in such an industrialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy,</v>

364
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>mad dashing society and that is to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

365
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 1>patients first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we exercise it with our children or our</v>

366
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.833
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

367
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Getting people to work together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to have patience.</v>

368
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Even with your family,</v>

369
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're involved with independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

370
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like herding cats,</v>

371
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herding sheep as easy.</v>

372
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>They very quickly get going the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

373
00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but try herding cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your children.</v>

374
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Different ages and different</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and different opinions to</v>

375
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>get the family all going the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

376
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Kind of working together to make things</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

377
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a challenge,</v>

378
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but if you'll have some patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

379
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the big one,</v>

380
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>to have patience with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself time to learn.</v>

381
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself time to understand good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

382
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself time to make changes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then grow into those changes.</v>

383
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself time to refine your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

384
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 1>to fit the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever business you're engaged in,</v>

385
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.750
<v Speaker 1>some you may have to speak up a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and some you may have to calm</v>

386
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 1>down just a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just learn to refine your personality</v>

387
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 1>and your temperament to suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us could do that,</v>

388
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but it takes it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have patience with yourself.</v>

389
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.280
<v Speaker 1>We had to do that from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning to tie the shoe strings of your</v>

390
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tried a couple of times and says,</v>

391
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll never learn this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's overseen.</v>

392
00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go through life with your</v>

393
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.860
<v Speaker 1>shoe's untied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

394
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it happens for them in a little</v>

395
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 1>quicker than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get the hang of it almost</v>

396
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else that takes a little longer.</v>

397
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 1>If it takes you a little longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have patience with yourself because</v>

398
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 1>patients has its own reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patience is a virtue of the</v>

399
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:55.000
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have patience with our</v>

400
00:24:55.001 --> 00:24:56.980
<v Speaker 1>employers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have patients with government</v>

401
00:24:56.981 --> 00:25:00.940
<v Speaker 1>officials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have patients with irs.</v>

402
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.760
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have patience with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

403
00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:06.220
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have patience with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI.</v>

404
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good thing to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you're exercising patients,</v>

405
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.720
<v Speaker 1>usually enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good people will finally make it right.</v>

406
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You just got to jot that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually enough,</v>

407
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:22.330
<v Speaker 1>good people will finally make it right.</v>

408
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone in the community is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to toe the line and do the moral thing,</v>

409
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but let me tell you what most will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we create a society that we</v>

410
00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 1>can live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most will.</v>

411
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Every teenager will not obey all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and regulations and live a model</v>

412
00:25:40.471 --> 00:25:42.420
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone will,</v>

413
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.660
<v Speaker 1>but jot this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most will enough will.</v>

414
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.290
<v Speaker 1>When the good Lord recruited 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not every disciple,</v>

415
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 1>not every one of the 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough of the 12 to start a</v>

416
00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 1>movement that's lasted for 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone,</v>

417
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

418
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.623
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

419
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.940
<v Speaker 1>There's only been a couple of exceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

420
00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.</v>

421
00:26:13.361 --> 00:26:16.930
<v Speaker 1>God was going to destroy Sodom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah for their evil ways.</v>

422
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Abraham had a friend that lived there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham and Florida and said,</v>

423
00:26:21.191 --> 00:26:23.560
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can go to Sodom and Gomorrah and</v>

424
00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 1>find 50 righteous people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you spare the city?</v>

425
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>

426
00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.620
<v Speaker 1>you've been such an excellent friend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

427
00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll spare the city if you can find 50.</v>

428
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So he searches the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find 50 good,</v>

429
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>comes back and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered.</v>

430
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Would you take 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods as Abraham for you?</v>

431
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it if you can find 40.</v>

432
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So we searches for 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find 40.</v>

433
00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And he comes back and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you take 30?</v>

434
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord says Abraham only for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I reduce it to 30?</v>

435
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Can't find 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find 20.</v>

436
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Abraham said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my last request.</v>

437
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Would you take 10?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God said only for you Abraham.</v>

438
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.370
<v Speaker 1>So he went searching for 10 and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

439
00:27:31.371 --> 00:27:36.371
<v Speaker 1>the story couldn't find 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the exception to the rule.</v>

440
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.640
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>

441
00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:44.390
<v Speaker 1>get your friend lot and his family out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of there because the end has gone,</v>

442
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.710
<v Speaker 1>but that's the exception to the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jot down the general rule.</v>

443
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Most will in a civilized society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most will obey the rules in government.</v>

444
00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Most will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not every senator will,</v>

445
00:27:57.591 --> 00:28:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but what enough will to build a stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and a future.</v>

446
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone in the armed forces will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough will.</v>

447
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone in the community will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough with not every teenager in</v>

448
00:28:10.761 --> 00:28:11.571
<v Speaker 1>this high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

449
00:28:11.571 --> 00:28:15.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you the most will and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we survive in a civilized</v>

450
00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:19.690
<v Speaker 1>society because most will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good feeling to know most</v>

451
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.533
<v Speaker 1>wheel</v>

452
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:22.643
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

453
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.640
<v Speaker 1>So have patience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

454
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.980
<v Speaker 1>under personal development is learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve problems.</v>

455
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.500
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having patients with the seasons takes</v>

456
00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 1>time to develop the crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't plant the seed,</v>

457
00:28:42.411 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Speaker 1>dig around it in a few days saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is it?</v>

458
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't really help.</v>

459
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.540
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is nourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people planted spring,</v>

460
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:55.541
<v Speaker 1>leaving the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just haven't got the patience to last.</v>

461
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.690
<v Speaker 1>So next comes solving problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business problems,</v>

462
00:28:59.691 --> 00:29:01.340
<v Speaker 1>family problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal problems,</v>

463
00:29:01.341 --> 00:29:03.380
<v Speaker 1>financial problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional problems.</v>

464
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:04.214
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds.</v>

465
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found in solving problems every once</v>

466
00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 1>in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to.</v>

467
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I've got it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can just describe it before you</v>

468
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 1>take a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a line down the center of the paper,</v>

469
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 1>and on the left side describe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

470
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So just jot that down on a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper in half on the left side,</v>

471
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 1>described the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's a good idea to take a</v>

472
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:27.630
<v Speaker 1>problem out of your head and put it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

473
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.110
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk a little bit more tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to think on paper.</v>

474
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.090
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the ways to think on</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

475
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Our mind usually is too busy sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort things out.</v>

476
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you take it out of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on paper,</v>

477
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>what is the problem and you to describe</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the of your ability what the problem</v>

478
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 1>is and then ask this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that all of it?</v>

479
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to prescribe</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for the problem,</v>

480
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>you need to know what all of the is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you've got it all listed on the</v>

481
00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now of the paper's called answers and</v>

482
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:57.390
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem on one side,</v>

483
00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.070
<v Speaker 1>answers and solutions on the other side,</v>

484
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and now let me give you three questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three questions that can help solve</v>

485
00:30:07.411 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 1>almost any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are those questions.</v>

486
00:30:09.181 --> 00:30:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could I do?</v>

487
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.800
<v Speaker 1>So just jot that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I do?</v>

488
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you start developing what we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>working papers and the working papers</v>

489
00:30:20.461 --> 00:30:23.430
<v Speaker 1>consist of making a list of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do to solve this problem.</v>

490
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

491
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:28.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one would take too long.</v>

492
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I can see that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to number two.</v>

493
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

494
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.913
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't it,</v>

495
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and let's say you've got several points</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you've done your best to try to</v>

496
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem yourself and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve it yourself.</v>

497
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's the second question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could I read?</v>

498
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody spent a lifetime</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching the problem you've got and</v>

499
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 1>they've got some excellent answers from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime of research.</v>

500
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in your own journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've taken notes before on something</v>

501
00:30:57.361 --> 00:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

502
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I remember a class site took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like there were some answers</v>

503
00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:01.590
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you go back,</v>

504
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.390
<v Speaker 1>do a little research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so under number two is research and if</v>

505
00:31:06.391 --> 00:31:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you search what you will find if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

506
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you will find search and research.</v>

507
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Now research as soon as possible because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problem is severe.</v>

508
00:31:22.731 --> 00:31:26.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to wait until too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Kenny comes to me and says,</v>

509
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you just lost a beautiful lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous lady.</v>

510
00:31:29.871 --> 00:31:31.970
<v Speaker 1>They got a divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was really something.</v>

511
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Then after his divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes to me and says,</v>

512
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 1>you know it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he says,</v>

513
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you know something strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

514
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I found a book in my library that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think would have saved my marriage if I</v>

515
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:48.901
<v Speaker 1>had read it before my divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a book entitled how to live</v>

516
00:31:49.731 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>with another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

517
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I should've read that book a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

518
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 1>He finally read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a little late.</v>

519
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like reading a book on nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you've had a heart attack.</v>

520
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.474
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

521
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is good,</v>

522
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>like gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much better to read it before.</v>

523
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Spare yourself the agony and the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and maybe the loss of your life.</v>

524
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

525
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 1>if you tried to solve it yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't solve it and you've researched</v>

526
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't seem like you've got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

527
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's number three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third question is who could I ask?</v>

528
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Is there someone around me that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the answer to my</v>

529
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.103
<v Speaker 2>problem</v>

530
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.970
<v Speaker 1>now under that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here,</v>

531
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask first.</v>

532
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:44.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to solve it yourself.</v>

533
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Develop some working papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you think you might do that still</v>

534
00:32:47.221 --> 00:32:49.410
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some books I've read.</v>

535
00:32:49.411 --> 00:32:50.790
<v Speaker 1>This guy's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

536
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 1>no answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't got it now I asked,</v>

537
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but if you now can show your working</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers to who you asked,</v>

538
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe how swift the answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>will come.</v>

539
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.560
<v Speaker 1>All of us have heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's remind ourselves one more time</v>

540
00:33:04.561 --> 00:33:08.100
<v Speaker 1>and put it in your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all love to help people who first of</v>

541
00:33:08.101 --> 00:33:13.101
<v Speaker 1>all try to help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to the philosophy of deserve.</v>

542
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got the answer.</v>

543
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody is very willing to help you if</v>

544
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 1>they know you've tried first to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

545
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It works that way with our children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

546
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.141
<v Speaker 1>My daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linda,</v>

547
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:33.540
<v Speaker 1>before she got married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to travel a lot.</v>

548
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 1>She comes to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

549
00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm headed for Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

550
00:33:35.851 --> 00:33:37.170
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

551
00:33:37.171 --> 00:33:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I've saved up my money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

552
00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:40.770
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

553
00:33:40.771 --> 00:33:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

554
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.370
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

555
00:33:44.371 --> 00:33:45.990
<v Speaker 1>the kids wanted to go here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go there.</v>

556
00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to buy this one,</v>

557
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.070
<v Speaker 1>buy that I didn't buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my money.</v>

558
00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Put aside a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

559
00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Linda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

560
00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:56.430
<v Speaker 1>You must be my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>

561
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Now she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the trip,</v>

562
00:33:58.561 --> 00:34:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I only need a couple of thousand dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

563
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.970
<v Speaker 1>An easy 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

564
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 1>But she knew she couldn't get the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

565
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 1>but she knew that if she worked hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of her ability and put that</v>

566
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 1>first thousand together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then next to is easy.</v>

567
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

568
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:21.330
<v Speaker 1>So develop your working papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your best to solve problems.</v>

569
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's why you try to solve it on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

570
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:26.130
<v Speaker 1>First you need the mental and emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

571
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:31.680
<v Speaker 1>You need the discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just quickly go to the answer,</v>

572
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.690
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're not developing the muscle.</v>

573
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>You're not developing the discipline to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve your own problems because there</v>

574
00:34:38.261 --> 00:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>may come a day when there's no one else</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask,</v>

575
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.300
<v Speaker 1>so you need the rhythm of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rhythm of trying,</v>

576
