1
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the biggest problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we face in our society and our day and</v>

2
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurodegeneration,</v>

3
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we really try to hide the truth from</v>

4
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've grown up in this world where</v>

5
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>everything is fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets a trophy.</v>

6
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is different.</v>

7
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for being equal,</v>

8
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>treating people equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

9
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are different.</v>

10
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>We see things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel things differently sometimes.</v>

11
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Although we can relate to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not all the same as human beings.</v>

12
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>We take losses and I think in today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>world where we grow up and it's more</v>

13
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>normal to not let somebody understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they took a loss is really</v>

14
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates room for people to start</v>

15
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>making excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives a reason for people to start</v>

16
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>pointing the finger and other directions</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not taking responsibility for</v>

17
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

18
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're not happy where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your problem.</v>

19
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>The circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be different compared to other</v>

20
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>you could have definitely been dealt a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty hand.</v>

22
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand my life isn't perfect.</v>

23
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It's never gonna be perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never been perfect,</v>

24
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day I had full</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over my situation.</v>

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>If you're not happy with where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not happy with what you're</v>

26
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking simple.</v>

27
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ensure,</v>

28
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets scary.</v>

29
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>It gets challenging and risky and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>never know what's gonna happen,</v>

30
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that why we are alive to</v>

31
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>experience this opportunity that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>given and not just sit by and watch it</v>

32
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:12.701
<v Speaker 1>go to waste overall your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ambitions and your objectives are</v>

33
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so is the outcome and the process.</v>

34
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>If you want it to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make it happen.</v>

35
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't.</v>

36
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>To stop blaming other people for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Be honest with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 17,</v>

38
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>if you know me by now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not somebody that's all about like</v>

39
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>new year new me,</v>

40
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that's easily able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at is just what you've done in a</v>

41
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>previous year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of situations and a lot of people</v>

42
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 2>just kind of look at a new year as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to say,</v>

43
00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:17.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the things I didn't do</v>

44
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Speaker 2>correctly this year and is now moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the next year.</v>

45
00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make me better,</v>

46
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.200
<v Speaker 2>but 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

47
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big year for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world.</v>

48
00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many crazy things happened this year</v>

49
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>with social media being with everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowadays.</v>

50
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 2>It was so easy to see all the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>that went on this year.</v>

51
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's nice to just kind of take</v>

52
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 2>a second and remember all the good</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that actually happened in the</v>

53
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.540
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for myself,</v>

54
00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I was able to express what I love doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for living in a way that brought me into</v>

55
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 2>a new creative field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this videography photography stuff.</v>

56
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:05.720
<v Speaker 2>My passion for my work as a freelance</v>
<v Speaker 2>designer helped influence me this year</v>

57
00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 2>to start stepping out of the comfort</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone,</v>

58
00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:13.511
<v Speaker 2>I guess with other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed to that led me to this extremely</v>

59
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 2>costly addiction in the video world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

60
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome because I get to document</v>
<v Speaker 2>these moments,</v>

61
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.080
<v Speaker 2>hopefully years to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll be able to look back on this video</v>

62
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.570
<v Speaker 2>recapping 2017 and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

63
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.220

<v Speaker 2>this year,</v>

66
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.280

<v Speaker 2>experiencing life to proposing to</v>

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 2>down to all the people that I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet this year and hopefully influence</v>

69
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.430
<v Speaker 2>to chase after the things that they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do as well.</v>

70
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Please push forward in 2018.</v>

75
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>You guys are amazing and this also goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all the people that I haven't met</v>

76
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's tons of people out there with</v>

77
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 2>the creative imagination and an a desire</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do something that they want to do and</v>

78
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 2>they hold themselves back from doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they wait till the next year to try</v>

79
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it now,</v>

80
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to take the opportunity to remind</v>

81
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>the people and some of the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that the youtube creators have</v>

82
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>done this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

83
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>the fundraising that's gone on during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drought for example,</v>

84
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>or people losing loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the opportunity to use their fan</v>

85
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>base to actually give back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How amazing is that that we're in a</v>

86
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>world now where people have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to create their own content,</v>

87
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 2>benefit from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also give back to the world</v>

88
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.610
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mindblowing.</v>

89
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>We've definitely lost some amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people this year,</v>

90
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>some amazing musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least on my end,</v>

91
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>to musicians that really inspired me</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the years to just be the</v>

92
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 2>person that I am today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even with losing them a gave us</v>

93
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to remember a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

94
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:28.511
<v Speaker 2>Remember a lot of those old feelings</v>
<v Speaker 2>that drove us to create the path that we</v>

95
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 2>created today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look back at every single year as</v>

96
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 2>a marketing point of what's happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

97
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have ups and downs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

98
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>for some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 wasn't a great year.</v>

99
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.650
<v Speaker 2>If bad things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you lost a loved one and I'm</v>

100
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 2>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly sorry.</v>

101
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.210
<v Speaker 2>If you could find any part of you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at the good things that did</v>

102
00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 2>happen this year and just focus on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

103
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's the littlest stuff to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>help push forward.</v>

104
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I promise you things will turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking back throughout multiple years</v>

105
00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 2>have been at many low points to I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost people.</v>

106
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>I've had bad times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been through depression and stress</v>

107
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 2>and just felt so alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can honestly say I've made the best of</v>

108
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's had ups and downs,</v>

109
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 2>but during those downtimes are focused</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of the positive that I have</v>

110
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.780
<v Speaker 2>focused on a lot of the hard work that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could put in and I did it here.</v>

111
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>In a few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be creating a short film of</v>

112
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of like an anniversary of me</v>
<v Speaker 2>quitting my job to be a freelance</v>

113
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:26.310
<v Speaker 2>designer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to doing this video</v>

114
00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:28.980
<v Speaker 2>because I did one last year and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to be insane.</v>

115
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Seen that transition of how I created</v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

116
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Then to now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I actually remember correctly,</v>

117
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 2>my first ever short film was the I quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>my job to be a freelance designer.</v>

118
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really cold out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so cold out here.</v>

119
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.660
<v Speaker 2>You guys are better appreciate this</v>
<v Speaker 2>video in some way,</v>

120
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 2>shape or form because of freezing my ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>off to be out here and get this,</v>

121
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's so worth it because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of this type of stuff</v>

122
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:02.080
<v Speaker 2>started for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This documenting this,</v>

123
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.310
<v Speaker 2>getting out and doing stuff</v>

124
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Speaker 2>in two days it's 2018 and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>head into 2018.</v>

125
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Not Remembering how great of a year 2017</v>
<v Speaker 2>was for me.</v>

126
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Not remembering the bad things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in 2017,</v>

127
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.930
<v Speaker 2>but just realizing that no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>year it is,</v>

128
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.200
<v Speaker 2>as long as I'm still here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the opportunity to live and I want</v>

129
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 2>to take advantage of that to the best of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ability.</v>

130
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to thank everybody who's been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this year all the way down to</v>

131
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 2>the coworkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that creative grenade,</v>

132
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.760

<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

133
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 2>all the supporters and the videos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the live streams,</v>

134
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Meghan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family friends,</v>

135
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>anybody that's just been a positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence in this year and that's been a</v>

136
00:08:55.591 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>negative influence as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for pissing me off so much</v>

137
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>so that way I gave the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove you guys</v>

138
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.230
<v Speaker 2>take every opportunity you guys get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make something of it because we never</v>

139
00:09:11.231 --> 00:09:12.940
<v Speaker 2>know what year is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our last</v>

140
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.080
<v Speaker 3>is 2018.</v>
