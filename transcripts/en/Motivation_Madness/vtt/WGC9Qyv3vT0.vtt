1
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up,</v>

2
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget them.</v>

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.900
<v Speaker 1>They are lying and they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy,</v>

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>so move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>sometimes this can be hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they've somehow tied</v>

6
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>themselves into your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like for instance,</v>

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you get the kids involved in a divorce</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>

8
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to mentally move on.</v>

9
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.721
<v Speaker 1>You have to emotionally detach from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human and that's hard to do because</v>

10
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>obviously they were someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusted and the reason I know that you</v>

11
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>trusted them is because they got to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where they were able to betray</v>

12
00:00:55.511 --> 00:01:00.511
<v Speaker 1>your trust and destroy you so they they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

13
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they trust that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusted them,</v>

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you had that relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even more reason to walk away.</v>

15
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's even more reason to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to see them for</v>

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an important piece right</v>

17
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

18
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>This is an important piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something I learned as a young lad</v>

19
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>out there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person is not who you thought they</v>

20
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They are not who you thought they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that this person</v>

22
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>was a trustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faithful companion is not true.</v>

23
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person does not exist.</v>

24
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>They didn't exist and they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in your head.</v>

25
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 1>It was in your head that this person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trustworthy and you the they were</v>

26
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>everything you wanted them to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were faithful,</v>

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>commanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a lie.</v>

28
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>They are not that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have proved it.</v>

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They've proved it by their actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

30
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>move on and at the risk of sounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>callous,</v>

31
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.593
<v Speaker 1>get over it,</v>

32
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not dwell.</v>

33
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Do not dwell on to not dwell on on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was and don't dwell on what it could</v>

34
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

35
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Who are you and guys go through bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakups.</v>

36
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.630
<v Speaker 1>You know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought we were going to say no.</v>

37
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't dwell on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deal with what it is right now.</v>

38
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>What that person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deal with reality except reality and be</v>

39
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>be thankful free album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thankful that you were able to learn</v>

40
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>before you invested more into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

41
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Be Be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Thankful that you found out when you</v>

42
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>did that this person was a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this person was unfaithful,</v>

43
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>is untrustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Be thankful</v>

44
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that you know it and you know it now</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of later and you know what else</v>

45
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>is going to make it a lot easier to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>over these situations is recognize that</v>

46
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of people out there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world are trustworthy and that our</v>

47
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:22.710
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good people.</v>

48
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.500
<v Speaker 1>They're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go find one of them,</v>

49
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.543
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

50
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>don't think that that person that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had was the only one in the world.</v>

51
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what if that as sometimes,</v>

52
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people have a hard time making</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trust because they're so caught up</v>

53
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

54
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to meet someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

55
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with yourself,</v>

56
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rely on yourself.</v>

57
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Trust yourself because we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone breaks our trust,</v>

58
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

59
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>we questioned ourselves too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we think are my judgments bad.</v>

60
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a good judge of human character</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I totally put my faith in this</v>

61
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>person and look what they did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we don't trust our.</v>

62
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to build that trust up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to build that trust up back</v>

63
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>again with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

64
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Read</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Learn workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be alone.</v>

66
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to be alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people get freaked out when they're</v>

67
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to be alone.</v>

68
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to be alone.</v>

69
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy it.</v>

70
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Do something productive and build that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust up in yourself.</v>

71
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Speaker 1>You'll look back at a situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from it.</v>

72
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>We do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an post operational debrief.</v>

73
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've put too much trust in somebody.</v>

74
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They broke your heart.</v>

75
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger that.</v>

76
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would the steps,</v>

77
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>what should I have recognized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times did I say will?</v>

78
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't call me,</v>

79
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably just because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone was out of battery.</v>

80
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once your phone runs out of battery</v>

81
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:56.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't let it happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

83
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>So you start seeing those red flags to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

84
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the mistakes that you made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then look for them next time around</v>

85
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>because you deal with people all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that they made mistakes.</v>

86
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>The first run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go back and they make the same</v>

87
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:09.181
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second run,</v>

88
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they go back and make the same mistakes.</v>

89
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>That third rung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you got to start blaming</v>

90
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.560
<v Speaker 1>yourself on your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

91
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said you got to like build</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with yourself.</v>

92
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 1>You gotta learn yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to trust.</v>

93
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn to trust yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so spend some time doing that and</v>

94
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>then when you go back and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people,</v>

95
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>because that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you got to watch out for is</v>

96
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>that you become a hardened criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't trust anybody like you were</v>

97
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>talking about cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know sometimes cops have a hard time</v>

98
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>because they're dealing with scumbags</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long and it builds up this,</v>

99
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 1>this mistrust of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to have that happen.</v>

100
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>You want to be suspicious of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to be able to build trust</v>

101
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>once they proved themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take those small steps and start</v>

102
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.973
<v Speaker 1>build up</v>

103
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 3>overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't just jump in and give someone 100</v>

104
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 3>percent trust out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know him,</v>

105
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 3>don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

106
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 3>back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day when old hardcore bands</v>

107
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 3>used to have this t shirt that just says</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

108
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 3>No one was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

109
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 3>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

110
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't go out of the gate with the big</v>

111
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 3>trust on somebody with important stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>

112
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 3>But the good news is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

113
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are good people that you give you.</v>

114
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Give all your trust to just take it slow</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>

115
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Feel crazy how you just explained that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So simple and it makes total sense when</v>

116
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 3>you're in the situation though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

117
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.340
<v Speaker 3>like you can't just detach it.</v>

118
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the red flags that I didn't</v>

119
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too busy missing the person or</v>

120
00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your disaster,</v>

121
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>but even</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and looking at pictures has to</v>

122
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.590
<v Speaker 1>work to get out the picture and stare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys do that.</v>

123
00:06:58.591 --> 00:06:59.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

124
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.560
<v Speaker 1>give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me throw this away for you.</v>

125
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to help that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that.</v>

126
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I was always to me was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was explaining like,</v>

127
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 1>listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

128
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>what she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

129
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a.</v>

130
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>That is a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person that you put put together in</v>

131
00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 1>your head that you've assembled in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

132
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>that person doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist.</v>

133
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>The person that you dealt with was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>liar,</v>

134
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.060
<v Speaker 1>was unfaithful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a cheater.</v>

135
00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who wasn't this person that</v>

136
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you're putting forth in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person doesn't exist,</v>

137
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>so stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't understand the good time.</v>

138
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

139
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:37.674
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

140
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

141
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 3>so</v>
<v Speaker 3>if.</v>

142
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person will lie.</v>

143
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>That part of the cheater and what I kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of said there was like you don't</v>

144
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 3>understand the good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real part of it.</v>

145
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 3>That's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

146
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 3>sure they did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

147
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 3>She.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a flats.</v>

148
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 3>My tires when she gets measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

149
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>but the good times we have are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

150
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's proof that it.</v>

151
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the person that you can</v>

152
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 3>see all the red flags and how they</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistreat you from time to time or they</v>

153
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about yourself and how you're sad</v>

154
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 3>now because of all these reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the trick comes with what one of the</v>

155
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 3>tricks come with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

156
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.670
<v Speaker 3>same thing I said about drinking where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your brain because it's like</v>

157
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 3>chemicals when you bond with someone in</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain in certain ways.</v>

158
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's different from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

159
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 3>it varies from person to person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

160
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like oxytocin or I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

161
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 3>something where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's it,</v>

162
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to.</v>

163
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.140
<v Speaker 3>But you feel this bond with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific person.</v>

164
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have these feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though this girl like lies to you,</v>

165
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 3>you see her lying text messages on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone right now.</v>

166
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

167
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men still miss him.</v>

168
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:44.431
<v Speaker 3>It's a trick because it seemed like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>your emotional wellbeing is attached to</v>

169
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 3>this person kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

170
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.730
<v Speaker 3>And all the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of ignore it.</v>

171
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 3>So it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the same with drinking,</v>

172
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why know?</v>

173
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 3>Consciously like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be hung over tomorrow.</v>

174
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I get anything done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

175
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Why do I want to drink so bad right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

176
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing and it's the same thing.</v>

177
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 3>The chemicals in your brain are telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like this girl is essential for you.</v>

178
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your wellbeing is not yet.</v>

179
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the logic though.</v>

180
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky.</v>

181
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't listen to your brain.</v>

182
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me that she's not essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all you bro.</v>

183
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the logic.</v>

184
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Those chemicals are blocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have seen so many situations where</v>

185
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>guys are just in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's horrible is I'm sitting here</v>

186
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 3>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

187
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You could be smacking someone in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>face telling them,</v>

188
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:32.371
<v Speaker 3>move on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move on,</v>

189
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 3>and they're not to listen to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you gotta make that decision.</v>

190
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

191
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it's hard.</v>

192
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.750
<v Speaker 3>And guys ruined their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the oldest due to the girls and</v>

193
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ruined their lives,</v>

194
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with over somebody that is completely</v>

195
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 3>abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether mentally or physically that just</v>

196
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 3>completely abusive and they'll ruin</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives for this person.</v>

197
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 3>That per se,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mind,</v>

198
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because they build a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

199
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 3>they build a person on the framework of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

200
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 3>They build a fantasy and they're in love</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that fantasy and they want to keep</v>

201
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:05.514
<v Speaker 3>it going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

202
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stop and they get away ignore like</v>

203
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 3>all the quona version for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they remember the good times.</v>

204
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's like like 10 minutes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

205
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 3>they remember those good times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ignore the red flags</v>

206
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know that trick,</v>

207
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 3>that chemical trick in their brain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it reinforces that thing that they</v>

208
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:27.871
<v Speaker 3>built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

209
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>that fantasy that they built there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>

210
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 3>this big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality is this big and look the</v>

211
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 3>street and they just attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see a friend or whatever</v>

212
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 3>because I'm assuming you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've never been in this situation like</v>

213
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 3>you ever had a friend where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>really into it.</v>

214
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 3>They're almost ruining their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in bad shape or whatever,</v>

215
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 3>and then whether it be all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 3>or years later,</v>

216
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're thinking back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

217
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.371
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was.</v>

218
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I think because the chemical trick so to</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak,</v>

219
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 3>wears off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they can see all of that logic</v>

220
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

221
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 3>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

222
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

223
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you feel like you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different person when you recover your</v>

224
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.221
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

225
00:11:06.221 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that you can't talk any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense into people when they're in that</v>

226
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 3>situation is the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to try and.</v>

227
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

228
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think knowing that that's it.</v>

229
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a chemical in your brain that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>tricking you and it goes for a lot of</v>

230
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:20.600
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donuts,</v>

231
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 3>like all this that's tricking you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know like,</v>

232
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>

233

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel the sadness.</v>

235
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:30.150

<v Speaker 3>Speaking of moving on,</v>

241
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.900
<v Speaker 3>next question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless we want to talk about this</v>

242
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.743
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

243
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.460

<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

244
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.294
<v Speaker 3>Let's move on.</v>

245
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 3>In what circumstances</v>

246
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>do you recommend direct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will hold on.</v>

248
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720

<v Speaker 1>killed themselves in these situations</v>

249
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>over a lie.</v>

00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>up is if they could just move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd find a reality that was actually</v>

254
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 1>congruent with what their desires are.</v>
