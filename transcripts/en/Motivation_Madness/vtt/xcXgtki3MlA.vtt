1
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a deterministic drive fits a</v>

2
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>some personality that has a goal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has a bunch of action patterns</v>

3
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>that are going to work in reference to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal.</v>

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It has a bunch of perceptions that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit that goal and it organizes your</v>

5
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>emotional responses around that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to think about it as a</v>

6
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>personality is a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more intelligent way to look</v>

7
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the thing about skinner's rats,</v>

8
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinner could get rats to do almost</v>

9
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>everything and he would reward them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And so he had a simple model but his</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats were starved down to 75% of their</v>

11
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>normal body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only were they not social</v>

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>gregarious routes like rats are cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were isolated,</v>

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>they're genetically altered from wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>routes,</v>

14
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but they also weren't as complex as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real route because they were starving.</v>

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

16
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>a starving rat is a pretty good model of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rat.</v>

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>And a rat has a pretty good model of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>But are a lot of our models have simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior learning were based on starving</v>

19
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>isolated rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>how to think about motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll think about it from the</v>

21
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say one thing that</v>

22
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>motivation does is set goals and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say that emotions track progress</v>

23
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>towards goals and I'm going to use that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema even though it's not exactly</v>

24
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>well motivation determines where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to aim.</v>

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>So if you're hungry you're going to name</v>
<v Speaker 1>it something to eat and then that will</v>

27
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>organize your perceptions so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero out everything that isn't relevant</v>

28
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>to that task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost everything you</v>

29
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on those few things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to facilitate your movement</v>

30
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces positive emotion,</v>

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>as you move through the world towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal and you see that things are</v>

33
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>laying themselves out that facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your movement forward,</v>

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>those things cause positive emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter anything that gets in</v>

35
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that produces negative emotion and</v>

36
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>it can be like threat because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to encounter something that</v>

37
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be anger so that you move it</v>

38
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be frustration,</v>

39
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grief.</v>

40
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Those would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

41
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>if you had a response that serious to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle,</v>

42
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>it would probably punish the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated frame right out of existence.</v>

43
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you walked downstairs and I dunno,</v>

44
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>they're contracting company has had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecking ball through your kitchen.</v>

45
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

46
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to keep eating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,</v>

47
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>that little frame is going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>punished out of existence and some new</v>

48
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>goal is going to pop up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

49
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we're going to try to</v>

50
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>sort out is how do you decide when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've encountered an obstacle that's so</v>

51
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>big that you should just quit and go do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else?</v>

52
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Because that's not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get into counterproductive</v>

54
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>persistence pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know how people solve that</v>

55
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really complicated one.</v>

56
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to work on that scenario.</v>

57
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Your hypothalamus pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Micro goals that are directly relevant</v>

58
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>to biological now produces a frame of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

59
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a drive and it's not a</v>

60
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>collection of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little personality and the</v>

61
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>personality has a viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has thoughts that go along with it.</v>

62
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It has perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has action tendencies,</v>

63
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see this in addiction most</v>

64
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you find often</v>

65
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>with people who are alcoholic is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie all the time.</v>

66
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's because when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they built a little alcohol dependent</v>

67
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>personality inside of themselves or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big one,</v>

68
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's 90% of their personality.</v>

69
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And one of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that compose consists</v>

70
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>of is all the rationalizations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've used over the years to justify</v>

71
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>their addiction to themselves and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

72
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the addiction has a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and so when the person is off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are addicted to meth or</v>

74
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>something like that where we know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction is more,</v>

75
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more short term powerful than I</v>

76
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than an alcohol addiction.</v>

77
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They'll say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

78
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:03.384
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>the words are just tools used to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal.</v>

80
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And if they happen to be deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

81
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just practical tools to get</v>

82
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get towards the goal</v>

83
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and you take a nice shot of math or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

84
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>you reinforce all those rationales that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use to get the drug and then the</v>

85
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>next time you're even a better deceiver</v>
<v Speaker 1>and liar.</v>

86
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.951
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

87
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to say motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of thinking about as they set</v>

88
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the right way of thinking</v>

89
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They produce a whole framework of</v>

90
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to think about that</v>

91
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>framework of interpretation and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions emerging side of that.</v>

92
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the world is framed.</v>

93
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set goals.</v>

94
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You could say the world has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>framed.</v>

95
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So motivation sets that frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crews,</v>

96
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

97
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and actions and inactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>track progress.</v>

98
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>So positive emotion says you're moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward properly towards your goal.</v>

99
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you encounter something you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>

100
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's anxiety.</v>

101
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

102
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>we're not where we thought we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't know what to do.</v>

103
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So we should stop because we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are,</v>

104
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop frozen.</v>

105
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>And then the more powerful negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions like pain they might make you</v>

106
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.514
<v Speaker 1>get out of there.</v>

107
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So emotions forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

108
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your emotions within that</v>

109
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>motivated frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's another example of how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is embedded in your body.</v>

111
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Your emotions are like their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offshoots of action tendencies.</v>

112
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to think about it.</v>

113
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause action has everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

114
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So what are some basic motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>most of these are regulated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus by the way.</v>

116
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells you just how important the</v>

117
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>control system it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's useful to know</v>

118
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>about the hypothalamus is that it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>projections going up from it that are</v>

119
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>like tree trunks and inhibitory</v>
<v Speaker 1>projections coming down there.</v>

120
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>They're like grape vines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of control your</v>

121
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus as long as it's not on too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

122
00:05:56.411 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>But if on in any serious way it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

123
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>it winds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what you do to stop yourself</v>

124
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>from falling under the dominion of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus is to never ever be</v>

125
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>anywhere where it's action is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go into a biker bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might find yourself in a</v>

127
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>situation where panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Defensive aggression is immediately</v>

128
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't want that.</v>

129
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't want the panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the terror,</v>

130
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the frenzied fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want any of that.</v>

131
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have to run away in</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute panic.</v>

132
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So you just don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a huge,</v>

133
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of how we regulate our</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions is just by never going anywhere</v>

134
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>where we have to experience them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that has very little to do with</v>

135
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>internal inhibitory control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to do with staying where you</v>

136
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>belong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

137
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basic motivations,</v>

138
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:51.351
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>

139
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is not regulated by the</v>

140
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different circuit.</v>

141
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Anger slash aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thermoregulation panic and escape,</v>

142
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>affiliation and care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire,</v>

143
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>exploration play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of break those in.</v>

144
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of break those into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic Darwinian categories too and</v>

145
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a set of motivations that</v>

146
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>go along with self maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be your survival ingestive and</v>

147
00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I've sort of coded them there.</v>

148
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.050
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self maintenance,</v>

149
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.930
<v Speaker 1>there's an adjustive set of basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations that go with self</v>

150
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:30.480
<v Speaker 1>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd say that's hunger thirst,</v>

151
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a set of defensive motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

152
00:07:33.571 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thermal regulation,</v>

153
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.260
<v Speaker 1>paddock and escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

154
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>there's motivations that are associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reproduction,</v>

155
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>affiliation care and sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I put exploration in play sort</v>

156
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>of outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

157
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.410
<v Speaker 1>well I would say because those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things serve both of these approximately</v>

158
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 1>equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to Harvard,</v>

159
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I came from the Gill and I had spent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time with my advisor there and,</v>

160
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and a research team that he had trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the genesis of antisocial</v>

161
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 1>behavior and</v>

162
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 2>among adolescents mostly so well as kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

163
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Anti social behavior is very persistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a child whose conduct</v>

164
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 2>disordered at the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they will be</v>

165
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:26.790
<v Speaker 2>criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely high.</v>

166
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very dismal literature because</v>

167
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you see these early onset aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and and it's persistent and then</v>

168
00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:41.130
<v Speaker 2>you look at the intervention literature</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you throw up your hands because no</v>

169
00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:42.960
<v Speaker 2>interventions work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>

170
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:46.590
<v Speaker 2>psychologists have tried everything you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly imagine and a bunch of</v>

171
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:49.320
<v Speaker 2>things that you can't in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ameliorate that.</v>

172
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.440
<v Speaker 2>So we are really interested in trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

173
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're antisocial by age of four,</v>

174
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>then there isn't an intervention that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be effective.</v>

175
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

176
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 2>the standard peanut logical theory is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really quite horrifying in this regard</v>

177
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 2>because what you see is that male</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression peaks around the age of 15</v>

178
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.710
<v Speaker 2>and then it declines fairly</v>
<v Speaker 2>precipitously and,</v>

179
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of re normalizes again by the</v>

180
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>age of 27 and standard peanut logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory essentially is this cold hearted.</v>

181
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have a multi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have someone who's a multiple</v>

182
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 2>offender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just throw him in prison til they're</v>

183
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 2>27 and then the age out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all there is to it.</v>

184
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we've got.</v>

185
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some downside to that because</v>

186
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a corollary literature that</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that the worst thing that you</v>

187
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>can do with antisocial people is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>group them together,</v>

188
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 2>which is what we do in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a whole mess.</v>

189
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we were doing was</v>

190
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to see if there might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive predictors of antisocial</v>

191
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we use this battery of</v>

192
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological tests that was put</v>
<v Speaker 2>together at the Montreal neurological</v>

193
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 2>institute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took about 11 hours to administer and</v>

194
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically assess prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortical function and we computerized</v>

195
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 2>out and reduced it to about 90 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

196
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessed antisocial adolescents in,</v>

197
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.540
<v Speaker 2>in Montreal and found out that they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>show deficits in,</v>

198
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 2>in problem solving ability that we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with,</v>

199
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with prefrontal ability.</v>

200
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got to Harvard,</v>

201
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:19.411
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

202
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could use the neuro psych battery to</v>

203
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 2>predict negative behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps we could use it to predict</v>

204
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>positive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

205
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if we turn the neuro psych battery</v>

206
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 2>and over and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 2>can we predict grades for example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>

208
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>that's a decent thing to predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we ran a study,</v>

209
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>we ran a study that looked at Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

210
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line workers at a Milwaukee factory and</v>

211
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>managers and executives at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory.</v>

212
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:54.921
<v Speaker 2>And what we found was that the average</v>
<v Speaker 2>score across these neuropsychological</v>

213
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were kind of like games.</v>

214
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 2>They were game like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

215
00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 2>So in one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one test you had,</v>

216
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 2>there were five lights in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the screen and a box was associated with</v>

217
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 2>each light and you had to learn by trial</v>
<v Speaker 2>and error,</v>

218
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>which box was associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with each light.</v>

219
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

220
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>so we took people's average score across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tests because they seem to clump</v>

221
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>together into a single structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it,</v>

222
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 2>you can find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statistically,</v>

223
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 2>if you take a bunch of tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find out how they clump together</v>

224
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>statistically by looking at their</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of correlations.</v>

225
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And you might get multiple clumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what happens with personality</v>

226
00:11:31.861 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>research where you get five or you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a singular clump,</v>

227
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 2>which is what happens in cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

228
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 2>And we got a single clump essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we were trying to figure out if</v>

229
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>at the same time I was reading the</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on performance prediction and</v>

230
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 2>there's an extensive literature on</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance prediction.</v>

231
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it generated by the armed</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>

232
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

233
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>indicating Iq is a very good predictor</v>
<v Speaker 2>of longterm life success.</v>

234
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the general rule.</v>

235
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.290
<v Speaker 2>If your job is simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you do the same thing every</v>

236
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Iq predicts how fast you'll learn</v>

237
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not how well you you do it.</v>

238
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 2>But if your job is complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that the demands change on</v>

239
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 2>an ongoing basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the best predictor of success is</v>

240
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>general cognitive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

241
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I learned that the general cognitive</v>

242
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.570
<v Speaker 2>ability tests clump together into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single factor that's fluid intelligence</v>

243
00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Iq.</v>

244
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And then we didn't know if the factor</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had found was the same factor as</v>

245
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Iq and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we still haven't really figured out</v>

246
00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that was the case because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of depends on how you do the</v>

247
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:36.000
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

248
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>so I got deeply into the performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction literature and I found out,</v>

249
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to predict people's</v>

250
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 2>performance in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

251
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

252
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>You need to know their general cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>

253
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 2>If they're going to do a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know their trait</v>

254
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you might've heard that</v>

255
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 2>rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

256
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 2>because it's a good predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm life success,</v>

257
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 2>freedom from negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Low neuroticism is another predictor,</v>

258
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of third on the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then openness to experience,</v>

259
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 2>which is a personality trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is associated with,</v>

260
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>with expertise in creative domains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evidence that now I should tell you</v>

261
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it's such a complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should tell you how to make an Iq test</v>

262
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 2>because they're actually really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to know this to actually</v>

263
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 2>understand what Iq is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you generated a a set of</v>

264
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>10,000 questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

265
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>About anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be math problems,</v>

266
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 2>they could be general knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could be vocabulary,</v>

267
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 2>they could be multiple choice.</v>

268
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.800
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't matter what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>about as long as they require</v>

269
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 2>abstraction to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd be formulated linguistically,</v>

270
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.140
<v Speaker 2>but mathematically would also apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have those 10,000</v>

271
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you take a random set of a hundred</v>

272
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>of those questions and you give them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand people and all you do is sum</v>

273
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 2>up the answers right from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people are going to get most of</v>

274
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 2>them right and some of some of them are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get most of them wrong.</v>

275
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>You just rank ordered the people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of their score,</v>

276
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.570
<v Speaker 2>correct that for age and you have Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all there is to it.</v>

277
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>And what you'll find is that no matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>which random set of 100 questions you</v>

278
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people at the top of one random set</v>

279
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:16.650
<v Speaker 2>will be at the top of all the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

280
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 2>and with very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

281
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:19.750
<v Speaker 2>very high consistency.</v>

282
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.960
<v Speaker 2>So one thing you need to know is that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>any social science claims whatsoever are</v>

283
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:30.331
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the Iq claims are correct because</v>

284
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the Iq claims are more psychometrically</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous than any other phenomena</v>

285
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon that's been discovered by</v>
<v Speaker 2>social scientists.</v>

286
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Now the ICU literature is a dismal</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>

287
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 2>No one likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

288
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's our little,</v>

289
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 2>here's a fun little fact for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Liberals and conservatives alike,</v>

290
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 2>because conservatives think there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job for everyone.</v>

291
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 2>If people just get off their asses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to work and liberals think while you</v>

292
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 2>can train anyone to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

293
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a job for everyone and no,</v>

294
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you can't train everyone to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's wrong.</v>

295
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And here's one of the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

296
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 2>So as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Armed Forces has done a lot of work</v>

297
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 2>on Iq and they started back in 1919 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason they did that was because,</v>

298
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for obvious reasons,</v>

299
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:20.021
<v Speaker 2>say let's say there's a war and you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get qualified people into the officer</v>

300
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 2>positions as rapidly as possible or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll lose.</v>

301
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 2>So that's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

302
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:30.611
<v Speaker 2>the armed forces has experimented with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq tests since 1919 and in the last 20</v>

303
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 2>years I'm a law was passed as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that analysis,</v>

304
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 2>which was that it was illegal to induct</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone into the armed forces who had an</v>

305
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Iq of less than 83 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is why?</v>

306
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was all of that effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in by the armed forces indicated</v>

307
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>that if you had an Iq of 83 or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't anything that you could be</v>

308
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 2>trained to do in the military that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't positively counterproductive.</v>

309
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Now you gotta think about that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the military is chronically</v>

310
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 2>desperate for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

311
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 2>There's not like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like people are lining up to be</v>

312
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 2>inducted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

313
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Speaker 2>They have to go out and recruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not easy.</v>

314
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 2>And so they're desperate to get their</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands on every body they can possibly</v>

315
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:12.644
<v Speaker 2>manage.</v>

316
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in wartime,</v>

317
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but also in peacetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there was another reason too,</v>

318
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>which was the armed forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was also set up from a policy</v>

319
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 2>perspective to take people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>underclass,</v>

320
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and train them and moved them up at</v>

321
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.030
<v Speaker 2>least into the working class or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middleclass.</v>

322
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So there's a policy element to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even from that perspective,</v>

323
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 2>you could see that the military is</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate to bring people in.</v>

324
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 2>But with an Iq of 83 or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not happening.</v>

325
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how many people have an Iq of 83 or</v>

326
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.734
<v Speaker 2>less?</v>

327
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 3>10%</v>

328
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that doesn't,</v>

329
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 2>if that doesn't hurt you to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you didn't hear it properly.</v>

330
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Because what it implies is that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex society like ours and one that's</v>

331
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:04.590
<v Speaker 2>becoming increasingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything for 10% of the</v>

332
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.620
<v Speaker 2>population to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

333
00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:08.401
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>

334
00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:11.250
<v Speaker 2>We're going to ignore that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to run away from that.</v>

335
00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:13.530
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have every reason to,</v>

336
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.700
<v Speaker 2>or we going to contend with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need to figure out how it is,</v>

337
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.920
<v Speaker 2>how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it might be possible to find a place</v>

338
00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:27.090
<v Speaker 2>for people on the lower end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>general cognitive distribution to take</v>

339
00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:30.540
<v Speaker 2>their productive and worthwhile place in</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

340
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.680
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't just going to be a matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dumping money down the hierarchy</v>

341
00:17:34.681 --> 00:17:38.340
<v Speaker 2>because giving people who have nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do money isn't helpful.</v>

342
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that simple.</v>

343
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of an answer to the</v>

344
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.810
<v Speaker 2>question of whether or not we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with the,</v>

345
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.110
<v Speaker 2>with Iq forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

346
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 2>if you can find a flaw in that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just go right ahead.</v>

347
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I was thrilled to death to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discover all of this by knows by no</v>

348
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination was that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

349
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

350
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 2>So Iq is reliable and valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing.</v>

351
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's more reliable and valid than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other psychometric test ever designed by</v>

352
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>social scientists by a factor of about</v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

353
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 2>That's fact number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fact number two is it predicts longterm</v>

354
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:24.351
<v Speaker 2>life outcome at about 0.3 0.4 which</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves about 85% 70 to 85% of the story</v>

355
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:29.190
<v Speaker 2>unexplained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's still the best thing that we</v>

356
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

357
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case that in places like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain,</v>

358
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>when Iq tests were first introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were actually used by the</v>

359
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:42.411
<v Speaker 2>socialists and they were used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>identify poor people who had potential</v>

360
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 2>cognitive potential and to move them</v>
<v Speaker 2>into higher into institutes of higher</v>

361
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:48.324
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

362
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 2>So there's an upside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 2>social upside as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something you can't say anything</v>

364
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 2>about without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without immediately being killed.</v>

365
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you one thing that I did</v>

366
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 2>in the last week that's relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

367
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this just shows you how complex the</v>

368
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 2>problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

369
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 2>we should point out that race is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing to define because racial</v>

370
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>boundaries aren't tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

371
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when you talk about racial</v>

372
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 2>differences in Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

373
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you're faced with a thorny problem of</v>
<v Speaker 2>defining race.</v>

374
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective.</v>

375
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 2>But we'll leave that aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote an article this week.</v>

376
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Somebody stood up at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my talks and vice,</v>

377
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.920
<v Speaker 2>bless their hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took this particular question and used</v>

378
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 2>it as an indication of the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are my so called</v>

379
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>

380
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality of my so called followers is</v>

381
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can find that out quite rapidly</v>

382
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 2>just by going looking at the youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments,</v>

383
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 2>which are head and shoulders above what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard set of youtube comments.</v>

384
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone asked me that,</v>

385
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 2>both the Jewish question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

386
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implication,</v>

387
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:05.310
<v Speaker 2>it was actually someone Jewish and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>implication was that,</v>

388
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews are overrepresented in positions of</v>

389
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:11.060
<v Speaker 2>authority and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

390
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.240
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had just spoken for like an hour and a</v>

391
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 2>half and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy had an ax to grind.</v>

392
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's No God damn way I'm getting into</v>

393
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:21.380
<v Speaker 2>this at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

394
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

395
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a very good answer.</v>

396
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a blog post this week and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

397
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

398
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 2>here's the situation.</v>

399
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews are overrepresented in positions of</v>

400
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 2>power and authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then let's open our eyes a little</v>

401
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

402
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 2>and think for like two or three seconds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think,</v>

403
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.363
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

404
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>They're also overrepresented in</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of competence and it's not</v>

405
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 2>like we have more geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what to do with,</v>

406
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and if the Jews happened to be producing</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of them,</v>

407
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 2>which they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

408
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>then that's a pretty good thing for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of us.</v>

409
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 2>So let's not confuse competence with</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and authority,</v>

410
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.620
<v Speaker 2>even though that's a favorite trick of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical leftists who always failed</v>

411
00:21:01.621 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>to make that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

412
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Speaker 2>why does this overrepresentation occur?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it does it also.</v>

413
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 2>There's also overrepresentation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>political movements,</v>

414
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 2>including radical political movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

415
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

416
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 2>answer one Jewish conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

417
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.640
<v Speaker 2>that's not a very good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had,</v>

418
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 2>we've used that answer before.</v>

419
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.713
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

420
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 2>but do we have an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

421
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 2>here's an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere</v>

422
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 2>between one 10 in one 15 which is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>one standard deviation above the</v>

423
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 2>population average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that the</v>

424
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.130
<v Speaker 2>average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Iq that's higher than 85% of the</v>

425
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot higher.</v>

426
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make that much difference</v>

427
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

428
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>But genius is don't exist at the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the distribution.</v>

429
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>They exist at the tails of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

430
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.650
<v Speaker 2>And you don't need much of a move at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean to produce walloping differences at</v>

431
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>the tails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the tails are important because a</v>

432
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 2>lot of where we draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we draw exceptional people from the</v>

433
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:13.690
<v Speaker 2>exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

434
00:22:13.691 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another example of the same</v>

435
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most engineers are male.</v>

436
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because men are more interested in</v>

437
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 2>things and women are more interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

438
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 2>And he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's socio cultural.</v>

439
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

440
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that because if you stack up</v>

441
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:36.850
<v Speaker 2>countries by their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by their egalitarian social policies,</v>

442
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>which you can do quite effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you look at the</v>

443
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:43.300
<v Speaker 2>overrepresentation of men in stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields,</v>

444
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 2>the overrepresentation increases as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries become more egalitarian.</v>

445
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's not socio cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

446
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Now men aren't that much more interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in things than women.</v>

447
00:22:56.411 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>It's one standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about the same difference,</v>

448
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the population norm and the</v>

449
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Ashkenazi Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're looking at the person who</v>

450
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.500
<v Speaker 2>the one person in 20 or the one person</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 50 who's most,</v>

451
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 2>who's hyper interested in things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's likely to become an engineer,</v>

452
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 2>then most of them are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another example of the same</v>

453
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are more aggressive than women.</v>

454
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Now you might ask how much and answered</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as best place to look at that as in</v>

455
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the egalitarian policies of be</v>

456
00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 2>laid out for a long period of time.</v>

457
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a more direct inference</v>

458
00:23:33.521 --> 00:23:36.730
<v Speaker 2>about biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you took a random man and around in</v>

459
00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 2>woman out of the population and you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bet on who was more aggressive and</v>

460
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you bet on the man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be right 60% of the time.</v>

461
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>So that's not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

462
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's deviates from 50 50 but it's not</v>

463
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 2>like 90 10 it's 60 40 okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

464
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 2>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

465
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 2>we got a tail problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

466
00:23:56.631 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say that now you decide to go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the extremes of aggression and you</v>

467
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 2>identify the most aggressive one in 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>persons.</v>

468
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 2>They're all men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess who's in prison?</v>

469
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why most of the people in prison</v>

470
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 2>are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is elementary part of the</v>

471
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 2>problem in our society is that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand statistics.</v>

472
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand that you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively small differences at the</v>

473
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 2>population level that produce walloping</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences at the tails of the</v>

474
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:29.954
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

475
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back died.</v>

476
00:24:31.931 --> 00:24:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Q</v>
<v Speaker 2>one final thing to say about Iq.</v>

477
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 2>The ethnic differences are difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispense with.</v>

478
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to make them go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

479
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tests aren't culture fair.</v>

480
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Well here's a test of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you,</v>

481
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you test group a with an Iq test and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>test group B with an Iq test and then</v>

482
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you look at their actual performance in</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're predicting.</v>

483
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 2>If the test was biased against ethnic</v>
<v Speaker 2>group A,</v>

484
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 2>then it would under predict their</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

485
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>

486
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's systemic bias in the performance</v>

487
00:25:10.851 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>measures and the potential measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a possibility.</v>

488
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now one other thing about that,</v>

489
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a real danger in the ethnicity</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq debate and the,</v>

490
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 2>the danger is that we confuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence with value or that we</v>

491
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:34.160
<v Speaker 2>include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we we confuse intelligence with yet with</v>

492
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>human value.</v>

493
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a better way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

494
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have to understand here is that</v>

495
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that being more intelligent doesn't</v>

496
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 2>make you a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case.</v>

497
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 2>It makes me you more useful for complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive operations,</v>

498
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Speaker 2>but you can be pretty damn horrific as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>genius son of a bitch,</v>

499
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's morally neutral.</v>

500
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 2>And we also know that from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric data,</v>

501
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:00.380
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there doesn't seem to be any</v>

502
00:26:00.381 --> 00:26:02.930
<v Speaker 2>relationship whatsoever between</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and virtue.</v>

503
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.500
<v Speaker 2>And so if it does turn out that nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fates do not align with our</v>

504
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 2>eagle attarian presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is highly probable,</v>

505
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.900
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't therefore make the mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>of assuming that if group A or person a</v>

506
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 2>is lower on one of these attributes than</v>
<v Speaker 2>group B or person b,</v>

507
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 2>that that is somehow reflective of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic value as human beings.</v>

508
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a big mistake.</v>
