1
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animistic is a income is a wonderful</v>

3
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:21.151
<v Speaker 1>revenue for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told myself and told him,</v>

4
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:26.341
<v Speaker 1>my young people before 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good student when into</v>

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn some experience before 30 years</v>

6
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow somebody,</v>

7
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>go to a small company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally in a big company,</v>

8
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>it is good to learn processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a part of a big machine,</v>

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but when you go to small company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn the passion.</v>

10
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>You learn the dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to do lots of things as</v>

11
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>when one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before 30 years old,</v>

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not which company you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's which boss you follow.</v>

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good boss teach you differently and</v>

14
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>before from 30 to 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think very clearly where</v>

15
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you're working for yourself.</v>

16
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur,</v>

17
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>when you're 40 to 50 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do all the things that you</v>

18
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>are good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to drop into the new area.</v>

19
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be successful,</v>

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but the rate of dying is too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 40 to 50 think about how can focus on</v>

21
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:33.481
<v Speaker 1>things that you are good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you are 50 to 60 years old,</v>

22
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>work for the young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because young people can do better than</v>

23
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rely on them.</v>

24
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Invest on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure they're good.</v>

25
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So when you are over 60 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend time for yourself on the beach</v>

26
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:50.644
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shine,</v>

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too late for you to change novelty.</v>

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>

29
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>my advice to the young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years old.</v>

30
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Make enough mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>

31
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stand up,</v>

32
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stem.</v>

33
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>25 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the show in your show.</v>

35
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a rich father,</v>

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>tried to three times for university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all filled.</v>

37
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I apply for Harvard for 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All failed.</v>

38
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't even want to see me for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time I went to the teacher's</v>

39
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was considered the third or fourth</v>

40
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 2>class of my city.</v>

41
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 2>So applied jobs 30 times rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so difficult at that time.</v>

42
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I was so frustrated because I taught in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a university,</v>

43
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 2>my pay was $10 a mouth because I cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a good job in 1994 discuss it.</v>

44
00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do something called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and 23 of them against it.</v>

45
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid idea.</v>

46
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>We have never heard about internet or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know nothing about computer and I</v>

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>never thought I was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody believed that I could be</v>

48
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 2>successful because everybody would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this guy think differently.</v>

49
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Think of crazy that you know these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things about something that will work.</v>

50
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I try to follow three salary who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters from the banks took me three</v>

51
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still cannot get him.</v>

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>We talked to over 30 or 40 of venture</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists.</v>

53
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's mill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>

54
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Not a pupil said Ali Baba is a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

55
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

56
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I think this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could it be big?</v>

57
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I never thought it will be bad big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like today I believe something,</v>

58
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 2>something is waiting for me there and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to work hard to prove myself.</v>

59
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.220

<v Speaker 2>our business.</v>

62
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.730

76
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 2>they are always optimistic for the</v>

<v Speaker 2>They always tried to solve the problems</v>

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>of the others</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're optimistic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the other people complain.</v>

86
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>The opportunity lie always lies where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people complain.</v>

87
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Singing about how you can make things</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

88
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything I can do that make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two first and then when you think about</v>

89
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 2>this study to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of people,</v>

90
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>young people have a fantastic ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>every evening,</v>

91
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.700

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

92
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an entrepreneur,</v>

93
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to do the things before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people do.</v>

94
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>You have to wake up before the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wake up.</v>

95
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to be more brave than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

96
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Use instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you do is to the need of the</v>

97
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 2>customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everybody,</v>

98
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>to any person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow is a new,</v>

99
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 2>make the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make the action whether investors</v>

100
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>believe it this or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether your friends believe it or not,</v>

101
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 2>what their parents believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not important.</v>

102
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 2>You believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your team believe in and work day and</v>

103
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 2>night on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all the things happens.</v>

104
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Make enough mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fall your stand up.</v>

105
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Any mistake is that encompasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

106
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>wonderful revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>

107
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money follows the people.</v>

108
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.870
<v Speaker 2>People should follow the creams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a dream just to go ahead.</v>

109
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I think nobody can conquer the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're only kissed,</v>

110
00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:50.860
<v Speaker 2>serve the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either work for the others.</v>

111
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll work for yourself and I troost away</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can my,</v>

112
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.100
<v Speaker 2>for myself working for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means working for the society.</v>

113
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to work for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the others because only when</v>

114
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 2>the other people successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the other people are happy,</v>

115
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 2>you will be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be happy.</v>

116
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I think today people worry a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

117
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.840
<v Speaker 1>about the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China economy in the world and I'm a</v>

118
00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:24.841
<v Speaker 1>very optimistic when people start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry that that is the opportunity is,</v>

119
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but I worry about the blood testing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she created the good things and I think</v>

120
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 1>great innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great companies always happening in the</v>

121
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>tough times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lives,</v>

122
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Speaker 1>like the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a copy of it down,</v>

123
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you have a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shot nodes,</v>

124
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and I like your American movie life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is like a box of chocolate.</v>

125
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You never know what you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

126
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pretty optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opportunity in the future for</v>

127
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:56.221
<v Speaker 1>equality is huge because in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in the last century,</v>

128
00:07:56.261 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the t is for big companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The globalization is for big companies.</v>

129
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>But now with the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can serve those 80% of the companies</v>

130
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 1>that never been served.</v>

131
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.970
<v Speaker 1>We can serve the 80% of the young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have never been served.</v>

132
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Technology for Internet is so cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy to use.</v>

133
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why we grow each</v>
<v Speaker 1>China ecommerce so fast,</v>

134
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>much faster than the u s it because our</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure of commerce in China was</v>

135
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does too bad?</v>

136
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Something happened to ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we are working on the rural areas</v>

137
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 1>of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never imagine that Chinar about</v>

138
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>800 million people still live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural areas.</v>

139
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmers and there are about close to 200</v>

140
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.860
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are income is less than $1 per day</v>

141
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and before the Internet it's impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these guys to reach the pc because</v>

142
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even people like me,</v>

143
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to use a pc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now all 80% of the farmers,</v>

144
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>those people using mobile phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the mobile phones,</v>

145
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data,</v>

146
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>things changing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm excited about the future.</v>

147
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>People always worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

148
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the young kids sitting there and</v>

149
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>talking about the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hopes because if they have the hope,</v>

150
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>we have the hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I believe.</v>

151
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 3>And let's just take</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

152
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.593
<v Speaker 3>And I</v>

153
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.650
<v Speaker 4>loved every description I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how you serve people and your</v>

154
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:34.970
<v Speaker 4>story about the bamboo farmers and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>wife and her friends.</v>

155
00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:37.700
<v Speaker 4>It was fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But where's this going?</v>

156
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.370
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are your plans to maximize the use</v>

157
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:48.371
<v Speaker 4>that people in remote rural areas of</v>
<v Speaker 4>China can make of their cell phones?</v>

158
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Besides ordering your projects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you going to get it?</v>

159
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to get them in the banking</v>
<v Speaker 4>system through cell phones?</v>

160
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.533
<v Speaker 3>How</v>

161
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never know that we couldn't grow so</v>

163
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:08.281
<v Speaker 1>fast that passed the five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We covered 4,500 villages and these</v>

164
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:15.490
<v Speaker 1>people normally the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the using very traditional way.</v>

165
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Did it take them like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to a rural area,</v>

166
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it took them the farmers two hours to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work to the downtown,</v>

167
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

168
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.170
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the town and buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

169
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 1>But today because the mobile phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we deliver,</v>

170
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.030
<v Speaker 1>we can deliver things to their home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their village within 72 hours.</v>

171
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well last week I read a very interested</v>

172
00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:40.120
<v Speaker 1>in new for this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a girl,</v>

173
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.130
<v Speaker 1>she told them your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said her grandfather 92 years.</v>

174
00:10:45.131 --> 00:10:50.131
<v Speaker 1>So the birthday and for his life he</v>
<v Speaker 1>always wanted to try one western style</v>

175
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.460
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he lived in the rural areas.</v>

176
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a no such a restaurant food.</v>

177
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.220
<v Speaker 1>So she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried on the Internet book a</v>

178
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.190
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner for western food,</v>

179
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>deliver to that village and the fatherly</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately find the one restaurant.</v>

180
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Speaker 1>There were three guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took like a three days bus from</v>

181
00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Sha height to that village,</v>

182
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>made a telic spaghetti and a beef for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for 92 years old bursting and whole</v>

183
00:11:24.461 --> 00:11:26.390
<v Speaker 1>village was excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody starts says,</v>

184
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.320
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can order food rest in a restaurant,</v>

185
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.230
<v Speaker 1>rest of style of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by almost everything,</v>

186
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and also we'll helping there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of farmers,</v>

187
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.290
<v Speaker 1>they planned a love apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green apples,</v>

188
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>but 90% of the apples routed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody by that they normally buy</v>

189
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 1>by track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:49.210
<v Speaker 1>if you sell via the APP apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this our whole track</v>

191
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:50.963
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

192
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:56.340
<v Speaker 1>using the traditional way they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sell by whole basket of the</v>

193
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 1>apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now because of the Internet,</v>

194
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 1>the cell by one by one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each app with the cell,</v>

195
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>$1 Oh you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't imb or two,</v>

196
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just for each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the farmers will see using Internet,</v>

197
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 1>they can buy and the sell and using a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone that changed their lives.</v>

198
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's exciting and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>need examples when they see where the</v>

199
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>other my neighbor made made money sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of online to selling things.</v>

200
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.600
<v Speaker 1>My neighbor made by much interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are life.</v>

201
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>People start to learn and more more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people started by the mobile phones.</v>

202
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 1>We cannot have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot make all the factory,</v>

203
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>the mobile factories to cell phones to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them only they know the mobile phone</v>

204
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>really works helping change their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started by the mobile phones.</v>

205
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 4>Just one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think this will make</v>

206
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 4>the current problems like the current</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem in China?</v>

207
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is if we'll have more market</v>

208
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 4>information in the market will drive</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the investment goes instead of the</v>

209
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 4>government trying to make judgments</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

210
00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 4>I better build another housing</v>
<v Speaker 4>development or office development here,</v>

211
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 4>there and Yonder and you wound up with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble.</v>

212
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 4>What he comes from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it more likely that fewer bad things</v>

213
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:13.714
<v Speaker 4>will happen?</v>

214
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

215
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I think the last week I was in Seattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing about the China economy.</v>

216
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the you American people worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much about the China economy.</v>

217
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see</v>

218
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 1>every time where you start to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the China,</v>

219
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>China goes better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every channel you think China's problem,</v>

220
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you know we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll get better but we ain't got to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>gi.</v>

222
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a high expectation of China.</v>

223
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 1>China always a problem like a parents of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectation of the kids,</v>

224
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you know have the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between the</v>

225
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>American consumption because people say</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

226
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you know the economy's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So China consumption will be good.</v>

227
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Look no totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You American love to spin a tomorrow's</v>

228
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other people's money,</v>

229
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:09.361
<v Speaker 1>maybe all maybe the coolest money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Chinese love to safe money.</v>

230
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 1>We are probably the largest or country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the d safe deposit in the whole road.</v>

231
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>That will people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we'd been poor for so many years</v>

232
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>when we made money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting the banks because Sunday</v>

233
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>we know the disaster is coming so we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the money.</v>

234
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So when the economy's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have the money to spend.</v>

235
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You guys probably don't you worry.</v>

236
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And a second of thing at the China</v>
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>

237
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>China been focusing on developing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past 30 years.</v>

238
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>China government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sole Straw on investment.</v>

239
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>So Straw on exporting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're too weak on the domestic</v>

240
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>consumption's domestic consumption is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not driven by government,</v>

241
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>is driven by intrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven by the market,</v>

242
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 1>not the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the past two years,</v>

243
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>pastor to the years government is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong now they get a week.</v>

244
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's our opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our show time to see the market</v>

245
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.790
<v Speaker 1>cademy entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we can develop the real consumption.</v>

246
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if the China developed with a</v>

247
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:20.231
<v Speaker 1>great consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a 300 million middle class in</v>

248
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>next to 15 to 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a half below middle class.</v>

249
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.260
<v Speaker 1>We need to import a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we start to import,</v>

250
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to I,</v>

251
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I worry a lot when we export.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

252
00:15:33.991 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 1>when we export,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a terrible sky.</v>

253
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>We have a terrible water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a terrible work environment.</v>

254
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>When we started input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to be better.</v>

255
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's all the grid opportunity guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Happy about that.</v>

256
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>

257
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 4>We Orient Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

258
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 4>The reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it's worried about China as we</v>

259
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:04.480
<v Speaker 4>depend on you to buy our debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

260
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I tried to be more Chinese when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

261
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.060
<v Speaker 4>I saved a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

262
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted you to say that because</v>

263
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

264
00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:21.430
<v Speaker 4>I think you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The trend toward greater internal</v>

265
00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:26.431
<v Speaker 4>consumption is I think will remain</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbroken in spite of whatever the</v>

266
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:31.300
<v Speaker 4>difficulties are in the next few months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important not to overreact.</v>

267
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:35.800
<v Speaker 4>You can't break the trend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to clean up the land from</v>

268
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:37.990
<v Speaker 4>chemical contaminants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to clean up the air,</v>

269
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 4>you're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

270
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of Chinese will make a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money out of that will be a lot of great</v>

271
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:47.200
<v Speaker 4>new companies and there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities to import from other</v>

272
00:16:47.201 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.640
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you discuss your theory of what</v>

274
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:59.731
<v Speaker 4>you're doing and other things in terms</v>
<v Speaker 4>of whether it advances equal opportunity</v>

275
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:03.430
<v Speaker 4>in social solidarity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell him what you think's going to</v>

276
00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 4>happen and what other kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when your opening remarks,</v>

277
00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 4>you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

278
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.840
<v Speaker 4>technology is going to be active in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>way and other areas of the economy.</v>

279
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.180
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the next big</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities are?</v>

280
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.550
<v Speaker 4>But first tell him just in two sentences</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing.</v>

281
00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Cause Jack and I know when we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 4>been clear enough,</v>

282
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.310
<v Speaker 4>explain it and explain how you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that advances social solidarity and</v>

283
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.610
<v Speaker 4>equality of opportunity.</v>

284
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our work is in</v>

285
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.540
<v Speaker 5>the belief that access to health</v>
<v Speaker 5>information is a basic human right and</v>

286
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:46.050
<v Speaker 5>that lab information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly because lab data drives 70%</v>

287
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 5>of clinical decisions needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>accessible to people before they're</v>

288
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if you look at the word diagnose</v>

289
00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 5>in the dictionary today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says to determine the presence of</v>

290
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 5>disease from symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means by definition we're</v>

291
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 5>determining that people are sick once a</v>
<v Speaker 5>disease has already progressed.</v>

292
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.470
<v Speaker 5>And our work is in being able to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>lab testing accessible to people in time</v>

293
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.690
<v Speaker 5>for therapy to be affected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to do that in a way in which every</v>

294
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 5>person you're respective of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>insurance status,</v>

295
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 5>irrespective of where they live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can afford the ability to get a test</v>

296
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that means in our case,</v>

297
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:38.721
<v Speaker 5>we've invested the last 12 years in now</v>
<v Speaker 5>developing hundreds of tests,</v>

298
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 5>many of which are less than $10.</v>

299
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.120
<v Speaker 5>So in $2 tests in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the amazing things</v>

300
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 5>about this country is that we have such</v>
<v Speaker 5>an incredible</v>

301
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem for fueling creativity in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>creativity can create new markets.</v>

302
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 5>So in answer to your question about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>market being able to conform itself to</v>

303
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:07.230
<v Speaker 5>social good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the creativity that goes into</v>

304
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 5>creating new these new technologies</v>
<v Speaker 5>create new markets in and of themselves.</v>

305
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.950
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and our basic belief that is that those</v>

306
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 5>new markets come from empowering</v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals and in franchising</v>

307
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 5>individuals and trusting that</v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals have the capability to</v>

308
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:27.780
<v Speaker 5>engage with information and in accessing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that information,</v>

309
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 5>beginning to take control of their own</v>
<v Speaker 5>outcomes and their own health outcomes.</v>

310
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 5>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changing the way our healthcare system</v>

311
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:37.810
<v Speaker 5>works.</v>

312
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 4>I think what this could mean for rural</v>
<v Speaker 4>China.</v>

313
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For Rural India,</v>

314
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.630
<v Speaker 4>for native American reservations in</v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

315
00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:53.140
<v Speaker 4>for the Mississippi Delta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the remote area to where all the</v>

316
00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:56.560
<v Speaker 4>jobs for loss from cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all of a sudden giving people</v>

317
00:19:56.561 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 4>information and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most important things I think</v>

318
00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:05.821
<v Speaker 4>we did in my second term as president of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the healthcare front was developed as</v>

319
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Diabetes Self Care Program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of a sudden you could be Jack's</v>

320
00:20:11.591 --> 00:20:16.591
<v Speaker 4>company could be delivering the means to</v>
<v Speaker 4>self care based on your test.</v>

321
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that this is really,</v>

322
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.810
<v Speaker 4>this is a very big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all want to live as long and as well</v>

323
00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:24.970
<v Speaker 4>as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Greg Brenner was here.</v>

324
00:20:24.971 --> 00:20:29.500
<v Speaker 4>We were joking about whether we'd make</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to a hundred but in the meanwhile,</v>

325
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:31.540
<v Speaker 4>do you want to keep people healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they're sick,</v>

326
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:33.280
<v Speaker 4>you went to intervene early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not late.</v>

327
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.780
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

328
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.250
<v Speaker 5>and if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the ability to engage with this</v>

329
00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:40.780
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a $4 trillion health care</v>

330
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:45.100
<v Speaker 5>problem in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>20% of it is type two diabetes,</v>

331
00:20:45.101 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 5>which is reversible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we 90 million Americans who do not</v>

332
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 5>know they are prediabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but access to information and the</v>

333
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 5>ability to engage with that information</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the foundation for being able to</v>

334
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:00.690
<v Speaker 5>change those outcomes and costs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

335
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.050
<v Speaker 1>One more factor then I want to call it</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

336
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you founded this company 12 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

337
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell him how old you are.</v>

338
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.443
<v Speaker 1>I was 19</v>

339
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.723
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

340
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.330
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in good hands and that was think</v>

341
00:21:20.331 --> 00:21:23.640
<v Speaker 1>of a new [inaudible] water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am nine tab?</v>

342
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Not The past examination for university</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

343
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I felt a three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it worked out.</v>

344
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at schooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

345
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I give confidence to a lot of</v>

346
00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:38.010
<v Speaker 1>young people in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Jack Ma Can,</v>

347
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.970
<v Speaker 1>success can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of the people can be successful.</v>

348
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.650
<v Speaker 3>People like hurry up with jealous.</v>

349
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>

350
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I would like to make a lot of technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping you because yesterday I was</v>

351
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:57.541
<v Speaker 1>joining the United a u n a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference about gender equality and I</v>

352
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 1>think the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology revolution happened 200</v>

353
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>years ago in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Release the human body,</v>

354
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.210
<v Speaker 1>the arm stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second the technology revolution</v>

355
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 1>that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the u s if our advantage you can last</v>

356
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this technology of revolution relief</v>

357
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 1>release the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this century is not a competition.</v>

358
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Who's strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's muscles stronger is who is a</v>

359
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's soft,</v>

360
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 1>who can listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the challenge of a wisdom.</v>

361
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 1>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are equal on the Internet.</v>

362
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>You can never see his a woman or man on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>

363
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Women can serve much better than the men</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet and a man talking about</v>

364
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

365
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

366
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nic business,</v>

367
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>very code women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make business a very cozy</v>

368
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.960
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% more than 50% of our shop owners,</v>

369
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 1>while they half 5 million shop owners</v>
<v Speaker 1>are women.</v>

370
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And people love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is,</v>

371
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 1>this is a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that this century,</v>

372
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880
<v Speaker 1>we see more and more women leaders on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state leaders and the presidents in</v>

373
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to general receptor of</v>

374
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 1>United Nations should be a woman leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this is the greatest century for</v>

375
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

376
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel excited about that.</v>

377
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you that.</v>

378
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.070
<v Speaker 1>We're almost out of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that we haven't</v>

379
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.860
<v Speaker 1>talked enough about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just here,</v>

380
00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but generally is whether the leap</v>
<v Speaker 1>frogging we saw</v>

381
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.450
<v Speaker 1>with cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was instrumental in your</v>

382
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.780
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal business success and which</v>
<v Speaker 1>will make it possible for you at the</v>

383
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 4>appropriate time to do what you've done</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a global scale hitherto unimaginable</v>

384
00:23:51.241 --> 00:23:54.750
<v Speaker 4>and all of human history for anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any of their own health data.</v>

385
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 4>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've seen examples but not the kind of</v>

386
00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:07.401
<v Speaker 4>dramatic penetration we need with energy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and clean energy and enough and in short</v>

387
00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:13.110
<v Speaker 4>enough time to avoid the worst</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of climate change.</v>

388
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.060
<v Speaker 4>So do you believe</v>

389
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.623
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

390
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean your country has done more than</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else to try to put up solar</v>

391
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 4>panels and some of your companies went</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke because you overdid it,</v>

392
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But beforehand and you got to work out</v>

393
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 4>the phase out of the coal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the phases of the sun and all that.</v>

394
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa,</v>

395
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 4>which is growing like crazy because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cell phone and no small measure.</v>

396
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.460
<v Speaker 4>And as six of the fastest growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries in the world still has vast</v>

397
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 4>swath of its land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally dark at night.</v>

398
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe</v>

399
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.850
<v Speaker 4>that it's possible for us to scale up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with distributed solar power is rather</v>

400
00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:59.320
<v Speaker 4>than central lives as quickly as we did</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the cell phone?</v>

401
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.540
<v Speaker 4>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if that were your business,</v>

402
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:04.150
<v Speaker 4>if you had to quit what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>today and start there,</v>

403
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.220
<v Speaker 4>how would you do it and how would you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

404
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Did he at first I know that,</v>

405
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.331
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

406
00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:20.331
<v Speaker 5>I'm such a huge believer in technology</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think especially right now we're</v>

407
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:24.420
<v Speaker 5>at an incredible time in terms of new</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology and the ability to apply</v>

408
00:25:24.421 --> 00:25:28.230
<v Speaker 5>technology in a scalable way towards</v>
<v Speaker 5>solving some of these problems.</v>

409
00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:32.340
<v Speaker 5>So I would look at it in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the renewable solutions that we</v>

410
00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:35.370
<v Speaker 5>already have and in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 5>empowering,</v>

411
00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:39.330
<v Speaker 5>connecting individuals with access to</v>
<v Speaker 5>those solutions and in the context of</v>

412
00:25:39.331 --> 00:25:44.190
<v Speaker 5>creating markets around them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's real opportunity to</v>

413
00:25:44.191 --> 00:25:48.420
<v Speaker 5>actually create an ecosystem in which</v>
<v Speaker 5>people can financially benefit from</v>

414
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:51.000
<v Speaker 5>these solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's going to drive an</v>

415
00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:53.100
<v Speaker 5>adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in developing economies there's</v>

416
00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:57.870
<v Speaker 5>a revenue stream associated with that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the more we can turn even already</v>

417
00:25:57.871 --> 00:26:00.570
<v Speaker 5>some of the technologies that we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>into markets,</v>

418
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.200
<v Speaker 5>the more that we can fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe local growth and individual</v>

419
00:26:04.201 --> 00:26:07.470
<v Speaker 5>engagement in in beginning to adopt some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these solutions.</v>

420
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Just related to that would be Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you answer it and then I'll ask you one</v>

421
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:13.260
<v Speaker 4>final.</v>

422
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a strong believer that technology</v>

423
00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:19.600
<v Speaker 1>can make war much better because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>say China economists getting slower,</v>

424
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy about a 7% even 5% even 5% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the GDP of the number of chain of the</v>

425
00:26:26.591 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Speaker 1>second large economy is big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yet you don't expect China keep on</v>

426
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:36.161
<v Speaker 1>growing 11% cause like one body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one human body where your 1.8 meters</v>

427
00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 1>tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot keep all like a 10% growth</v>

428
00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:41.320
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to grow the quality,</v>

429
00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:42.460
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom.</v>

430
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.900
<v Speaker 1>So I think China needs new technologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve this problems and which today</v>

431
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

432
00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clean technology,</v>

433
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 1>all these things that China is supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

434
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 1>If we keep on the tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old ways,</v>

435
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.290
<v Speaker 1>we're going nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I feel excited because</v>

436
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>people asking you what is your dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

437
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Cause I never thought I would be today.</v>

438
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I can sit here talking to president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a guy you know,</v>

439
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 1>on the street and like filled of three</v>
<v Speaker 1>times for university,</v>

440
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 1>five times four h for high key schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I applied for 10 times and Harvard</v>

441
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:24.160
<v Speaker 1>school or rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought because of the tech and</v>

442
00:27:24.161 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 1>large because the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it give me this opportunity.</v>

443
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'm think when I retire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want,</v>

444
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:35.601
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese people have a terrible water</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drink and it's safe for food and the</v>

445
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 1>money we make all spend in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's disaster.</v>

446
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.650
<v Speaker 1>So how we can use in the technology to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enable young people the greater chance</v>

447
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 1>of this road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about.</v>

448
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.970
<v Speaker 1>We got to 1.4 billion people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>born in 1980s they are the people of the</v>

449
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Internet Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are going to have new ways to solve</v>

450
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:01.290
<v Speaker 1>the word problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things you're worried about today,</v>

451
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 1>they can solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a human being have the these kind of</v>

452
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:07.030
<v Speaker 1>worries for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

453
00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 1>young people can always solve it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>today when you have the right direction,</v>

454
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 1>cling encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

456
00:28:13.211 --> 00:28:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these issues they will be solved and</v>

457
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 1>these are the great opportunities ahead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>

458
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.753
<v Speaker 3>Anything else?</v>

459
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the more,</v>

460
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.660
<v Speaker 5>the more we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more we can in franchise people,</v>

461
00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:36.500
<v Speaker 5>the more we can create ecosystems in</v>
<v Speaker 5>which individuals are empowered,</v>

462
00:28:36.501 --> 00:28:40.250
<v Speaker 5>the more we give rights to individuals</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be able to build businesses,</v>

463
00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:43.520
<v Speaker 5>to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pursue the economic benefit of</v>

464
00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:46.250
<v Speaker 5>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more you see these markets change</v>

465
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 1>before they leave the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look at them</v>

466
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.760
<v Speaker 1>and I want you to think about the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have had to spend here</v>

467
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the refugee problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria and Lebanon.</v>

468
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellis,</v>

469
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.790
<v Speaker 1>this is my friend Elliot Musafa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the education minister in Lebanon.</v>

470
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got to educate all these kids</v>

471
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

472
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>so he left a miracle that very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects the lives that Elizabeth and</v>

473
00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Jack have lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was</v>

474
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>in a very responsible position at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American of Dubai.</v>

475
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.280
<v Speaker 4>They started bringing American scholars</v>
<v Speaker 4>over there to live in and and Arabic</v>

476
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:52.290
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did all these wonderful things.</v>

477
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 4>Lebanon got in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went home to save his country.</v>

478
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.920
<v Speaker 4>What is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much more could he in every smart</v>

479
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:04.921
<v Speaker 4>Lebanese person do if they could focus</v>
<v Speaker 4>on these things and why can he not?</v>

480
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 4>Because the place is dominated by people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who think their differences are more</v>

481
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 4>important than their common humanity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>our common challenges.</v>

482
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.530
<v Speaker 4>You cannot imagine</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack Miles proud of being Chinese.</v>

483
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never hit it.</v>

484
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's happy about it and the proud to be</v>

485
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:32.611
<v Speaker 4>a global citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I imagine Elizabeth's proud to be a</v>

486
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.880
<v Speaker 4>blonde haired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blue eyed American tech.</v>

487
00:30:38.881 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's the northern California?</v>

488
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

489
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a word either.</v>

490
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 4>One of them is sad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has defined the meaning of their lives.</v>

491
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Are the direction of their work with</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative reference to someone else.</v>

492
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.650
<v Speaker 4>My friend Dikembe Mutombo stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

493
00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll hurt too much.</v>

494
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.340
<v Speaker 4>You're an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My seven foot two or it's fall friend</v>

495
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.020
<v Speaker 4>was just inducted into the National</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basketball Association Hall of fame</v>

496
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.733
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

497
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.430
<v Speaker 4>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole family loves him and I have</v>

498
00:31:28.591 --> 00:31:32.070
<v Speaker 4>seen how much he has given back to his</v>
<v Speaker 4>native country Congo,</v>

499
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.460
<v Speaker 4>which has been sold troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've known him a long time.</v>

500
00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:42.870
<v Speaker 4>We both went to Georgetown University.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did before he was born.</v>

501
00:31:42.871 --> 00:31:47.871
<v Speaker 4>I think I've never heard him say a</v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful thing about anybody.</v>

502
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.910
<v Speaker 4>I have seen him give and give and give</v>
<v Speaker 4>and try to give the people in his native</v>

503
00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:58.911
<v Speaker 4>land opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I telling you this?</v>

504
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 4>He's had a good life because he never</v>
<v Speaker 4>defined his life with negative reference</v>

505
00:32:07.241 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>to anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never begrudge anybody else's success</v>

506
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 4>and he thought he had an obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 4>help other people.</v>

507
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>

508
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 4>we are back in a time of collective</v>
<v Speaker 4>global insecurity</v>

509
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.783
<v Speaker 3>where</v>

510
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:30.980
<v Speaker 4>the main struggle is the oldest one in</v>
<v Speaker 4>human history.</v>

511
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Just in modern techno realities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you were trying to build the</v>

512
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would think about our permanent</v>

513
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 4>sponsor here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ambassador from Oman who tried to,</v>

514
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.850
<v Speaker 4>her government tried to help head off a</v>
<v Speaker 4>calamitous war in the Middle East over</v>

515
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:55.910
<v Speaker 4>the nuclear issue in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all pray to God that it will work</v>

516
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.110
<v Speaker 3>and the lady she made you look around</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these places,</v>

517
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:04.840
<v Speaker 3>wherever</v>

518
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.660
<v Speaker 4>people are putting aside their</v>
<v Speaker 4>differences and working together,</v>

519
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.390
<v Speaker 4>good things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We cannot achieve economic or social</v>

520
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 4>equality without living in the factual</v>
<v Speaker 4>realities of the world.</v>

521
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 4>We face looking at the obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the opportunities,</v>

522
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:28.090
<v Speaker 4>making the best decisions and those of</v>
<v Speaker 4>us who even feel good about ourselves</v>

523
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 4>because we think we spend a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving.</v>

524
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 4>Our whole goal should be to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves out of a job.</v>

525
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.780
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that the bill and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tammy Austin it or sitting there with</v>

526
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 4>stark and they started giving away</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing aids and then they decided,</v>

527
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.420
<v Speaker 4>well we better teach these young people</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to speak.</v>

528
00:33:49.421 --> 00:33:52.540
<v Speaker 4>It's I get the gift of hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll have to learn that.</v>

529
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:57.541
<v Speaker 4>So they got into the education distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sani Barky got into the education</v>

530
00:33:57.991 --> 00:34:02.100
<v Speaker 4>business and started somebody ought to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do something really dramatic to remind</v>

531
00:34:02.101 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 4>people that the only people that really</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter,</v>

532
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.440
<v Speaker 4>the teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he gave the first global teacher of</v>

533
00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:12.090
<v Speaker 4>the year award last year and an</v>
<v Speaker 4>international panel gave the prize to a</v>

534
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:16.050
<v Speaker 4>teacher from Maine who probably gave the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire million dollars to her school</v>

535
00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.660
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never made any money in her life.</v>

536
00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:19.860
<v Speaker 4>She gave all the money away</v>

537
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.223
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

538
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:27.030
<v Speaker 4>The future's going to be forged by</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who think of how to use the</v>

539
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:32.031
<v Speaker 4>modern tools that we're given</v>
<v Speaker 4>as Elizabeth and Jack have to create</v>

540
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:42.581
<v Speaker 4>opportunity through empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it will not be a straight line.</v>

541
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:46.610
<v Speaker 4>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too many moving parts.</v>

542
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 4>But I just want you to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason you feel good looking at them</v>

543
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.950
<v Speaker 4>and that you identify with them even</v>
<v Speaker 4>though they're different from you.</v>

544
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's basically where we are all</v>
<v Speaker 4>over again and we can't slip back.</v>

545
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:06.950
<v Speaker 4>We can't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we had the prime minister of</v>

546
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Italy and George Soros talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future of Europe.</v>

547
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 4>And George said it was coming apart and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the prime minister said,</v>

548
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have to come apart if it's</v>

549
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 4>about something more than economics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it doesn't have to come apart</v>

550
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It not to,</v>

551
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.740
<v Speaker 4>and you put yourself on the line for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are no guaranteed outcomes today,</v>

552
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 4>but you can guarantee that the trend is</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

553
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.350
<v Speaker 4>So go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were gonna say something origin.</v>

554
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

555
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about the future and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my own experience</v>

556
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 5>and looking at all the faces here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a huge part of the answer to</v>

557
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 5>your question is also to raise our</v>
<v Speaker 5>little girls with the stereotype that</v>

558
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 5>they can be the best in engineering and</v>
<v Speaker 5>science and math because when they do,</v>

559
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 5>in all of these industries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it changes everything.</v>

560
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.173
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

561
00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 6>we need to do that in this country and</v>
<v Speaker 6>we need to do that as parents in other</v>

562
00:35:59.471 --> 00:36:00.304
<v Speaker 6>countries.</v>

563
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about if,</v>

564
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say,</v>

565
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

566
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the problems you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally is like a politician.</v>

567
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about the opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the business people,</v>

568
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about how we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using this,</v>

569
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 1>all the problems that change the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the opportunity.</v>

570
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.340
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

571
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel excited when people talk</v>

572
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 1>about problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's thing about if you can</v>

573
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.170
<v Speaker 1>solve one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the chance.</v>

574
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And today nobody in live in this century</v>
<v Speaker 1>has so many opportunities and so many</v>

575
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 1>tools they can use the change other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

576
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last century,</v>
