1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,310
In what you've done with your life thus
far?

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,960
Is it giving you what you want?
Is it giving you what you want?

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,830
When you look toward the future,
when you look at all this boring on out

4
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,560
here,
is there some place within yourself you

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,610
say,
Hey,

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,340
I know I need to be out there and not
arena.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,560
I know I can do more than what I've been
doing.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,070
I know there's some great music that I
have within me that I haven't brought

9
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:30,180
out here cause that's something that you
began to look at within yourself.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,740
See,
I saved you.

11
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:36,300
Look at your life and if and if you're
not getting what you want,

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,010
you owe it to yourself to do something
differently.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,260
You are.
If you're on a job,

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,140
85% they say of Americans,
go to jobs,

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,100
but they're unhappy.
If you're doing something eight hours a

16
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,970
day that you don't like,
it's not giving you what you want is not

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,330
giving you a strong feeling of
satisfaction and fulfillment.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,480
You're miserable.
You hate to go there,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,610
you're depressed just thinking about it.
You're saying the thank God it's Friday

20
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,370
song every week.
If that's what it is,

21
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,360
you are to your staff to start
strategically working to change

22
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,180
directions.
See,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,080
but you know what most people do?
Most people will resist change.

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
Most people will fight change as if
change would be worse than what they're

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,510
experiencing.
See,

26
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,970
they know this.
They're familiar with this.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,320
Most people will not challenge the
unknown.

28
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,820
They won't just step off there.
See they,

29
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,060
well see there are certain things has
got to be in place.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,080
They got to see it all together and life
isn't like that.

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,280
That's not how you grow.
So as you look at your life,

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,740
you're saying,
I'm not getting one.

33
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:54,000
I want.
As you begin to look toward the future,

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,070
begin to know that whatever it takes for
you to create that,

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,110
you've got that in you.

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,930
If you've got that,
you've got genius in you,

37
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,740
you've got goodness in you,
you got creativeness in you.

38
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,890
If you decide to take the initiative to
change the current quality of your life,

39
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,140
I say to you that you will find that the
universe is on your side,

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,070
that life is on your side,
not.

41
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,600
Will it be turbulent?
Yes.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,520
Would it be easy?
No.

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,100
No.
We have some opposition.

44
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,410
Yes.
Will I make a lot of mistakes?

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,990
Yes.
Will I get hurt?

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,260
Yes.
Yes.

47
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,930
See,
a lot of people won't try anything

48
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,660
different in life because they don't
want to get hurt.

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,980
Let me tell you something.
It's too much pain to doc.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,840
Pain is everywhere.
You can hide under here.

51
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,690
It will come where you are.
It's everywhere.

52
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,360
Viktor Frankl cause it unavoidable.
Suffering kept,

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,940
but most people spend their life not
wanting to deal with the pain of

54
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,400
rejection.
The pain of defeat,

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,670
the pain of being disappointed,
the pain of losing,

56
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,190
the pain of failure,
the pain of being criticized,

57
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,320
the pain of not being locked,
the pain,

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,400
the pain,
the pain.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,580
That's called life.
Life is don't pay this everywhere,

60
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,390
but that's why there is no gain without
pain

61
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,390
because it's the pain of regret.
That's your experience.

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,470
If I had it to do over again,
that's a pain.

63
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,060
Don't you know that something when you
know,

64
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,270
I was in a seminar once and this lady
stood up if I had my life to live over

65
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:45,390
again,
she talked about all of the things that

66
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,810
she would do and you can feel the pain
of regret,

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,390
regret.
She was still experiencing.

68
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,820
She was trying not to experience the
pain of defeat,

69
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,530
the pain of disappointment,
the pain of loss.

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,990
Okay?

71
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,490
The pain of lack of support

72
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,280
and she's still experienced pain.
It was right there.

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,400
We can't get around it.

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,120
Most people are governed by their
habits,

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,200
the fears and the opinions of others.
A lot of people never try anything

76
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:26,651
differently because they have been
convinced by people in their lives that

77
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,240
they value.
That'd be can't do it.

78
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,040
They're living within the context of the
opinions that other people have of then

79
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,730
the low expectations.
Many people doubt themselves because

80
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,160
when they thought about doing something
at some critical point in the life of

81
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,000
somebody they respected and honored
somebody,

82
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,250
they believed them,
somebody that they loved,

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,170
someone they trusted,
said,

84
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,250
you can't do that,
and they accepted that.

85
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,860
As you look at your life,
ask yourself the question,

86
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,680
what would your life be like?
What would your life look like if you

87
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,830
decided not to care what people thought
of you?

88
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,000
What would your life be like if you
decided to give up some of your fears?

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,900
What would your life be like if you
decided to become courageous?

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,180
What would your life be like if you
decided to act on your dream?

91
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:32,600
If you did what you felt in your heart?
You know what courageous means?

92
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,050
Tom Ruskin and randy reads that this had
that courage comes from a French word,

93
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,730
which means of the heart.

94
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,840
How does it feel to you?
He says,

95
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:49,330
it's college.
You know it takes courage to lear says

96
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:54,331
most people go through life not allowing
themselves to step out because they

97
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,970
don't want to let go.
They don't want to be blown around.

98
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:02,090
They don't want to be moved.
The courage to face of lice,

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,440
whirling win of contradictions,
but courage to love yourself.

100
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,860
The courage to love that.
For years I was afraid to long the

101
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,730
courage to take a chance,
the courage to be who you are.

102
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,360
He says,
courage isn't for somebody else.

103
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,410
For metals.
Applause,

104
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:27,040
a moral depth.
Courage is what at that moment feels

105
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,090
most right for you.
Not just situational ethics,

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,100
but what feels right in your heart.
The word alcohol,

107
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,610
what feels right in your heart?
One great philosopher says,

108
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,130
car what's die?
Many times before their deaths,

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,130
the valiant never taste of death,
but once.

110
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,590
What does that be in the valley?
And people aren't afraid.

111
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,071
No,
no,

112
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:51,700
no.
It means that they experienced that here

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,150
and they move forward and move forward.
Any harm?

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,500
Many people are dead.
Not many people along their dreams to

115
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,560
die.
Many people applying the ideas,

116
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,600
delight,
Dorma and collect dust.

117
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Many people have all this talent and
ability that they align to be embedded

118
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,580
inside of them,
that they will take with them to their

119
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:16,270
graves because they didn't have the
courage to be who they are.

120
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,400
And I say as you begin to look toward
the future and manifesting your

121
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:25,270
greatness,
it's going to take everything in you,

122
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,660
everything in you that your life
deserves.

123
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:32,320
The concentrated effort to begin to look
at.

124
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:37,321
How is it that I can express more of me?
How is it that I can bring my ideas out

125
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:39,214
here?
Now,

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,830
how is it and start living with a sense
of urgency?

127
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,070
Because you're here today.
You're gone today.

128
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,470
Life is unpredictable.
It's uncertain.

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,400
There are no guarantees,
no guarantees out here at all.

130
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,920
So holding back,
what are you waiting on?

131
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,530
Ask Yourself,
what's the benefit of your waiting?

132
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,650
What's the benefit of you're not living
your dream?

133
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,440
What's the benefit of not listening to
yourself?

134
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,770
Oh,
please listen to yourself.

135
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,850
You know the feelings that you started
listening to the feelings in your heart,

136
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,680
and I'm doing it now more everyday.

137
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,950
I find that my feelings,
I can trust them.

138
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,750
And I say to you
that as you look toward the future,

139
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,540
you look at life on a daily basis.
If there's something that you had been

140
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,450
given,
if you've heard something within

141
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,000
yourself that you know that what you're
doing now,

142
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,800
it doesn't fit you.
It doesn't work for you.

143
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:36,520
It's not giving you what you want and
there's something else that you want to

144
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:40,000
do.
Don't allow that inner doubt in you to

145
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,920
talk you out of it.
The bill,

146
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:46,030
a case on why you can't have it,
to tell you why you're not good enough.

147
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,170
You ignore that inner voice and all of
the external voices.

148
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,100
Don't judge the possibilities,
but what you can do based upon the

149
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,820
circumstances,
because the circumstances won't

150
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,850
determine who you are.
Don't determine what you're able to do

151
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,810
based upon your resources,
won't determine what's possible for you

152
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,730
based upon where your life is right now,
where your life is right now.

153
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,910
It's not you.
That's just what it is right now,

154
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,240
but the possibilities for you are
unlimited.

155
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,140
If you're in a rebuilding process,
it's unlimited.

156
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,720
If you're coming back from adversity and
devastation,

157
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,080
it's unlimited of what you can do.
That's the capacity of human beings.

158
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,920
It doesn't matter how many mistakes
you've made.

159
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,260
It doesn't matter how many flops you've
had,

160
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,840
doesn't matter how much money you've
lost.

161
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,120
In fact,
I see it only as an investment.

162
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,970
What you learned from life,
not losses,

163
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,880
but investments of what's possible for
you.

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,480
And I say to you that once you start
listening to yourself and as you begin

165
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,170
to act on your dream,
as you start just trying to find your

166
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,550
way,
doing what you can,

167
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,110
what you have,
you will start seeing things opening up

168
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,030
for you.
Started tracking people.

169
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,380
You say,
where'd it come from?

170
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,310
Things will start coming together.

171
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,290
Clicking for you.
You say,

172
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,000
whoa.
You start brainstorming.

173
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,940
Ideas will come out of nowhere as you
focus on it.

174
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,230
The key to it is to begin to focus on
what it is you want to do.

175
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,771
Why?
Let's,

176
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:17,130
why is that important?
Because as you focus on that which you

177
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,870
want to do,
that which we focus on,

178
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,040
that which we give out energy to,
it will begin to multiply.

179
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,340
It will began to expand.
It will begin to develop your

180
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,100
consciousness and out of that comes your
greatness.

181
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,610
Out of that comes a commitment.
Out of that comes a passion for life.

182
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,630
Out of that calm they special power that
you have in you that you haven't even

183
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,280
called on yet.
See,

184
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,400
the powers that we have will never
reveal themselves if we don't challenge

185
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:45,870
them.
If we don't put ourselves in the

186
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,480
position where we have to use them.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,020
So one of the most important things is
reading a book that's a really

188
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,240
interesting book called instant
millionaire.

189
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,630
And the guy said,
put yourself in a position where you

190
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:02,631
can't retreat where it's do or die sake
or swell.

191
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,470
Here's what you'll find out.
You're developing credible swimming

192
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:10,590
skills.
You'll find yourself struggling unlike

193
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:14,850
you've ever seen before.
Through the inspiration of desperation,

194
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,280
you'll become more creative than ever
before.

195
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,160
So what is it?
How do we handle that whole piece?

196
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
Throw your whole self into it.
See,

197
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:26,490
most people go at it tentatively,
they don't give all their stuff.

198
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,880
They don't concentrate,
they don't put everything they've got in

199
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,200
them.
One Guy wrote a book called,

200
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,380
all you can do is all you can do and all
you can do if he know.

201
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,880
But he said,
make sure you do all you can do.

202
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,710
And if we're honest this evening,
we know that we haven't done all we can

203
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,660
do.
So as we look at the future,

204
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,360
we can decide that from this day
forward.

205
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,270
As I look at my personal relationships,
if I look at my professional

206
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,850
relationships,
if I look at my family relationships,

207
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,040
if I look at all the dimensions of my
life,

208
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,140
looking at myself mentally,
emotionally,

209
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:06,970
and spiritually,
I'm going to do all I can do to develop

210
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,040
me,
to bring my talent out here,

211
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,230
to make a contribution to life.
