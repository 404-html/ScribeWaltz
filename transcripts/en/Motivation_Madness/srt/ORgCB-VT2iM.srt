1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,040
You're doing something for willingly
is the fundamental of huge joy,

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,993
isn't it?

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,653
Hello.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,880
However simpler, stupid, or
you'd your Dick Activity. It is.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,620
I'm doing something willingly makes
a world of difference, isn't it? So

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,083
hello,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,660
the difference between
Heaven and Hell is just this.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,080
You are doing something
willingly that you're having.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,720
You're doing something unwillingly.
That's your hell.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,640
We are already taken on attitudes.
What we like and what we don't like.

11
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:50,270
I like this person. I don't like
this person. Now with this person,

12
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:53,540
I will do things willingly with this
person. I'll do things, honey unwillingly.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,980
This maybe two people,
two aspects of life to communities,

14
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,990
to nations,
too many things.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,190
This I will willingly
this I do unwillingly.

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,240
This means I've decided in my
mind this is good. This is bad.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,410
When I hear even in
national news channels,

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,750
good guys and bad guys.

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,200
Once you have this kind of thing, you
are going to be disastrous to the planet.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,490
It's just a question of time.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,440
The moment you decide this is a
good person, this is a bad person.

22
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,770
This has gone deep into American society.
No,

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,890
there are no good people and bad people.

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,140
Everybody's oscillating between the two.
If you create a wedding, a pleasant,

25
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,170
wonderful atmosphere,
everybody behaves wonderfully.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,480
If you create an unpleasant atmosphere,

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,020
a whole lot of people agnostic this no,

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,430
there are joyful people
and miserable people,

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,710
but there are no good
people and bad people

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,080
[inaudible]

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,020
the moment we think we are good,

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,400
we are entitled to
destroy the bad isn't it?

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,840
Well we've been destroying a
lot of people for a long time.

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Time to stop typing because human beings
had in different levels of experience

35
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,324
and understanding

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,240
that idea of people.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,480
Anybody who is not like you
is obviously bad, isn't it?

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,450
Isn't it? So those are not
like me. Must be bad people

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,130
because the basis of goodness and what
you think his goodness is decided by you.

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,340
No, you have no business to
do that. Willing means this.

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,780
I am just willing, um, 100% yes to life.

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,450
I am not yes to this
one, not to this one. No.

43
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm just yes and yes to life.

44
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,960
If you are 100% a yes to life,
you're a woman tier.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,740
You have a big,
I'm a will in life.

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,940
You have become sure willing that
you have no will of your own.

47
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,690
People ask me Sadhguru,
how do you operate with all these people?

48
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,080
All kinds of horrible questions.
They're asking, they're doing this,

49
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:26,460
they're doing that. I said,
my life is not about them.

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,700
It's about me.
It's about how I am.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,320
It's about me. It doesn't matter
how they are, that's their choice,

52
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,490
but how Ireland is my choice.
This is my way.

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,560
No matter what they do.

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,010
I'm like this because I have not given
the freedom to anybody that somebody can

55
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:49,870
freak me, somebody can make me
angry, somebody can make me happy,

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,580
somebody can make me unhappy.
These privileges I kept to myself

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,850
each time you do the too because if
somebody else can decide what can happen

58
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:05,230
within you right now, he's in
this the ultimate slavery, Huh?

59
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,220
Isn't this someone else can decide
what should happen within you.

60
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,910
What happens around you? Of
course him. So many people decide

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,180
what happens around us is not 100% ours,
but what happens within me

62
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,400
lesbian,
my making,

63
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,460
isn't it right now just about anybody
can freak anybody because they're not

64
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,140
volunteers.
They're unwilling.

65
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,700
Wallen tiering means you
have no will of your own.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,810
You can do whatever is needed.
You know we are a volunteer organization.

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,060
This means that all kinds of people,

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,810
most of them are not qualified
for the jobs that they're doing

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,960
and I cannot find them
because they're all in tears.

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,193
So people

71
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,990
coming up to me on a daily basis. I said,
Google, I can't work with this person.

72
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:08,550
She's so horrible. I gone
do it. I tell them, see,

73
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:13,410
in this world, this is the sort
of people who exist like this,

74
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:18,350
like this, like this, like this.
That's the kind of people that are not.

75
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,330
If you want to work with ideal people,

76
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,370
you must go to heaven

77
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,050
today,

78
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,270
but if you think what you're
doing is very significant,

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,000
you must learn to work with all these
horrible people you saw the world is.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,790
If you think what you're
doing is very significant,

81
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,510
you learn to work with all kinds of
people. You will see hardly will.

82
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,980
People will do wonderful things.
Yes,

83
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,260
but if you want to work with ideal people,
you won't find any.

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,490
I haven't one yet.
No.

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,080
All kinds of mixed bags.

86
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,620
But if you are willing that you
are not yes and no as to one north,

87
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,540
one of the use, simply one
big ass, you will find a way.
