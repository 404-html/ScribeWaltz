1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,120
A person's strengths are often their
biggest weaknesses into.

2
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:21,321
That also means that their weaknesses
can be their strengths.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,060
I am weak in all those ways that I
listed.

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,310
I am,
but I don't accept that.

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,320
I don't accept that I am what I am and
that that

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,220
is what I'm doing to be no,
I don't accept that.

7
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm fighting,
always fighting.

8
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:00,610
I'm struggling and I'm so hot.
Wrapping him,

9
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,630
kicking and clawing at those weaknesses,
the cheap stock though,

10
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,130
some days I win,
some days I don't,

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,970
but each and every day I'd get back up
and I move forward

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,750
with my fist clench toward the battle
toward the struggle.

13
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,540
Hey,
this temporary,

14
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
it may last for a minute or an hour or
day or even a year.

15
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,400
What?
Eventually it will subside

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,160
and something else will take its place.
If I quit,

17
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:04,161
however it will last forever.
I go dot.

18
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,240
Because you feel in the loop,
hey,

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,660
at the end of pain,
a success,

20
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,890
I fight with everything.
I've got to overcome those weaknesses

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,980
and those shortfalls and those flaws
as I strive to be just a little bit

22
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:34,731
better today
than I was yesterday.

23
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,060
You got the best two jobs in your life,
you've got your dream job would.

24
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,460
This is only the beginning.
This is nothing here.

25
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,340
This is not where I want you to be for
the rest of your life.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,280
Hey

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,310
is temporary.
I've been trying to get that into your

28
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,900
spirit.
I've been trying to get you to

29
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,100
celebrate.
Hey,

30
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,560
are you hear me?
I'm trying to get you to have an

31
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,670
understanding that hey is your friend.
The pain is going to take them to the

32
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,671
next level.
It's not your circumstances or your

33
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,290
seat,
your whites,

34
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,120
it that determines if you're going to be
successful up.

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,330
I've been telling you what's your
mindset?

36
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,973
Okay?

37
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,130
Totally.
You want to pay.

38
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,980
I'm not what you feel it.
I know exactly what I've been there.

39
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,290
I've done that,
but you gotta work through it.

40
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,960
Well,
on the other side is the reward.

41
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,500
Listen to me.
Hey,

42
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,501
they permanent,
no pain,

43
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,590
a permanent.
You can get through this.

44
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,880
You're wiggling your pack.
I use the pay to push me to greatness

45
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,630
and I'm telling you right now,
don't give up.

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,730
I'm telling you right now,
don't get me.

47
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,770
Get through it.
And if you can get through it,

48
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,570
if you can work through your pay,
if you can work through your pay,

49
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,990
I'm guaranteeing you on the other side.
I've got to commit my very being to this

50
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:39,990
thing.
I gotta,

51
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,970
I gotta breathe it.
I got to eat it.

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,130
I got sleep sweeper and until you get
there,

53
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,240
you'll never be successful in life.
Well,

54
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,320
once you get there,
I guarantee the world is yours.

55
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,390
Once you make yourself one single
mom,

56
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,880
it's too self ever.
Then you can go watch your life become

57
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,470
you actually want it to be.
Because the very best for human beings

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,430
is one that lives in the line.
Your thoughts,

59
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
your words and your actions all as one.
Yeah.

60
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,950
Not One day saying one thing and then
off the next stage,

61
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:45,951
doing something else.
Thinking and wishing so badly that you

62
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:50,770
could have something for them only to
give up on yourself before you even

63
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,910
tried.
Plus you have to hope that good things

64
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,500
will happen to you when you cannot trust
yourself.

65
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,410
You can't rely on your own capabilities
and the fact that you will show up and

66
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:06,410
do what you said you would.
Of course you're going to rely on luck

67
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,520
and chance.
But if you build up your belief in

68
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,490
yourself,
keeping the promises that you make to

69
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,220
you,
your life will change instantly.

70
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,870
I'm not talking about an agreement that
you made with somebody else.

71
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:25,871
I'm love talking about a contract
and we don't need anybody expecting you

72
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,930
to keep your word for somebody else
until you have done it for you.

73
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,070
Why should anyone else ever believe in
you?

74
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,710
Why should anyone else ever trust in
you?

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
If you cannot trust your son?
See the moment that you actually start

76
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,090
doing the things that you said you
would,

77
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,440
the moment you start actually acting on
your ideas is the moment your life

78
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,380
changes flow ever.
It's the moment where you access to

79
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,200
power them.
Most people never experience in their

80
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:01,970
lifetime.
You gained the power to make anything

81
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,970
that you want.
Anything that you dream of become

82
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,460
reality.
Because when you follow up your

83
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,610
thoughts,
when you follow up a dream with real

84
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:14,060
action,
well then nothing can stop you.

85
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,650
Nothing can get in your way.

86
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,830
Nothing can really take you from your
goal and absolutely nobody can take away

87
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:26,030
your goal from you other than yourself
is when you don't follow through speed.

88
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,510
Don't do the things that you said you
would do that other people start to

89
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:34,190
disappear in fail too.
We were talking about your dream here.

90
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,670
We're talking about your passion.
We're not expecting everybody else to

91
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:42,671
show up and give us handouts.
You give yourself a handout by following

92
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,490
through with actions that you said you
needed to do,

93
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,300
that you know you needed to do that no
will take you to the next level.

94
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,670
So stop treating your word like trash.
Stop treating it like garbage,

95
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,820
like something you could just throw
around saying one day that you can

96
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,280
improve your relationship.
They seem that you're going to be better

97
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,140
socially,
but saying that you're going to make

98
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:06,020
progress in your career or that you're
going to lose weight and get in shape

99
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,620
and then the next day not do anything
about it and just give up on yourself.

100
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,730
Even if you went half way there.
It's the same damn thing.

101
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,730
Go all the way followed through with
real work,

102
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
real effort,
cause you can keep daydreaming and

103
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,480
escaping your dream.
You can keep thinking that one day we'll

104
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,340
be real or you can actually step into
it.

105
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:35,341
Today you can make a real decision.
I'm real life position,

106
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,130
not a fantasy,
a real choice to no longer daydream,

107
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,920
but to use your name,
to step into your dream.

108
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,320
I heard my own trusted you.
This no one else can approve of you

109
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,080
except for you.
You have to validate your dream.

110
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:54,820
You have to validate your passion and
you have to validate it with real work

111
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
and you have to follow with passion.
We'll drive determination and all such

112
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,510
thing as giving up.
How about you stop looking for other

113
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,010
people scanning?
What's,

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,610
what's your guarantee success?
What's your guarantee about reaching the

115
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:19,611
point where you want to
take you seriously?

116
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,050
No,
seriously stop letting yourself now

117
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,780
because there is absolutely nothing,
nothing in the world that feels better

118
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,890
than doing what you said you would.

119
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,740
Problem is everybody wants to be obese
and so it's time to do what real bees

120
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:01,741
do.
Everybody gets excited.

121
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,030
He t the bull story,
but nobody wants to get up at three

122
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:09,610
o'clock.
Well,

123
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,520
I was excited when I say I wake up at
three o'clock three o'clock

124
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,260
hi.

125
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,120
Well you walk out of here,
popped up,

126
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,310
fire it up.
Who get some new information?

127
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,170
You're ready?
Everybody wants to be a beast.

128
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,350
It turns time to do what bees do.

129
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,223
Okay?

130
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,860
What's you have to understand is
everybody that you're going to hear from

131
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,830
Eric Thomas.
My mother got pregnant with me at 17

132
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,390
years old,
high school dropout,

133
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,540
ate out of trash cans,
going to bed and building,

134
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,720
slept in cars,
multimillion company.

135
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,210
That's changing the world.
I didn't say America.

136
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,290
The world.
Why?

137
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,750
Because not only do I want to be a
beast,

138
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,290
if you follow my 24 hours,
I do what bees do.

139
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,600
You can't just say you want it.

140
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,043
Yes.

141
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,020
Can't watch the video and say I want it
as bad as I want to breathe.

142
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,170
It's true to say it
when the sun comes up,

143
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,750
you've got all the books,
you've got all the tapes,

144
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,580
you got all the access.
Now it's time charts.

145
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,460
[inaudible]

146
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,420
I haven't is essentially a decision that
your brain made at some point in that

147
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:42,370
you made
and then you stop making but continued

148
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,380
back.
I'm sure you've heard that cheesy quote

149
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,980
about life being a journey.
Well,

150
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,840
it's absolutely you're not racing
anywhere.

151
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,830
She slow down.
Stop looking around at what everyone

152
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:04,810
else is doing and focus on where you are
and what's important to you.

153
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,363
Okay.

154
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,120
We know from neurological studies and
every habit has three components.

155
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,030
There's a cue,
which is like a trigger for the behavior

156
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:23,010
to start and then there's the behavior
itself and then finally a reward.

157
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,290
And for years when people thought about
habits,

158
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,860
they focused on the VP.
But what we know from all of these

159
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:32,130
experiments is that it's the queue and
then we'll warm.

160
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,360
What are the secrets to unlocking a got
understanding how it works and more

161
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:41,361
importantly to change it.
How do you gain for assistance and how

162
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,950
do you start to have more good days than
bad days?

163
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,690
You're going to hate this advice,
but it absolutely works.

164
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,290
You must come up with a morning routine
that you do every single morning or at

165
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:10,190
least more and mornings than not.
That puts you in control of yourself

166
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,050
then in control of your day.

167
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,793
Okay?

168
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,420
We can choose.
We can choose to create new habits.

169
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,380
We can choose to extinguish old habits.
Once you understand how they work

170
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,770
according to studies,
you get to reshape these automatic

171
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,700
behaviors and then you gain this control
over these parts of your life that

172
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
otherwise just feel sort of just at the,
just out of reach

173
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,520
and foremost,
wake up on time when that alarm goes

174
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,710
off,
get your butt out of bed.

175
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,551
Five,
four,

176
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:53,121
three,
two,

177
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:56,420
one go.
Why is that important for persistence?

178
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,040
The reason why is because the first
decision that you're making of the day

179
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,860
is to actually get up and get moving.

180
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,600
Yep.

181
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Means you are persistently bigger than
your excuses.

182
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,750
You are persistently vigor than feeling
lazy,

183
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,230
and you are persistently feeding the
feelings that typically stop.

184
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:25,620
Yeah.

185
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,453
Yeah.

186
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,490
Where it is that your two priorities are
in your head.

187
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,550
Why?
The reason why is because of

188
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,384
persistence.

189
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,970
Yeah.
You got to

190
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,100
start off your day by getting up on
time,

191
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,670
figuring out your priorities,
and then getting to on them.

192
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,840
Single biggest reason why people have
bad days is because they start them off

193
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:05,230
by looking around at everybody else and
seeing what they're doing.

194
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,080
Instead of having the focus and the
discipline

195
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,590
to actually start your day off with you
in,

196
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,633
in troll,

197
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,690
get out

198
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,130
one time,
figure out your priorities and exercise.

199
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,430
You've got to believe in yourself.
You've got to believe in your abilities.

200
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,950
You got to believe in your service,
your company,

201
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,980
your ideas.
Unquestionably,

202
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,550
you must have faith.
It's hard.

203
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:41,384
Yes.
It's hard.

204
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,130
It's difficult.
Yes.

205
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,680
Blight,
and it's worth it.

206
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:54,850
Okay.
