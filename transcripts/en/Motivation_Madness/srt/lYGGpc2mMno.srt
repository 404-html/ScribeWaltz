1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,420
So 25 years.
Oh,

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,150
don't worry.
Animistic is a income is a wonderful

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:21,151
revenue for you.
So I told myself and told him,

4
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:26,341
my young people before 20 years old,
be a good student when into

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,940
entrepreneurialism.
Learn some experience before 30 years

6
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,070
old.
Follow somebody,

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,180
go to a small company.
Normally in a big company,

8
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:40,960
it is good to learn processing.
You are a part of a big machine,

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,380
but when you go to small company,
you learn the passion.

10
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:49,050
You learn the dreams,
you learn how to do lots of things as

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,380
when one time,
so before 30 years old,

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,890
it's not which company you go,
it's which boss you follow.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,420
It's very important.
A good boss teach you differently and

14
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:05,250
before from 30 to 40 years old,
you have to think very clearly where

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,600
you're working for yourself.

16
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,910
If you really want to be an
entrepreneur,

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,480
when you're 40 to 50 years old,
you have to do all the things that you

18
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,790
are good at.
Don't try to drop into the new area.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,950
It's too late.
You may be successful,

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
but the rate of dying is too big.
So 40 to 50 think about how can focus on

21
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:33,481
things that you are good at,
but when you are 50 to 60 years old,

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,800
work for the young people
because young people can do better than

23
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,470
you.
So rely on them.

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,670
Invest on them,
making sure they're good.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,420
So when you are over 60 or so,
spend time for yourself on the beach

26
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,644
side.
Shine,

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,460
right?
It's too late for you to change novelty.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,180
But I,
this is my,

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,510
my advice to the young people,
25 years old.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,050
Make enough mistakes.
Don't worry,

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,900
you fall.
You stand up,

32
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,860
your fault,
your stem.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,020
Enjoy it.
I mean,

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,270
25 years old.
I enjoy the show in your show.

35
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,350
I didn't.
I have a rich father,

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,740
tried to three times for university,
all filled.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,730
I apply for Harvard for 10 times.
All failed.

38
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:25,650
They don't even want to see me for the
last time I went to the teacher's

39
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,720
college,
which was considered the third or fourth

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,410
class of my city.

41
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,070
So applied jobs 30 times rejected.
It was so difficult at that time.

42
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:43,150
I was so frustrated because I taught in
a university,

43
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,210
my pay was $10 a mouth because I cannot
find a good job in 1994 discuss it.

44
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:55,870
I'm going to do something called
Internet and 23 of them against it.

45
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,310
They said,
this is stupid idea.

46
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,200
We have never heard about internet or
you know nothing about computer and I

47
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,080
never thought I was smart.
Nobody believed that I could be

48
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,520
successful because everybody would say,
well this guy think differently.

49
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,320
Think of crazy that you know these
things about something that will work.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,320
I try to follow three salary who has
daughters from the banks took me three

51
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,000
mouse,
but I still cannot get him.

52
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,390
We talked to over 30 or 40 of venture
capitalists.

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,970
Everybody's mill.
Forget it.

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,060
Not a pupil said Ali Baba is a terrible
model.

55
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,460
As I said,
I believe that.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,470
I think this thing,
could it be big?

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,150
I never thought it will be bad big.
Like today I believe something,

58
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,040
something is waiting for me there and I
have to work hard to prove myself.

59
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,220
That was the tough experience.
So we gather 50,000 us daughters from 18

60
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,671
founders were started for the first
three years.

61
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,970
We do not have the evil $1 revenue from
our business.

62
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,730
What's not easy?
Why?

63
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,850
It keeps on going ahead going forward,
because I received lots of email of

64
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,820
thanks from the customer.
This a,

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,820
this is such a great thing we cannot
have pay you,

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,110
but this thing helped us.
If you keep on helping us one day you

67
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,520
will be successful and I believe this
little by little we build up our

68
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,320
business little by little we build up
our ecosystem of the infrastructure and

69
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,620
now after 16 years,
whoever Ali Baba Group,

70
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,100
we have a team or group,
we have a top all group where for Ali

71
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,130
pay and people fed.
You are so smart.

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,440
How could you make a company like that?

73
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,050
Bill Gates,
Warren Buffet,

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,660
the Jack Welch,
very page mark Sangaber.

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,450
The difference between those people and
other people,

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,300
they are always optimistic for the
future.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,740
They never complained.
They always tried to solve the problems

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,340
of the others
where you're optimistic.

79
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,380
It's always opportunity.
People same here today.

80
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,910
Jeff,
where's the opportunity?

81
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,040
I don't have a job.
I don't have this.

82
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't have a debt.
We are at the best of time of the

83
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,010
sanctuary.
The best,

84
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,010
uh,
sets you have is that you are young.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,110
Don't complain.
Let the other people complain.

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,950
The opportunity lie always lies where
people complain.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,010
Singing about how you can make things
different.

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,020
Is there anything I can do that make the
two first and then when you think about

89
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,750
this study to it,
I saw a lot of people,

90
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,930
young people have a fantastic ideas
every evening,

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,700
but in the morning they go to the office
thing.

92
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,470
Again,
being an entrepreneur,

93
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,440
you have to do the things before the
other people do.

94
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,020
You have to wake up before the other
people wake up.

95
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,300
You have to be more brave than the
others.

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,070
Use instinct.
Everything you do is to the need of the

97
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,820
customer,
to everybody,

98
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,790
to any person.
Tomorrow is a new,

99
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,250
make the move.
Make the action whether investors

100
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,430
believe it this or not,
whether your friends believe it or not,

101
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,700
what their parents believe it or not,
that's not important.

102
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,630
You believe it.
Your team believe in and work day and

103
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,180
night on this.
That's all the things happens.

104
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,230
Make enough mistakes.
You fall your stand up.

105
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,680
Any mistake is that encompasses.
Okay,

106
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,550
wonderful revenue.
Don't worry about it.

107
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:36,100
Money.
Money follows the people.

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,870
People should follow the creams.
If you have a dream just to go ahead.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,440
I think nobody can conquer the world.
We're only kissed,

110
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:50,860
serve the world,
either work for the others.

111
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,090
I'll work for yourself and I troost away
or can my,

112
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,100
for myself working for myself.
That means working for the society.

113
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,250
If you really want to work for yourself,
think about the others because only when

114
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,700
the other people successful,
when the other people are happy,

115
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,340
you will be successful,
you will be happy.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,310
I think today people worry a lot about
the world,

117
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,840
about the economy,
China economy in the world and I'm a

118
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:24,841
very optimistic when people start to
worry that that is the opportunity is,

119
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,340
but I worry about the blood testing and
she created the good things and I think

120
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:34,030
great innovations,
great companies always happening in the

121
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,100
tough times.
The lives,

122
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:39,000
like the music,
you have a copy of it down,

123
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,930
you have a lawyer,
the shot nodes,

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,020
and I like your American movie life.
Life is like a box of chocolate.

125
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,230
You never know what you're going to get.
Right?

126
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,220
So I'm pretty optimistic.
The opportunity in the future for

127
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:56,221
equality is huge because in the,
in in the last century,

128
00:07:56,261 --> 00:08:01,240
the t is for big companies.
The globalization is for big companies.

129
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,830
But now with the technology,
we can serve those 80% of the companies

130
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:06,850
that never been served.

131
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,970
We can serve the 80% of the young people
that have never been served.

132
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,620
Technology for Internet is so cheap,
so easy to use.

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,580
One of the reasons why we grow each
China ecommerce so fast,

134
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,230
much faster than the u s it because our
infrastructure of commerce in China was

135
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,810
too bad.
Where does too bad?

136
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,320
Something happened to ghost.
Today we are working on the rural areas

137
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:33,490
of China.
I can never imagine that Chinar about

138
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,030
800 million people still live in the
rural areas.

139
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,110
Uh,
farmers and there are about close to 200

140
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,860
million people.
They are income is less than $1 per day

141
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,790
and before the Internet it's impossible
for these guys to reach the pc because

142
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,810
it's so difficult.
Even people like me,

143
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:56,640
I don't know how to use a pc,
but now all 80% of the farmers,

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,970
those people using mobile phones,
we have the mobile phones,

145
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,500
the Internet,
the data,

146
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,860
things changing a lot.
So I'm excited about the future.

147
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,140
People always worry.
That's the,

148
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,870
you know,
I love the young kids sitting there and

149
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,140
talking about the dream,
the hopes because if they have the hope,

150
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,540
we have the hope.
That's what I believe.

151
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,810
And let's just take
what you do.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,593
And I

153
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,650
loved every description I've ever heard
about how you serve people and your

154
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:34,970
story about the bamboo farmers and your
wife and her friends.

155
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:37,700
It was fabulous.
But where's this going?

156
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,370
What are you going to do?
What are your plans to maximize the use

157
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:48,371
that people in remote rural areas of
China can make of their cell phones?

158
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,800
Besides ordering your projects,
how do you going to get it?

159
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,320
Are you going to get them in the banking
system through cell phones?

160
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,533
How

161
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,650
well,
um,

162
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,280
we,
we never know that we couldn't grow so

163
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:08,281
fast that passed the five miles.
We covered 4,500 villages and these

164
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:15,490
people normally the,
the using very traditional way.

165
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,760
Did it take them like two,
we went to a rural area,

166
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:23,260
it took them the farmers two hours to
work to the downtown,

167
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,030
uh,
in,

168
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,170
in the middle of the town and buy
things.

169
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,110
But today because the mobile phone and
we deliver,

170
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,030
we can deliver things to their home,
to their village within 72 hours.

171
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,520
I remember there is a,
well last week I read a very interested

172
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,120
in new for this is amazing.
There is a girl,

173
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,130
she told them your story.
She said her grandfather 92 years.

174
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:50,131
So the birthday and for his life he
always wanted to try one western style

175
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,460
food,
but he lived in the rural areas.

176
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,050
There's a no such a restaurant food.

177
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,220
So she said,
I tried on the Internet book a

178
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,190
restaurant,
dinner for western food,

179
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,340
deliver to that village and the fatherly
immediately find the one restaurant.

180
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,930
There were three guys,
they took like a three days bus from

181
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,060
the,
from Sha height to that village,

182
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,660
made a telic spaghetti and a beef for
that for 92 years old bursting and whole

183
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,390
village was excited.
Everybody starts says,

184
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,320
wow,
you can order food rest in a restaurant,

185
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,230
rest of style of food.
So by almost everything,

186
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,530
and also we'll helping there.
A lot of farmers,

187
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,290
they planned a love apples,
green apples,

188
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,980
but 90% of the apples routed because
there's nobody by that they normally buy

189
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,760
by track.
You know,

190
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:49,210
if you sell via the APP apples,
this our whole track

191
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,963
and

192
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,340
using the traditional way they can,
they can sell by whole basket of the

193
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,100
apples.
But now because of the Internet,

194
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,400
the cell by one by one,
each app with the cell,

195
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,130
$1 Oh you know,
won't imb or two,

196
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:09,490
I'm just for each.
So the farmers will see using Internet,

197
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,900
they can buy and the sell and using a
mobile phone that changed their lives.

198
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,560
And I think it's exciting and people
need examples when they see where the

199
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,320
other my neighbor made made money sort
of online to selling things.

200
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:26,600
My neighbor made by much interesting
things are life.

201
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,310
People start to learn and more more
people started by the mobile phones.

202
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,040
We cannot have,
we cannot make all the factory,

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,810
the mobile factories to cell phones to
them only they know the mobile phone

204
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:41,560
really works helping change their lives.
They started by the mobile phones.

205
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,930
Just one more question.
Do you think this will make

206
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,570
the current problems like the current
problem in China?

207
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,630
Less likely.
That is if we'll have more market

208
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:59,560
information in the market will drive
where the investment goes instead of the

209
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,050
government trying to make judgments
about it.

210
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,520
I better build another housing
development or office development here,

211
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,500
there and Yonder and you wound up with a
bubble.

212
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,880
What he comes from the bottom up.
Is it more likely that fewer bad things

213
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:13,714
will happen?

214
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,710
Yeah,
no.

215
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,710
I think the last week I was in Seattle
discussing about the China economy.

216
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,100
I think the you American people worry
too much about the China economy.

217
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,360
Well,
you see

218
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,380
every time where you start to worry
about the China,

219
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,120
China goes better.
Every channel you think China's problem,

220
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,740
you know we've got,
you know,

221
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,440
we'll get better but we ain't got to say
gi.

222
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,410
We have a,
you have a high expectation of China.

223
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,150
China always a problem like a parents of
the expectation of the kids,

224
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:50,990
you know have the same.
But there's a big difference between the

225
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,530
American consumption because people say
wow,

226
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,290
you know the economy's bad.
So China consumption will be good.

227
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,970
Look no totally different.
You American love to spin a tomorrow's

228
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,360
money
and the other people's money,

229
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:09,361
maybe all maybe the coolest money.
We Chinese love to safe money.

230
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,390
We are probably the largest or country,
the d safe deposit in the whole road.

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,490
That will people,
cause we'd been poor for so many years

232
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,820
when we made money,
we're putting the banks because Sunday

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,400
we know the disaster is coming so we can
spend the money.

234
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,090
So when the economy's bad,
we still have the money to spend.

235
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,800
You guys probably don't you worry.

236
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,650
And a second of thing at the China
market,

237
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,620
China been focusing on developing for
the past 30 years.

238
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,910
China government,
sole Straw on investment.

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,140
So Straw on exporting,
but they're too weak on the domestic

240
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,890
consumption's domestic consumption is
not driven by government,

241
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:55,040
is driven by intrepreneurship,
driven by the market,

242
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,070
not the government.
So in the past two years,

243
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,000
pastor to the years government is so
strong now they get a week.

244
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:07,090
It's our opportunity.
It's our show time to see the market

245
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,790
cademy entrepreneurship,
how we can develop the real consumption.

246
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,230
You know,
I think if the China developed with a

247
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:20,231
great consumption,
we have a 300 million middle class in

248
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,960
next to 15 to 20 years.
We've got a half below middle class.

249
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,260
We need to import a lot.
So when we start to import,

250
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,060
that's a great,
it's going to I,

251
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,990
I worry a lot when we export.
You know,

252
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:36,920
when we export,
we got a terrible sky.

253
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,710
We have a terrible water,
we have a terrible work environment.

254
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,260
When we started input,
we got to be better.

255
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,590
So that's all the grid opportunity guys.
Be Happy about that.

256
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,220
I'm serious.
I'm serious.

257
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,990
We Orient Yourself,
don't worry.

258
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,990
The reasons.
Some of it's worried about China as we

259
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:04,480
depend on you to buy our debt.
However,

260
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,740
I tried to be more Chinese when I was
president,

261
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,060
I saved a lot of money.
So,

262
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,210
uh,
I just wanted you to say that because

263
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,810
I really believe that.
I mean,

264
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:21,430
I think you're absolutely right.
The trend toward greater internal

265
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:26,431
consumption is I think will remain
unbroken in spite of whatever the

266
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,300
difficulties are in the next few months.
I think it's important not to overreact.

267
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:35,800
You can't break the trend.
You got to clean up the land from

268
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:37,990
chemical contaminants.
You got to clean up the air,

269
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:38,960
you're going to do it.
Yeah.

270
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:43,270
And a lot of Chinese will make a lot of
money out of that will be a lot of great

271
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:47,200
new companies and there'll be
opportunities to import from other

272
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:48,100
places.
Yeah.

273
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,640
So
can you discuss your theory of what

274
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:59,731
you're doing and other things in terms
of whether it advances equal opportunity

275
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:03,430
in social solidarity?
Tell him what you think's going to

276
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:07,330
happen and what other kinds of,
when your opening remarks,

277
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:08,870
you just say,
uh,

278
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,840
technology is going to be active in this
way and other areas of the economy.

279
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,180
What do you think the next big
opportunities are?

280
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,550
But first tell him just in two sentences
what you're doing.

281
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,860
Cause Jack and I know when we haven't
been clear enough,

282
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,310
explain it and explain how you think
that advances social solidarity and

283
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,610
equality of opportunity.

284
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,590
Well,
our work is in

285
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,540
the belief that access to health
information is a basic human right and

286
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,050
that lab information,
particularly because lab data drives 70%

287
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,560
of clinical decisions needs to be
accessible to people before they're

288
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:57,030
sick.
And so if you look at the word diagnose

289
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,320
in the dictionary today,
it says to determine the presence of

290
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,460
disease from symptoms,
which means by definition we're

291
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:09,780
determining that people are sick once a
disease has already progressed.

292
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,470
And our work is in being able to make
lab testing accessible to people in time

293
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,690
for therapy to be affected.
And to do that in a way in which every

294
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,640
person you're respective of their
insurance status,

295
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,170
irrespective of where they live,
can afford the ability to get a test

296
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,720
done.
So that means in our case,

297
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:38,721
we've invested the last 12 years in now
developing hundreds of tests,

298
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:42,060
many of which are less than $10.

299
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,120
So in $2 tests in the United States.
And I think one of the amazing things

300
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,750
about this country is that we have such
an incredible

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
ecosystem for fueling creativity in that
creativity can create new markets.

302
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,380
So in answer to your question about the
market being able to conform itself to

303
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,230
social good,
I think the creativity that goes into

304
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,460
creating new these new technologies
create new markets in and of themselves.

305
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,950
And,
and our basic belief that is that those

306
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:18,360
new markets come from empowering
individuals and in franchising

307
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:23,040
individuals and trusting that
individuals have the capability to

308
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,780
engage with information and in accessing
that information,

309
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,490
beginning to take control of their own
outcomes and their own health outcomes.

310
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,050
And in doing so,
changing the way our healthcare system

311
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:37,810
works.

312
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,810
I think what this could mean for rural
China.

313
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah.
For Rural India,

314
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,630
for native American reservations in
America,

315
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,140
for the Mississippi Delta,
for the remote area to where all the

316
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,560
jobs for loss from cold,
you're all of a sudden giving people

317
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,820
information and uh,
one of the most important things I think

318
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:05,821
we did in my second term as president of
the healthcare front was developed as

319
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,590
Diabetes Self Care Program.
And all of a sudden you could be Jack's

320
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:16,591
company could be delivering the means to
self care based on your test.

321
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
I mean,
I think that this is really,

322
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,810
this is a very big deal.
We all want to live as long and as well

323
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,970
as we can.
And Greg Brenner was here.

324
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:29,500
We were joking about whether we'd make
it to a hundred but in the meanwhile,

325
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,540
do you want to keep people healthy?
And if they're sick,

326
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,280
you went to intervene early,
not late.

327
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,780
Sure.
When,

328
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,250
and if you look at,
I mean the ability to engage with this

329
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,780
information.
We have a $4 trillion health care

330
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,100
problem in this country.
20% of it is type two diabetes,

331
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:49,120
which is reversible.
And we 90 million Americans who do not

332
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,560
know they are prediabetic,
but access to information and the

333
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:58,540
ability to engage with that information
is the foundation for being able to

334
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,690
change those outcomes and costs.
Right.

335
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,050
One more factor then I want to call it
Jack,

336
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,570
you founded this company 12 years ago,
right?

337
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,130
Yeah.
Tell him how old you are.

338
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,443
I was 19

339
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,723
so

340
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,330
don't worry about the future.
We're in good hands and that was think

341
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:23,640
of a new [inaudible] water.
Where am nine tab?

342
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,450
Not The past examination for university
yet.

343
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,740
I felt a three times,
but I think it worked out.

344
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm not good at schooling.
Well,

345
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,200
yeah.
That's why I give confidence to a lot of

346
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:38,010
young people in China.
If Jack Ma Can,

347
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,970
success can be successful.
80% of the people can be successful.

348
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,650
People like hurry up with jealous.

349
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,670
Well,
equality.

350
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,540
I would like to make a lot of technology
helping you because yesterday I was

351
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:57,541
joining the United a u n a woman
conference about gender equality and I

352
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:00,610
think the first,
the technology revolution happened 200

353
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,310
years ago in the UK.
Release the human body,

354
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,210
the arm stronger.
The second the technology revolution

355
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,970
that in the,
in the u s if our advantage you can last

356
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,510
law.
But this technology of revolution relief

357
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,670
release the brain.
So this century is not a competition.

358
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,030
Who's strong,
who's muscles stronger is who is a

359
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,190
smarter,
who's soft,

360
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:27,460
who can listen.
It's the challenge of a wisdom.

361
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,070
So man,
women are equal on the Internet.

362
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,400
You can never see his a woman or man on
the Internet.

363
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,650
Women can serve much better than the men
on the Internet and a man talking about

364
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,060
a business,
talking about,

365
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:40,960
you know,
numbers,

366
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,310
competition,
the nic business,

367
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,940
very code women,
they can make business a very cozy

368
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,960
lifestyle and interesting.
50% more than 50% of our shop owners,

369
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,550
while they half 5 million shop owners
are women.

370
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,700
And people love that.
I think this is,

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,790
this is a great thing.
I see that this century,

372
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,880
we see more and more women leaders on
the state leaders and the presidents in

373
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,860
the future.
We're going to general receptor of

374
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,120
United Nations should be a woman leader
at this is the greatest century for

375
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,210
equality.
And I,

376
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,450
I feel excited about that.

377
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,560
Let me ask you that.

378
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,070
We're almost out of time,
but one of the things that we haven't

379
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,860
talked enough about here,
not just here,

380
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:33,120
but generally is whether the leap
frogging we saw

381
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,450
with cell phones,
which was instrumental in your

382
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,780
phenomenal business success and which
will make it possible for you at the

383
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,080
appropriate time to do what you've done
on a global scale hitherto unimaginable

384
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,750
and all of human history for anybody to
have any of their own health data.

385
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,270
We haven't,
we've seen examples but not the kind of

386
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:07,401
dramatic penetration we need with energy
and clean energy and enough and in short

387
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:13,110
enough time to avoid the worst
consequences of climate change.

388
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,060
So do you believe

389
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,623
that,

390
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,140
I mean your country has done more than
anybody else to try to put up solar

391
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:24,620
panels and some of your companies went
broke because you overdid it,

392
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,830
right?
But beforehand and you got to work out

393
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,320
the phase out of the coal,
the phases of the sun and all that.

394
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,170
Meanwhile,
Africa,

395
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,800
which is growing like crazy because of
the cell phone and no small measure.

396
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,460
And as six of the fastest growing
countries in the world still has vast

397
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:45,560
swath of its land,
totally dark at night.

398
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,230
Do you believe

399
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,850
that it's possible for us to scale up
with distributed solar power is rather

400
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:59,320
than central lives as quickly as we did
with the cell phone?

401
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,540
And if so,
and if that were your business,

402
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,150
if you had to quit what you're doing
today and start there,

403
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,220
how would you do it and how would you do
it?

404
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,210
Did he at first I know that,

405
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,331
yeah,
I'm,

406
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:20,331
I'm such a huge believer in technology
and I think especially right now we're

407
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:24,420
at an incredible time in terms of new
technology and the ability to apply

408
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:28,230
technology in a scalable way towards
solving some of these problems.

409
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:32,340
So I would look at it in the context of
some of the renewable solutions that we

410
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:35,370
already have and in the context of
empowering,

411
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:39,330
connecting individuals with access to
those solutions and in the context of

412
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:44,190
creating markets around them,
I think that there's real opportunity to

413
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:48,420
actually create an ecosystem in which
people can financially benefit from

414
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,000
these solutions.
And I think that's going to drive an

415
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,100
adoption.
I think in developing economies there's

416
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:57,870
a revenue stream associated with that
and the more we can turn even already

417
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:00,570
some of the technologies that we have
into markets,

418
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,200
the more that we can fuel,
I believe local growth and individual

419
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:07,470
engagement in in beginning to adopt some
of these solutions.

420
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,530
Just related to that would be Jack,
you answer it and then I'll ask you one

421
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,260
final.

422
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,670
Yeah.
I am a strong believer that technology

423
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:19,600
can make war much better because people
say China economists getting slower,

424
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,590
I'm happy about a 7% even 5% even 5% of
the GDP of the number of chain of the

425
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:31,160
second large economy is big enough.
But yet you don't expect China keep on

426
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:36,161
growing 11% cause like one body,
one human body where your 1.8 meters

427
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,620
tall,
you cannot keep all like a 10% growth

428
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:41,320
every year.
You have to grow the quality,

429
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:42,460
your mind,
the wisdom.

430
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,900
So I think China needs new technologies
to solve this problems and which today

431
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,430
the data,
the,

432
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,140
the,
the clean technology,

433
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,890
all these things that China is supposed
to do.

434
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:58,320
If we keep on the tradition,
the old ways,

435
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,290
we're going nowhere.
This is why I feel excited because

436
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,250
people asking you what is your dream
now?

437
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,960
Cause I never thought I would be today.

438
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,060
I can sit here talking to president.
I'm like a guy you know,

439
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:15,750
on the street and like filled of three
times for university,

440
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:20,010
five times four h for high key schools.
I applied for 10 times and Harvard

441
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:24,160
school or rejected.
I never thought because of the tech and

442
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:27,450
large because the Internet,
it give me this opportunity.

443
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:30,600
So I'm think when I retire,
I don't want,

444
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:35,601
the Chinese people have a terrible water
to drink and it's safe for food and the

445
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,780
money we make all spend in the hospital.
That's disaster.

446
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,650
So how we can use in the technology to
enable young people the greater chance

447
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,820
of this road.
Don't worry about.

448
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,970
We got to 1.4 billion people who are
born in 1980s they are the people of the

449
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,990
Internet Times.
They are going to have new ways to solve

450
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:01,290
the word problems.
The things you're worried about today,

451
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,620
they can solve it.
And a human being have the these kind of

452
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:07,030
worries for centuries.
Uh,

453
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:11,190
young people can always solve it and
today when you have the right direction,

454
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,780
cling encourage,
you know,

455
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,211
the,
the,

456
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:17,940
the climate change,
all these issues they will be solved and

457
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,070
these are the great opportunities ahead
of us.

458
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,753
Anything else?

459
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,900
I agree with that.
I think the more,

460
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,660
the more we can,
the more we can in franchise people,

461
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:36,500
the more we can create ecosystems in
which individuals are empowered,

462
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:40,250
the more we give rights to individuals
to be able to build businesses,

463
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,520
to be able to,
to pursue the economic benefit of

464
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,250
technologies.
The more you see these markets change

465
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,510
before they leave the stage,
I want you to look at them

466
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,760
and I want you to think about the time
we have had to spend here

467
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,460
dealing with the refugee problems in
Syria and Lebanon.

468
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,310
Stand up.
Ellis,

469
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,790
this is my friend Elliot Musafa.
He's the education minister in Lebanon.

470
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,980
He's got to educate all these kids

471
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,700
and

472
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,960
so he left a miracle that very much
reflects the lives that Elizabeth and

473
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,880
Jack have lived.
He was

474
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,250
in a very responsible position at the
American of Dubai.

475
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,280
They started bringing American scholars
over there to live in and and Arabic

476
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:52,290
culture.
He did all these wonderful things.

477
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,790
Lebanon got in trouble.
He went home to save his country.

478
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,920
What is the difference?
How much more could he in every smart

479
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:04,921
Lebanese person do if they could focus
on these things and why can he not?

480
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,480
Because the place is dominated by people
who think their differences are more

481
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:13,780
important than their common humanity and
our common challenges.

482
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,530
You cannot imagine
Jack Miles proud of being Chinese.

483
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:25,210
I like that.
He never hit it.

484
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:27,610
He's,
he's happy about it and the proud to be

485
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:32,611
a global citizen.
I imagine Elizabeth's proud to be a

486
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,880
blonde haired,
blue eyed American tech.

487
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,540
No.
Where's the northern California?

488
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,700
Yes,
but

489
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,930
they don't,
not a word either.

490
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:50,800
One of them is sad,
has defined the meaning of their lives.

491
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Are the direction of their work with
negative reference to someone else.

492
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,650
My friend Dikembe Mutombo stand up.
No,

493
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,300
you don't have to stand up.
It'll hurt too much.

494
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,340
You're an old man.
My seven foot two or it's fall friend

495
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,020
was just inducted into the National
Basketball Association Hall of fame

496
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,733
and

497
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,430
my family,
my whole family loves him and I have

498
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:32,070
seen how much he has given back to his
native country Congo,

499
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,460
which has been sold troubles.
I've known him a long time.

500
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:42,870
We both went to Georgetown University.
I did before he was born.

501
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:47,871
I think I've never heard him say a
resentful thing about anybody.

502
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,910
I have seen him give and give and give
and try to give the people in his native

503
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:58,911
land opportunities.
Why am I telling you this?

504
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,910
He's had a good life because he never
defined his life with negative reference

505
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:12,220
to anybody else.
He never begrudge anybody else's success

506
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,210
and he thought he had an obligation to
help other people.

507
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm telling you,
this is the,

508
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,750
we are back in a time of collective
global insecurity

509
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,783
where

510
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,980
the main struggle is the oldest one in
human history.

511
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Just in modern techno realities.
I mean if you were trying to build the

512
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,740
Middle East,
you would think about our permanent

513
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:46,610
sponsor here.
The ambassador from Oman who tried to,

514
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,850
her government tried to help head off a
calamitous war in the Middle East over

515
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:55,910
the nuclear issue in Iran.
We all pray to God that it will work

516
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,110
and the lady she made you look around
all these places,

517
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:04,840
wherever

518
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,660
people are putting aside their
differences and working together,

519
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,390
good things are happening.
We cannot achieve economic or social

520
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:19,130
equality without living in the factual
realities of the world.

521
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,730
We face looking at the obstacles,
looking at the opportunities,

522
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,090
making the best decisions and those of
us who even feel good about ourselves

523
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,680
because we think we spend a lot of time
giving.

524
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,370
Our whole goal should be to work
ourselves out of a job.

525
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,780
One of the things that the bill and
Tammy Austin it or sitting there with

526
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,410
stark and they started giving away
hearing aids and then they decided,

527
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,420
well we better teach these young people
how to speak.

528
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:52,540
It's I get the gift of hearing.
They'll have to learn that.

529
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:57,541
So they got into the education distance.
Sani Barky got into the education

530
00:33:57,991 --> 00:34:02,100
business and started somebody ought to
do something really dramatic to remind

531
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,740
people that the only people that really
matter,

532
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,440
the teachers,
so he gave the first global teacher of

533
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:12,090
the year award last year and an
international panel gave the prize to a

534
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:16,050
teacher from Maine who probably gave the
entire million dollars to her school

535
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,660
woman,
never made any money in her life.

536
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:19,860
She gave all the money away

537
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,223
immediately.

538
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,030
The future's going to be forged by
people who think of how to use the

539
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:32,031
modern tools that we're given
as Elizabeth and Jack have to create

540
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:42,581
opportunity through empowerment.
And it will not be a straight line.

541
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,610
It's too,
too many moving parts.

542
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,360
But I just want you to think about that.
The reason you feel good looking at them

543
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,950
and that you identify with them even
though they're different from you.

544
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,920
And that's basically where we are all
over again and we can't slip back.

545
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:06,950
We can't give up.
That's why we had the prime minister of

546
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,800
Italy and George Soros talking about the
future of Europe.

547
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:12,740
And George said it was coming apart and
the prime minister said,

548
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,050
no,
it doesn't have to come apart if it's

549
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:19,100
about something more than economics.
I thought it doesn't have to come apart

550
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,230
if you will.
It not to,

551
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,740
and you put yourself on the line for it.
There are no guaranteed outcomes today,

552
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,440
but you can guarantee that the trend is
right.

553
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,350
So go ahead.
You were gonna say something origin.

554
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,950
I just wanted to add,
I mean it's,

555
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,980
we were talking about the future and,
and my own experience

556
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,430
and looking at all the faces here.
I think a huge part of the answer to

557
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:45,840
your question is also to raise our
little girls with the stereotype that

558
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:50,100
they can be the best in engineering and
science and math because when they do,

559
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,190
in all of these industries,
it changes everything.

560
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,173
And

561
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:59,370
we need to do that in this country and
we need to do that as parents in other

562
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,304
countries.

563
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,570
Yeah.
I was thinking about if,

564
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,860
uh,
what you say,

565
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,120
I'll think about when you,
what,

566
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,760
when you talk about the problems you're
normally is like a politician.

567
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:18,000
When you talk about the opportunities
that the business people,

568
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,400
I was thinking about how we can,
using this,

569
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,700
all the problems that change the problem
become the opportunity.

570
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,340
And um,
I,

571
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,850
I dunno,
I just feel excited when people talk

572
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:37,200
about problems.
I think that's thing about if you can

573
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,170
solve one of them,
that's the chance.

574
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,680
And today nobody in live in this century
has so many opportunities and so many

575
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,390
tools they can use the change other
people's lives.

576
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,030
And I think in,
in the last century,

577
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,570
which I'd call it time,
this century is called the [inaudible]

578
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,350
data technology.
It is to empower yourself,

579
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,680
make yourself strong.
D t is to empower the others.

580
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,660
When you pee,
empower the others,

581
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,030
you're empowered your future or
yourself.

582
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,840
So when I listen to talk,
I agree and I think,

583
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,060
uh,
that's why we were born in this century.

584
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,410
That's why we,
uh,

585
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,780
how we can use the internet to help
them.

586
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,660
What people,
it's giving them a hand.

587
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,523
Thank you.

588
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,560
Okay.
