1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,050
Only explain to you how you can live an
easy life,

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,340
accomplishing goals and be successful
and going out in the world and as tough.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,710
The only way to live an easy life is to
basically give up on all your dreams and

4
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:22,360
aspirations and just sit around doing
nothing.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,180
Shit.
The diseases is not worth accomplishing.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,160
Therefore a life that is easy.
It's not even worth living.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,790
Nothing in this world is worth having or
doing unless it means effort,

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,350
pain,
and difficulty.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,640
Would you listen to me?
You are going to die.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,090
All of you,
you all,

11
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,730
your friends,
your family,

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,570
everyone you know,
everyone you care about is going to die

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,740
if you love life,
not waste time because time is what life

14
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:00,844
is made of.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,480
If you respect and appreciate the time
that you've been given while you out

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,440
there doing what you want to do,
what you need to be telling yourself is

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,710
acceptable to be sitting around
procrastinating and I no longer wants to

18
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,790
be a loser.
I no longer wanted to be offered.

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,130
I know what it is that I want and I'm
going to work hard and I'm going to get

20
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,670
it.

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,180
When you want to succeed,
as bad as you want to breathe,

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,590
then you'll be successful.
Somebody lost sleep more than a lot of

23
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,390
success,
and I'm here to tell you the day if

24
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,810
you're going to be successful,
you've got to be willing to give up

25
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,690
sleep.
You got to be willing to work off for

26
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,010
three hours of sleep,
two hours.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,490
If you really want to be successful,
some days you will have to stay up three

28
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:41,324
days in a row.

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,070
You don't need to
if you don't really want to.

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,790
Are you wanting success rather than
actually working towards your dreams?

31
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,450
A lot of you are just thinking about it.
I have high hopes for everybody watching

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,030
this.
I want to remember your name.

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,250
It is not the things we do in life that
we regret on our deathbed.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,900
It is the things we do not because I
assure you I've done a lot of really

35
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,960
stupid things.
None of them bother me.

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,140
All the mistakes and all the dopey
things and all the time I was

37
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,530
embarrassed.
They don't matter.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,750
Find your passion and in my experience,
no matter what you do at work,

39
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,230
what you do in official settings,
that passion will be grounded in people

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,880
grounded in the relationships you have
with people and what they think of you.

41
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,400
When your time comes

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,920
in,
the teeth stupefying odds,

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,570
which is urine by in our ordinariness
that are here.

44
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,770
One thing I do every single day of my
life trying to find somebody else change

45
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:22,801
their life.
I waited till 39 to get married because

46
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:37,071
I had to wait that long to find someone.
Her happiness was more important,

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,450
and if nothing else,
I hope that all of you can find that

48
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:46,830
kind of passion and that kind of love in
your life.

49
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,413
Thank you.

50
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,930
We have granted the opportunity to
understand why our eyes open and why

51
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:14,991
they see what they do in the short time
before they close forever.
