1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,610
I want to skip the flattery and the Atta
boys because I do know this.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,250
The sooner that we become less impressed
with our life,

3
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,260
with our accomplishments,
with our career,

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,350
with whatever that prospect is in front
of us,

5
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:26,351
the sooner we become less impressed and
more involved with that and these

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,880
things,
the sooner we get a whole lot better

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,383
doing them.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,690
So I'm going to talk to you about some
things that I've learned in my journey.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,330
Most of them experience,
some of them I heard in passing,

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,780
many of them I'm still practicing,
but all of them I do believe are true.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,180
Now,
they may be truth to me,

12
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:48,590
but don't think that that makes them
mine because you cannot own the truth.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,730
So please think of these as signpost
approaches,

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760
paradigms that gives some science to
satisfaction,

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,070
yours to steal yours,
to share,

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,460
like into your own lives,
to personally apply in your own lives,

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,900
in your own way should you choose to.
So here we go.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,530
Number one,
life's not easy.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,830
Life is not easy.
It is not.

20
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,380
Don't try to make it that way.
Life's not fair.

21
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,390
It never was.
It isn't.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,510
Now,
and it won't ever be,

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,430
do not fall into the trap,
the entitlement trap of feeling like

24
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,440
you're a victim.
You are not.

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,180
Get over it.
Get on with it,

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,270
and yes,
most things are more rewarding when you

27
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,070
break a sweat to get them.
Number two,

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,800
I love this.
Unbelievable is the stupidest word.

29
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:43,520
The dictionary
should never come out of our mouth.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,830
Think about it to say,
Oh wow,

31
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,450
what an unbelievable play a.
It was an unbelievable book and

32
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,100
unbelievable film.
Unbelievable active Kurt.

33
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,303
Really,

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,540
it may be spectacular.
It may be phenomenal,

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,690
most excellent or outstanding,
but unbelievable.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,550
Give others and yourself more credit.
It just happened.

37
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,290
You witnessed it.
You just did it.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,990
Believe it.
What about the other side of

39
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,030
unbelievable?
You know that that side,

40
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,660
when we humans under perform or act out
of our best character,

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,110
for instance,
man flies a suicide jet into the World

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,530
Trade Center.
Millions die from diseases everyday that

43
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,880
we have cures for.
Bob,

44
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:30,230
the builder swears that he's going to
have your house built by Thanksgiving

45
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,560
and you can't move in until Christmas.
The next year.

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,850
Our best friends lied to us and we lie
to ourselves all the time.

47
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,000
Unbelievable.
I don't think so.

48
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,280
Again,
it just happens and it happens everyday.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,270
Nothing that we homo sapiens earthlings
do is unbelievable,

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,950
and if there's one thing you can depend
on,

51
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,820
people being

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,613
it's people,

53
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,520
so we shouldn't be surprised.
We are the trickiest mammals walking the

54
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,620
planet.
I'm not worried about the monkeys.

55
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm worried about you and me,
so acknowledged the acts of greatness as

56
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:12,280
real and do not be naive about mankind's
capacity for evil,

57
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,880
nor be in denial of our own
shortcomings.

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,290
Happiness is an emotional response to an
outcome.

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,390
If I win,
I will be happy.

60
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:24,650
If I don't,
I won't.

61
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,710
It's an if then cause and effect.
We had pro quo standard that we cannot

62
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:34,280
sustain because we immediately raise it.
Every time we attain it.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,690
You see happiness,
happiness demands a certain outcome.

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,880
It is result reliant and I say,
if happiness is what you're after,

65
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,480
then you're going to be let down
frequently and you're going to be

66
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:49,550
unhappy.
Much of your time.

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,480
Joy though you always a different thing.
It's something else.

68
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,820
Joy is not a choice,
it's not a response to some result.

69
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,430
It's a constant joy is the feeling that
we have from doing what we are fashioned

70
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,160
to do,
no matter the outcome.

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,890
Now personally,
as an actor,

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I started enjoying my work and literally
being more happy when I stopped trying

73
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,860
to make the daily Labor a means to a
certain end.

74
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,390
For example,
a,

75
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:24,390
I need this film to be a box office
success.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,730
You know,
I need my performance to be

77
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:27,431
acknowledged.
I,

78
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:32,431
I need the respect of my peers are all
of those are reasonable aspirations,

79
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,710
but the truth is,
as soon as the work,

80
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,170
the daily making of the movie,
the doing of the deed became the reward

81
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:43,260
in itself for me.
I got more box office,

82
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:45,300
more accolades and respect than I ever
had before.

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
See,
joy is always in process.

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,530
It's under construction.
It is in constant approach,

85
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,710
alive and well in the doing of what
we're fashioning to do and enjoying it.

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,340
Number four,
define success for yourself.

87
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,340
Define success for yourself and check
this out.

88
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:12,170
I'm in south of New Orleans a few years
ago and I went to a Voodoo shop

89
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,730
and they had this,
this,

90
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,960
this wooden partition against the wall,
at these columns,

91
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:22,310
and in these columns where all these
vials of these magic potion,

92
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,620
right,
and the headings above each potion,

93
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:28,550
defining what they would give you were
things like fertility,

94
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,710
health,
family,

95
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,840
legal help,
energy,

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,760
forgiveness,
money.

97
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,850
Yes.
Which column is empty?

98
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,850
My nae have to admit it.
Money is king.

99
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,310
Today is what make the world,
makes the world go round.

100
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,590
It is success.
The more we have,

101
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:54,591
the more successful we are right now.
I would argue that our cultural values

102
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,080
have even been financial.
Humility is not in vogue anymore.

103
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,070
It's too passive.
It's a get rich quick on the Internet,

104
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,620
riches,
15 minutes of fame world that we live in

105
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,770
and we see it every day,
but we all want to succeed.

106
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,080
Right?
So the question that we got to ask

107
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,900
ourselves is,
what success is to us?

108
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,010
What success is to you?
Is it more money as fine?

109
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,870
I've got nothing against money.
No.

110
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,840
Maybe it's a healthy family.
Maybe it's a happy marriage.

111
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:31,230
Maybe it's to help others to be famous,
to be spiritually sound,

112
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,200
leave the world a little bit better
place than you found it.

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,080
Continue to ask yourself that question.
Now your answer may change over time and

114
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,610
that's fine,
but do yourself this favor.

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,210
Whatever your answer is,
don't choose anything that will

116
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:52,500
jeopardize yourself.
Prioritize who you are,

117
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,700
who you want to be in.
Don't spend time with anything that

118
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:01,701
antagonizes your character.
Don't drink the koolaid and it tastes

119
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,870
sweet,
but you will get cavities.

120
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,780
Tomorrow.
I live is not a popularity contest.

121
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,760
Be Brave.
Take the hill.

122
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,400
But first answer that question.
What's my hill?

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,770
So me,
how do I,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,330
how do I define success for me myself?
Well,

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,490
for me it's a measurement of five
things.

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,000
We got fatherhood,
we got being a good husband.

127
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,070
I've got my health,
mind,

128
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,851
body,
and spirit.

129
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,220
We've got career and we'd have
friendships.

130
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,920
These are what's important to me in my
life right now.

131
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,710
So I try to measure these five things
each day.

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,040
I check in with them.
I like to see whether or not I'm in the,

133
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,360
uh,
the,

134
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,810
the debit section or the credit section
with each one man in the red or I'm in

135
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:45,120
the black.
You follow for instance,

136
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,240
sometimes say my career's rolling.
Alright,

137
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,610
it's way up here in the black,
but I see my relationship with my wife

138
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,770
maybe could use a little bit more of my
attention.

139
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,410
I got to pick up the slack on being a
better husband.

140
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,660
Get that one out of the red or say my
spiritual health could use some

141
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,700
maintenance.
It's down here,

142
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:06,040
but a man,
my friendships and my social life there

143
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,160
in high gear,
right?

144
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,430
I've got to recalibrate.
Checks and balances.

145
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:13,890
I gotta go to church.
Remember to say thank you more often

146
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,670
something,
but I got to take the talent because I

147
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:22,671
want to keep all five in healthy shape
and I know that if I don't take care of

148
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,010
them,
if I don't keep up maintenance on them,

149
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,440
one of them is going to get weak.
Man,

150
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,410
it's gonna dip too deep into the debit
section.

151
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,400
It's going to go bankrupt.
It's going to get sick,

152
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,070
die.
So first we have to define success for

153
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,980
ourselves and then we have to put in the
work to maintain it.

154
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,650
Take that daily tally,
tend to our garden,

155
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,460
keep the things that are important to us
in good shape mean.

156
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,250
Let,
let,

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,780
let's admit it.
We've all got to wolves in a suit,

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,790
a good one and a bad and they both want
to eat

159
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,140
best.
I can tell.

160
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,450
We just got to feed that goodman a
little more than the other one.

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,910
Here we go.
Number five,

162
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,370
process of elimination is the first step
to our identity,

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,840
Aka where you are not is as important as
where you are.

164
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,540
Right?
Nineteen 92.

165
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,470
I got my first job as an actor.
Three lines,

166
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,260
three days work in a film called dazed
and confused.

167
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,170
Alright.
Alright.

168
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,320
Alright.
Alright,

169
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,463
there we go.

170
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,020
So this director of that film,
Richard Linklater,

171
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:42,950
he kept inviting me back to set each
night putting me in more scenes which

172
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,740
led to more lines,
all of which I happily said yes to.

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,530
I mean I'm having a blast.
People were telling me I'm good at what

174
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,920
I'm doing and they're writing me a check
for $325 a day.

175
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,060
I mean,
hell yeah.

176
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,740
Give me more scenes.
I love what I'm doing.

177
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,220
Well,
by the end of the shoot,

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,510
by the end of the film,
those three lines and turned into over

179
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:04,511
three weeks work and it was mine.
It was Woodson's 1970 Chevelle that we

180
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,680
went to go get aerosmith tickets in.
Man.

181
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,330
It was bad ass.
Well,

182
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,400
a few years ago I'm watching this film
again and I noticed two seems I really

183
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,470
shouldn't have been in and one of these
scenes,

184
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,000
my character wooderson I,
I accept screen left to head somewhere

185
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,050
and then I reentered the screen and
double check if any of the other

186
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:34,730
characters wanted to go with me now in
rewatching the film and you agree,

187
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:38,330
if you know wooderson what?
Kristen's not a guy who would ever say

188
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,680
later and then come back to see if you
were sure you didn't want to go.

189
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,350
Now when waterson leaves,
orders is gone.

190
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:46,520
He does not stutter.
Step,

191
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,470
flinch,
rewind as twice or solicit.

192
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,920
You know what I'm talking about
Waterson,

193
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,310
there's better things to do like liking
those high school girls,

194
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:57,110
man,
because I get older and they stayed the

195
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:01,440
same age point is I should not have been
in that thing.

196
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,780
It shouldn't have come back,

197
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,000
should've exited screen left and never
come back,

198
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,350
but back then making my first film,
getting invited back to the set,

199
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,590
cashing that check and having a ball.
I wanted more screen time.

200
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,450
I wanted to be in the scene longer and
more and come back into the scene.

201
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,130
Right?
But I shouldn't have been there.

202
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Wooderson shouldn't have been there.
It is just as important where we are not

203
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,080
as it is,
where we are.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,640
Look,
the first step that leads to our

205
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:39,450
identity.
Life is usually not.

206
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,630
I know who I am,
I know who I am.

207
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,040
That's not the first step.
The first step,

208
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,440
she usually I know who I am.
Not

209
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Process of elimination.
Defining ourselves by what we are not is

210
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,320
the first step that leads us to really
know who we are.

211
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,580
You know that group of friends that you
hang out with that there really might

212
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:04,530
not bring out the best in you,
you know they gossip too much or that

213
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,560
kind of shady really aren't going to be
there for you in a pinch,

214
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,620
or how about that bar that we keep going
to that we always seem to have the worst

215
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:18,350
hangover from or that computer screen,
right?

216
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,390
That computer screen that keeps giving
us an excuse not to get out of the house

217
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,450
and engage with the world and get some
real human interaction or how about that

218
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:30,310
food that would keep eating this stuff
that tastes so good going down,

219
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,070
it makes us feel like crap the next week
when we feel lethargic and we keep

220
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:34,904
putting on weight,

221
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,030
well those people,
those places,

222
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:41,600
those things stopped giving them your
time and energy.

223
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,250
Just don't go there.
I put them down and when you do this,

224
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,920
when you do put them down,
when you could go in there and you

225
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:53,300
couldn't given them your time,
you inadvertently find yourself spending

226
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:58,301
more time and in more places that are
healthy for you that bring you more joy.

227
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,230
Why?
Because you just eliminated the WHO's

228
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,080
the,
where's the Watson,

229
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,950
the winds that were keeping you from
your identity,

230
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,751
like,
trust me,

231
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,900
too many options.
I promise you the too many options will

232
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:16,520
make a tyrant of is all right,
so get rid of the excess,

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,120
the wasted time.
Decrease your options.

234
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,240
If you do this,
you will have accidentally,

235
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,110
almost innocently put in front of you
what is important to you by process of

236
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:33,750
elimination.
No one who we are is hard.

237
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,420
It's hard to give yourself a break.
Eliminate who you are,

238
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:43,140
not first and you're gonna.
Find yourself where you need to be.

239
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,270
I'm a six.
Don't leave crumbs and the beauty of

240
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:55,620
delayed gratification.
So what a crumbs.

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,720
The crumbs I'm talking about are the
choices that we make that make us have

242
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:05,721
to look over our shoulder in the future.
He didn't pay that guy back the money

243
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:09,840
that you owed him and tonight you just
saw him.

244
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,280
Three rail is behind you.

245
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,143
Shit.

246
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
You slept around on your spouse and you
just found out that Tamara,

247
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,430
she and the lady you were having an
affair with are going to be at the same

248
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,590
PTA meeting.

249
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,893
Shit again.

250
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,710
You drank too much last night.
You're too hung over to drive.

251
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,350
Your son is 8:00 AM,
Saturday morning baseball practice.

252
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,940
These are the crumbs.
They come in the form of regret,

253
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,870
guilt and remorse.
You leave trump's today.

254
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,390
They will cause you more stress
tomorrow,

255
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,490
and they disallow you from creating a
customized future in which you do not

256
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,740
have to look over your shoulder.
So let's flip the script.

257
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,210
Instead of creating outcomes that take
from us,

258
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,120
let's create more outcomes that pay us
back.

259
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,540
Fill us up.
Keep your fire lit,

260
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,140
turn you on for the most amount of time
in your future.

261
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,030
These are the choices I'm talking about
and this is the beauty of delayed

262
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,790
gratification.
Tee yourself up.

263
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,950
Do yourself a favor.
Make the choices,

264
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,160
the purchases today that pay you back
tomorrow.

265
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,930
Residuals in my business,
we call it mailbox money.

266
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,470
If I do my job well today and that movie
keeps rerunning on TV,

267
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,790
five years from now,
I'm getting checks in the mailbox.

268
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,840
It's a heck of a deal,
so whether it's prepping the coffee

269
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:36,560
maker the night before,
so all you got to do is press the button

270
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,490
in the morning or getting ready for the
job interview early so you don't have to

271
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:44,600
cram the night before or chooses not to
hook up with that married woman because

272
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:48,890
you know you're going to feel horrible
about it tomorrow and her husband

273
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:53,891
carries a gun or paying your debts on
time so that when you do see that guy

274
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,870
three rows back tonight,
you don't have to hunker down you seed

275
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,670
hoping that he don't see you.
Get some Roi.

276
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,010
You know what that is?
Return on investment.

277
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,430
Your investment.
You customize your future.

278
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,670
Don't leave trumps.
Number seven,

279
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,570
dissect your successes and the rest of
prosody of gratitude.

280
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,130
We so often focus on failure,
don't we?

281
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,550
We studied failure.
Obsess with failure.

282
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:38,551
We dissect failure in our failures,
dissect them so much.

283
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:44,140
We end up intoxicated with them to the
point of disillusion mean when we write

284
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:46,480
in our diary,
usually when we're depressed,

285
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,470
what do we gossip about?
Other people's flaws and limitations,

286
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,640
and we can dissect ourselves into
self-loathing if we're not careful.

287
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,290
I find that most of the times our
obsession with what is wrong just ends

288
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,290
up breeding more wrong,
more failure.

289
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,440
The easiest way to dissect success

290
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,360
is through gratitude,
giving thanks for that,

291
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:15,980
which we do have for what is working.
Appreciating the simple things we

292
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,730
sometimes take for granted.
We give thanks for these things and that

293
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:24,710
gratitude reciprocate,
creating more to be thankful for it.

294
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,760
It's really simple and it works.
Now I'm not saying be in denial of your

295
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,460
failures.
Now we can learn from them too,

296
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:39,461
but only if we look at them constructed
as a means to reveal what we are good

297
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,390
at,
what we can get better at,

298
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,450
what we do succeed at.
I personally,

299
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:48,070
I've read a whole lot of my bad reviews.
All right.

300
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,410
I've had quite few
written by the more talented critics.

301
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,380
They are the ones who give constructive,
bad reviews.

302
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,800
They reveal to me what did translate in
my work,

303
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:06,130
what came across,
what was seen or what was it.

304
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,190
Now,
I don't obsess on the unfavorable aspect

305
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:12,310
of their views review,
but I do see what I can learn from it

306
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,550
because their displeasure actually
uncovers.

307
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,980
It makes more apparent what I do do
well,

308
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,570
what I am successful at,
and then I just sat back.

309
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,400
I live some verb.
We try our best.

310
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,750
We don't always do.
Our best.

311
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,930
Architecture is a verb as well.
Yes,

312
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,590
it is,
and since we are the architects of our

313
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,420
own lives,
let's study the habits,

314
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:43,570
the practices,
the routines that we have that lead to

315
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,450
end feed our success,
our joy,

316
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,060
our honest pain,
our laughter,

317
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,840
our earn tears.
Let's dissect that and give thanks for

318
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,750
those things and when we do that,
guess what happens?

319
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,950
We get better at them and we have more
to dissect.

320
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,600
Number eight,
make voluntary obligations,

321
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,940
right?
Mom and dad,

322
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,970
since we were young,
they teach us things as children,

323
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,860
teachers,
mentors,

324
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,510
the government,
and on laws.

325
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:20,160
They all give this guidelines for which
to navigate this life rules to abide by.

326
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:24,420
In the name of accountability,
I'm not talking about those obligations,

327
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,590
I'm talking about the ones that we make
with ourselves,

328
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,390
with our God,
with our own consciousness.

329
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,110
I'm talking about the you versus you.
Obligations we have to have now.

330
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,890
Again,
these are not societal laws and

331
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,990
expectations that we acknowledge and
endow for anyone other than ourselves.

332
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,100
These are faith based obligations that
we make on our own.

333
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,440
These are not the lower insurance rates
for a good driving record.

334
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,360
You will not be fined or put in jail if
you do not gratify these obligations.

335
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:05,240
I speak of no one else covers these,
but you.

336
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,020
They are your secrets with yourself,
your own private counsel,

337
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,100
personal protocols,
and while nobody throws you a party,

338
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:16,490
when you abide by them,
no one's going to arrest you when you

339
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:21,491
break them either except yourself
or some cops who got a disturbing the

340
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,900
peace call at 2:30 in the morning
because you were playing bongos.

341
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
You birthday suit.
Yeah,

342
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,790
that was me
and honest man's pillow is,

343
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:37,030
is peace of mind and when you lay down
on that pillow at night,

344
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,780
no matter who's in your bed,
we all sleep alone.

345
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,370
These are your personal jimminy cricket
and there are not enough cops in the

346
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,660
entire world to them.

347
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,710
It's on you.
It's on you

348
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,310
now.
Midnight from Cannes to want.

349
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,291
Alright,
check this out.

350
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:04,000
In 1995 I got my first big paycheck as
an actor.

351
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:08,530
I think it was 150 grand.
The film is almost boys on the side and

352
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:11,680
we were shooting in Tucson,
Arizona and I had this sweet little

353
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,160
adobe guest house on the edge of this
swirl,

354
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,080
national park.
The house came with a maid.

355
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,110
My first made.
It was awesome.

356
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,190
So I got a friend over one Friday night
and we're having a good time and I'm

357
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,210
telling her about how happy I am with my
setup.

358
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,910
The house,
the made,

359
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,800
especially the maid.
I'm telling her look like she cleans the

360
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,300
place up.
After I go to work,

361
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,160
she washes my clothes,
the dishes,

362
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,510
put fresh water by my bed,
leads me cooked meal.

363
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:43,511
Sometimes she even presses my jeans
and my friend,

364
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:47,350
she smiles at me happy that I'm excited
over this.

365
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,380
She says,
well,

366
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:51,630
that's great matthew.
Uh,

367
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,530
if you like your jeans pressed.
And I kinda looked up batter,

368
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:00,200
my jaw hanging open.
I stuttered a moment.

369
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,620
Had that dumb ass slip that you get when
you just been told the truth and you

370
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,390
didn't think about it.
And he hit me.

371
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,350
I hate that line going down in front of
my jeans.

372
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,020
I hate that line.
And it was then for the first time that

373
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,760
I noticed it,
I never thought about not liking that

374
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:20,150
starts sliding down the front of my
genes because I'd never had a maid

375
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:22,980
Dharma jeans before.
And since she did.

376
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:26,460
Now for the first time in my life,
I just liked it because I could get it.

377
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,040
I never thought about it,
but I really wanted it.

378
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,570
Well,
I didn't want it there.

379
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,310
That line.
And that night I learned something just

380
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,180
because you can.

381
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,580
Nah,
come on.

382
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,000
It's not a good enough reason to do
something.

383
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,760
Even when it means having more,
be discerning,

384
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,740
choose it because you want it,
do it because you want to

385
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,200
never had my jeans pressed again.
A hate that line number 10,

386
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,200
a roof is a man made thing.
This may cut a little close to the bone

387
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,820
since the geography,
but I think we all were there and we uh,

388
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,840
allow,
remember where we were.

389
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,300
But in January the third,
19,

390
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,150
93,
he was the nfl playoffs in your Houston

391
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:29,151
oilers for planning the buffalo bills.
The olders rubbed 28 to three at

392
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,420
halftime.
Thirty five to three early in the third

393
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,030
frank break and the bills come back to
when?

394
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:41,031
Forty one to 38 and over time for one of
the greatest comebacks in NFL history.

395
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,050
Yeah,
the bills one.

396
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,610
But they didn't really beat the,
the others lost that game.

397
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,720
They beat themselves.

398
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,153
Yeah,
I remember that.

399
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Why?
Why did they beat themselves or how was

400
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:58,980
it?
Because it halftime,

401
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,470
they put a ceiling,
a roof,

402
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,680
a limit on their belief in themselves,
Aka the prevent defense.

403
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,000
Or maybe they started thinking about the
next opponent in the playoffs.

404
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,841
It halftime.
I mean,

405
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:17,230
they were up and they came out and
played on their heels,

406
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,870
lost the mental edge,
the entire second half and wall up.

407
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,530
They lost in a mere two quarters
defensive coordinator,

408
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,970
Jim Eddie went from being called the
defensive coordinator of the year and

409
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:35,971
the man first in line to be a high a
head coach next year to a man without a

410
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:40,710
job in the NFL.
You ever choked?

411
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,050
Nobody has ever choked.
I have

412
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,620
been talking about fumbling the goal
line,

413
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,040
second foot in your mouth.
Once you got to the microphone,

414
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,140
had a brain freeze on the exam that you
were totally prepared for.

415
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,700
Forgot the punchline to a joke in front
of 40,000 graduating students at the

416
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,700
University of Houston commencement,
or maybe you've had that feeling of,

417
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,710
oh my God,
life just cannot get any better than

418
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:12,310
this moment and ask yourself,
do I deserve this?

419
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,080
Now what happens when we get that
feeling tense up?

420
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,440
We have this sort of outer body
experience where we are literally three

421
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,460
seeing ourself in the third person and
we realized that the moment just got

422
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,640
bigger than us.
They were felt that way,

423
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,853
I have,

424
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,980
and it's because we have created a
fictitious ceiling,

425
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:44,981
a roof to our expectations of ourselves,
a limit where we think it's all too good

426
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,010
to be true,
but it's not,

427
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,180
and it's not our right to say or believe
it is.

428
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,380
We shouldn't create these restrictions
on ourselves.

429
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,330
Blue ribbon a statue,
a score,

430
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,990
a great idea.
The love of our life are euphoric.

431
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,910
Bliss.
Who are we?

432
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
The thing that we don't deserve or
haven't earned these gifts.

433
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:12,330
When we get them,
it's not all right,

434
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,490
but if we stay in process within
ourselves,

435
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
in the joy of the doing,
we will never choke at the finish line.

436
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,250
Why?
Because we are thinking of the finish

437
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:29,860
line because we're not looking at the
clock.

438
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:32,620
We're not watching ourselves on the
Jumbotron,

439
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,140
performing the very act that we're in
the middle of.

440
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,180
No,
we're in process.

441
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,620
The approach is the destination and
we're never finished.

442
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,200
Bo Jackson,
what did do?

443
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,830
He used to run over the goal line
through the endzone end of the tunnel,

444
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
the greatest snipers and marksman in the
world.

445
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:54,450
They don't aim at the target.
They aim on the other side of the

446
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:58,620
target.
We do our best when our destinations are

447
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:02,880
beyond the measurement,
when our reach continually exceeds our

448
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,570
grasp and when we have a more tool
finish lines,

449
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,750
and when we do this,
the race is never over.

450
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:14,751
The journey has no port adventure never
ends because we are always on the way,

451
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,360
so do this,
do this,

452
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,180
and let them let somebody else come up
and tap you on the shoulder and say,

453
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,000
hey,
you scored.

454
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,590
Let them run up and tap you on the show
and say,

455
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:29,760
man,
you want let them come tell you you can

456
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:33,270
go home.
Now let them say I love you too.

457
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,700
Let them say thank you.
Take the lid off.

458
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,660
The manmade roofs that we put above
ourselves and always play like an

459
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:47,140
underdog.
It would go number 11,

460
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,410
turn the page,
the late and Great University of Texas

461
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:57,490
football coach Darryl Royal.
Y'All remember when we won a national

462
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,540
champion in [inaudible],
69.

463
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,300
He won a couple of national
championships and it'll Darwalla.

464
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,430
He was a friend of mine,
a good friend of many people.

465
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,590
Now,
a lot of people looked up to this man.

466
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,630
One of the people looked up to him was a
musician named Larry.

467
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,800
Now at this time in his life,
Larry was in the prime of his country

468
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,830
music career.
He had number one hits and his life was

469
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,900
rolling and he had picked up a bad habit
of a snort and the white stuff somewhere

470
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:30,990
along the line and at one particular
party after a bathroom break,

471
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,720
Larry went confidently up to his mentor,
Darryl,

472
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,090
and he started telling the story,
Oh troy,

473
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,110
listen,
as he always had,

474
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,160
and when Larry finished his story and
was about to walk away,

475
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,790
coach royal put a gentle hand on his
shoulder and he very discretely said,

476
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,970
hey larry,
you got something on your on your nose

477
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:54,600
there.
But Larry immediately hurried to the

478
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,810
bathroom mirror where he saw some of the
white powder that he hadn't cleaned up

479
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:59,670
his nose.
He was ashamed.

480
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,190
He was embarrassed as much because he
felt so disrespectful to coach royal and

481
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:08,730
as much because he'd obviously gotten
too comfortable with the drug,

482
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,180
even hide it as well as he should.
Well,

483
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,160
the next day Larry went to coach's
house,

484
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,260
he rang the doorbell coach answered,
and he said,

485
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:17,490
coach,
I need to talk to you.

486
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,481
Dale said,
sure.

487
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,314
Come on.
In,

488
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,270
Larry confessed.
He purged his sins to coach.

489
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:28,530
He told him how embarrassed he was and
how he had lost his way in the midst of

490
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,820
all this fame and fortune,
and towards the end of an hour,

491
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,100
Larry,
who was in tears,

492
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,410
he asked coach.
He said,

493
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,270
coach,
what do you.

494
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:44,060
What do you think I should do?
I coach being a man of few words,

495
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,550
just looked at him and hey,
call me.

496
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,393
Said,

497
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,043
Larry,

498
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,410
I have never had any trouble turning the
page in the book of my life.

499
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,460
Larry got sober that day and he's been
sober for the last 40 years.

500
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,540
You ever get in a Rut?
I'm talking about you.

501
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,770
Get the funk stuck on the merry.
Go around.

502
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:10,720
Have a bad habit I have,

503
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,230
but

504
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,110
we're going to make mistakes.
You've got to own them.

505
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,310
Then you got to make amends and then you
gotta move on.

506
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,960
Guilt and regret kills many.
Amanda,

507
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,760
who their time,
so turn the page,

508
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,590
get off the ride.
You are the author of the book of Your

509
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,420
Life.
Turn that page.

510
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,580
Number 12,
give your obstacles credit.

511
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,390
You know those,
um,

512
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,370
no fear.
Tee shirts that were out,

513
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,140
I don't know,
he used to wear them 10 years ago.

514
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:49,180
No fear
may remember.

515
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,770
Those are just me.
I saw them everywhere.

516
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,400
All right.

517
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,530
I don't get them and I never did.
I mean I tried to scare myself at least

518
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:00,640
once a day.
I mean,

519
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,400
I get butterflies every morning before I
go to work.

520
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,520
I was nervous before I got here to speak
tonight.

521
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:09,340
I think fear is a good thing now.
Why?

522
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,200
Because it increases our need to
overcome that fear,

523
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,320
right?
So say your obstacle is fear of

524
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:20,350
rejection.
Now you want to ask her out or you want

525
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:24,130
to ask him out,
but you feared that he or she may say no

526
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,550
to you.
You want to ask your boss for that

527
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,750
promotion,
but you're scared.

528
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,730
He's going to think you're overstepping
your bounds.

529
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,520
Well,
instead of denying those fears,

530
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,610
declare them.
Say the fear out loud,

531
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,220
admitted.
Give them the credit they deserve.

532
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Don't get all macho and act like they're
no big deal and don't get paralyzed by

533
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:49,180
denying that they exist and therefore
abandoning your need to overcome them.

534
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,570
I mean,
I even subscribe to the belief that

535
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,960
we're all destined to have to do the
thing that we fear the most anyway at

536
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:59,920
some point.
So give your obstacles credit and you

537
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:03,310
will one,
find the courage to overcome them or you

538
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:07,750
will to see more clearly that they're
not really worth prevailing over.

539
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,970
So be brave.
Have courage.

540
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,670
And when you do,
you get stronger.

541
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,940
You get more aware,
you get more respectful of yourself and

542
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:20,450
that which you fear.

543
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:27,550
Number 13.
So how do we know when we crossed the

544
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:32,270
truth?
13th and was asking why did I picked 13?

545
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,480
That's an unlucky member.
Well,

546
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,200
I don't know.
When 13 got the bad rap and became the

547
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,490
world numerology,
it's never done me wrong.

548
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,450
13,
in fact,

549
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,670
13 has been a pretty lucky number for
me.

550
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:48,671
And I want to tell you how
I've always taken these 21 day trips by

551
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,900
myself to far off places where I usually
don't know the language and nobody knows

552
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,900
my name,
their adventures one,

553
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:00,080
but they're also a purge their cleanse
for me,

554
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:05,081
they're like a 21 day fast from tension
from all the things I have in my well

555
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,220
appointed life.
There are check out so I can check in

556
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,340
with me,
see how I'm doing.

557
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,800
He forced to be my own and my only
company to have a look in my mirror.

558
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,190
And we all know what can happen when we
do that.

559
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:25,310
Sometimes we do not like what we see.
Well,

560
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,420
in 1996,
uh,

561
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,550
right after I got famous from a film I
did couple of time to kill.

562
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,863
I,
uh,

563
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,130
I headed out on one of these 21 day walk
about and this time to the jungles in

564
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:44,141
the mountains of Peru.
The sudden fame that I just gotten was

565
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,630
somewhat.
I'm on balancing.

566
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,920
My face was everywhere.
Everyone wanted a piece of me.

567
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,910
People I'd never met were swearing that
they loved me everywhere I went there.

568
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,340
I was on a billboard of magazine cover.
It was,

569
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,120
it was just weird overall,
you know,

570
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,940
as I was asking myself,
what's the reality in this and what's

571
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,220
the bullshit?
Did I deserve all this?

572
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,720
These are all questions I was asking
myself who was I was another.

573
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,920
Now there's always an initiation period
with these trip,

574
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,080
an amount of time that it takes for the
place to initiate the traveler,

575
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,990
the time it takes to disconnect from the
world.

576
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,750
We just left and become completely
present in the one we are traveling in

577
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,361
now.
For me,

578
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:30,110
that initiation period,
use the last about 13 days,

579
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,760
13 hellish days until I'm out of my own
way.

580
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,090
Well,
it was the night of the Twelfth Day.

581
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,920
My 21 day trip I'm settling into camp,
had already hiked 80 miles to this point

582
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:47,921
and I had a three day trek atomy to
Machu Picchu and I was full on sick of

583
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:50,390
myself.
Wrestling with the loss of anonymity.

584
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,860
I was guilt ridden for the sins of my
past.

585
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,830
Had a lot of grit.
I was lonely,

586
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,020
disgusted with my company,
mine grappling with these demons on this

587
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,853
night.
I couldn't sleep

588
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,920
all of these badges and banners and
expectations and anxieties that I was

589
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:09,170
carrying with me.
I needed to free myself from them,

590
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,740
so I stripped down to nothing.
I.

591
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,140
I took every moniker that gave me pride
and confidence,

592
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,670
all the window dressings,
the packaging around the product.

593
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,990
I discard them all.
I got rid of my lucky and faithful

594
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:27,650
American cap.
I stripped off all my talismans from

595
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:31,370
adventures past.
I even discarded my late father's gold

596
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:33,730
ring with an m on it that he gave to me
and it was.

597
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,800
It was a meltdown of he and my mom's
classrooms and gold from mom's teeth.

598
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,620
Even got rid of that.
I was naked,

599
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,920
literally and figuratively,
and I got sick,

600
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,940
felt clean.
I felt free and light

601
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,930
long,
a muddy path on this walk.

602
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:56,160
I,
I turned a corner and they're in the

603
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
middle of the road.
Was was this Mirage.

604
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,330
It's magnificent.
Pinks and blues and red colors that I'd

605
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,310
ever seen it.
It was electric,

606
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,990
glowing and vibrant.
Just hovering just off the surface of

607
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:13,800
the jungle floor as if it was plugged
into some neon powerplant.

608
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,130
I stopped.
I stared.

609
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,630
There was no way around it.

610
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,640
The jungle floor in front of me was
actually thousands of butterflies

611
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,080
there in my path.
It was spectacular,

612
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,540
so I stayed a in somewhere in my
captivation I heard this little voice

613
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,400
inside my head.
Say these words,

614
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,140
all I want is what I can see
and all I can see is what's in front of

615
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:45,130
me.
Now,

616
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,520
at that moment have I had stopped
anticipating what was around the corner

617
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,300
for the first time,
I stopped thinking about what was coming

618
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,550
up next,
what was up ahead.

619
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,720
Time slowed down.
I was no longer in a rush to get

620
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,200
anywhere and my anxieties were greatly
ease.

621
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,230
Few hours later,
I returned to camp.

622
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,380
Even the local Sherpas I was traveling
with,

623
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,400
they they noticed calling out to me,
so he's losing Mateo so he's lose,

624
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,460
which means you are light in Spanish.
The I forgave myself.

625
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,470
That morning I let go of the guilt,
the wait,

626
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,860
it was on.

627
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,050
My shoulders was lifted,
my penance was paid,

628
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,530
and I got back in good graces with my
God and I shook hands with myself,

629
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,230
my best friend,
the one that we're all stuck with

630
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:34,800
anyway,
ourselves and from that morning on the

631
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,870
adventure was awesome.
I was president.

632
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,720
I was out of my own way.
I was not anticipating next.

633
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,960
I was embracing only what was in front
of my eyes and giving everything that

634
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,850
justice that he deserved.
See,

635
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,900
I crossed the truth that morning.
Now did I find it?

636
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,670
I don't know.
I think it found me.

637
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,200
Why?
Because I put myself in a place to be

638
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:59,070
found.
I put myself in a place to receive the

639
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,190
truth.
So how do we know when we crossed the

640
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,990
truth?
Well,

641
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,670
I think the truth is all around us all
the time.

642
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,640
I mean,
I think the answer,

643
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:09,480
you know,
it's always right there or right there.

644
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,670
I think it's all around us.
We just don't always see it.

645
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,990
We don't always grasp it here.
It access it usually because we're not

646
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:19,470
in the right place to do so.
So what do we do

647
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,480
first?
I believe we've got to put ourselves in

648
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:27,770
the place to receive the truth.
Let's do it.

649
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,040
We live in an extremely noisy world with
all kinds of frequencies coming at us.

650
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,750
We've got commitments.
We got deadlines,

651
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,010
fix this,
do that.

652
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,130
Plans,
expectations,

653
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,860
and they all make it hard to get clarity
and peace of mind,

654
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,420
so we have to consciously put ourselves
in places to receive that clarity.

655
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,910
Now that may be prayer,
that may be meditation,

656
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:48,820
that may be a walkabout,
that may be being in the right company,

657
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,590
a road trip,
whatever it is for you.

658
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,670
Schedule that time,
schedule it

659
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,800
so
we do that.

660
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,200
If we hear it,
we've put ourselves in a place to hear

661
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:03,240
it and we do,
and it's become clear,

662
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,100
a truth,
natural and infinite.

663
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,940
Then the second part comes,
which is to personalize it.

664
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,620
Ask yourself how it works for you,
how it applies to you personally,

665
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:16,680
why you need it in your life
specifically,

666
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,980
and if you do that,
then comes the third part.

667
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,790
Had the patience to internalize it
and get it from our intellectual head.

668
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,060
Thinking about it and into our bones and
our soul.

669
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,070
And our instinct now,
we cannot rush this part.

670
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,520
It does take time.
So if we get that far,

671
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,820
we've received it,
we personalize it and internalize it.

672
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:41,490
If we make it,
that got to have the courage to act on

673
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:43,650
it,
they actually take it into our daily

674
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:48,651
lives and practice it to make it an
active part of who we are and live it

675
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,550
and do that.
Right?

676
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,980
If we do that,
then we have what I believe is heaven

677
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:57,060
right here on earth.

678
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,190
I mean,
that's the ticket in it.

679
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,250
Think about it.
I know that's where I want to live

680
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,680
while we're here and they're going to
run across the jumbo tron.

681
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:12,681
Let's make it a place where we break a
sweat where we believe,

682
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,500
where we enjoyed the process of
succeeding in the places,

683
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:20,520
in ways that we're fashion to where we
don't have to look over our shoulder

684
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,590
because we're too busy doing what we're
good at voluntarily keeping our own

685
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:30,480
council because we want to traveling
towards immortal finish lines.

686
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,840
We write our own book,
overcoming our fears.

687
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:38,841
We make friends with ourselves and Matt
Place and I'm talking about.
