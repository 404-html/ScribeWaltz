1
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,740
I want to get busy on the first couple
of subjects for today.

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,570
Everybody that's okay.
Say I'm okay.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,460
Here's the first subject that I've found
so interesting.

4
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:24,710
I want to share it with you.
Then I want to talk about personal

5
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:28,880
development of the subject that I
started listening to age 25.

6
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:31,970
That revolutionized my whole life from
my mentor,

7
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:36,070
Mr Earl shoaff.
Here's an interesting subject.

8
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:36,901
Just jot it down.
Now.

9
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:41,901
It's called enlightened self interest,
enlightened self interest.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,390
It's a fascinating study to study the
idea of self interest,

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,410
but just make this note,
all of us,

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,170
you know,
have self-interest.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,270
Key is for it to be enlightened so that
everybody wins and no one loses.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,450
Our first interest is to survive.
What does it take to survive?

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,840
Our second interest is to succeed.
What does it take to succeed?

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,670
What does it take for me personally to
survive and to succeed?

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,530
Can I legitimately be interested enough
in the things that helped me both

18
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:33,531
succeed and survive,
and here's what I discovered.

19
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:38,851
The answer is yes.
It's possible to exercise self interest,

20
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,870
but to do it in such a way that no one
loses everyone benefits.

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Keyphrase life was not designed to give
us what we need.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,270
Life was designed to give us what we
deserve.

23
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,450
We did not reap a harvest in the fall
because we need it.

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,440
We reap a harvest in the fall because we
deserve it.

25
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,110
Not necessarily from a moral standpoint.
Of course,

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,180
of course,
there are some moral laws as well,

27
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,010
spiritual and moral laws,
but just the basic laws that simply say,

28
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:25,250
if you wish to read,
you must plant,

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,810
so jot this down.
Reaping is reserved for the planters

30
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,070
and the reason they reap is because they
deserve it.

31
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,230
They're the planters they deserved to
read.

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,780
Interesting Bible phrase that says,
if you keep knocking,

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,110
you will find open doors.
Good phrase to jot down.

34
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:50,480
If you keep knocking,
you will find open doors,

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,230
doors of opportunity.
Doors have a chance to meet someone.

36
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,260
Doors open for association doors.
Open to find someone special doors open

37
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:04,090
to find a unique business colleague.
If you keep knocking the door,

38
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,550
the phrase says,
doors of opportunity are open to those

39
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,791
who continually knocked,
so we don't find open doors of

40
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:19,860
opportunity because we need.
We find them because we deserved only

41
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:24,861
those who knock deserve to find an open,
but the promise is if you continually

42
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,970
knock,
you'll find doors of opportunity.

43
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,410
It says,
if you search,

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,340
you will find
so I'll make the note.

45
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,170
It's good finding is reserved for the
searchers

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,350
because they deserve it.
Now,

47
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:53,010
at first they may have needed it,
but they now know that just needing it

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,980
is not sufficient.
If they need it now,

49
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:59,880
they must qualify for it.
The reason why you're going to be

50
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:02,820
blessed with good ideas this weekend is
because you've come searching,

51
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,310
gotten on an airplane to come searching.
Got It in your automobile to come

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,570
searching.
You got here searching.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,650
Now you're ready to receive,
and for those who have search,

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,340
they will find answers.
They will find plans,

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,980
imagination to stir yourself into action
for future benefit.

56
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,110
So if you search to find a good idea,
you'll go looking,

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
searching.
You've got to go to church,

58
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,780
you've got to go to class,
you've got to go to the seminar,

59
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,870
you've got to go to the library.
You've got to go to the books.

60
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,310
If you wish to find,
rarely does a good idea,

61
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,163
interrupt you

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,313
rarely,

63
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,840
but if you will search,
you will find it so we get not what we

64
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,340
need,
but we get what we deserve.

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,820
It's just if you ask,
someone has an answer,

66
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,960
if you keep asking,
the answers belong to you because by

67
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:06,070
virtue of asking,
you have qualified so we don't get what

68
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,370
we need.
We get what we deserve.

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,940
The mother on welfare should be taught
in some small.

70
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,600
Enter the.
Hopefully she can begin deserving the

71
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,830
welfare kid,
not getting it because she needs it now,

72
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,260
starting to get it because she deserves
it.

73
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,670
If the welfare worker says to Mary,
Mary,

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,770
I brought a bucket of paint and a paint
brush,

75
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,990
and the next time I come,
if the door is painted in the fence here

76
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:41,470
in front is painted,
I give you the check for $450.

77
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,230
Not the painting,
the door and painting the fence is worth

78
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,180
$450.
It's not worth that much,

79
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:50,350
but it is the beginning of the process.
So make that note.

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,650
I want to begin the process of
deserving.

81
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,480
What would that be?
What process should I begin engaging in

82
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,730
to deserve good health,
to deserve a good relationship,

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,440
to deserve prosperity,
to deserve an enterprise,

84
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,980
to deserve the opportunity to build the
city

85
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,340
must I do to begin the process of
deserved

86
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,550
so now the welfare worker comes back and
the door is painted in the fences

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,080
painted and now Mary gets the $450 to
help take care of her children.

88
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,140
Not because she needs it,
but because she's beginning to deserve

89
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,870
it and the welfare worker thinks of some
other project.

90
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,891
She said,
Mary,

91
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,940
if these weeds are gone and this little
garden has cultivated when I come back,

92
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,780
now that the door is painted and the
fence is paid it,

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,190
if the weeds are gone and this little
garden has cultivated,

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,430
you get the $450 and step by step.
A new life is emerging.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,360
Learning the process of deserving it,
not just

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,010
we teach our children at home,
right?

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Child says,
I need $10 so that language doesn't work

98
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,610
here.
There's plenty of money here and the

99
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,570
vaults are full,
but to say I need $10 is not how you

100
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,560
open the vault.

101
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,200
So the channel says,
what?

102
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,990
Wow,
how can I get that $10 that I need?

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,150
So here's what they learned to say,
how could I earn $10?

104
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,160
Now the vault opens up.
Now the money starts to flow.

105
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,610
How can I earn $10?
What could I do to earn the money?

106
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,270
Not to get the money because you need
it,

107
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:36,271
but if you maybe you need the money.
That's all of us have needs here.

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,830
The key is to figure out how to open the
vault,

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,570
how to open the bank,
how to open this unbelievable flow of

110
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:49,410
resources to come our way and here's the
key to deserve it,

111
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,550
not to need it.
You can't walk out to the field and say

112
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,810
to the field,
I need to crop.

113
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,950
Here's what the field says.
Here's what the ground says.

114
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,640
Who is this clown that brings me his
need but brings me no seed,

115
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,370
so jot that down.
Take your seed to the marketplace,

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,100
not your need.
Don't disclose your need to the

117
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,930
marketplace,
only your willingness.

118
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,000
We'll talk about that a little later
today

119
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,900
because the marketplace is not
interested in your knee,

120
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,680
but they are interested in your seed.
They're interested in your willingness

121
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,940
to work.
They're interested in your disciplines.

122
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:31,941
They're interested in your eagerness.
They're interested in your vitality and

123
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,290
your work ethic.
That's what the marketplace is

124
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,800
interested in,
not your need that you're seed.

125
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,293
Okay?

126
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,900
We get what we deserve.
Old Testament.

127
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,460
God says,
if you'll move toward me,

128
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,960
I'll move toward you.
See,

129
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,410
that's how you get those occasions to
meet God.

130
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,070
You must make the move.
God could say you don't move.

131
00:08:58,031 --> 00:08:59,320
I don't move.
You say,

132
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:00,154
well,
that's arbitrary.

133
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,330
Well,
when you're God,

134
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:06,331
you can make it that way.
So

135
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,750
the law says,
if you wish to receive.

136
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,060
Now let's talk about enlightened self
interest.

137
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:21,140
If you wish to receive,
and we would call the wish to receive

138
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:24,320
self interest,
but if it's enlightened,

139
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,120
self interest.
Here's what it says.

140
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,240
I understand that in order to receive,
I must view

141
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,780
receiving is reserved for those who
give.

142
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,490
Receiving is not reserved for those who
need it.

143
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,050
It's reserved for those who deserve it.
We deserve the receiving,

144
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,640
giving.
In fact,

145
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,230
there's an extraordinary phrase in just
a little context and here's what it is.

146
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:57,520
It's better to give
than it is to receive.

147
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,910
Now the uneducated person would find
that difficult to ponder.

148
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,810
Why would it be better to give than it
is to receive?

149
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,210
So let me give you one of the better
phrases for the day.

150
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:10,810
Here it is.
Giving starts the receiving process.

151
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,783
Yes,

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,650
so of course it's better.

153
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,850
Yeah,
it is.

154
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,030
How much receiving do you wish you must
start?

155
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:23,320
The giving process

156
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,170
for me to receive my additional fortunes
for the future,

157
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,870
not necessarily for the money because I
don't need them.

158
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
I take them up.
I don't need them,

159
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,420
but here's what I do need for someone to
say,

160
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,860
a year from now,
five years from now,

161
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:46,360
Mr Ryland net seminar helped to change
my life and for whatever reason,

162
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,950
I was brought here to this place for
this time and later someone says that

163
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,850
seat to receive that kind of thinks.
It's unbelievable.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,850
Here's what you cannot buy,
that kind of thing.

165
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,110
You can't buy it with money.
You have to earn it.

166
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,300
Now,
let's expand a little further now that

167
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,880
it's called the law of riches and wealth
in our own self interest.

168
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:24,181
If we wish to be rich and wealthy and
prosperous and healthy and all the

169
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:28,180
valuable things we can think of for the
human experience,

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,660
how could we get there?
It's understanding the law of

171
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,600
enlightened self interest in the law of
deserving.

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,810
The question was asked in the Bible,
how can we be great?

173
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,980
What is the key to greatness?
Great Wealth,

174
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
great return,
great accolades,

175
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,980
trophies to put on the mantle above the
fireplace.

176
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:55,840
How can we get great respect?
Great Richard's great abundance for

177
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,550
ourselves.
How can we get that?

178
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,440
And the answer was given,
and here was the answer.

179
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:04,360
Find a way to serve.
Find a way to serve the mini.

180
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,670
So I paraphrase it.
To read this service.

181
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:11,970
Too many leads to greatness,
service.

182
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,030
Too many leads to greatness.
Someone says,

183
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,630
well,
about the best I can do is take care of

184
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:20,980
myself.
That's okay.

185
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:25,450
Self care has its own reward,
but it's very limited.

186
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,351
Let me.
It says,

187
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:29,910
I can't be worried about other people's
problems.

188
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,360
I got enough problems of my own.
That's okay.

189
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,430
Self defense is okay.
Self preservation is okay,

190
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:40,350
but it has a very limited reward.
If you wish to change that into

191
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,880
abundance,
prosperity,

192
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:44,300
and uniqueness,
then here's what you must do.

193
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,540
Help solve other people's problems.
Help finances for someone else,

194
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,400
not just for yourself,
but for someone else.

195
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,030
And in that kind of service,
you now begin the process of grief.

196
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,160
Someone asked the question,
how can I be ruler over many?

197
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,350
How could I manage a lot of people?
How could I be the leader of a vast

198
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,050
movement or enterprise?
Here was the answer.

199
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,620
Nothing wrong with that,
which we call that self interest of the

200
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:21,621
highest kind wishing to be the manager,
the ruler bushing to be presiding over

201
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,200
many people.
Here was the answer.

202
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,180
Be Faithful when the amounts are small.

203
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,930
Be Faithful when there's just a few.
Be disciplined when there's only a few

204
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,950
that starts to entitle you to someday be
ruler over many.

205
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,351
You say,
well,

206
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,330
if I had a big organization,
you know,

207
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:46,140
I'd really run it with a strong hand and
I'd be a fabulous leader,

208
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,910
but I've only got a few and I don't know
where they are.

209
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,660
See that that's not gonna work.
If you wish to preside over Richard,

210
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,470
so you must start with the amounts are
small.

211
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,741
Someone says,
Oh,

212
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,570
if I had a fortune,
I'd really take good care of it,

213
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,700
but I've only got a paycheck.
I don't know where it goes.

214
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,470
See not knowing where it goes,
disqualifies you now for presiding over

215
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:15,570
the fortune.
We've all heard that,

216
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,250
right?
I don't know where it all goes.

217
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,060
Do you ever hear that expression or we'd
love to have you run the company.

218
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,530
You don't know where it all goes.
Somebody says,

219
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,070
it just gets away from me.
Oh,

220
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:27,600
we'd love to have you run the world,
right?

221
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:32,601
It just gets away from you.
Somebody says it's only pennies and it's

222
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:36,450
only a few.
Here is where you begin to qualify for

223
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:40,830
abundance and riches and greatness and
respect is to be disciplined when the

224
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:41,700
amounts are small.

225
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,840
Someone finds it unique,
right?

226
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,510
That this many people would come here.
What I've got to say for the whole

227
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:51,240
weekend,
but this is not where I started.

228
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,720
I started with just a few,
but I was so unfamiliar with the few

229
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,890
trying to translate for them in my
awkward ways back then what had happened

230
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,210
to me.
My life got changed,

231
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,100
my income got changed,
my health got changed,

232
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,950
everything got changed for the better,
and now I've lived the most

233
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,920
extraordinary life,
but it started with my passion for just

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,740
a few to translate for just the few.
Someone says,

235
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,880
well,
they're just a few here.

236
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,590
You know,
does this meeting matter when there's

237
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,330
only a few in?
The answer's yes,

238
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,900
jot this down.
You never know who's in the audience,

239
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,040
whether it's a few or a thousand or
whatever,

240
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,760
but you got to be faithful when there's
just a few.

241
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,930
Tell your story when there's just a few.
Be just as passionate about ideas that

242
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,270
can change someone's life when there's
just a few.

243
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:38,540
Now you begin.
You're not fully qualified,

244
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:43,130
but you begin the qualification to
someday speak to many someday preside

245
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,430
over a vast crowd.
Someday be the manager or the leader of

246
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,380
millions.
It starts in those early days to deserve

247
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,550
it.
Now,

248
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,380
jot this down.
Also,

249
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,290
give yourself a chance to change some
things.

250
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,880
I held onto that.
I thought this was it.

251
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,110
This was it.
I'm telling you.

252
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,010
After a while,
I gave it up.

253
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:04,850
Found out it wasn't there,

254
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,070
so give yourself a chance to change.
Refine your philosophy,

255
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,150
refine your direction.
If you'll give yourself a chance to do

256
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,590
that,
here's what will happen down the road.

257
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,590
A ways a new door will open that you
haven't discovered before.

258
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,640
Give yourself a chance to change.
Re-Evaluate,

259
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,873
okay,

260
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,400
so let your library the testimonial of
your dedicated interest in accelerated

261
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:43,590
personal development that you will read
whatever you have to read,

262
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,830
you will hear whatever you must hear and
you will watch and see whatever you must

263
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:54,201
see in order to make your life refined
and worthwhile and achieve all of your

264
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:59,070
purposes.
That's what I want this stopping station

265
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,100
to be these three days just to come here
and sit for a while and listen and

266
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,380
ponder and take notes and work hard and
see if you can't absorb,

267
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,680
get all that you possibly can here so
that it will start to refine your life

268
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,940
even before you get on an airplane and
fly back to wherever you came from

269
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,770
before you get into your car and drive
away what we share with you here with

270
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,900
whatever all the rest that you've
learned.

271
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,510
This will be a catalyst to start a
process.

272
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,970
Even before you get home,
they'll start working for you.

273
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,110
Some of you are going to set some goals.
We're going to do the workshop tomorrow,

274
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,490
designing the next 10 years.
Hopefully you'll come up with some new

275
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,240
promises,
some new objectives,

276
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,720
some new ideas,
and by the time we're finished here,

277
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,280
these two,
three days,

278
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,790
I'm telling you,
you'll see yourself able to accomplish

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,020
two times,
three times,

280
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,390
five times more than you ever thought
was possible,

281
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,610
which will make this cost of this
seminar small price to pay,

282
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,460
and hopefully it'll make the time you
spent here small price to pay compared

283
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:09,600
to making this an investment in your
future and what will flow in,

284
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:14,601
in terms of money and income and return
and reward and respect and dignity and

285
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:18,570
accolades,
trophies,

286
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,190
all the stuff that can be yours,
a marriage that lasts forever,

287
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,070
a friendship that nourishes you forever.

288
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,060
Things that you'll find that you'll keep
and treasure for a lifetime.

289
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,130
Hopefully this is one of those weekends.
It takes a lot of effort to learn.

290
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
It takes a lot of effort to grow.
It takes a lot of effort to decide,

291
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
debate,
but jot this down.

292
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,210
It's all worth the price.
Whatever stimulates you to think.

293
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:49,920
Whatever stimulates you to wonder.
Whatever stimulates you to react or even

294
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,530
to debate.
Even if you hear something,

295
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:52,921
you'd say,
well,

296
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:54,360
that's not right.
See,

297
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,970
that's still valuable.
It means you're awake.

298
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,400
It means you're alert.
It means you're alive.

299
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,590
It means your mind is ready to take on
something whether it's agreeable or not,

300
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,390
agreeable,
something right,

301
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,040
something wrong.
Who cares what it is?

302
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,310
We've got to listen to a variety of
voices and some are going to come from

303
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:14,640
the left and some are going to come from
the right and some are going to come

304
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:18,930
from mysterious sources and some will
try to entice you with all kinds of

305
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,280
stuff,
but that's okay.

306
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,860
Just so you're alive and alert and
awake,

307
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,980
ready to process anything that comes
your way,

308
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,960
take the best of it and make it
beneficial for you so that tomorrow you

309
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,961
walk with a stronger step.
Next month you see a clearer vision and

310
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,990
a month from now,
the purpose for your life is multiplied

311
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:40,711
by two,
three,

312
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:44,040
five.
That's what I want to create here,

313
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,340
so now to hurry and get through because
we have so many subjects to cover.

314
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,920
Let's cover now some other things under
personal development.

315
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,890
Here's one that's important.
As you read and as you listen to and as

316
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,770
you study and as you grow,
and as you take notes and as you fill up

317
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:07,771
your journal
and then try to work on the ideas to

318
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,080
make yourself valuable in the
marketplace.

319
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,390
Here's something to remember.
Under personal development,

320
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:18,391
some things I had to learn.
First steps to success.

321
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,440
First of all,
you need good ideas.

322
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,020
Just decide right now.
You're going to accelerate your plan for

323
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,350
collecting good ideas,
ideas for your life,

324
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,270
ideas for your health,
ideas for your marriage,

325
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:38,271
your relationships,
ideas that stimulate one idea sometimes

326
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,500
lead to that leads to the next leads to
the next

327
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,080
and the four or five ideas in the future
that really thrust acceleration into

328
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,800
your life.
You couldn't have gotten unless you went

329
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,690
through the first one and the second one
and the third one.

330
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,640
Next,
you need a good plan,

331
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:56,900
so we're going to talk about time
management and game plans tomorrow.

332
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,690
Need a good health plan traveling around
the world.

333
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:07,620
You can imagine the kind of health plan
I have to have if I didn't have a super

334
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,560
extreme.
Got An underline the word extreme.

335
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,500
If I didn't have a superb extreme health
plan,

336
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,840
you think I could travel all over the
world.

337
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,040
People look at my calendar and say,
you know possible.

338
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,370
I'm the only one that can do it.
Everyone else do young,

339
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,280
incredible,
but I've got to be extremely healthy.

340
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,060
I can't let up at all in terms of diet,
nutrition,

341
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,080
exercise,
all that stuff in order to stay healthy,

342
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,460
so a good health plan,
a good family plan.

343
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,110
Here's a good one,
a good marriage plan.

344
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,790
Some people just go along,
married,

345
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,380
but their fingers crossed.
You got to have a better plan than that

346
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,370
summer whistling in the dark,
hoping everything will work out.

347
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,330
Not Not a good plan.
You need a good plan for how to use the

348
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,010
day.
We'll talk about that tomorrow.

349
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,850
Best kept secret of the rich,
how to use your time,

350
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,320
a good plan to meet the right people
over the right amount of time to

351
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,330
stimulate your life.
You need a game plan for lifestyle.

352
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,080
We'll talk about that later.
So to succeed,

353
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:22,330
we need good ideas and good plans.
Here's the next.

354
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,850
We have to learn to handle the passing
of time

355
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,590
because all of this takes time to learn,
to grow,

356
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:34,150
to change.
Getting through the seasons takes time.

357
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,730
The spring has a certain amount of time,
the summer as time harvest has time.

358
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,810
The winter has time.
Learning to handle the passing of time

359
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,390
dot this down.
If you're involved in business,

360
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,540
you've got to give your project time.
You've got to give people time.

361
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,050
Give people a chance to learn,
chance to grow,

362
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,440
chance to change.
One of the great requirements,

363
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,510
especially in such an industrialized,
busy,

364
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:03,040
mad dashing society and that is to have
people,

365
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:06,990
patients first,
we exercise it with our children or our

366
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833
family.

367
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,060
Getting people to work together,
got to have patience.

368
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,080
Even with your family,

369
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,900
if you're involved with independent
people,

370
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,830
it's a challenge.
It's like herding cats,

371
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,670
trying to get them to work together.
Herding sheep as easy.

372
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,340
They very quickly get going the same
direction,

373
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:31,900
but try herding cats.
It's like your children.

374
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,440
Different ages and different
personalities and different opinions to

375
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,360
get the family all going the same
direction.

376
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,010
Kind of working together to make things
work.

377
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,870
I'm telling you,
it is a challenge,

378
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,510
but if you'll have some patients,
you can do it.

379
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:44,380
Now,
here's the big one,

380
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:49,250
to have patience with yourself.
Give yourself time to learn.

381
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,980
Give yourself time to understand good
ideas.

382
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,690
Give yourself time to make changes and
then grow into those changes.

383
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,160
Give yourself time to refine your
personality,

384
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,280
to fit the business.
Whatever business you're engaged in,

385
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,750
some you may have to speak up a little
stronger and some you may have to calm

386
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:13,400
down just a little bit more.
Just learn to refine your personality

387
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:16,550
and your temperament to suit.
All of us could do that,

388
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:21,140
but it takes it takes time.
Have patience with yourself.

389
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,280
We had to do that from the beginning.
Learning to tie the shoe strings of your

390
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,990
shoes.
If you tried a couple of times and says,

391
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:31,370
I'll never learn this,
it's overseen.

392
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,050
No,
you can't go through life with your

393
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,860
shoe's untied.
Come on.

394
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,970
Some people,
maybe it happens for them in a little

395
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:40,610
quicker than others.
Some people get the hang of it almost

396
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,860
overnight.
Someone else that takes a little longer.

397
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:46,880
If it takes you a little longer,
have patience with yourself because

398
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:50,360
patients has its own reward.
Patience is a virtue of the

399
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:55,000
extraordinary kind.
We have to have patience with our

400
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,980
employers.
We have to have patients with government

401
00:24:56,981 --> 00:25:00,940
officials.
You've got to have patients with irs.

402
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,760
You've got to have patience with the
army.

403
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:06,220
You've got to have patience with the
FBI.

404
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,180
Here's a good thing to remember.
While you're exercising patients,

405
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,720
usually enough,
good people will finally make it right.

406
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,750
You just got to jot that down.
Usually enough,

407
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,330
good people will finally make it right.

408
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,380
Not everyone in the community is going
to toe the line and do the moral thing,

409
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,760
but let me tell you what most will.
That's how we create a society that we

410
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:35,940
can live in.
Most will.

411
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,470
Every teenager will not obey all the
rules and regulations and live a model

412
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,420
life.
Not everyone will,

413
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,660
but jot this down.
Most will enough will.

414
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,290
When the good Lord recruited 12,
not every disciple,

415
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,090
not every one of the 12,
but it was enough of the 12 to start a

416
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,230
movement that's lasted for 2000 years.
Not everyone,

417
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,790
but

418
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,623
enough.

419
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,940
There's only been a couple of exceptions
to that.

420
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:13,360
Rule.
One was the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

421
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:16,930
God was going to destroy Sodom and
Gomorrah for their evil ways.

422
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,190
Abraham had a friend that lived there
and Abraham and Florida and said,

423
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:23,560
God,
if I can go to Sodom and Gomorrah and

424
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,380
find 50 righteous people,
will you spare the city?

425
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,700
And God said,
Abraham,

426
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,620
you've been such an excellent friend of
mine.

427
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,930
Yes,
I'll spare the city if you can find 50.

428
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,570
So he searches the city,
can't find 50 good,

429
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,420
comes back and says,
lowered.

430
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Would you take 40
gods as Abraham for you?

431
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Come on,
I'll do it if you can find 40.

432
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,540
So we searches for 40,
can't find 40.

433
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,770
And he comes back and says,
would you take 30?

434
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Good Lord says Abraham only for you.
Will I reduce it to 30?

435
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,910
Can't find 30,
can't find 20.

436
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,420
Abraham said,
this is my last request.

437
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,450
Would you take 10?
God said only for you Abraham.

438
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,370
So he went searching for 10 and you
know,

439
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:36,371
the story couldn't find 10.
That's the exception to the rule.

440
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,640
So we said,
Abraham,

441
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:44,390
get your friend lot and his family out
of there because the end has gone,

442
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,710
but that's the exception to the rule.
So jot down the general rule.

443
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Most will in a civilized society,
most will obey the rules in government.

444
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:57,590
Most will,
not every senator will,

445
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:02,390
but what enough will to build a stable
government and a future.

446
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,260
Not everyone in the armed forces will,
but enough will.

447
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,760
Not everyone in the community will,
but enough with not every teenager in

448
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:11,571
this high school,
we'll,

449
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:15,320
but I'm telling you the most will and
that's how we survive in a civilized

450
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:19,690
society because most will.
And that's a good feeling to know most

451
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,533
wheel

452
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,643
okay?

453
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,640
So have patience.
Next,

454
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,980
under personal development is learning
to solve problems.

455
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,500
By the way,
having patients with the seasons takes

456
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,410
time to develop the crop.
You can't plant the seed,

457
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,810
dig around it in a few days saying,
where is it?

458
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,060
Where is it?
And you can't really help.

459
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,540
All you can do is nourish.
Some people planted spring,

460
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:55,541
leaving the summer,
just haven't got the patience to last.

461
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,690
So next comes solving problems,
business problems,

462
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:01,340
family problems,
personal problems,

463
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,380
financial problems,
emotional problems.

464
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,214
There's all kinds.

465
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,030
Here's a good idea.
I found in solving problems every once

466
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:09,960
in a while.
You've got to.

467
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,200
I've got it here,
but I can just describe it before you

468
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,740
take a piece of paper.
Put a line down the center of the paper,

469
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,780
and on the left side describe the
problem.

470
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,040
So just jot that down on a piece of
paper in half on the left side,

471
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,890
described the problem.
Sometimes it's a good idea to take a

472
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,630
problem out of your head and put it on
paper.

473
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,110
We'll talk a little bit more tomorrow
about how to think on paper.

474
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,090
This is one of the ways to think on
paper.

475
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,810
Our mind usually is too busy sometimes
to sort things out.

476
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,580
So if you take it out of your mind,
put it on paper,

477
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:42,250
what is the problem and you to describe
to the of your ability what the problem

478
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:44,140
is and then ask this question,
is that all of it?

479
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,480
Because if you're going to prescribe
something for the problem,

480
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:51,460
you need to know what all of the is.
When you've got it all listed on the

481
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,620
other side,
now of the paper's called answers and

482
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,390
solutions,
the problem on one side,

483
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,070
answers and solutions on the other side,

484
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,860
and now let me give you three questions,
three questions that can help solve

485
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:09,180
almost any problem.
Here are those questions.

486
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:11,310
Number one,
what could I do?

487
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,800
So just jot that down.
What can I do?

488
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Then you start developing what we call
working papers and the working papers

489
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:23,430
consist of making a list of the things
you could do to solve this problem.

490
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,650
Number one,
and you say,

491
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:28,820
well,
number one would take too long.

492
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,070
I can see that right now.
Let's go to number two.

493
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,050
Maybe that's the answer.
Number three,

494
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,913
no,
that isn't it,

495
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,880
and let's say you've got several points
now and you've done your best to try to

496
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,280
solve the problem yourself and you can't
solve it yourself.

497
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,190
Here's the second question.
What could I read?

498
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,570
Maybe somebody spent a lifetime
researching the problem you've got and

499
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,240
they've got some excellent answers from
a lifetime of research.

500
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,360
Maybe in your own journal,
you've taken notes before on something

501
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,110
you say,
Hey,

502
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,600
I remember a class site took.
Seems like there were some answers

503
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:01,590
there,
so you go back,

504
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,390
do a little research,
so under number two is research and if

505
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:10,470
you search what you will find if you
research,

506
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,980
you will find search and research.

507
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,730
Now research as soon as possible because
of the problem is severe.

508
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:26,810
You don't want to wait until too late.
My friend Kenny comes to me and says,

509
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,870
you just lost a beautiful lady,
fabulous lady.

510
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:31,970
They got a divorce.
She was really something.

511
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,640
Then after his divorce,
he comes to me and says,

512
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,530
you know it's over,
but he says,

513
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,670
you know something strange.
He said,

514
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:43,900
I found a book in my library that I
think would have saved my marriage if I

515
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:48,901
had read it before my divorce
and it was a book entitled how to live

516
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:53,020
with another person.
He said,

517
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,210
I should've read that book a long time
ago.

518
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,680
He finally read it,
but it was a little late.

519
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,640
It's like reading a book on nutrition
after you've had a heart attack.

520
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,474
Right.
To me,

521
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,940
that's good.
That is good,

522
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,330
like gosh,
it's so much better to read it before.

523
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,770
Spare yourself the agony and the last
time and maybe the loss of your life.

524
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,680
Now,
if you,

525
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,190
if you tried to solve it yourself and
you can't solve it and you've researched

526
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,630
and it doesn't seem like you've got the
answer.

527
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:28,300
Here's number three.
The third question is who could I ask?

528
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,040
Is there someone around me that might
have the answer to my

529
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,103
problem

530
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,970
now under that,
but here,

531
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,160
but this.
Don't ask first.

532
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:44,220
No.
Try to solve it yourself.

533
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,220
Develop some working papers.
What you think you might do that still

534
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:49,410
isn't it?
Here's some books I've read.

535
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:50,790
This guy's crazy.
This guy,

536
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,290
no answers,
haven't got it now I asked,

537
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,350
but if you now can show your working
papers to who you asked,

538
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,840
you can't believe how swift the answer
will come.

539
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,560
All of us have heard this,
but let's remind ourselves one more time

540
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:08,100
and put it in your notes.
We all love to help people who first of

541
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:13,101
all try to help themselves.
Back to the philosophy of deserve.

542
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,620
I've tried to work it out.
I haven't got the answer.

543
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,130
Maybe you can help me.
Somebody is very willing to help you if

544
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,930
they know you've tried first to help
yourself.

545
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,060
It works that way with our children.
Right.

546
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,141
My daughter,
Linda,

547
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,540
before she got married,
I used to travel a lot.

548
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,560
She comes to me and say,
Daddy,

549
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,850
I'm headed for Thailand.
I said,

550
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,170
wonderful.
She said,

551
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,370
I've saved up my money.
I said,

552
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:40,770
fantastic.
She said,

553
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:42,750
I've got a thousand dollars.
I said,

554
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,370
wonderful.
She said,

555
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:45,990
the kids wanted to go here.
I wanted to go there.

556
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,950
I didn't go.
They wanted to buy this one,

557
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,070
buy that I didn't buy.
I got my money.

558
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,960
Put aside a thousand dollars.
I said,

559
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,430
Linda,
unbelievable.

560
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,430
You must be my daughter.
That's fantastic.

561
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,560
Now she said,
to make the trip,

562
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,540
I only need a couple of thousand dollars
more.

563
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,970
An easy 2000.
Right?

564
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,460
But she knew she couldn't get the whole
three,

565
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,880
but she knew that if she worked hard to
the best of her ability and put that

566
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,700
first thousand together,
then next to is easy.

567
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,590
Right?
Okay.

568
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,330
So develop your working papers.
Do your best to solve problems.

569
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,310
Here's why you try to solve it on your
own.

570
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,130
First you need the mental and emotional
muscle.

571
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,680
You need the discipline.
If you just quickly go to the answer,

572
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,690
somebody that's got it,
now you're not developing the muscle.

573
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,260
You're not developing the discipline to
solve your own problems because there

574
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,450
may come a day when there's no one else
to ask,

575
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,300
so you need the rhythm of learning,
the rhythm of trying,

576
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,890
the rhythm of seeing if you can do it
first to build the emotional mental

577
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:50,724
muscle.

578
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,690
Okay?
