1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,560
I think one of the biggest problems that
we face in our society and our day and

2
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,110
age,
neurodegeneration,

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,180
whatever you want to consider it,
is we really try to hide the truth from

4
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,540
people.
We've grown up in this world where

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,890
everything is fair.
Everybody gets a trophy.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,540
Nobody's left behind.
Nobody is different.

7
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,010
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all for being equal,

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,410
treating people equally,
but the thing is,

9
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,880
as humans,
we are different.

10
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,290
We see things differently.
We feel things differently sometimes.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Although we can relate to other people,
we are not all the same as human beings.

12
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:07,520
We take losses and I think in today's
world where we grow up and it's more

13
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:12,140
normal to not let somebody understand
that they took a loss is really

14
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,480
negative.
It creates room for people to start

15
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,560
making excuses,
gives a reason for people to start

16
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:21,950
pointing the finger and other directions
for not taking responsibility for

17
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:25,310
themselves.
At the end of the day,

18
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,550
if you're not happy where you are,
it's your problem.

19
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,770
The circumstances,
it could be different compared to other

20
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:31,720
people.
Uh,

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,460
you could have definitely been dealt a
shitty hand.

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,130
Trust me,
I understand my life isn't perfect.

23
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,770
It's never gonna be perfect,
it's never been perfect,

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,080
but at the end of the day I had full
control over my situation.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
If you're not happy with where you are,
if you're not happy with what you're

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,730
doing,
it's pretty fucking simple.

27
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,090
Stopped doing it.
We ensure,

28
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:54,050
yeah,
it gets scary.

29
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:58,190
It gets challenging and risky and you
never know what's gonna happen,

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,870
but at the end of the day,
isn't that why we are alive to

31
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:07,700
experience this opportunity that we're
given and not just sit by and watch it

32
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:12,701
go to waste overall your goals,
your ambitions and your objectives are

33
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,850
yours,
but so is the outcome and the process.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,040
If you want it to happen,
you can make it happen.

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,480
If you don't,
you won't.

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,060
To stop blaming other people for your
fault.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Be honest with yourself.
Two thousand and 17,

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,450
if you know me by now,
I'm not somebody that's all about like

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,670
new year new me,

40
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,950
but one of the things that's easily able
to look at is just what you've done in a

41
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,410
previous year.
A lot of situations and a lot of people

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,980
just kind of look at a new year as an
opportunity to say,

43
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,600
okay,
these are the things I didn't do

44
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:21,530
correctly this year and is now moving
into the next year.

45
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:24,020
I'm going to do the things that are
going to make me better,

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,200
but 2017,
man,

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,130
I'm a big year for all of us.
The world.

48
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,550
Honestly,
so many crazy things happened this year

49
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,080
with social media being with everybody
nowadays.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,540
It was so easy to see all the terrible
that went on this year.

51
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,920
You know what I mean?
Sometimes it's nice to just kind of take

52
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,580
a second and remember all the good
things that actually happened in the

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,540
year.
I know for myself,

54
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,430
I was able to express what I love doing
for living in a way that brought me into

55
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,670
a new creative field,
this videography photography stuff.

56
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:05,720
My passion for my work as a freelance
designer helped influence me this year

57
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:08,510
to start stepping out of the comfort
zone,

58
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:13,511
I guess with other things
handed to that led me to this extremely

59
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,730
costly addiction in the video world,
which is.

60
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,840
It's awesome because I get to document
these moments,

61
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,080
hopefully years to come.
We'll be able to look back on this video

62
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,570
recapping 2017 and be like,
man,

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,220
2017,
good year,

64
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,000
good year,
you know,

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,770
all the way from just traveling more
this year,

66
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,280
living a little bit,
experiencing life to proposing to

67
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,130
Meghan.
Thank God she said yes by the way,

68
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,670
down to all the people that I got to
meet this year and hopefully influence

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,430
to chase after the things that they want
to do as well.

70
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,620
No,

71
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,350
a
lot of you guys that I've met this year

72
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,510
are amazing people.
You truly are the positivity,

73
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:17,920
the interaction that you guys bring your
way to special and creative to to not

74
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:21,580
push forward in 2018.
Please push forward in 2018.

75
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,790
You guys are amazing and this also goes
to all the people that I haven't met

76
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,170
yet.
There's tons of people out there with

77
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,670
the creative imagination and an a desire
to do something that they want to do and

78
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,700
they hold themselves back from doing it
or they wait till the next year to try

79
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,780
to do it.
Just do it now,

80
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,640
guys.
I want to take the opportunity to remind

81
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:40,570
the people and some of the positive
things that the youtube creators have

82
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,460
done this year.
Oh,

83
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,260
the fundraising that's gone on during
the drought for example,

84
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,980
or people losing loved ones,
taking the opportunity to use their fan

85
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:52,810
base to actually give back.
How amazing is that that we're in a

86
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,200
world now where people have the
opportunity to create their own content,

87
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,850
benefit from it,
and then also give back to the world

88
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,610
from it.
That's mindblowing.

89
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,440
We've definitely lost some amazing
people this year,

90
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,460
some amazing musicians,
at least on my end,

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,940
to musicians that really inspired me
throughout the years to just be the

92
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,900
person that I am today,
but even with losing them a gave us

93
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,510
opportunity to remember a lot of the
music.

94
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:28,511
Remember a lot of those old feelings
that drove us to create the path that we

95
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,520
created today.
If you look back at every single year as

96
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,490
a marketing point of what's happened in
your life,

97
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,900
it's going to have ups and downs.
Guys,

98
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,360
for some of you,
2017 wasn't a great year.

99
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,650
If bad things happen,
maybe you lost a loved one and I'm

100
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,040
truly,
truly sorry.

101
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,210
If you could find any part of you to
just look at the good things that did

102
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,910
happen this year and just focus on those
things.

103
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,890
Even if it's the littlest stuff to just
help push forward.

104
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:57,420
I promise you things will turn around.
Looking back throughout multiple years

105
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,150
have been at many low points to I've.
I've lost people.

106
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,770
I've had bad times.
I've been through depression and stress

107
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,300
and just felt so alone.
I can honestly say I've made the best of

108
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:11,700
2017.
It's had ups and downs,

109
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:15,060
but during those downtimes are focused
on a lot of the positive that I have

110
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,780
focused on a lot of the hard work that I
could put in and I did it here.

111
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:21,600
In a few weeks.
I'm going to be creating a short film of

112
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,660
kind of like an anniversary of me
quitting my job to be a freelance

113
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,310
designer.
I look forward to doing this video

114
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,980
because I did one last year and it's
just going to be insane.

115
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,430
Seen that transition of how I created
content.

116
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Then to now,
if I actually remember correctly,

117
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:45,910
my first ever short film was the I quit
my job to be a freelance designer.

118
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,470
It's really cold out here.
It's so cold out here.

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,660
You guys are better appreciate this
video in some way,

120
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:55,720
shape or form because of freezing my ass
off to be out here and get this,

121
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,680
but it's so worth it because this is
where a lot of this type of stuff

122
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,080
started for me.
This documenting this,

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,310
getting out and doing stuff

124
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,880
in two days it's 2018 and I'm going to
head into 2018.

125
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,200
Not Remembering how great of a year 2017
was for me.

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,950
Not remembering the bad things that
happened in 2017,

127
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,930
but just realizing that no matter what
year it is,

128
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,200
as long as I'm still here,
I had the opportunity to live and I want

129
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:37,360
to take advantage of that to the best of
my ability.

130
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,130
I want to thank everybody who's been a
part of this year all the way down to

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,900
the coworkers,
that creative grenade,

132
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,760
all the customers that we've had this
year,

133
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,730
all the supporters and the videos and
the live streams,

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,950
Meghan,
family friends,

135
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,590
anybody that's just been a positive
influence in this year and that's been a

136
00:08:55,591 --> 00:09:00,120
negative influence as well.
Thank you for pissing me off so much

137
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,160
so that way I gave the opportunity to
prove you guys

138
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,230
take every opportunity you guys get to
make something of it because we never

139
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,940
know what year is going to be.
Our last

140
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,080
is 2018.
