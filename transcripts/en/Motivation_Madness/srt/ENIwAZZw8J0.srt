1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,450
So here's a little issue we have in
America today,

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,860
there are currently about 250,000 people
a year who are dying in our hospitals

3
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,820
due to,
uh,

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,930
due to preventable deaths.
And I'm not talking about negligence,

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm talking about little accidents,
right?

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm,
I'm talking about the doctor in the

7
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,700
morning,
not properly briefing the doctor for the

8
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,810
evening.
You know,

9
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,120
I'm talking about things that,
you know,

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,780
we can't sue anybody.
There's nothing,

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,820
there's nothing that we can see that's
wrong,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,480
but there's 250,000 preventable deaths
every year.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,540
That's about 27,
40 sevens going down every single week.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,020
That's what's the equivalent to.
And the confusing thing is that we have

15
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:02,331
the best doctors in the world.
We have the most advanced technology in

16
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,350
the world.
Some of the medical equipment we have as

17
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:07,260
the best in the world,
the medicines we have are the best in

18
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,390
the world.
So you start asking yourselves why are

19
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,230
these things happening?

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,230
And the reason is not because of any of
those things,

21
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:16,250
the reasons are actually something
vastly more simple.

22
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:17,310
It's something very,
very human.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,990
Five percent of hospital administrators
or doctors,

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,610
most of them are number crunchers.
Hospitals are run like businesses.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,030
Hospitals are run by the numbers and the
problem isn't the people who are giving

26
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,810
the care,
they're very highly trained.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,130
The problem is the way those people are
cared for because what we've done is

28
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,190
we've created cultures in hospitals
where the people who were doing the

29
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,420
caring aren't cared for and so all of
these little preventable deaths are

30
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,230
happening because they don't feel like
they're a part of anything.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,780
They're just doing their jobs and they
don't get along that well,

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,770
and there's not a lot of comradery and
the impact is death.

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,950
Right now.
I use this example because it's

34
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,640
exaggerated because the impact is so
powerful,

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,810
but the problem is the same in our own
companies,

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,770
right?

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,430
Which is we come to work and were told,
you must care for your clients.

38
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,250
You must care for your customers.
You must make them the focus of all you

39
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,230
do,
and yet why aren't the people who are

40
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,750
managing us from the top caring about
us?

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,810
So yes,
in a hospital,

42
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,330
the impact is worse,
but the impact that we're having on the

43
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,490
outside world is just as bad.
In other words,

44
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,250
we're not working at our best.
We don't care for the things we're

45
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,260
doing,
we're not helping each other is the most

46
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,470
important part.
And the residual impact is that we are

47
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:38,340
unfulfilled by the work that we do and
when were unfulfilled by the work that

48
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,020
we do,
we focus on the details and when we

49
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,090
focus on the details,
we retract from each other.

50
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,740
When we tracked from each other,
we feel lonely.

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,320
And when we feel lonely,
cancer goes up,

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,420
heart disease goes up,
diabetes goes up.

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,920
In other words,
by going to work,

54
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,400
we're killing ourselves.
Literally.

55
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,710
There's another study that was released
not that long ago that says that,

56
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,810
uh,
parents who work late,

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,880
the negative impact that it has on their
children is little to none.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,150
They may feel guilty as parents,
but the negative impact that it has on

59
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,310
the raising of their children is little
to none.

60
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,730
However,
parents who come home from jobs they

61
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,810
hate or don't love,
their kids are more likely to be bullied

62
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,300
at school.
And now you think about the bullying

63
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,580
epidemic we have in America,
right?

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,360
Where there's this disturbing number of
young children who are killing

65
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,050
themselves,
suicides because of bullies.

66
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,560
The problem is not the schools and the
problem isn't even the parenting.

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,070
The problem is the jobs the parents
have.

68
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,930
This is the importance and this is the
power of the work that we do and the

69
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,930
places we go to work,
right?

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
Most of us,
I mean,

71
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,470
like if you listen to the,
the,

72
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:49,800
the,
uh,

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,030
the unemployment statistics,
they say,

74
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,260
you know,
we're all time high,

75
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,390
record high nine to 10 percent
unemployment,

76
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:55,971
right?
And people go,

77
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:56,980
oh my God,
that's terrible.

78
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,480
And I hear that number.
And I go,

79
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,640
well,
that means 91 percent still have a job

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,080
right now,
granted,

81
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,060
we want to get that employment number
up,

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,370
but that means 91 percent is still going
to work.

83
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,820
The question is how many of them coming
home fulfilled by the work that they do

84
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,550
and how many of them are waking up
inspired to go back to work the next

85
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,040
day?
If we don't love our works,

86
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,110
we don't look out for each other,
and if we don't look out for each other,

87
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,400
we feel lonely.
If we don't feel lonely,

88
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:23,401
all these negative things happen.
So what example can I share with a

89
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,840
creative audience about how to change
this?

90
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,640
The United States Marine Corps.
I had the great honor last week of

91
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,450
spending a week with the marines.
I spent a couple days at Camp Lajune and

92
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:38,860
then I went for a few days to Parris
Island to watch them go through bootcamp

93
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,240
and this isn't a remarkable,
remarkable human experiment that they're

94
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,760
doing and even though they know what
works,

95
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,860
they don't know why it works,
but they don't need to know why,

96
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,720
because they know that it works.
Right?

97
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,630
But what's happening is they're taking a
group of strangers,

98
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,260
people who don't know each other,
who are showing up and within a very,

99
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,530
very short period of time,
learn to trust each other.

100
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,530
So much that they would give their lives
for each other,

101
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,750
right,
and we know everyone,

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,440
sort of anyone who's ever worn a uniform
knows that no one runs into battle for

103
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,820
God and country.
It doesn't happen.

104
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,670
It's for the guy to the left of me and
the guy to the right of me.

105
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,010
That's the reason they do what they do.
Right?

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
And these sort of remarkable stories of
heroism where people rush into very,

107
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,980
very dangerous situations to save others
and they always ask the question,

108
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,870
why did you do it?
Why would you risk your life?

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,360
Why would you put yourself at risk for
them?

110
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,930
And the answer's always the same because
they would do it for me.

111
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,330
In other words,
what gives them the confidence to put

112
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,420
themselves at great risk is the
knowledge that someone would do the same

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,690
for them.
We would put ourselves at great risk for

114
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,720
our companies if we knew that our
companies would put themselves at great

115
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,020
risk for us,
but they don't.

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,530
So we don't.
Now.

117
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,880
One of the things that's remarkable
about the marines and if you go read and

118
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,130
you know this is the most I asked these
and they're 21,

119
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,060
22 years old,
some of these,

120
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,890
these lance corporals,
the grunts,

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,731
you know,
the guys,

122
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,890
the infantry,
I mean this is the lowest of the low,

123
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,460
the ones we actually send into battle
the front lines and I asked them,

124
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,930
are you misunderstood in America?

125
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,910
And they said yes unanimously.
They all not it.

126
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,890
I said,
what?

127
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,180
What do people think of you?
And one stood up and says,

128
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,160
they think we're baby killers.
I said,

129
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,870
how does it feel?
He says,

130
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,940
it hurts,
and when I say,

131
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,850
well,
tell me a story then that captures to

132
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:25,940
you what it means to be a marine.
The feeling you have of being a marine.

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Tell me a story that captures it and I
expected to hear stories of I took a hit

134
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,210
and somebody save me or I ran into a
firefight and pulled some it.

135
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:40,130
I expected these stories of heroism.
Not a single story like that came out.

136
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,070
Now I'm sure there's stories exist,
but those aren't the stories they told

137
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,110
me that capture what it means to be a
marine.

138
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,310
One of the stories they told me was a
young boy in Afghanistan who would come

139
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:53,600
around every morning and sell kabobs to
the marines and then one day he showed

140
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,050
up and he was all beaten up and he
didn't go to his parents for help and he

141
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,220
didn't go to his friends to help.

142
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,780
He came to the marines for help because
he trusted them more than anyone else.

143
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,420
They told me a story that captured how
they feel of a civilian bridge that had

144
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:11,600
been overrun by the Taliban and the
residents of the village could,

145
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,270
couldn't go home because they would be
killed by the Taliban.

146
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,190
And so they were just living by the
river.

147
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,360
The problem was winter was coming and
one of the,

148
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,810
uh,
the elders came to the marines,

149
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,080
knocked on the door and said,
I need you to come down to the river and

150
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,330
kill us.
And the marines had,

151
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,170
what are you talking about?
He says,

152
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,480
if we go back home will be killed by the
Taliban.

153
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,690
And if we stay out there,
we're going to die slow deaths this

154
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,400
winter.
It's easier if you just come and kill

155
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,234
us.
Please.

156
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,170
The marines overran the Taliban village,
push the Taliban out.

157
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,750
A year later they went back to this
village and people were playing

158
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,320
volleyball.
These were the stories they told me that

159
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:53,321
capture what it means to be a marine.
They believe in doing good for others

160
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,720
and the fulfillment they get when they
put themselves at risk so that others

161
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,130
may prevail is overwhelming.
This is not unique to the Marine Corps.

162
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,720
This is all human beings.
The feeling of fulfillment comes from

163
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:09,980
doing something for another.
The feeling from fulfillment comes from

164
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:14,540
the exertion of time and energy for
someone else.

165
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,780
If you are walking to work and you
throw,

166
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,570
throw a few pennies in a cup and you
come to work and you say to your

167
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,680
friends,
hey guys,

168
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,810
I gave a dollar to somebody homeless
this morning.

169
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,810
What are your friends going to say?
A good,

170
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,170
right?
I gave 20 bucks to somebody homeless.

171
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,320
They'd be like a good for you,
right?

172
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,000
What have you come in in the morning?
You say,

173
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,260
Hey,
I gave up my Saturday night.

174
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,540
I went and painted,
painted a school in the inner city.

175
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,700
People go,
Whoa,

176
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,230
cool,
wow,

177
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,120
cool,
and all of a sudden,

178
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,940
not only are they inspired to do
something good themselves,

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,670
but the feeling that that you have
persists.

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,110
The amazing thing is that when we do
good for others that actually inspires

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,350
others to do good for others.
This has provided for us prime

182
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,260
logically,
anthropologically it's all part of the

183
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,360
survival of the species.
You know,

184
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,270
sex feels good,
so that will do it so we can procreate

185
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,660
and perpetuate the species,
but we're social animals and so we have

186
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,570
to provide for the fact that will
maintain strong bonds and build cultures

187
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,190
right?
Because that's what humans do.

188
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,910
We're cultural animals and so when we do
good for others and we look out for

189
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,830
those in our tribe,
we look out for those in our group.

190
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,920
It actually feels good biologically
releases oxytocin.

191
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,640
This chemical that's released when you
do good for others is released and it

192
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,290
makes you feel good,
and the amazing thing is the more

193
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,560
oxytocin you have in your body,
the more you want to do good for others.

194
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,990
The problem is we've replaced this
feeling,

195
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,760
the exertion of time and energy with
digital communications.

196
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,110
We've replaced it with headphones.
We've replaced it with money,

197
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,540
right?
Think about the invention of money,

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,810
right?
It used to be money used to be like you

199
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,400
go to someone's house,
you cook them dinner,

200
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,420
and the deal was they'll do the dishes,
time and energy exchange for time and

201
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,220
energy,
and someone said,

202
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,980
I'll give you an Iou,
right?

203
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,020
Someone says,
I don't feel like doing the dishes,

204
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,200
so I'm going to give you an iou that I
promise to do them another day.

205
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
Right?
And that's what money is.

206
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,270
It is the promise for future goods or
services,

207
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,310
the promise of future goods and
services.

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,620
In other words,
we've replaced our own time and energy

209
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,010
with promises for someone else to do it
another day,

210
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,870
right?
In other words,

211
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:22,530
there's no exertion of time and energy,
and so the feeling people get is that I

212
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,930
did something for you and you did
nothing for me.

213
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,570
You replaced it with a piece of paper
with an Iru,

214
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,690
with a promise for future goods and
services.

215
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,330
The way we find fulfillment is by doing
good for others,

216
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,550
so how did the marines it?
How do you get people to do good for

217
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,740
others?
We all know this intellectually.

218
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,200
We know that it's good to do good for
others,

219
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:44,100
but why don't we do it?
Then why don't we do it and what the

220
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,820
Marines learned is something that I
completely did not expect.

221
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
They can't just yell at these guys to
help each other.

222
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,580
That's not what happens.
There's a few things that they have to

223
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:58,050
do first,
so we all heard of the obstacle course,

224
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,040
right?
The marines have a thing called the

225
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,710
obstacle course,
and this is where they build anaerobic

226
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,810
strength and aerobic strength,
muscle strength,

227
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,850
and it's timed and all of this good
stuff.

228
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,910
They have another course called the
confidence course and it's never timed

229
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,420
and most of the obstacles on this course
cannot be completed by yourself.

230
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,040
They must be completed in teams.
You have no choice.

231
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,940
That's just how it's designed and what
they say is the first two weeks of

232
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,730
bootcamp.
Everybody's there to outdo each other

233
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:29,490
and prove that they're strong.
Just kind of like when we start in a job

234
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,170
where proof,
we want to show how great we are,

235
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,010
we'll work a little harder.

236
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,710
We'll do good work.
Look how good my designers,

237
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,910
right.
It's all about us and how good we are.

238
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,430
Right?
But they keep putting them in situations

239
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,000
where they can't do things by themselves
and what starts to happen very slowly.

240
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,910
They said after about two weeks,
they start cheering for each other.

241
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,750
Now they get in trouble when they do,
but they start cheering for each other

242
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,170
and then before too long you see them
organically start helping each other.

243
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,030
And what happens is if there's one
person who's weak and refuses to help

244
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:58,990
each other,
the others,

245
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,760
or even if there's one person who's
strong,

246
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,511
who's,
you know,

247
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,540
I wasn't star college athlete and they
get to every the end of every obstacle,

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,730
they just stand there and wait for
everybody to finish and they don't help

249
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,650
each other.
What starts to happen as organically,

250
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,190
the group starts to ostracize that
person organically.

251
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,330
They get ostracized until they learn
that the only way that they will get

252
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,490
through this thing,
they only way they will survive bootcamp

253
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,190
is if they ask for help because they
have no option.

254
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,280
The problem is no one will help them
until they're willing to help another.

255
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,150
It's the deal we have to make.
It's called vulnerability and risk.

256
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,730
We have to take the risk to make
ourselves vulnerable.

257
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,530
Yes,
you might do something for someone else

258
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:34,060
and they may not do something back for
you.

259
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,970
That's the risk you run.
That's the risk you run.

260
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,580
It's not about.
It's not about giving everything to them

261
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,080
and sort of huge,
big,

262
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,940
overwhelming risk.
It's about little things and little

263
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,440
things.
It's like going on a date,

264
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,300
right?
Because like if I went on a date with

265
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,610
somebody,
I came home and I said,

266
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,860
uh,
after one date I said,

267
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,353
I'm marrying her.

268
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,160
They be like,
what?

269
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,260
Are you nuts?
I'd be like,

270
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,130
I'm in love.
They're like,

271
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,890
this is crazy.
I'm like,

272
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,450
I know I'm in love.
She feels the same way.

273
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,780
We both know it's nuts right now.
You know that you're going to be like,

274
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
go on a couple more dates.
Right?

275
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,560
We know instinctively that the strong
bond that's created that,

276
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,090
that needs to be created first takes
more than a week.

277
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,440
Right?
We know that.

278
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,900
Right?
But if I've been dating somebody for

279
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,230
seven years and we haven't,
you know,

280
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,171
married,
you'd be like,

281
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,130
dude,
what is wrong?

282
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,570
Right?
In other words,

283
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,930
we know that it takes more than seven
days and we know that it takes less than

284
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:36,670
seven years.
The problem is we don't know how long it

285
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,640
takes.
Somewhere in the middle,

286
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,660
all human bonds are the same.
Like when you show up at work,

287
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,640
when you show up for the first time,
when you're new,

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,760
don't expect that people will look out
for you and they won't expect you to

289
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,740
look out for them in seven days it won't
happen,

290
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,530
but if you can,
working at a job for a few years and you

291
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,710
don't have the n,
d sort of the the absolute confidence

292
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,450
that if you turn your back,
you will not get stabbed.

293
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,950
You can rely on somebody who can give
them something.

294
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,990
Nothing will go wrong.
You will share the credit.

295
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,420
No one will throw you under the bus and
you don't have that in a few years.

296
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

297
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,700
I don't know how long it takes,
but I know that's more than a week and I

298
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:14,701
know it's less than seven years and the
marines fundamentally understand that

299
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:18,760
before anyone is willing to put
themselves out for another,

300
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,930
they have to have self confidence,
real self confidence.

301
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,860
You have to be confident in yourself and
your own ability before you're willing

302
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,860
to help another.
If you're insecure at all about your own

303
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:30,720
ability,
it's an oxy.

304
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,410
It's sort of a paradox,
right?

305
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,450
How am I?
How can I overcome my confidence?

306
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,160
You know,
my self confidence and we all have ego

307
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,300
issues at all times.
You know,

308
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,500
we all do,
right?

309
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,860
But if I'm not confident in myself,
I won't help another.

310
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,510
It's a paradox because then we need
someone to look out for us before we're

311
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,680
willing to help our peers,
right?

312
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,630
This is what management is supposed to
do.

313
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,280
The drill instructors,
the school they are.

314
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,830
There are parents.
They are there for one reason and one

315
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,180
reason only to help us feel strong and
good about ourselves,

316
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,930
but look at the way we talk to each
other.

317
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,610
Look at them.
Look,

318
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,680
a budget's been cut and so what do you
get told?

319
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:06,110
I need you guys to do more with less,
right?

320
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,370
That's what we're told.
Hey guys,

321
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,160
I need you guys to do more with less.
That's what told by our clients,

322
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,210
by our bosses,
by our parents.

323
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,080
This is what we're told,
right?

324
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,120
That's like your parents telling you
when you're young.

325
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,840
I know you're stupid.
Figure it out,

326
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,430
right?
You're not as smart as the other kids.

327
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,700
What do you want me to do?
Right?

328
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,580
It's the exact same thing.
I need you to do more with less,

329
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,010
right?
What we need to be telling people is I

330
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,830
need you.
I need to do to do more with what you

331
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,780
have,
right?

332
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,910
You have capacity,
you have strength,

333
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,310
you have talent,
you have compatibility.

334
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,560
I need you to do more with what you
have.

335
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,300
We don't celebrate what we've got.
We criticized or what we don't have.

336
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,710
This is the responsibility of management
to take us under their wing and help us

337
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:56,711
understand our own value to ourselves.
Close your eyes and think back to high

338
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:03,461
school and think of that one teacher who
took you under their wing and cared for

339
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:08,450
you and looked after you and helped you
realize that you are capable of more

340
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:13,250
than you thought you were and you and
you probably are the person you are

341
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,830
today in some part because of that
person.

342
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Right?
Do you have that name?

343
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,370
What's the name?
Tell me the name.

344
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,280
Tell me the name of the teacher.
Okay.

345
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,840
Give me the name.
We can.

346
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,090
I can point to anybody and you can tell
me that name now,

347
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:32,180
tell me the names of all the other
teachers you had that day.

348
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,930
Can't remember them.
Kenya.

349
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,380
This is the power of those who teach us
confidence.

350
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,980
We will literally carry their names
around with us for the rest of our

351
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:44,520
lives.
Wouldn't you want to be that person?

352
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
Wouldn't you want to be the person that
20 years from now,

353
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,720
30 years from now,
40 years from now,

354
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:52,230
I can do this exercise with somebody and
they will tell me your name.

355
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,610
This is the power of helping others
realize their own strengths.

356
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,610
This is what management and leadership
is supposed to be doing.

357
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,500
They're supposed to be caring for us and
helping us realize our own value,

358
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,120
and by the way,
if you have anybody who reports to your

359
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,020
works for you,
your responsibility is not to make them

360
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,050
meet the deadline.
You're responsibility is not to make

361
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:18,530
sure that they do is you say your
responsibility is to make sure that they

362
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:21,350
understand their own strengths,
their own value,

363
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,430
and that they are way,
way more talented than they think they

364
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,940
are.
And the only way they will learn that is

365
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,130
if you put them in situations in which
they can fail and you hold them and you

366
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,850
support them and you give them talent
and you give them skills and you give

367
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:37,610
them education and you watch their backs
and if they fall over,

368
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,780
you encourage them to get back up.

369
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,580
And if they follow the carriage them to
get back up.

370
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,650
And if they fall over,
you encourage them to get back up until

371
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,830
they figure it out themselves.
It's called confidence.

372
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,200
It's your responsibility to help others
find it into others responsibility to

373
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,720
help you find yours.
And the amazing thing is as soon as you

374
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,400
start feeling confident in your own
ability,

375
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,260
you're naturally help each other.
That's what happens.

376
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,510
It's called trust in the military.
They give medals to people who were

377
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:06,660
willing to sacrifice themselves so that
others may gain

378
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,980
in business.
We are willing to give bonuses to people

379
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,020
who will sacrifice others so that we may
gain.

380
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,900
We have it backwards.
And then we complain about how we don't

381
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,780
love our jobs and we complain about how
the work is suffering and we complain

382
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,000
about how budgets are being cut and we
can complain,

383
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:24,834
complain,
complain,

384
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,950
and the first thing we do is blame each
other and become more selfish and

385
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,020
worried about my pay and my benefits and
my this.

386
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,360
And this is what happens when we are
unfulfilled.

387
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,580
We look at the metrics and we say,
they're not good enough.

388
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,740
When we are fulfilled,
we don't care about the metrics.

389
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,230
This is why when you have a job you love
and you get a call that says,

390
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,540
I'll offer you tons more money and great
benefits you like,

391
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,830
I'm not interested.
I'm not interested.

392
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,130
I'm not interested.
I'm very happy here,

393
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,250
but we'll give you more.
That's not the reason I'm here.

394
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,120
I'm here because I love it.
I'm here because I care for the people I

395
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:58,800
work with and I'm here because the
people I work with care for me.

396
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,230
This is the world I imagine.
This is the world I imagine.

397
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,770
And here's the great thing.
If you take little risks,

398
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm not talking about big things,
little things.

399
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,600
Did you start doing little things for
each other?

400
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,140
The amazing anthropological response is
other people will start doing little

401
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:22,500
things for others too.
I was walking down the street two days

402
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:26,510
ago and a guys backpack was open and a
whole bunch of paper fell out as is

403
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,240
walking down the street and I happened
to be behind him and so my friend and I

404
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:32,340
just sort of.
We written mid conversation and in mid

405
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,720
conversation we never even stopped
talking.

406
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,790
We just bend down,
sort of help them gather those papers.

407
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I and them back to him,
sort of pointed out that his book bag

408
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:39,360
was his,
you know,

409
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,100
his backpack was unzipped and he said
thanks,

410
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,810
and we walked in.
It was like no big deal,

411
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,280
right?
We get to the end of the street,

412
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,670
we stand at that.
We're waiting to cross the street.

413
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,630
We still talk and we haven't stopped
talking and the guy in front of us turns

414
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,510
to us and says,
I saw you help that guy.

415
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,250
That was really cool,

416
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,850
but here's what's great about that.
The guy will go do something for someone

417
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:07,420
else simply because he saw us bend down
and pick up paper for someone else.

418
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,480
He will actually go do something for
someone else because of it,

419
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,100
right?
He,

420
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,400
he won't give to charity because he sees
me put a dollar in a cup,

421
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,160
but he will actually help someone
because he saw someone also helps

422
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,720
someone.
Little things hold the door open for

423
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,370
someone.
Say thank you to the person who holds

424
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,380
the door open for you.
Smile to the Barista.

425
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:30,790
Little little things.
You put your foot in the subway when the

426
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,470
doors closing,
so someone who's running,

427
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,780
we'll make it hit the open at the at the
elevator.

428
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:39,781
Don't go
or pretend you didn't.

429
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,280
See that's the best one.

430
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,470
Oh,
I didn't.

431
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,700
I wouldn't if I saw sorry,
right?

432
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Do it a little time and a little energy
and you'll find around work that people

433
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:59,500
give a little time and a little energy
back to you and you'll give a little

434
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,380
more time and a little more energy.
You go for a coffee with someone.

435
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,610
Then you go for two hour coffee and you
go for a coffee and a lunch,

436
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,060
then you go for lunch and a dinner.
Then you go for a dinner and a movie and

437
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,370
then you sleep over and then you sleep
over two nights and then you go on

438
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,200
holiday together and eventually you get
married.

439
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,940
Right?
It's slow.

440
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,000
It takes time and we can't rush it.
You know,

441
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,721
if,
when we rush it,

442
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,230
it's all fake.
Do things for others and watch.

443
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,400
Watch how much others do for you.
You know,

444
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,250
go,
you go get yourself a cup of coffee from

445
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,890
the coffee sheet machine in the morning.
Make one for someone else.

446
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,710
It takes a little extra time.
It takes a little extra energy.

447
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,170
That's the point.
That's the point.

448
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,230
And here's the best part.
You will feel so good at the end of the

449
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,240
day.
So good.

450
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,083
Thank you very much.

451
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,670
Thank you.

452
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,200
That's a great question.
How do you convince someone?

453
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,380
How do you know?
So what are the metrics?

454
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,810
How do you convince a skeptical audience
of this trust metric?

455
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,220
Um,
you don't,

456
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,740
you don't,
right?

457
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,300
You can't twist anybody's arm to do
something that they don't want to do and

458
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,370
you know,
the law of diffusion,

459
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,470
which I obey,
you know,

460
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,030
as hard as,
as much as I can,

461
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:21,900
which is you don't need the majority.
You need those people who believe what

462
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:22,711
you believe.
In other words,

463
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:23,710
if you bought,
if you,

464
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,780
you know,
when you go sort of,

465
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,690
when you do some nice things for people,
they may not do something nice back

466
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:28,860
because they may be,
you know,

467
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,690
we live in a world in which you do
something for somebody.

468
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,840
They think you want something from them,
right?

469
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,090
That's unfortunately the society we've
created.

470
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,090
But,
but that's the risk that we keep taking.

471
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,510
And I'm not saying you should keep doing
it for somebody who keeps doing nothing

472
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,850
and keeps sort of,
you know,

473
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,890
crapping on you because of it.
Then at some point you have to be like,

474
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,360
all right,
my bad,

475
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,501
my bad.
Right.

476
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,560
And you back off.
You know,

477
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,610
I don't believe in helping everyone.
I do not believe in it.

478
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,110
Right?
Um,

479
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,250
this is not,
you know,

480
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,020
let's do good for everyone on the
planet.

481
00:22:58,021 --> 00:22:59,840
That's not what I'm talking about,
mother Theresa,

482
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:03,720
who was the poster child for giving
selflessly to all who need at the end of

483
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,070
her life,
started questioning the existence of God

484
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:07,950
and by the way,
hated her life serious.

485
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,540
Okay.
In other words,

486
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:14,541
giving to others unabashedly is actually
self destructive.

487
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,030
It doesn't help.
Right?

488
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,610
And it's just like going on dates with
people you don't like,

489
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:23,300
doesn't mean you'll eventually click and
map.

490
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,103
Right?

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,330
There's,
there's only one machine that I found

492
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,110
that really accurately measures trust
better than any other sort of metric.

493
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,230
It's called the human being.
It's really good at it.

494
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,830
Right?
And so those feelings you get,

495
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,890
trust them in one way or the other.
You know,

496
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,120
it's,
it's the little risks.

497
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,000
It's the butterflies.
If the unsure,

498
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,811
you know,
it's the,

499
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:50,150
it's the backwards and it's the dance.
It's dating,

500
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,580
it's the dance at the nerves like I,
you know,

501
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,700
it's that.
So if there were,

502
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,670
if there are cynical bastards at your
office who,

503
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,760
who are,
who,

504
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,840
don't get it,
ignore,

505
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,940
ignore him,
don't worry about it because eventually

506
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,270
you'll get enough and those people
either come along or leave or be pushed

507
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,680
out,
you know,

508
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,060
ostracized.
Remember,

509
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,650
when the group starts helping each
other,

510
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,780
they ostracize the ones who refuse to
help,

511
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:13,130
whether they're strong or whether
they're weak,

512
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,950
they get ostracized until they learn,
until they learn that they cannot

513
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,490
survive without the help of others.

514
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,880
And they learn that the only way others
will help them as if they,

515
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,610
if they help the others,
right?

516
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,460
The order matters.
The order matters.

517
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,940
Just I just thought of something that is
pervasive in our sort of,

518
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,920
you know,
digital world,

519
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,480
uh,
the order matters,

520
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,240
so to speak honestly about what you
want,

521
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,440
right?
If you are doing,

522
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,140
don't do things for people.
When you want something from them,

523
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,990
just ask them what you want from them.
And I'll give you one little example.

524
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:48,410
It's a funny little example.
We've all received emails that go like

525
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,180
this,
dear Simon,

526
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,470
where you wouldn't get an email to the
assignment.

527
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,390
But I,
dear,

528
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,320
insert your name right.
Dear Simon.

529
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,010
I'm haven't seen you in years.
Hope you're well.

530
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,250
Congratulations on all you've been
doing.

531
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:07,880
It's really amazing.
We should get coffee sometime.

532
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,630
If you could do me a favor.
I'm.

533
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,730
If you could vote for me on this
website.

534
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,090
I'm hoping to win the thousand dollar
prize for my design,

535
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:17,361
blah,
blah,

536
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,920
blah.
Hope you're well.

537
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:20,690
Talk to you soon,
Kenny.

538
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,000
Right?
We've all received an email like that

539
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:27,950
and how do we respond to it
right now?

540
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,260
What happens if you get the same email
that goes like this?

541
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,790
Dear Simon,
I'm hoping you could vote for me on this

542
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,890
website.
I'm trying to win some thousand dollar

543
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:40,130
prize for my design.
I haven't seen you in years.

544
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
I hope you're really well.
Congratulations on all that you've been

545
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,900
doing.
We should get a coffee sometime.

546
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,290
Thanks Kenny.
Totally different.

547
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,440
In other words,
when we know why you're emailing and it

548
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:53,750
comes first,
it has a remarkable impact.

549
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,770
We know that all those pleasantries or
just buttering us up to get to what they

550
00:25:57,771 --> 00:25:59,030
want,
right?

551
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,890
But if you come right out with what you
want,

552
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,690
we're actually very grateful for the
pleasantries,

553
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,423
right?

554
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,650
It's the same thing in human
interaction.

555
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,770
Don't give someone a cup of coffee.
If you need a favor back,

556
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,390
just ask them for the favor.
It builds trust.

557
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,790
I can't trust you.
Every time you do something nice for me,

558
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,440
I think you just something you want
something from me,

559
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,620
I won't trust you,
and this is what companies do to us

560
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,050
right when we did this for you.
Why won't you do this for us?

561
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,300
That's not how it works.
Generosity,

562
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,330
bending down to pick up the papers,
holding the door open for someone is

563
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:33,380
expecting nothing in return ever.
You do not give,

564
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,970
you know,
this is what happens in new business,

565
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,440
right?
We be new.

566
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,110
Business is built on relationships and
so we build the relationship,

567
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,760
build the relationship,
build the relationship until we're

568
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,740
comfortable to ask for the business.
In other words,

569
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:47,490
you were befriending me to the point you
felt that I would let down my guard and

570
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,370
you could ask me for something the whole
time you were just waiting for that

571
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,204
time.

572
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,180
Doesn't work that way.
If you actually want to build

573
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:56,910
relationships,
you build relationships without wanting

574
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,050
anything and that's how you build trust.
You want to know why?

575
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,690
The Marines gave me this incredible
access.

576
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,220
I mean literally they said,
Simon,

577
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,720
anything you want to see,
you got it.

578
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,310
Anything you want to do,
you got it.

579
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,770
You can go.
And we went past sign that said no

580
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,830
observers,
no civilians beyond this point.

581
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,830
I'm like,
can I take pictures of like,

582
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,130
go ahead.
You should see some of the pictures.

583
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:18,780
They're unbelievable,
right?

584
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm like,
right in their marines coming at me,

585
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,250
we went out to the crucible and all
rolling in the dirt and like,

586
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,250
you know,
going under barbed wire and I'm like,

587
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,610
I'm not joking either.
They're like,

588
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,000
you know,
unprecedented access access that

589
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:38,760
journalists would be jealous of.
Do you know why they gave it to me?

590
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,450
Because in all the time that I've been
visiting with marines and then having

591
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:44,490
meetings with them,
I've never asked for anything.

592
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,650
I don't want anything and I don't have
anything to sell.

593
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
I just keep showing up and say,
what do you need?

594
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,730
How can I help?
And at some point they said,

595
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,920
when I called him and said,
I need a little favor because they know

596
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,000
I haven't been waiting for the favor.
It's the time now that I have a little

597
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,680
favor,
they go absolutely whatever you need.

598
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,610
It's called human relationships.
Companies don't do business with

599
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:04,020
companies.
People do business with people

600
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,710
you know your company didn't.
When IBM,

601
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,680
as a client,
somebody who likes somebody said,

602
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,600
we'll hire you,
and if they didn't like you,

603
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,840
they're just there.
They're doing,

604
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,850
they're playing roulette.
What we're betting that this will work

605
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,670
out.
Those are the weaker relationships.

606
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,623
Yes.

607
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,450
The more we gave,
the more it inspires others to give,

608
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
but the more selfish we are,
the more others become selfish around

609
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,760
us.
And so those are organizations in which

610
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:36,420
selfish behavior perfect prevails.
And so we see the residual effects,

611
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:39,480
which is they make decisions that
ultimately screw us.

612
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,960
They destroyed our economy because of
their selfish behavior.

613
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,250
Right?
We know this is what,

614
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,310
what,
what happens?

615
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,630
Same in politics,
right?

616
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,590
Um,
uh,

617
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,050
and the answer is don't worry about it.
I know it sounds silly.

618
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,510
I mean,
your first question is do I talk about

619
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,910
these things to them?
I will talk to anyone who will listen,

620
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,810
you know,
but I don't talk to people who don't

621
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:03,780
want to listen.
The good news is there are some good

622
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:08,760
eggs and there are some of them who've
had conversions where they were the

623
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:12,240
bastards who believed in firing people
and screen people to advance their

624
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,190
careers and something happens.

625
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,860
I just met a guy recently who's a very
senior executive at very,

626
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,740
very large company and something
happened and he,

627
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,470
like,
he got hit in the head or something and

628
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,650
he realized holy cow,
I have to look after people.

629
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,290
Right?
And they become obsessed with it and

630
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,770
they start sticking their necks out and,
and we just need those champions

631
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,280
scattered around and this is what I do.
The more I spread this message,

632
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,230
the more sort of.
It's kind,

633
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,133
Kinda like,
um,

634
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,290
you know,
in the,

635
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,470
in the cartoons sort of the whole of
justice,

636
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:43,210
you know,
that the message goes out and they all

637
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:44,950
sort of like wherever they are,
like,

638
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,240
you know,
that they poke their heads up.

639
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:48,700
It's that kind of thing.
The more we talk about it,

640
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,750
the more we put it in our work,
the know,

641
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,590
because don't forget you're going to
help someone who goes home feeling good

642
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,780
and their husband or their wife works in
the bank and they're going to talk too

643
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:57,340
much about.

644
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,140
They love to and that might inspire that
per,

645
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,830
you know,
it's,

646
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,890
it has all of these residual impacts
that we don't really know.

647
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,300
This is the funny thing about the
Internet,

648
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,970
which is we're so proud of the internet
that we can measure everything.

649
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,020
No,
you can't.

650
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,300
You can only measure one layer.
Right?

651
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,081
So for example,
you say,

652
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,550
Simon,
what's the impact you're having?

653
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,710
I don't know.
Is The answer right?

654
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,573
I know it's,
it's.

655
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,040
I know that it'll take more than a week
and I will take seven years,

656
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,320
but I don't know when it's gonna happen
and I don't know how it's going to get

657
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,610
there.
Right?

658
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,910
All I can do is,
is do it right,

659
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,780
but I have no clue how or when.
And so for example,

660
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,540
I can measure book sales and I can
measure how many hits and I can measure

661
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,250
how many people have watched a ted talk
and all of this,

662
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,350
but I can't measure,
you know,

663
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,450
that Ted talk being shown to a room of
50 people and one of those 50 people

664
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,190
doesn't buy a book,
doesn't watch a Ted talk,

665
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:44,620
doesn't do anything but goes out and
does something good for somebody else.

666
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,980
I have no way of measuring that.
And so we're so proud of the internet

667
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,580
and its ability to measure everything.
But we're measuring one layer where we

668
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,890
used to measure no layers.
It's like,

669
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
you know,
this is how people work.

670
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,520
It's Gossamer,
you know,

671
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,500
it's networked.
Um,

672
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,150
and so the answer is don't worry about
them,

673
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,690
don't worry about them,
worry about the people who you can care

674
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:05,980
for,
who you can give to.

675
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,020
And when we reach a critical mass in
society,

676
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,840
it will tip right?
And if you don't believe me,

677
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,480
the reason it is,
the way it is now is because it tip the

678
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,790
wrong way.
There was no such thing as massive

679
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,830
layoffs as,
as business strategy prior to

680
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:20,050
[inaudible] in the 19 eighties.
It just wasn't done.

681
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,030
It was done here and there,
but it wasn't strategy.

682
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,990
The idea of using layoffs to balance the
books is a relatively new phenomenon

683
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,290
that came for the increase of
selfishness in the Gordon Gekko greed is

684
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:29,620
good.

685
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,580
Nineteen eighties,
boom,

686
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
right?
Um,

687
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,950
and uh,
this was also the same exact period,

688
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:39,940
the 19 eighties where the theory,
the theory of shareholder value is put

689
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:40,900
forwards,
right?

690
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,870
Because they had all these people buying
large companies and installing

691
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,760
professional managers to run the
companies that they bought,

692
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,610
that they invested in and they had a
problem which is those professional

693
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,970
managers were paid for by the company
and those professional managers cared

694
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,460
for the employees and the customers.
And so the investor said,

695
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,710
how do we protect our investments?
We've got an idea,

696
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,700
we're going to give them equity in the
company and bonus them based on the

697
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,530
performance.
Right?

698
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,790
And so the shift happened where the
CEO's started caring more about the

699
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,100
investors and stopped caring about the
customers and employees.

700
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,330
Those were theories introduced by some
Harvard professor in the 19 eighties.

701
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,020
We can push it back the other way,
right?

702
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,440
We can push it back the other way.
Um,

703
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,760
but we just have to.
And there's just a,

704
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:22,680
there's a,
there was a,

705
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,100
uh,
just the other day.

706
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,090
Which company was it?
A one of the large banks where the

707
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:29,890
shareholder in Citibank,
Citibank,

708
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,010
Citibank,
the shareholders voted majority

709
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,820
shareholders voted against a fat pay
package.

710
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,430
That's unprecedented.
It has never happened even in hard

711
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,170
times,
even when the company is doing this,

712
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,440
the shareholders,
it's just sort of a cursory thing where

713
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:48,320
they approved the $15,000,000 bonus for
the CEO.

714
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,830
They voted against it.
It's nonbinding,

715
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,280
but it sends a shot across the bow
saying shareholders now want you to be

716
00:32:55,281 --> 00:33:00,020
bonused if you do something good for
others,

717
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,930
even if the others is us.
Right?

718
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,080
The point is,
is that it's,

719
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,050
it's starting to crack.
And so let's just stick our finger in

720
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:12,930
the crack,
you know,

721
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,970
make sure that it keeps cracking.
It swung one way.

722
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,610
We can swing it back.
The question was can I talk about

723
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:21,190
celebrating accomplishment while still
asking for more?

724
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,250
Right to,
to so,

725
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,430
so,
um,

726
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,560
they did a study on kids who are really,
really smart,

727
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:31,450
like an old gifted classes.
Why is it when you're smart,

728
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,320
you're gifted.
When you're stupid,

729
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:33,220
you're special.
Why is that?

730
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,040
I was told my whole life I was special,
never gifted.

731
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,310
I'm a,

732
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,790
they took the gifted kids who are
constantly told,

733
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,440
you're so good.
Oh,

734
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
thanks for that.
I knew you'd do well.

735
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,893
Oh,
you're the,

736
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,150
you're our best employee.
You know our best student.

737
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,410
You're awesome.
Right?

738
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,860
And what happens is later in life they
actually suffer because they're very

739
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:01,920
afraid of taking risk because they're
very afraid of losing their position on

740
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:03,680
the mental.
Okay.

741
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,350
Kids who were sort of more average,
who constantly are rewarded not for

742
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:08,910
their accomplishment,
but for their effort,

743
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,090
great effort.
Really proud of the improvement you

744
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,240
made.
What they find is they do very well in

745
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:19,320
life because there's no shelf,
there's always more,

746
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,940
there's more effort,
right?

747
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,230
And so you want to reward and
acknowledge effort.

748
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,310
Even if they don't hit the goal,
it's that the delta.

749
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,170
But at the same time,
if it goes backwards,

750
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:31,760
you'd be like,
dude,

751
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,640
what's going on?

752
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,770
Like we don't get.
We shouldn't be getting ribbons for

753
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,390
everyone who competes,
right?

754
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:39,240
Because what we're teaching people is if
you do nothing,

755
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,550
you get a metal.
Right?

756
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,450
And the funny thing is is we start
creating a generation that's feeling

757
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:49,560
very hollow and feeling this sense of
entitlement that people complain about

758
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:51,930
Gen y.
The entitlement is I don't feel like

759
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:54,270
I've accomplished anything.
And the funny thing is about human

760
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:55,800
beings is we,
we,

761
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:00,830
the way we feel accomplished is when we
exert energy and time and reach a

762
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:02,970
destination,
right?

763
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,850
And the more energy and time that we
have to suffer through,

764
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,060
especially if we suffer together and we
get somewhere,

765
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,570
it is overwhelming.
Think about the best jobs you've ever

766
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,340
worked on.
Was it the best design?

767
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,940
Was it the best results that the company
had because of your project?

768
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:23,030
Or was it an absolute hell project that
you worked together and you came out on

769
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:25,920
the other end and you got it done at the
deadline and you're like,

770
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,540
that was amazing.

771
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,410
It was the hell projects,
it was the things that we had to go out

772
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:34,200
of our ways more,
do things for each other,

773
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,760
right?
Things we weren't thinking of doing.

774
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,610
I was wrapping packages,
was doing stuff that aren't designers on

775
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,780
supposed to do,
going,

776
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,570
you know,
this is what produces that.

777
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,810
Right?
And so the,

778
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,430
the,
the thing is about measurement and

779
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:50,610
destination reward.
Imagine we're standing in a big empty

780
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,570
room,
right?

781
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,200
And we're standing in one corner and I
give you a simple instruction.

782
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,890
I want you to go to that corner in a
straight line,

783
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,560
right off you go,
no big deal,

784
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,150
right?
Without telling you,

785
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,430
I slip a chair in front of you.
What do you do?

786
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,280
You go around the chair,
now,

787
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,600
you just disobeyed what I told you to
do.

788
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,250
I told you to go to that corner,
straight line,

789
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,590
but this is the amazing things about
human beings,

790
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,690
which is when we're given a clear
destination,

791
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,040
we use our own creativity and our own
sense of innovation and our own problem

792
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:23,160
solving abilities to overcome obstacles
to get to the destination.

793
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,930
In other words,
the destination is more important than

794
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,460
the route,
right?

795
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,400
We're flexible about the route.
We're obsessed with the destination

796
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,500
reset.
We're standing in the corner together

797
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:34,500
and I give you a simple instruction.
Go somewhere in this room in a straight

798
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:36,120
line and you say to me,
well,

799
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:36,841
where do you want me to go?
I'm like,

800
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,160
I don't know.
You're smart.

801
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,750
Figure it out.
Go in a straight line,

802
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,870
and so you pick a point and you start
walking and without telling you,

803
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:43,980
I put a chair in front of you and what
are you?

804
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,290
Do you come to a grinding halt?
And I say,

805
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,250
what'd you stop for?
You Go,

806
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:49,830
well,
you put a chair in front of me or you'll

807
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,630
make a sudden turn on going in another
direction.

808
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,820
Right?
And this is the problem.

809
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,100
It's the same obstacle.
The differences.

810
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,930
When you have a clear set of clear
destination,

811
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,450
the obstacles become easy to overcome.

812
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,240
When you don't have a clear destination,
you keep coming to a grinding halt.

813
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:06,240
And what we do in our companies is we're
counting the steps we're taking along

814
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,130
the route,
but whenever looking at the destination,

815
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,380
right?
So company says,

816
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,870
made a million dollars this year we were
only planning on making $800,000.

817
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:14,700
We took 10 steps.
When you're planning on taking eight,

818
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,860
where are you going?
No clue,

819
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,410
right?
We count the steps.

820
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,080
And so the point is is that people want
to feel that the effort that they're

821
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:25,620
exerting actually are moving somewhere.
And so successful measurement,

822
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,260
successful recognition is not just for
the steps you take,

823
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,620
it's not just for the effort,
it's that the effort you exerted moved

824
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:35,490
us closer to where we're trying to get
to and that get to should be some crazy

825
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:38,130
ideal.
My ideal is to live in a world in which

826
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,880
the vast majority of people wake up
every single morning inspired to go to

827
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,440
work and fulfilled by the work that they
do.

828
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,380
And the,
the,

829
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,890
the couple of measurements that I use
are,

830
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,300
if the book is selling,
and I,

831
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,200
by the way,
people ask me,

832
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,940
how many have you sold?
I have no clue.

833
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,430
I've never asked the publisher because
they don't care.

834
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,450
I really don't care how many I sold.
What I care about is the Amazon rankings

835
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,070
and that those are going steady or up
and not plummeting because that means

836
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,390
other people,
right?

837
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:05,730
Because I don't have a publicist,
I don't have a marketing strategy on

838
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,560
purpose.
I didn't hire one of those companies to

839
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:10,080
sell the book for me.
And the reason is is because I'm not

840
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,570
interested in book sales.
I'm interested in the spreading of an

841
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,710
idea and so I just used that as a metric
to help me understand am I sort of

842
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,050
marching in the because the more I
preach,

843
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,240
is it resonating,
you know,

844
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,750
and so you have a couple of these
imperfect measurements that help you

845
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:28,890
understand are you going along the way
so it's not just great effort.

846
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,620
Look what you achieved because that's
what we're doing now,

847
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,810
right?
Our goal is to increase top line

848
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,330
revenues by $50,
million dollars for what reason?

849
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,900
Right?
Which is we have to know the destination

850
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,020
and then we say,
amazing.

851
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,240
You took us that much closer and if we
go to the right,

852
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,220
it's because we were overcoming an
obstacle.

853
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,820
If we hadn't gone to the right,
we would've been stuck forever.

854
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,500
Thank you.
You know,

855
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,010
it's not always straight lines.
It's not always straight lines,

856
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,110
but it's.
It's in one direction.

857
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:02,110
She's playing the cane up.
Thank you very,

858
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:02,944
very much.

859
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Thank you.
