1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,820
So there was one thing I teach and I
want to remind you of it.

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:12,850
It's really simple things.
Getting things not going to make her

3
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,100
happy.
That's good news in a tough economy,

4
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,230
it's a good reminder.
You know it doesn't matter what you get,

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,870
doesn't matter whether it be money or
opportunity.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,270
All those things might excite you for
the moment.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,940
You know,
even a relationship as magnificent it

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,460
may be,
might be exciting for a while,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
but if you don't keep growing,
that relationship isn't going to stay

10
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,880
excited.
So the secret to real happiness is

11
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:36,400
progress.
Progress equals happiness.

12
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,170
And if we can make progress on a regular
basis,

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,330
we feel alive.
And that's why at the beginning of the

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,620
year we get this thing like,
okay,

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,280
I can have this fresh start.
I could really do what my soul desires.

16
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,930
I can expand.
I could grow,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,010
I could improve.

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,740
I could change or maybe better than
change.

19
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,870
I could progress.
See,

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,690
think about that progress as an a
liveliness to it,

21
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,940
doesn't it?
You don't have to work at changing.

22
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,520
People say all the time,
now I'm working on changing.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,100
Don't worry about it.
You don't have to work on changing.

24
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,740
Change is automatic.
Your body's going to change whether you

25
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,320
wanted it or not.
As the years go by and I'm going to how

26
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,880
hard you work,
there's going to be some changes going

27
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,310
on there.
The economy's going to change no matter

28
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,950
what you want it to do.
The weather's going to change.

29
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,250
Relationships are going to change.
Everything in life is always changing.

30
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,650
We don't have to work on change.
Change is automatic,

31
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:24,610
but progress is not.
So if you want to make real progress,

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,010
then you really got to look at your life
in a different way.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,980
You gotta say,
I gotta take control of this process and

34
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,520
not just hope it's gonna work out like
people do who make a resolution cause

35
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,590
really isn't that what they're really
doing at the beginning of the year.

36
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,750
They're saying,
well here's my resolutions for the year

37
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:39,880
and they really basically tell you their
wishes.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,130
It's their wishlist.
It's what they hope.

39
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:45,340
It all comes together and then they call
it a resolution,

40
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,230
but they don't know what a resolution
is.

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,340
When you resolve something,
to have a resolution is to resolve it.

42
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:53,500
When you resolve,
this is how it's going to be.

43
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,400
That's when you cut off any possibility
except the thing you've committed to.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,160
It's like the old adage,
if you want to take the island,

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,070
you burn the boats.
Cause when you burn those boats,

46
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,200
there's no going back.
You're going to find a way to make

47
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,300
things work.
And most people,

48
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,490
they're stating what they hope will come
together.

49
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,860
And if it doesn't happen,
then they're disappointed,

50
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,080
but they're not too disappointed cause
they're not too vested.

51
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,340
What does it take to successfully create
a lasting change in your life?

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,370
To not only have a new years resolution
you fall through on,

53
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,840
but really have a lasting change?
Well,

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,020
the first step for lasting change is
very much like making a new year's

55
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,460
resolution.
Fundamentally,

56
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,320
it's the same.
The first step is you've got to have a

57
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,530
vision,
a vision for what it is you really truly

58
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,530
want,
not what you think you want and what you

59
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,370
should have.
I mean,

60
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,690
what are most people's new years
resolutions?

61
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,690
I'm gonna stop eating sugar and I'm
going to stop smoking.

62
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,440
I'm gonna lose 10 pounds.
Problem with that is it's not very

63
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,540
inspiring for most people.
You know?

64
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,580
It's not telling you what you're going
to get.

65
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,790
It's only what you're not going to do,
and it's Kinda hard to have you move

66
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,624
forward with that.

67
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,480
A vision is about what you're here to
create.

68
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,870
A vision that really works is one that
excites you.

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,580
If you say,
well,

70
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,330
my,
no,

71
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,530
my resolution,
my goal,

72
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,940
my outcome for this month,
this week,

73
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,390
this year is to lose x number of pounds.
That's okay,

74
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,510
but it's not very compelling.
It has to be a compelling vision.

75
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,670
It's got to have something,
has the power to pull you,

76
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,190
not something you have to push yourself
to do.

77
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,080
Well,
the two different kinds of motivation,

78
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,800
push requires willpower and willpower
never lasts.

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,970
What will last is pull.
Having something so exciting,

80
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:29,470
so attractive,
so somebody who desires so much that you

81
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,260
have a hard time going to sleep at night
and you get so up early in the morning

82
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,060
to a rocket and take it to the next
level.

83
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,770
That's what you're looking to create and
that was it.

84
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,440
Easy to get.
But one of the reasons we do seminars

85
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,280
and events and he's saying,
you know,

86
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,000
why do that?

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,890
Why isn't my not just read a book or
something?

88
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,460
It's because when you get an environment
where you're with people that are being

89
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,520
put in a peak state,
like when you're going to a sporting

90
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,350
event,
if you watch a sporting event at home,

91
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,730
it might have a certain level of
excitement,

92
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,520
but when you're in a stadium with 50,000
people,

93
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,190
suddenly it has a whole different level
of intensity.

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,790
When we feel that in the bottom line of
our follow through comes down to our

95
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,580
emotional intensity in a different state
of mind,

96
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,430
you're going to come up with a much
better in a more exciting vision than if

97
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,290
you're sitting on the couch going,
okay,

98
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,320
what am I new revolutions for this year?
And you're doing it the morning after

99
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:15,250
the new year started and your little
inebriated and the football games on in

100
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,710
the background,
probably not going to have the power of

101
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,160
focus.

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,710
They're probably not gonna have the
power or the energy to create something

103
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,350
that's going to pull you for this year
and you've got to do that.

104
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,480
So it's gotta be a vision that's
compelling,

105
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,510
something that no,
it's going to be a gift to make sure

106
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,630
that it happens.
And also along with that compelling

107
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:34,060
vision,
you got to have strong enough reasons

108
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,400
that you're going to follow through when
the going gets tough.

109
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,860
That's one of the biggest things missing
for most people.

110
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,120
They said,
this is what I want to do.

111
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,340
It's not very exciting.
It's not very compelling,

112
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,490
but most importantly,
they don't have strong enough reasons to

113
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,790
push themselves through what's going to
be necessary to get that dream,

114
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,820
to get that goal when the inevitable
challenges come up,

115
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,710
when you're starving,
hungry and you're trying to go on a

116
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,630
diet,
right when you got no time and you're

117
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,250
stressed out and you haven't worked out
still,

118
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,390
and that's what you're supposed to do.

119
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,620
When the economy gets tight and what you
thought you're going to do doesn't work.

120
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,410
And so you give up on the goal instead
of finding another way to get there.

121
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,770
You don't let the fear take you over.
If you've got strong enough reasons,

122
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,580
those reasons can be positive or those
reasons can also be negative.

123
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:13,900
They can be,
if I don't do this,

124
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,100
this,
it's going to cost me.

125
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,650
And if I do to this,
this is what I'm going to gain in my

126
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,380
life.
Reasons come first,

127
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,980
answers come second.
If you get a compelling vision and

128
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,700
you've got strong enough reasons that
will push you through the tough times,

129
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,290
you're gonna do things other people
don't do it.

130
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,630
It's been a collapsing.
Even if you get off target,

131
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,111
you won't go,
Oh,

132
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,940
I blew it.
You'll get right back on target.

133
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:35,830
Make the change,
make things happen.

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,780
And I know you've done this in many
areas of your life.

135
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:40,480
Just think about it again.
I'm not teaching you something really

136
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,210
new here today.
I just want to remind you of what your

137
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,010
soul knows.
You gotta change,

138
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,460
you gotta improve and you gotta go
through a simple process fundamentally

139
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,250
to make that progress.
First step vision,

140
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,750
that's compelling.
Second step,

141
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,000
make sure that they're strong enough
reason to follow through.

142
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,000
Third step,
you got review it and feel it every day.

143
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,120
I mean anything.
Have you ever had this happen in your

144
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,650
life?
Has there been anything in your life

145
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:07,910
that you've ever wanted so badly?
You were so desirous of it,

146
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,850
you have such a hunger for it that you
couldn't stop thinking about.

147
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,630
It could been a career move.
Could have been when you're a kid,

148
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,610
a car.
It could have been a relationship,

149
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,620
it could have been anything,
but you were obsessed.

150
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,440
You wanted to make this happen.
You want to attract this to your life.

151
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,710
You want to,
you just wanted something and you didn't

152
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:27,620
even know how to get it,
but it was so compelling to,

153
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,540
you kept thinking about it every day,
envisioning it,

154
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,710
imagining it,
feeling it,

155
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,750
and then stuff happened and suddenly you
started to attract people or situations

156
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,200
to your life and it just came together
like you didn't even have a total plan.

157
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,190
It was just that it was so a part of
your focus with so much intensity and

158
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,390
emotion so often that it's sensitize you
to notice anything that could get you

159
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,730
there.
There's a part of your brain called the

160
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:52,880
reticular activating system for short,
we call it the Ras.

161
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,160
That part of your brain determines what
you notice in the world and it's really

162
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,760
important because when you set a goal,
when you get really clear on a vision,

163
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:05,030
they're strong enough reasons and you
review it enough and it becomes a part

164
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,280
of you,
that part of your brain says,

165
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,530
anything that relates to this,
I need to notice.

166
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,140
It's like,
did you ever buy a certain kind of car

167
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,280
or maybe a certain outfit and suddenly
you see that car everywhere,

168
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,990
those outfits everywhere.
You know the cars were always around,

169
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:21,620
but why do you see it now?
Cause your Ras knows this is important.

170
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,080
This is part of my world now.
Similarly,

171
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,460
when you really get clear and it's
compelling and you're reviewing it every

172
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,330
day,
got strong reasons,

173
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,950
you're reviewing it every day and you're
feeling it.

174
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,750
The brain becomes incredibly acute at
noticing anything to get you to move

175
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,670
forward.
And so that's the power of this.

176
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,110
So you know,
what do people do with a new year's

177
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,850
resolution?
They come up with something they kind of

178
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,920
want,
if not a compelling vision,

179
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,370
they don't really have strong enough
reasons and they never review it again

180
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,340
until the notice that they broker what
they said they really want to have make

181
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:52,250
happen because they didn't really
resolve you resolve.

182
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,510
You've got the vision,
it's compelling,

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,500
you review it daily and you feel it,
you envision it and you experience it as

184
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,030
simple as it sounds.
Now ultimately,

185
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,700
what does this really about?
Ultimately,

186
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,740
if you're going to have lasting change
in anything,

187
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,710
you're really talking about just raising
your standards.

188
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,940
I mean,
I always tell people,

189
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,560
if you want to know how to change your
life and give it to him,

190
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,150
three words,
boring as it sounds,

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,570
raise your standards and what does that
mean?

192
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,220
Corny as it sounds,
raise your standards.

193
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,480
So thank you for the breakthrough
thought,

194
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,830
Tony.
I'm glad I wasted my time watching the

195
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,900
little email with you.
But think about it.

196
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,360
Lasting change is different than a goal.
You don't always get your goals,

197
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,870
but you always get your standards.
Maybe it will help you is to think about

198
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,820
it this way.
I try to explain standards to people

199
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,290
with a different set of words.

200
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,490
Think of it as everybody in life gets
their musts.

201
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,730
They don't get the shits,
but think about it.

202
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,770
Most people have a list of shoulds,
don't they?

203
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,900
Don't have a list of the shuts things
you should do.

204
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,750
You should follow through on I,
I should lose some weight.

205
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,940
I should work out more.
I should make more calls.

206
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,610
I should respond more rapidly to my
email,

207
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,810
whatever.
You know,

208
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,540
I should get into the office earlier.
I should be more confident.

209
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,570
Whatever your should list is.
People love to have their should list

210
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,070
make me mad,
but it's kind of like New Year's

211
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,080
resolutions.
If it does,

212
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,580
it's really exciting,
but if it doesn't,

213
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,750
which is most of the time,
yeah,

214
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,780
it's a little disappointing,
but you kind of know it's not going to

215
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,640
happen,
but when you decide something is a must

216
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,530
for you,
an absolute must.

217
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,060
When you cut up any possible,
you just say,

218
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,070
I'm going to find the way I'm going to
make the way.

219
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,320
Human beings,
when they resolve things and they have

220
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,350
to make a real resolution inside
themselves,

221
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:24,630
which is they raised the standard and
they make it a must.

222
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,840
They find a way to think about it in
your own life,

223
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,310
how could you add some area of your life
where you raise your standard and your

224
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:35,100
life has never been the same?
Maybe at one time your life,

225
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,940
you smoked cigarettes or he did
something and you did it for years and

226
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,610
you kept trying to change it,
trying to change it and kept telling

227
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,340
yourself I should and the one day
something happened,

228
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,400
something just clicked you over.
Something took you over.

229
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,720
That kind of tipping point and inside
yourself you said no more.

230
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,760
There was a very,
very different experience,

231
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,880
wasn't it?
Something inside of you shifted and what

232
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,090
was a should became a must and you've
never gone back.

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,330
Is there an area like that in your life
you can think of again?

234
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,970
Do you ever smoke cigarettes?
Did you ever eat a certain way?

235
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,550
Drink a certain form of alcohol and then
finally saying no more and you just

236
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:11,850
don't go back and notice this.
It doesn't really take any willpower

237
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,880
anymore because somewhere when we make
this click,

238
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,270
we make something a must.
We attach ourselves to it.

239
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,100
It becomes part of our identity.
One thing I've learned in the last,

240
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,040
Gosh,
33 years at working with people from now

241
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,930
over a hundred countries,
4 million people,

242
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,090
is human beings absolutely follow
through on who they believe they are.

243
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,580
And you said said to me,
well,

244
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,980
I'm really going to work hard to stop
smoking,

245
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
but you know,
I've been a smoker my whole life and

246
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,461
I'm,
you know,

247
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,340
I am a smoker.
I know your days are numbered.

248
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,790
You're gonna be back smoking cigarettes
again because we all act consistent with

249
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,080
who we believe we are.
I tell people the strongest force in the

250
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:55,950
whole human personality is this need to
stay consistent with how we define

251
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:59,070
ourselves.
If you define yourself as somebody who

252
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:02,460
is really conservative,
you're not going to be crazy and act

253
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,230
nuts unless you're really drunk or
something.

254
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,890
And then you can say if the alcohol,
when it's really just you finally

255
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,500
getting permission to be yourself.
The alcohol is your excuse.

256
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,920
If you're really crazy person,
you act crazy,

257
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,000
outrageous,
playful.

258
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,940
You don't act conservative because
that's not who you are.

259
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,740
Very often people say,
well,

260
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,930
I can't do that.
I'm not that kind of person,

261
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,490
and I always say to people,
really,

262
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,730
when did you define yourself?
I mean really?

263
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:29,880
How many years ago did you come up with
what you could and couldn't do in your

264
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:30,714
life?

265
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,120
How many years ago?
Most people,

266
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,250
if they really look at how they're
living their life today,

267
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,240
it's based on a set of standards,
a set of beliefs that they made choices

268
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:44,241
about 10 2030 or more years ago.
I mean very often we made decisions in

269
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,480
our youth or very young about what to
believe about what we were capable of,

270
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:52,110
about who we are as a person,
and that becomes the glass ceiling,

271
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,440
if you will,
that controls us.

272
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,110
There's a corny metaphor,
but it's true.

273
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,680
I remember one time I was with my family
at the circus and there was a person

274
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,390
there and they had this big giant
elephant.

275
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,240
And you look at this elephant and they
take this little rope,

276
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,520
put it around the elephant's neck,
and they drive the stake into the

277
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,110
ground.
And I mean,

278
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,870
you look at this and you know that
elephant could written down the entire

279
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:12,790
tent with almost no effort.

280
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,070
And yet the elephant doesn't struggle,
doesn't try.

281
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,140
Why?
Because the elephant is conditioned and

282
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,880
they take that elephant condition.
The elephant,

283
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,770
when it's a baby elephant,
that's how they train them.

284
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,410
When if a little baby elephant and it
doesn't have the power yet,

285
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,950
they put a big rope around it and they
drive this huge stake in the ground and

286
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,690
the elephant fights and fights and
fights,

287
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,300
and one day finally that elephant
decides,

288
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,440
I'm not capable of pulling this out.
And once that becomes the definition of

289
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,530
an identity of anyone,
an elephant in this case,

290
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,560
they don't even try anymore.
It's just who I am.

291
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,620
That's how it is.
That's just the way it is in my life.

292
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,030
I'd like to ask you to take a look at
any place you've got a limitation.

293
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,730
Ask Yourself,
when did I decide to accept that

294
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,980
limitation?
And you may not even see it as a

295
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,490
limitation.

296
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,170
You might see it as just that's who I
am.

297
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,450
But so often our lives,
we've adapted to be a certain way so

298
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:04,480
that we don't fail or so that people
will like us or respect us,

299
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:08,920
but it's not necessarily who we are.
Joy comes when you're spontaneous.

300
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,480
It's really hard to be truly happy when
you're not being yourself.

301
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,840
And most of us have no clue who we are.
And so a big part of my work,

302
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,100
if you've ever been to an event you
know,

303
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,100
is to get people to do things
spontaneously without thinking because

304
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,160
that's when the real you shows up.
That's when the energy comes alive.

305
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,160
And when you do that,
when you start to connect your true

306
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,830
nature,
suddenly there's energy available for

307
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,230
you to set a higher standard for what
you want in your life.

308
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,910
That's what this is really all about.

309
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,020
And when to talk about standards.
When I talk about [inaudible] versus

310
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,950
musts,
think about your own life.

311
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,240
I know there have been areas in your
life where some point in time you just

312
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:47,800
shifted and you raised the standard in
your life changed because whatever

313
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:51,370
people have their identity attached to,
they live.

314
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,760
We live who we believe we are.
That's just how it works.

315
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,350
It just kind of like I give an example.
Look at your physical body.

316
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,210
Your physical body today is an absolute
reflection of only one thing,

317
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,060
not your goals,
not your desires,

318
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,270
but your standards,
the identity you have for yourself.

319
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,560
If your standard is you're an athlete,
then there's a certain amount of

320
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,170
strength,
a muscle tone and energy that's

321
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:21,420
available in your body on a regular
basis because that's who you are and so

322
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,770
you do whatever's necessary to maintain
that identity.

323
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,110
Again,
the strongest force in the human

324
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:30,040
personality is this need to stay
consistent with how we define ourselves.

325
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,850
Because if you don't know who you are,
you would know how to act.

326
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,300
Once you lock in on that identity,
your brain finds a way to keep you

327
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,690
there.
If you say,

328
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:39,490
uh,
you know,

329
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,480
man,
I'm overweight,

330
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,900
I've always been overweight,
I'm big boned and that's the story

331
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,120
you've got.
Then you're going to always find a way

332
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,160
to get back there.
That's your settling point.

333
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,740
That's your identity.
That's where things lock in.

334
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,420
If you see somebody who's in really
great shape,

335
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,040
you ask him,
do you work out?

336
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,060
You know the answer?
Yes.

337
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,530
How often?
And they'll tell you three times,

338
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,640
four times,
five times a week,

339
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,900
whatever.
In a seminar.

340
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,700
Last people who here works out at least
five days a week and I'm stand up and

341
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:08,600
you look around that room and you know
that they work out five times a week.

342
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,540
As you can see their body,
you don't just get a result without some

343
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,790
kind of action,
without some form of ritual,

344
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,340
ritual meaning actions you do
consistently.

345
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,560
Now,
do you think he knows people that are

346
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:23,360
out there working out five days a week?
Do they have more time than you do or I

347
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,220
have or anybody else?
Of course,

348
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,170
no.
Is that a white less busy?

349
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,450
Of course not.
It's just a must for them.

350
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,960
They must work out that way and they've
made that turn their life change.

351
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,270
So I'm not saying you have to work out
five days a week.

352
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,370
I'm just saying whatever you really
want,

353
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,340
wants,
don't get met consistently,

354
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,920
standards,
do whatever you identify.

355
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,800
This is who I am.
And so it's not so much about changing

356
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,770
your identity as there's expanding it,
you know,

357
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,940
deciding that you know,
instead of your goals to lose 10 pounds,

358
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,850
which is not compelling.
What if your vision was to get back to

359
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,570
my fighting weight?
You know this,

360
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:58,730
this year,
this month,

361
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,220
this next 90 days I'm going to transform
my body.

362
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm going to take on a new challenge.
I'm going to find some technique or

363
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,930
strategy.
There's a million of them that can

364
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,790
reframe myself where I want to feel
younger,

365
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,770
stronger,
more vibrant than ever before.

366
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,550
Here's my reasons because I want the
energy to really make my life work

367
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,430
because it's tough out there and I want
to be stronger than I've ever been

368
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,430
before.
I want to go in front of the mirror and

369
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,880
if I'm making it not,
you know,

370
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,650
want to laugh,
I want to look there and take a good

371
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:22,880
look and go,
yeah,

372
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,690
I'm proud of whenever I see there,
whatever it takes,

373
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,340
someone's going to make you laugh,
smile,

374
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,900
something that's going to tease
yourself,

375
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,760
but someone's going to move you to
another level.

376
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,140
If you identify yourself in a new way
and you own that every day,

377
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,150
and that becomes the standard how you
live,

378
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,070
you'll find the way to make that
standard.

379
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,820
Real money's the same way.
Think about it doesn't matter what's

380
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,140
happening,
quote unquote,

381
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:48,650
in the marketplace.
People that make money find a way to

382
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,970
make money no matter what,
don't they?

383
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,270
I mean,
most people's standard is to pay their

384
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,970
bills.
So that's what most people find a way to

385
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,830
do.
Even when economic times get tough.

386
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,750
Most people,
if that's their absolute standard,

387
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,110
they find a way.
Some people's standard is pay their

388
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:06,080
bills most of the time and some,
most of the time they do.

389
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,440
Some people's standard is not just to
pay their bills but to take care of

390
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,070
their family and maybe even some of
their friends and they find a way.

391
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,140
In fact,
human may,

392
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,630
some people may be in a family where
they don't have enough money to barely

393
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:21,350
have money to pay their bills.
They work their guts out and then

394
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:23,450
somebody,
their mother or their father or somebody

395
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,180
else,
their sister gets ill and there's not

396
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,200
enough money to take care of it.

397
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,060
Nobody else has money and family.
They don't either,

398
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,700
but they find a way to get that money to
take care of their mother or father

399
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:35,300
don't pay and pay their bills.
They never could do it before.

400
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:39,170
Why the situation made them raise their
own standard and not everybody does

401
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,400
that.
Somebody else in the family might have

402
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,870
money and still not take care of their
mother.

403
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,150
It all comes down to the inner game.
My friends changing your life is a

404
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,610
change in the inner game.
The outside world you can't control,

405
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,380
but you have absolute control over this
one.

406
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:57,381
If you learn the dynamics of what shapes
you and identity is one of those simple,

407
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:01,140
clear,
fundamental basics that if you start

408
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,210
start to shift it,
everything else will shift in your life

409
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,380
as well.
Some people are,

410
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,300
by the way,
have to have more than enough money to

411
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,080
do what they want.

412
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,160
When they want,
where they want,

413
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,320
with whomever they want,
contribute the way they want.

414
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,600
That's their must.
They find a way.

415
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,170
I know that sounds overly simplistic,
but it's true.

416
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,670
Now,
somebody wants said,

417
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,640
you can take all the money in the world,
out of the hands of everybody.

418
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,250
Out of all the wealthy people in the
world who are really successful,

419
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,960
given other people,
it wouldn't take too long.

420
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,340
Those people have it back in their
hands.

421
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,350
It's not because they're manipulative,
it's cause they have a standard.

422
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,700
Some are manipulative,
don't get me wrong,

423
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,550
but they've got a standard of what
they're gonna find a way to make happen.

424
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,090
I'm just simply saying to you,
take those three magic words and live

425
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,510
them.
Raise your standard if you really want

426
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,760
to do it.
And I'll tell you the most important

427
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,770
secret.
Have you ever done this?

428
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,750
Have you ever told yourself,
you're raising your standard?

429
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,370
Okay,
I'm going to go make this happen.

430
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm going to go make this much money.
I'm going to transform my kids.

431
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,740
I'm going to create the ultimate
relationship in my life.

432
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,480
I'm going to transform my body,
whatever it is,

433
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,620
and then you don't have strong enough
reasons and you don't lose use it.

434
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,830
You don't follow through.
It's because you didn't back up your

435
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:05,310
standards with what makes those
standards real and that's rituals.

436
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,070
Rituals are the power is whenever we do
our Robbins results coaching,

437
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,620
you know he's in Robbins equals results.
Wait,

438
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:14,760
we get results with people with the same
way.

439
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,390
If you listen to my ultimate edge
program or back in the old days,

440
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,700
personal power,
or if you went to one of my seminars,

441
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,820
you know what I do is I take these huge
challenges you've got and we break them

442
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:28,770
down into little bite size steps,
little things you do each day that after

443
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:31,410
you do them,
you get so much momentum that it's easy

444
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:31,950
to succeed.

445
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,100
You're not overwhelmed.
You have these victory day after day

446
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:38,190
after day on little things.
If you'd went to ultimate edge,

447
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:42,540
I'm sure you learned about the hour of
power or the 15 minutes to be able to be

448
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,720
fulfilled or 30 minutes to thrive where
you literally just condition your body

449
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:49,440
and emotion with a couple little rituals
so it doesn't matter what's going on in

450
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,300
your world.
You feel that strength and it's not

451
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,740
fake.
It's not some pump up.

452
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,050
It's coming from inside you and it
works.

453
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,360
Rituals define us.
See all the results in your life are

454
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:03,690
coming from your rituals.
They start with a standard and then have

455
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,480
rituals that fallen up like for example,
if you are where you want to be

456
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,300
physically,
you have very different rituals than if

457
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,590
you're not where you want to be
physically.

458
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,200
If you're overweight,
you and I both know you got a different

459
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,050
ritual than if you're physically fit
completely different.

460
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,600
You get up in the morning,
what's the first thing you do?

461
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,480
If you're fit,
your shoes are there.

462
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,520
You roll over the metal that you feel
you put on the shoes,

463
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,890
you lace and you start walking or
whatever that ritual is.

464
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,590
If you're overweight,
you roll over and you have a very

465
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,050
different ritual.
You might roll over several times that

466
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:34,350
turn the alarm clock off.
You go in and get your Mocha Smoko,

467
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,800
whatever you know,
special coffee you stop by at starbucks

468
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,020
or the case may be you have your nice
sugar muffin.

469
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,180
You know it's supposed to be really nice
for you.

470
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,190
Whatever you do,
it's a different ritual.

471
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,370
If you have a great passionate
relationship,

472
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,900
you're very different rituals and how
you come home.

473
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,510
Then if you have a lousy relationship,
become come home in.

474
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:56,050
The first thing you do is you're
tweeting somebody or you're emailing or

475
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,670
flipping on the news or you don't even
come home and what are the rituals?

476
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,220
Whenever I study people that are
successful,

477
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,170
well,
I look for is what's the standard they

478
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,980
hold themselves to and then what are all
those little rituals that up because

479
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,850
think about it,
success and failure are not giant

480
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,830
events.
They don't just show up.

481
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,410
You don't just suddenly become
successful or suddenly have this

482
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:19,990
cataclysmic event that makes you fail.
It may look that way,

483
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,900
but failure comes some.
All the little things.

484
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,850
It's failure to make the call.
It's failure to check the books.

485
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,100
It's failure to say,
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,270
It's feel your to push yourself to do
things physically that you don't want to

487
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,420
do it.
All those little failures day after day

488
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,090
come together until one day some
cataclysmic event happens.

489
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,240
You blame that that event happened
because you missed all the little stuff.

490
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,480
Do you agree with me and success by the
way,

491
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,070
is not some overnight event.

492
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,370
It's all these little things.
Success is having a vision.

493
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:54,990
Success is making it compelling.
Success is really seeing it,

494
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,950
feeling it everyday was strong enough
reasons.

495
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Success is feeling the sense that I'm
here to grow and I'm here to give

496
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:03,220
something to the world more than just
myself.

497
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,660
Success is caring about other people.
Success is calling and saying,

498
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,760
I love you in the middle of the day for
no damn reason or sending a note that

499
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,100
will change your relationship.
Have a ritual of something funny,

500
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,020
playful,
or a surprise.

501
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:20,380
You knew how many relationships are dead
today because they have no surprise

502
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,530
rituals anymore.
You need to have some rituals,

503
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:27,100
some cool things you do that nobody else
does that gives you a better life than

504
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:29,920
anybody else has.
All the little stuff.

505
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,710
That's where success comes from in
business,

506
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,440
it comes to delivering more than anybody
could imagine.

507
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,000
All those little things that have people
go,

508
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:39,340
wow,
that's who I want to do business with.

509
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,020
It's true in any area of your life.
So if you look at somebody who's really

510
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,190
successful and you think,
wow,

511
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,600
I mean they're,
they're so amazing,

512
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,820
they're such a genius.
You got to dig underneath and you've

513
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:52,510
gotta remember something.
People are rewarded in public for what

514
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:56,260
they've practiced for years in private,
myself and my business,

515
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,730
people say,
how do you get up and speak and he'll

516
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,730
know notes and you go for three days and
nights in the room is like everybody's

517
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:02,830
wired and it's incredible.
It's like a rock concert.

518
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,290
How do you do that?
How do you have that confidence of hall

519
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,970
and you know,
it's not confidence,

520
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:10,270
it's experience now,
but I did so much behind the scenes and

521
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:14,500
I still do to make things right.
I mean how many people would know that

522
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,890
since the time I was 17 years old before
I walk on stage,

523
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,540
still do to this day wouldn't need to do
it,

524
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,374
but I still do it.

525
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,100
I never walk out there without being in
an absolute peak state of mind.

526
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,590
You know,
there are days my back is hurting,

527
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:28,930
my throat was hurting or I may have had
a challenger,

528
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,830
my father passed away and I've still got
to deliver for these people cause my

529
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,020
standard is give my all,
every time.

530
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,840
Every band has to be better.
Talk to anybody who's been to our events

531
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,040
for five,
10 years.

532
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,520
Some of our trainers,
I don't know,

533
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,880
he does it.
He's always finds a way to make it

534
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:43,960
better.
That's not an ego thing.

535
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:47,180
That's a standard in me.
I have to find the way.

536
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,160
And my ritual though is I prepare,
I think I got the new information.

537
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,690
I figured out how to put something
across better.

538
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,940
What do people need?
I spend time with our customers.

539
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,340
I see what's going on and before I get
on stage,

540
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,940
each time I have to a ritual to put
myself in a state of mind.

541
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,370
And I did it starting from like 17 years
old.

542
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,700
I started doing it and say,
I now command my subconscious mind and I

543
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:12,350
say this out loud several times,
this little phrase set of phrases as an

544
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,320
incantation to kind of condition my mind
and body.

545
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,230
And I'd say I now command my
subconscious mind to direct me in

546
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:21,620
helping as many people as possible today
by giving me the strength and the

547
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:25,430
emotion and the humor and the brevity,
whatever it takes to show this person

548
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,320
and help this person change their life.
Now.

549
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,630
And I started out with a person when I
work with people one on one and I will

550
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:34,670
do that for 45 minutes driving in my
Volkswagen to go serve and coach

551
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,460
somebody for the first time.
Now I don't say that person.

552
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:42,050
I say these people and I can go out in a
room of 10,000 people and deliver for 50

553
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:44,060
hours,
and I do it every time I come back on

554
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:44,360
stage.

555
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,790
It's a ritual,
a ritual to go into peak state.

556
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,130
Peak states don't just show up,
they don't interrupt you.

557
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,800
Great ideas don't interrupt.
You got to pursue them.

558
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,400
I talked to Michael Jordan,
I'll never forget at the peak of his

559
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:59,570
career and got to watch his final games,
saw him backstage and spent some time

560
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,870
with them and it was pretty exciting
time was greatest basketball player and

561
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,370
I think that ever lived and has ever
lived.

562
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,990
And I asked them,
I said,

563
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:08,510
you know what sets you apart Michael?
You know,

564
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,750
what is it and is it God given talent,
ability,

565
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:12,411
skill,
what does it?

566
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:12,951
And he said,
Tony,

567
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:13,850
you know,
he said,

568
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,260
I can shoot you straight.
And you know,

569
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,250
it's not,
you know,

570
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,500
me trying to act humble.
He goes,

571
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,100
I have a lot of tell a lot of God given
talent,

572
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:20,540
a lot of skill.

573
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,560
I've worked really hard.
But he said,

574
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:26,000
really it's my standards.
He said every day I demand more from

575
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,760
myself than anybody else could humanly
expect.

576
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,570
I'm not competing with somebody else.
I'm competing with Lon capable of

577
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,610
magic formula because most of us lower
our standards.

578
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,340
Why?
Because please spend time with my

579
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,330
friends.
Who Do you become?

580
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,440
One of the biggest reasons I started
going to seminars when I was like 17 as

581
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:47,570
I have nobody around me as a great role
model,

582
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,120
I could read about somebody,
but being around people,

583
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:51,530
being in the environment was very
different.

584
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,560
Finding where to go to work with someone
who lived at standard life is very

585
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:58,850
different and get around people with low
standards and you compete with it.

586
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,590
You don't need to compete with it.
It's like,

587
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,110
okay.
I mean number Jerry Springer know if

588
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,180
he's still in the air,
but I've never used to get people on the

589
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,690
show and I thought where would he find
these people and why would people watch?

590
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,070
I'll you why they watch they watch these
people.

591
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,500
Don't my wife's know pretty darn good.
Compare that person,

592
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,990
learn of him.
You don't have to change your life.

593
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,330
All you have to do is find somebody with
a lower standard and you'll feel good

594
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:20,210
about yourself.
But if you feel that good feeling,

595
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,120
it's an illusion.
The only thing that's gonna make you

596
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,470
happy,
my friend in this year,

597
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,720
any other,
is to step up.

598
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,080
It's to raise the standard.
It's to discover what you're capable of

599
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:34,700
and feel that incredible power of
pushing through whatever's holding you

600
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,000
back and get to the other side of more
of your true self.

601
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,780
That's what this game is all about.
And look at the best of the world in

602
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:42,770
anything.
Tiger Woods,

603
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:45,060
what's,
what's his vision to win golf

604
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,960
tournaments?
No,

605
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,980
to be the best that ever lived.
That's his goal.

606
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,760
That's his vision.

607
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,160
But here's what's interesting.
He backs it up with rituals.

608
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,200
If you just have a vision and you don't
have the rituals,

609
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,960
stop lying to yourself.
His rituals are,

610
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,010
he started doing things nobody did
before he went,

611
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,610
started lifting weights,
golfers lifting weights,

612
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,510
no way.
He went out and he changed his swing

613
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,050
when he was the best in the world
because you realized in order to be the

614
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,970
best that ever lived,
he's gonna have to change his swing.

615
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,040
If you don't think about golf,
you don't change your swing when you're

616
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,070
the best.
And he went and retrained himself

617
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,560
because he has different rituals than
other golfers.

618
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:21,240
Now,
many people are modeling his rituals to

619
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,920
get better.
It's amazing.

620
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,980
You know,
you look at somebody like Michael

621
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,530
Phelps,
the 2008 swimmer won seven,

622
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,060
you know,
only two people I think in history,

623
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:32,970
if I remember correctly,
that have gotten seven gold medals in

624
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:33,804
one session.

625
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,170
And here's a guy,
he's got number six centers belt and

626
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,600
he's exhausted and he's going in for
that final swim.

627
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm sure you remember.
And how does the guy win by 100th of a

628
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:50,130
second.
Do you think that was some massive skill

629
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,310
that got them over the top or was it a
standard that says,

630
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,600
this is who I am,
I am the champion and no one has taken

631
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,550
us from me.
And somehow in those final

632
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,000
sub-millisecond hundredth of a second,
he pushed himself just beyond his

633
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,000
competitor.
But you know about Michael Phelps.

634
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,450
What allowed him to be able to push
beyond that moment is his rituals.

635
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,470
Go study the guy.
Most people who swim have these

636
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,820
unbelievable workouts.
He does two and three of the workout

637
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,400
sessions a day.
All the other swimmers in the beginning

638
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,550
thought he was insane.
You can overtrain you can't do that if

639
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,370
not physically possible,
but he had a standard and the rituals

640
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,283
tobacco.

641
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,060
So here's my final message to you cause
I've gotten carried away.

642
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,830
I thought I was going to send you like a
five minute message,

643
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:34,710
but you can see there's no script here.
Just me going a little crazy with you.

644
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,810
But I want to really see you get what
you want this year.

645
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,720
Don't let this year be like last and if
last year was great,

646
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,850
still don't let it be that way.
Raise the standard.

647
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,890
If your life is perfect and
extraordinary,

648
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,160
you darn well know you're not going to
be happy unless you keep making it

649
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,170
better.
That's what makes us feel alive.

650
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:53,280
It's not what we get to make us happy.
It's who we become and what we're able

651
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:56,700
to give because we become more.
That sense of contribution is what

652
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,390
creates the deepest meaning.
So here's my assignment for if you want

653
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,700
one,
if you want to go from conversation to

654
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,050
some action here,
simple thing to do.

655
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,690
What's an area of life right now that
you really want improve?

656
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,820
What's an area that's important to
improve?

657
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,820
Your body's great.
How much crew careers?

658
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:12,960
Great.
How about your relationships?

659
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,580
Intimate one especially or your kids or
your relationship with your Creator,

660
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,610
spiritual side of your life,
or is it your finances?

661
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,730
Figure an area that really matters.
Decide on that area.

662
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,400
Number one,
write down what your life is like in

663
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,470
that area right now specifically as
possible.

664
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,970
So you might say,
well,

665
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:34,971
I'm 13.5 pounds overweight,
whatever the weight is,

666
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,050
whatever the situation is,
or my body fat's like this,

667
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:39,510
or I'm pr,
I wake up exhausted in the morning.

668
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,470
And you're right.
The truth of where you are right now.

669
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,100
So you're real clear or I'm not in a
relationship.

670
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:46,600
I say I want a relationship.
But I,

671
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,730
I'm not in one.
I don't seem to find them.

672
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,560
All the good ones seem to be gone is my
belief,

673
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,110
you know?
And I really do want one,

674
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,700
but I don't have it.
Whatever your definition,

675
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:57,640
I'm in a relationship and God,
I wish I wasn't in a relationship.

676
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,170
I'm planning my escape wherever you are,
or I have a lot wonderful relationship.

677
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:04,180
We love each other,
but there just isn't enough passion.

678
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,630
Just write the truth of where you are,
the or you want to change,

679
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,470
but write how it is.
And then the second step is this where

680
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,850
you gotta be really honest with
yourself.

681
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,250
What are the rituals that have put me
there?

682
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,720
Because whatever results you're getting,
even if you don't like the results,

683
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,600
there's some rituals that are keeping
you in that place.

684
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,390
There's some rituals of what you eat or
don't eat,

685
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,820
how you move or don't move,
how you sleep or don't sleep.

686
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:33,050
There are some rituals in the lack of
variety or spice or energy or focus in

687
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:36,160
an area.
There's something you're doing and it's

688
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,140
usually not one thing.
It's a bunch of little things.

689
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,660
They kind of do consistently.
Whenever you think about getting in a

690
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,100
relationship,
whenever you think about working out,

691
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,010
whenever you think about money and get
yourself in a state of overwhelmed,

692
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,170
you start thinking about all the things
you can't control.

693
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,230
Just write down all the rituals you have
and then here's the third step.

694
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,390
What do you want?
What's your vision?

695
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,700
And be really specific.
I want to be my fighting weight.

696
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:57,100
I want to be the strongest I've ever
felt I want to be.

697
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm going to turn my whatever it is,
be specific.

698
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,000
And then last step number four,
what are the rituals that will get you

699
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,440
there?
What would you need to do differently

700
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,420
each morning if you're going to be that
kind of energy,

701
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,320
that kind of strength?

702
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,360
How would you have to,
how often would you work out?

703
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,080
What days would you work out?
What time a ritual,

704
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,580
something you do consistently,
usually at a specific time,

705
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,980
so it becomes automatic.
Let me tell you something.

706
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,700
We'll bauer doesn't last,
but rituals can last a lifetime.

707
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,330
I bet you have some rituals in your life
right now you've been doing for years,

708
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,490
even though some of them don't serve
you.

709
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,170
I'm just saying wake yourself up.
Make if you want a new year and a new

710
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,140
life,
you don't need to start in January 1st

711
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,530
start today.
Start with this little video and just

712
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,470
begin to see what happens and see how
easy it is to just do a few little

713
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:42,221
rituals.
Don't do them all.

714
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:44,620
Just do two or three new things and you
don't happens.

715
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,700
You'll get momentum because once you
discipline yourself in one area of your

716
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:49,810
life,
you feel yourself doing it in other

717
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:50,644
areas as well.

718
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,930
I always say something that my original
teacher taught me.

719
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,780
Always remind people there's always two
pains in life.

720
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,050
There's the pain of discipline or is the
pain of regret.

721
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,040
Discipline weighs ounces is my friend
Jim Roan taught me.

722
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,040
Regret weighs tons.
You don't have regret.

723
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,680
So right now,
what do you want to change?

724
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:10,960
What's it really like?
What are the rituals that got you there?

725
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,150
They will take a little homework if
you're not sure half the people around

726
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,650
you.
They'll tell you what your rituals are.

727
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,980
What do I really want in depth,
one of the rituals that will get me

728
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,100
there,
and then get yourself to start a few of

729
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,500
those actions and lock them in place so
that can help you in any way.

730
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,260
We're here as a company to support you.
Come and have an event with us.

731
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:28,720
Come to unleash the power within or
mastering university,

732
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,920
or get a coach.

733
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,620
You can get a free coaching session.
If you call our company and Click on

734
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:34,330
something on this,
we'll probably have something on it or

735
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,040
get a product or don't do anything with
us,

736
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,500
but do something with somebody starting
with you.

737
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,410
If you make the changes in yourself,
you're going to be proud this year and

738
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,220
no amount of money or accolades,
letter people can mirror the feeling of

739
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,370
being proud of knowing you've taken back
control of your life or you've taken a

740
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:51,950
great life to another level.
Because once you do that,

741
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,390
you have something you can give other
people.

742
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,220
Would it be your kids and your friends
and your family?

743
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,550
And ultimately that's why it's about.
So thanks for listening.

744
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,160
I don't know how long I went to here,
but I hope this has been helpful for

745
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,890
you.
I just thought it's a new year and I

746
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,790
want people to be able to truly create a
new life,

747
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,330
and until I see you again,
hopefully soon or get the chance to meet

748
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:11,840
you live strong and live with passion,
then of course,

749
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,460
God bless to you.
Happy New Year.

750
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,000
Okay.
