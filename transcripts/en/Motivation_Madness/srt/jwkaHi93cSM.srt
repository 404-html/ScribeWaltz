1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,630
He is the journey of the mind.
This is what determines the journey of

2
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:17,060
life.
Have you ever had the feeling that your

3
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,640
mind is on a journey of voyage,
of discovery,

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,180
that sometimes it has to make long
passages on dark,

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,320
uncharted seas and at other times and
discovers bright islands of beauty or of

6
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:31,730
truth I haven't zipped.
We'll know from this day forward then it

7
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,660
can always steer for him.
Find in a storm while they gales of

8
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,430
life,
blow themselves out of me.

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,610
Enormous sees of misfortune or pain or
sorrow or doubt subside in the calm.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,680
Well,
if you will come,

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,010
I'd like to take you with me on such a
voyage of the mind.

12
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,340
That one that was charted for me many
years ago by an obscure English editor

13
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:57,341
and poet named James Allen and a little
book called as a man Thinketh,

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,400
that word you will hear essentially
those of James Allen's as a man

15
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:07,480
thinketh,
thought in character.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,370
The aphorism as a man thinketh in his
heart,

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,720
so is he not only embraces the whole of
a man's being,

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,780
but it's so comprehensive as to reach
out to every condition and circumstance

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,500
of his life.
A man is literally what he thinks.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
His character being the complete sum of
all his thoughts as the plant springs

21
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:37,060
from and could not be without the seed.
So the acts of the man's spring from the

22
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,160
hidden seeds of thought and could not
have appeared without them.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,020
The suppliers to those acts called the
spontaneous and unpremeditated as well

24
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,560
as to those which are deliberately
executed.

25
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,730
Act is the blossom of thought and joy
and suffering are its fruits.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,510
That's doesn't matter.
Garner in the sweet and bitter footage

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,920
of his own husbandry thought in the mind
have made us what we are by thought was

28
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,780
rock and built.
If a man is mine have evil thoughts,

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
pain comes on him as comes.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,740
That we only ox behind that if man and
deere is in purity of thought,

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,430
joy follows him as his own shadow.
Sure man grows by law,

32
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,820
not by artifice and cause an effect on
us.

33
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,710
Absolute and I'm deviating and they
hidden realm of thought as in the world

34
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:37,210
of visible and material things.
A noble character is not a thing of

35
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:41,320
favor or chance,
but it's the natural result of continued

36
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,350
effort and thought the effect of long
cherished association with high ideals

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,510
and ignoble and best Joel character,
but the same process as the result of

38
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:56,530
the continued,
the heartbreak of grumbling thoughts man

39
00:02:56,531 --> 00:03:01,531
is made or unmade by
in the armory of thought.

40
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,990
He forges the weapons by which he
destroys himself.

41
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,950
He also patients the tools with which he
builds for himself.

42
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,010
Heavenly mentions of joy and strength
and peace made the right choice and true

43
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:19,831
application of thought man,
a to our divine perfection by the abuse

44
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,210
and wrong application of thought.

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,660
He descends below the level of the beast
between these two extremes are all the

46
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,670
grades of character and men is their
maker and master

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,070
of all the beautiful truth pertaining to
this,

48
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,570
so all of which have been restored and
brought to light.

49
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,760
None as mark broadening our food full of
divine promise and confidence than this.

50
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,450
That man is the master of thought.
The motor of character and the maker and

51
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:55,300
shaper of condition and environment and
destiny

52
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,460
as a being a power,
intelligence and love and the Lord of

53
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:05,410
his own thoughts.
Man holds the key to every situation and

54
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,070
contains where they himself,
that transforming and regenerative

55
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,680
agency by which he may make himself what
he wills.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,280
Then as always the master,
even in his weakest and most abandoned

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,200
state but in weakness and degradation is
not foolish.

58
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:25,201
Master who miss governs his household.
When he begins to reflect upon his

59
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,800
condition and to search diligently for
the law upon which is being as

60
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,010
established,
he then becomes the wise master

61
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,780
directing his images with intelligence
and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful

62
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,781
issues such as the conscious master and
then can only does become by discovering

63
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:48,700
within himself the laws of thought,
which discovery is totally a matter of

64
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,590
application,
self analysis and experience only by

65
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:58,510
much searching and mining are golden
diamonds have tamed and man confined

66
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,550
every truth connected with his being.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,590
If he will dig deep into the mind of his
soul and that he is the maker of his

68
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,870
character,
the molder of his life.

69
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,110
And the builder of his destiny.
He may unerringly Bruv if he will watch

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
control and ultra his thoughts tracing
their effects upon himself Abramovich

71
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,450
and upon his life and circumstances,
linking cause and effect by patient

72
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:29,701
practice and investigation and utilizing
his every experience even to the most

73
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,710
trivial,
everyday occurrence as a means of

74
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,120
obtaining that knowledge of himself,
which is understanding wisdom.

75
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,640
Power in this direction as in no other
is the law.

76
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,670
Absolute that P that secret findeth and
to him that knocks it shall be opened

77
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,950
our only by patients practice and the
ceaseless importuning can a man enter

78
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:58,951
the door of the temple of knowledge
of the mind.

79
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,710
It obeys the orders of the mind,
whether they be deliberate or automatic

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,470
at the bidding of evil,
miserable thoughts.

81
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,420
Their body may sink rapidly in the
disease and decay at the command of glad

82
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,670
and beautiful thoughts.
It make clothe itself with the

83
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:21,671
youthfulness and beauty disease and
health like circumstances are often

84
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,850
rooted in thought.
Six thoughts may express themselves

85
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,860
through a sick body.
In Aboriginal Society.

86
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:31,670
It starts a fair,
the known to kill a man as speedily as a

87
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:35,990
bullet and they are continually killing
thousands of people in our society.

88
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:40,991
Justice surely though less rapidly,
people who live in fear of disease are

89
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,530
apt to become out anxiety quickly.
The modernizers,

90
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:49,940
the whole body and lazy it open to
illness and disease while evil thoughts,

91
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,230
even though they be no more than that,
we'll soon shatter the nervous system.

92
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,090
Strong,
pure and happy thoughts build bigger and

93
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:02,600
grace.
The body is that sensitive plastic

94
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,290
instrument which responds readily did
that thoughts by which of his government

95
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
and having some thoughts.

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,880
We'll produce that on effects,
good or bad.

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Apartment out of a clean mind comes a
clean life and a clean body.

98
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defined
life and a corrupt body thought is the

99
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:26,210
fount of action,
life and manifestation.

100
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,530
Make the founder of the pier and the
stream of life of flow with greater

101
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:33,200
purity,
change of diet.

102
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,480
Maybe it'll help.
Amanda will not change your thoughts

103
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,290
when a man makes his thoughts healthy.
He no longer designers.

104
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,490
I'm healthy.
Food,

105
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,970
clean thoughts make clean,
healthy habits.

106
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,730
The so called saint who doesn't have to
wash his body,

107
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:50,510
he may well not be a saint.
And if you would perfect your body,

108
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,070
God,
your mind,

109
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,090
if you would renew your body,
beautify your mind.

110
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,330
Thoughts of malice in the
disappointment,

111
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:03,020
despondency can rob your body of it's
health and grace.

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,500
A sour face does not come by chance.

113
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,070
It has made my salad thoughts,
wrinkles that mar are drawn by folly,

114
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,930
pride and passion.
I know a woman of 96 who has the bright

115
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,830
innocent face of a girl.
I know a man well under the middle age

116
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,030
whose faces drawn into inharmonious kind
of two areas.

117
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,460
The one is the result of us,
so even a sunny disposition.

118
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,330
The others,
the outcome of bad temper and discontent

119
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,460
as you cannot have a suite and wholesome
abode unless you admit the air and

120
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,450
sunshine freely in the or rooms.
So a strong body and a bright,

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,630
happy,
serene condiments can only result from

122
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,160
my free admittance into the mind of
thought,

123
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:52,161
some joy and goodwill and serenity on
the faces of the age.

124
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,060
There are wrinkles made by sympathy.
There's by strong impure thought and

125
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:01,170
others are carved by arrogance and
resentment who cannot distinguish them,

126
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,420
what those have lived thoughtfully.

127
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,570
Agent's calm,
peaceful and softly mellow like the

128
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,600
setting sun.
I have recently seen a philosopher on

129
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:13,370
his death bed.
He was not a old except in years he

130
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:14,270
died.
The sweeper,

131
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,990
he and peacefully as he's lived,
there is no physician like cheerful

132
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,100
thought for dissipating the ills of
malcontent.

133
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,260
There is a comparator to compare with
goodwill,

134
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:30,210
for dispersing the shadows of grief and
Sarah to have continually in thoughts of

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,950
ill will,
cynicism,

136
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,750
suspicion and mv is to be confined in a
self made me prison hall,

137
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,010
but to think well of all to be cheerful
with all just patiently learned to find

138
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:46,011
the good in all is to live in sight of
the very portals of heaven and they buy

139
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,330
the thoughts of peace start.
Every creature will bring a bounding

140
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,340
piece to that possessor
thought and circumstances,

141
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,030
a man's mind and maybe likened it to a
garden which may be intelligently

142
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:04,740
cultivated or allowed to run wild,
but when it comes invaded or neglected,

143
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
it must end,
will bring forth.

144
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,180
If no useful seeds I put into it,
then an abundance of useless weed seeds

145
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:19,230
will fall there and we'll continue to
produce that kind of justice at.

146
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,520
Gardener cultivates his plot,
keeping it free from weeds and growing

147
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,500
the flowers and fruits which he
requires.

148
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,620
So many young men tend the garden of his
mind.

149
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,970
We had all the wrong and useless
thoughts and cultivating toward

150
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,390
perfection,
the flowers and fruits to ripe,

151
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,840
useful and pure thoughts.
My pursuing this process,

152
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,170
a man sooner or later discovers that he
is the master gardener of his soul,

153
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,490
the director of his life.
He also reveals within himself the laws

154
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:55,080
of thought and understands with ever
increasing accuracy how his mind

155
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,210
operates in the sheep.
We have his character,

156
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,420
circumstances and destiny.
Thought and character are one and as

157
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:07,350
character can only manifest and
discovered itself to environment and

158
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:11,010
circumstance,
the outer conditions of a person's life

159
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,790
will always be found to be related to
his inner state.

160
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,200
This does not mean that a man of
circumstances at any given time or an

161
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:23,370
indication of his entire character,
but that those circumstances are so

162
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,750
intimately connected with some vital
thought within himself that for the time

163
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,840
being they are indispensable to his
development.

164
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,830
Every man is where he is by the law of
his being.

165
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,360
The thoughts which he has built into his
character have brought him there and in

166
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,440
the arrangement of his life there is no
lasting element of champs,

167
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,580
but all is the result of a law which
cannot bear.

168
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,890
This is just as true of those who are
discontented with their surroundings as

169
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:57,891
of those who are contented with them.
As an evolving being man is where he is,

170
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:03,871
that he may learn that he may grow and
as he learns the lesson which any

171
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:08,710
circumstance contains for him,
it passes away and give spice to other

172
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,670
circumstances.

173
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,650
Man is buffeted by circumstances so long
as he believes himself to be a creature

174
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,960
and currently subject to outside
conditions.

175
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,240
But when he realizes that he is a
creative power and that he made command

176
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,110
the hidden soil and seeds of his being,
how to avoid circumstances grow,

177
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,830
he then becomes the right full master of
himself that circumstances grow out of

178
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,050
thought.
Every man knows who has for any length

179
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,950
of time,
practice,

180
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,890
self control of his mind and thoughts
for he will live.

181
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,891
Notice that the alteration of his
circumstances has been an exact ratio

182
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,970
with is altered mental condition.
So true is this,

183
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,970
that when a man earnestly applies
himself to remedy the defects in his

184
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,820
character and make swift and mark the
progress,

185
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,160
he passes rapidly through a succession
of this institutes that so attracts

186
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,860
lack,
which is secretly hybrids,

187
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,860
that which it loves,
and also that which it fears.

188
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,550
It reaches the height of his cherished
aspirations.

189
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,120
It falls to the level of its unchaste
desires and circumstances are the means

190
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:21,301
by which the soul receives its own and
we thought seeds sown are allowed to

191
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:27,241
fall into the mind and to take root
there producers a tone blossoming sooner

192
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,210
or later in the act and bearing its own
food,

193
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:33,250
age of opportunity in circumstance,
good thoughts,

194
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,470
bear good fruit,
bad thoughts,

195
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,150
bad trip.
The outer world of circumstances shaped

196
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,620
by the inner world of thought and both
pleasant and unpleasant external

197
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,190
conditions or factors which make for the
ultimate good of the individual.

198
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,700
As the reaper of his own harvest man
learns both by suffering and bliss

199
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,940
following me in most desires,
aspirations,

200
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,400
thoughts by which he allows himself to
be dominated,

201
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,960
pursuing me will the West sort of vapor,
the imaginings are steadfast.

202
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,610
We walking the highway of strong and
high end ever a man at last arrives at

203
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:13,720
their fruition and fulfillment in the
outer conditions of his life.

204
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,450
The laws of growth and adjustment
everywhere.

205
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,980
Obtain a man does not come to the arms
house,

206
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:24,280
so the jail by the tyranny of fate or
circumstance,

207
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,720
but by the pathway of grovelling
thoughts and base desires,

208
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,360
nor does a high minded men fall.
Suddenly the crime by stress am a mere

209
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,960
external force.
The criminal thoughts have long been

210
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,770
secretly fostered in the heart when the
hour of opportunity you'd be able to,

211
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:46,000
it's gathered power circumstance does
not make the man.

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,680
It reveals
no such conditions can exist as

213
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,760
defending and device and its attendant
sufferings apart from vicious

214
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,761
inclinations or ascending into virtue
and it's happiness without the continued

215
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:06,101
cultivation of virtuous aspirations.
And then they have Laura as the Lord and

216
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,860
Master of thought is the maker of
himself,

217
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,220
the shaper and author of environment.
The soul comes to its own.

218
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,620
Through every step of the jeffery
pilgrimage.

219
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,850
It attracts those combinations of
conditions which reveal itself,

220
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,930
which are the reflections of its own
virtue and vice.

221
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,050
It's strength and weakness.
Men did not attract that which they say

222
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:37,310
they want,
but that could stay are their whims

223
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,220
fancies and ambitions are taught it.
At every step,

224
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,180
but they're in most parts and desires
are fed with the food of their own

225
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,420
choosing the divinity,
the chiefs,

226
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:52,421
our ams is in ourselves.
It is our very self man is manacle only

227
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:56,780
by himself.
Thought and action are the jailers of

228
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:00,650
fate.
They imprison being based that also the

229
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:03,380
angels of freedom.
They liberate being no book,

230
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,220
not what he wishes him praise for it as
a man get,

231
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,360
but what he justly earns.
His wishes and prayers are only

232
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,380
gratified and answered when they comport
with his thoughts and actions in the

233
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,680
light of this truth.
What then is the meaning of fighting

234
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,820
against circumstances?

235
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,220
It means that a man has continually
revolting against an effect without wet

236
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,010
all the time.
He is nourishing and preserving its

237
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,390
cause in his heart.
That caused me to take the form of a

238
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,300
conscious vice or an unconscious
weakness,

239
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,930
but whatever it is,
it's stubbornly returns the efforts of

240
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:45,020
its possessor and thus calls allowed the
remedy.

241
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,620
Men are anxious to improve their
circumstances,

242
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:52,730
but are unwilling to improve themselves.
They therefore remain bound,

243
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,300
but names will,
does not shrink from self sacrifice,

244
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,830
can never fail to accomplish.
The object upon which he was hard is

245
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,630
that this is as true of material as of
spiritual things.

246
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,950
Even the man who was so object is to
acquire wealth and must be prepared to

247
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:13,790
make great personal sacrifices.
We've already can accomplish this object

248
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,260
and how much marcel he would realize a
happy,

249
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,530
joyful life.
It was a man who is wretchedly poor,

250
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,490
is extremely anxious that his
surroundings and home comfort should be

251
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,170
improved it all the time.

252
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,340
He shirks his work and considers these
justified in trying to deceive his

253
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,670
employer on the ground of the
insufficiency of his wages.

254
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,500
Such a man does not understand the
simplest rudiments of those principles,

255
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:43,610
which are the basis of true prosperity
and there's not only totally unfitted

256
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:47,630
derives out of his wretchedness,
but it's actually attracting to himself

257
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,760
a student deeper wretchedness by
dwelling m and acting out in Dulles

258
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,010
deceptive and a memory thought he was a
rich man who was the victim of a painful

259
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:01,780
and persistent ill health as a result of
glutimate.

260
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,010
He's willing to give large sums of money
to get rid of it,

261
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,200
but he will not abandon his gluttony.
He wants to gratify his taste for rich

262
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,630
and harmful volumes and have his health
as well.

263
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,300
Such a man is totally unfit to have help
because he has not yet learned the first

264
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:19,680
principles of a healthy life.

265
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,570
Here's my employer of labor who adopts
crooked measures to avoid paying the

266
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,200
regulation wage and in the hope of
making larger profits.

267
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,030
We do says the wages of his work,
people such a man as altogether unfitted

268
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,720
for prosperity and when he finds himself
bankrupt both as regards reputation and

269
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:41,490
bridges,
he blames circumstances not knowing that

270
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:46,491
he is the sole author of his condition.
I've introduced these three cases nearly

271
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:50,300
as illustrative of the truth.
That man is the causer.

272
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,580
They'll nearly always unconscious way of
his circumstances and that while aiming

273
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,550
at a good and he may continually
frustrated it's accomplishment.

274
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,330
My thoughts and desires,
which cannot possibly harmonize with

275
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:07,170
that end in such cases could be
multiplied in varied almost

276
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,440
indefinitely,
but this is not necessarily as you can

277
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:14,820
if he still is the action of the laws of
thought in your own mind in life.

278
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,870
I'm telling you,
do this near external facts are not

279
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:22,230
likely to persuade you.
Circumstances however,

280
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:25,590
are so complicated.
Thought is so deeply rooted in the

281
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,430
conditions of happiness,
very so with individuals that a man's

282
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,010
entire condition,
although it may be now under himself,

283
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,000
cannot be judged by another from the
external aspect of his life alone.

284
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,060
A man may be honest in certain
directions,

285
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,710
it's separate privations and man,
they be dishonest in certain directions,

286
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,250
yet acquire wealth.
The conclusion usually formed however,

287
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:51,270
that the one man fails because of his
particular honesty and that the other

288
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:55,240
prospers because of his particular
dishonesty is the result of a

289
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:59,340
superficial judgment,
which assumes that the dishonest man is

290
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:04,341
almost totally corrupt and the honest
man almost entirely virtuous in the

291
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,780
light of a deeper knowledge and wider
experience.

292
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,400
Such judgment is found to be around
this.

293
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,990
But dishonest man,
they have some admirable virtues which

294
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,130
the other does not possess.

295
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,880
And the honest man,
obnoxious devices which are absent in

296
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,980
the other.
The honest man rapes the good results.

297
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,340
So designers,
thoughts and acts.

298
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,050
He also brings upon himself the
sufferings,

299
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,400
which is vice's and the dishonest man.
Likewise,

300
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:34,401
gun has his own sufferings and happiness
and it's pleasing the human vanity to

301
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,050
believe that one suffers because of
one's virtue,

302
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,290
but not have them tell.
A man has extubated every vicious,

303
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,300
bitter and resentful thought from his
mind.

304
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:46,020
Can he be in a position to know and
declare that his sufferings are the

305
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,100
result of is good and not of his

306
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,820
bad qualities?
And on the way to yet long before it has

307
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:56,110
reached that supreme perfection,
he will have found working in his mind

308
00:20:56,111 --> 00:21:01,111
in life the great law,
which is absolutely just in which cannot

309
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,450
therefore give good for evil,
evil for good,

310
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,990
possessing such knowledge.
He will then know,

311
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:12,991
looking back upon this past ignorant and
blindness that his life is and always

312
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:17,470
was justly ordered and that all his past
experiences.

313
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,980
Good and bad,
where the equitable outworking of his

314
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:25,981
evolving yet unevolved good thoughts and
actions can never in the long run and

315
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,820
produce bad results,
bad thoughts and actions can never

316
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,720
produce good results.
This has been saying that nothing can

317
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:36,130
come from corn,
but corn,

318
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,170
nothing from metals,
but metals.

319
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,770
Men understand this law and the natural
world and work with it,

320
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,530
but few understand it and the mental and
moral world though it's operation.

321
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,310
The hair is just as simple and I'm
deviating and they therefore do not

322
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:56,110
cooperate with it.
Mental suffering is always the effect of

323
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,530
error in some direction,
and it's an indication that the

324
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,050
individual is out of harmony with
himself,

325
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,800
with the law of his being the sole.
I'm supreme you.

326
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:10,801
So such suffering is to correct and
teach mental suffering ceases or him who

327
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,890
was wise.
There can be no object burning gold

328
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:19,360
after the drug has been removed and the
mind of a perfectly enlightened beings

329
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,190
cannot be agonized.
The circumstances which Amanda

330
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,250
encounters with suffering of the result
of his own bleak outlook.

331
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,600
The circumstances which amendment
counters with blessedness or again the

332
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:35,140
result of his own aptitude,
blessedness,

333
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,300
not material possessions is the measure
of right wretchedness,

334
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,560
not the lack of material possessions is
the major of wrong.

335
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,560
A man may be cursed and rich.

336
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,100
He may be blessed and poor blessedness
and enriches only join together when the

337
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:59,941
richards or wisely used and the poor man
old me descends into wretchedness when

338
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,951
he regards his life as a Britain
unjustly imposed in the gym.

339
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:08,530
Some indulgence are the two extremes of
wretchedness.

340
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,970
They're both equally unnatural.
A man is not rightly conditioned until

341
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,700
he's a happy,
healthy,

342
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,640
and prosperous being.
And happiness.

343
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Health and prosperity are the results of
a harmonious adjustment of the inner

344
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,090
with the outer of the man,
with his surroundings.

345
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,410
A man only begins to be a man when he
sees us,

346
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,400
don't whine and revile and commenced
this to search where they hidden

347
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,320
justice,
which regulates his life.

348
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,340
And as he adapts his mind too,
that regulating factor,

349
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,830
he ceases to accuse others as the cause
of his condition.

350
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,680
And built himself up in strong and
noble.

351
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,010
Thoughts ceases to kick against
circumstances,

352
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,840
but begins to use them as aids to his
more rapid progress and as a means of

353
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:00,020
discovering the hidden powers and
possibilities within himself.

354
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,050
Law Not confusion is that dominating
principle in the universe.

355
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Justice,
not injustice is the sum and substance

356
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:16,361
of life and righteousness,
not corruption is the molding and moving

357
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,820
forest in the spiritual government of
the world.

358
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,460
This being so Manhattan,
but to write himself to find that the

359
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:29,210
university's right and during the
process of putting himself right,

360
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,260
he will find that as he alters his
thoughts towards situations and other

361
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:37,660
people situations and other people will
alter your toward him.

362
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,710
The proof of this truth is in every
person and that therefore admits them.

363
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:47,540
Easy investigation by systematic
introspection and self analysis and a

364
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,140
man radically alter his thoughts and he
will be astonished that the rapid

365
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:54,440
transformation that will affect in the
material conditions of his life.

366
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,490
Imagine that thought can be kept secret,
but it cannot.

367
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,060
It rapidly crystallizes into habit and
habits solidifies in just circumstance.

368
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,810
Thoughts of fear,
doubt and indecision crystallize into

369
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:13,690
week unmanly and irresolute habits,
which solidify in the circumstances of

370
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:16,520
failure.
Indigents and slavish dependence,

371
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,070
lazy,
apathetic,

372
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:21,800
thought's crystallizing the habits of
disorder.

373
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,090
I'm climbing there some dishonesty we
solidify in the circumstances of

374
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,800
confusion,
fallenness and beggary resentful and we

375
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:34,190
condemn monetary thought's,
crystallizing the habits of accusation

376
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:37,580
and violence,
which solidify in the circumstances of

377
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:40,040
hate,
injury and persecution.

378
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,460
On the other hand,
beautiful thoughts of all kinds of

379
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,470
crystallize and the habits and grace and
timeliness which to defined a genial and

380
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:53,930
sunny circumstances.
Selfless thought's crystallizing the

381
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,650
habits of temporary,
some self control which solidify in the

382
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,930
circumstances of risk,
pros and peace,

383
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,120
thoughts of courage,
self reliance and decision crystallized

384
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,410
into manly habits which solidify under
circumstances of strength and freedom

385
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,030
and energetic thought's crystallizing
the habits of industry,

386
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,650
which sort of divide and the
circumstances of achievement kind and

387
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,020
loving thoughts,
crystallizing the habits of

388
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:25,240
considerateness for others which
solidify and the circumstances of a

389
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:26,150
biting comfort.

390
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,590
A particular train of thought persisted
and be it good or bad,

391
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,480
cannot fail to produce it through south.
So character in sexual stances and man,

392
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:40,481
can I directly choose his circumstances,
but he can choose his thoughts and so

393
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,940
indirectly yet surely shape their
circumstances.

394
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,200
Make your health every man to the
gratification of the thoughts which he

395
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:52,230
most encourages and opportunities are
presented,

396
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,390
which were most speedily bring to the
service,

397
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:59,300
both the good and evil thoughts.
Imam choose his thoughts wisely and all

398
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,310
the world will soften toward him and be
ready to help him.

399
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,740
Let him put away bad thoughts and low
opportunities or spring up on every

400
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,560
hand.
The aid is strong results.

401
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,760
Nothing even encourage good thoughts and
no hard fate.

402
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,170
Chub binding them down to wretchedness
and shit.

403
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,750
The world is your kaleidoscope,
the varying combinations of which it

404
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:26,751
every succeeding moment it presents to
you as the exquisitely adjusted pictures

405
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,600
of your ever moving thought
you will be what you will to be let

406
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:35,370
failure find.

407
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,880
It's false content in that poor word
environment,

408
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,010
but spirits scorns it and it's free.
It masters time,

409
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:48,570
it conquers space.
It cows that boastful texted champs and

410
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:52,530
bibs the terror of circumstance.
I'm the crown and fill a servant's

411
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:57,180
place.
The human will that force unseen.

412
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,160
The offspring of a deathless soul can
hew a way to any goal.

413
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,340
The walls of granite intervene be not
impatient in delay,

414
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,630
but wait as one who understands when
spirit rises and commands,

415
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,960
the Gods are ready to obey
thought purpose and achievement

416
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,680
until thought is linked with purpose.
There is no intelligent accomplishment

417
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,140
with the majority.
The park daughters allowed to drift upon

418
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,750
the ocean of life.
Aimlessness is advice and such.

419
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:37,500
Drifting must not continue for him.
I would steer clear of catastrophe and

420
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,860
destruction.
They who have no central purpose in

421
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:44,070
their life,
following easy prey to petty worries,

422
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,650
fears,
troubles himself could headings,

423
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,960
all of which are indications of
weakness,

424
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,880
which lean just to Shirley is deliberate
wrongdoing by a different route to

425
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:57,480
failure,
unhappiness and loss for weakness cannot

426
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,420
persist in a power evolving universe.

427
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,880
A man should conceive of a worthy
purpose in his heart and set up to

428
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,250
accomplish it.
You should make this purpose the

429
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:12,510
centralizing point of his thoughts.
It may take the form of a spiritual

430
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:16,620
ideal or it may be a worldly object
according to his nature at the time,

431
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,700
but whichever it is,
he should have steadfastly focused his

432
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,190
thoughts upon the object which he has
set before him.

433
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,290
He should make this purpose is supreme
duty and should devote himself to its

434
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,230
attainment,
not allowing his thoughts to wander away

435
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:36,231
and the vague and if female offenses,
this is the royal road to self control

436
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:41,130
and true concentration of thought.
Even if he fails again,

437
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,880
again to accomplish his purpose as he
necessarily master drove weaknesses,

438
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,780
overcome the spring third character he
dreams will be the measure of its true

439
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:54,160
success and this will form a new
starting point for future power and

440
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:54,994
tramp.

441
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,080
Those who are not prepared to conceive
and dedicate themselves to a great

442
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,620
purpose should fix that.
Thoughts upon the fault was performance

443
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,950
of their beauty.
No matter how significant bed tasks may

444
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,130
appear,
only in his wake and the thoughts began

445
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:12,670
there and focused and resolution that
energy be developed,

446
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:16,450
which being done there is nothing that
may not be accomplished.

447
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,370
The weakest will knowing its own
weakness and believing this truth,

448
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,060
that strength can only be developed by
effort in practice,

449
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,360
will thus believing at once begin to
exert itself and add the effort,

450
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,320
effort patients to patients from
strength to strength will never cease to

451
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:40,321
develop and will it last grow strong as
the physically weak man can make himself

452
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:46,360
strong by careful impatient exercise.
So the man and we thought it can become

453
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:51,361
strong by training himself in thinking
to put away aimlessness and weakness and

454
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:56,570
to begin this think with purpose is to
enter the ranks of those strong ones who

455
00:30:56,571 --> 00:31:01,571
only recognize failure as one of the
pathway is to attain them who make all

456
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,080
conditions,
serve them and do things strongly

457
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,130
attempt fearlessly and accomplish
masterfully.

458
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,530
Having conceived of his purpose,
a man should prudently mark out a

459
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:18,340
straight pathway to its achievement.
Looking neither to the right nor the

460
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,690
left doubts and fears should be
rigorously excluded.

461
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,160
They are disintegrating elements which
break up the straight line of effort,

462
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,530
rendering it crooked,
ineffectual,

463
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,300
useless thoughts of doubt and fear never
accomplished anything and never cam.

464
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,520
They always lead to failure,
purpose them energy or weakened when

465
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:44,521
doubt and fear creeping up the will to
do springs to my knowledge that we can

466
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:50,400
do doubt and fear of the great enemies
of this knowledge and he would encourage

467
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,410
them forts himself at every step.
He who has conquered doubt and fear has

468
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:00,250
conquered failure is every thought is
fraught with power,

469
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,320
is difficulties wisely.
Bravely met an overcoat is purposes or

470
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:10,150
seasonably planted and the boom and
bring forth fruit which does not fall

471
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:15,151
prematurely to the ground thought allied
fearlessly to purpose becomes creative

472
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,114
force.

473
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,820
He who knows this is ready to become
something higher and stronger than a

474
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:27,850
mere bundle of wavering thoughts and
fluctuating sensations.

475
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,610
He who does this has become the
conscious and intelligent wielder of his

476
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:38,611
mental powers
over the amount of cheese at all he

477
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:44,321
fails to achieve is the direct result of
his own thoughts and adjust the ordered

478
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:48,350
universe where loss of repose means
destruction.

479
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Individual responsibility must be
absolute a man's weakness and strength,

480
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,030
wisdom and follow his own right and not
another man.

481
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,350
They have a product of himself and not
another,

482
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,220
and they can only be ordered by himself,
never buy another is circumstances also

483
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:16,100
on his own and not another man.
His suffering and his happiness,

484
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:20,150
we evolved from within as he thinks so
is he.

485
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,840
As he continues to think so,
he remains

486
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,040
strong.
Man cannot help a weaker unless the

487
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,980
weaker is willing to be helped and even
then that week,

488
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:32,750
man must become strong of himself.

489
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,790
He must by his own efforts develop the
strength which he admires and another

490
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,450
none but himself can alter his
condition.

491
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,450
It has been unusual for Amanda thinking
to say many men are slaves because one

492
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:50,120
is an oppressor.
Let us hate the oppressor.

493
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,330
However,
there is a Mayan increasing few,

494
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:58,331
a tendency to reverse this judgment and
to say one man is an oppressor because

495
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:03,500
many are slaves that has despised the
slaves.

496
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,620
The truth is that a presser and Suede,
our cooperators and ignorance and the

497
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:11,870
Yoc,
I mean to reflect each other in reality

498
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,970
of the funeral was out.
It.

499
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,840
Perfect knowledge precedes the action of
law and the weakness of the oppressed

500
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,630
and the misapplied power of the
oppressor.

501
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,000
A perfect love seeing the suffering
which both states and tail condemns

502
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:31,001
neither a perfect compassion and basis.
Both oppressor and oppressed eus

503
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,870
conquered weakness and has put away
selfish thoughts,

504
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,020
belongs neither to oppress her nor
oppressed.

505
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,670
He has free.
A man can only rise,

506
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,470
conquer,
and achieve.

507
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:51,010
By lifting up his thoughts,
he can only remain weak and object and

508
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,340
miserable by refusing to lift up his
thoughts

509
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,690
before Amanda can achieve anything,
even in the world if things he must lift

510
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:04,220
his thoughts above the animal level,
he may not in order to succeed,

511
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,160
give up all an amount of ego.
Selfish does by any means,

512
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,490
but a portion of it at least must be
sacrificed.

513
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,290
A man who was Chris' daughter,
self indulgence can either think clearly

514
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,880
and our plan methodically,
he cannot find them.

515
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,790
Developers,
Lakeland grease sources,

516
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,710
and I must fail in any undertaking I've
having commenced from men from eight to

517
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:27,740
control his thoughts.
He's not in a position to control

518
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,170
affairs and to adopt serious
responsibilities.

519
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,800
He's not fed to act independently in
standalone.

520
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,160
He's limited by the thoughts where she
chooses.

521
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,390
There can be no progress,
no achievement without sacrifice and a

522
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,920
man's worldly success will be in the
measure that he sacrifices his confused

523
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,020
animal thoughts and fixes his mind on
the development of this plans and the

524
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:56,550
strengthening of his resolution and self
reliance and the higher he lifts his

525
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:59,370
thoughts,
the more manly and upright he becomes.

526
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,660
The greater will be his success.
The more blessed than enduring will be

527
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:08,310
as achievement.
The universe does not favor the greedy,

528
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,850
the dishonest the fishes.
Although on the mirror surface it may

529
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,090
sometimes appear to do so.
It's continuing.

530
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,700
A Beckman is what the honesty,
the magnanimous,

531
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,400
the virtuous,
all the great teachers,

532
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,180
the ages have declared this and varying
forms and approve and know it.

533
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,700
A man has been to persist and lifting up
his thoughts.

534
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,770
Intellectual achievements are the
results of thought consecrated to the

535
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,970
search for knowledge or for the
beautiful and true in life and nature.

536
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,960
Such achievements maybe sometimes
connected with vanity and ambition,

537
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,270
but they're not the outcome of those
characteristics.

538
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,790
They have a natural outgrowth of long
and arduous effort and arduous searching

539
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,030
thought.
Spiritual achievement is the

540
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:55,050
consummation of aspiration.
He who lives constantly and the

541
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:58,650
conception of wise and noble thoughts or
dwellings dwells upon all that is

542
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,200
elevating and himself as well.
As surely as this time reaches it's Dean

543
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,060
and the moon,
it's will become knowledgeable and noble

544
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,510
and rise into a position of wisdom and
blessedness,

545
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,100
achievement of whatever kind is the
crown of effort,

546
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,760
the diadem of thought by self control,
resolution at auditions and well

547
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:27,081
directed thought a man sm by an amount
of the endurance,

548
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,560
corruption and confusion of God.
Amen.

549
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,430
Amen.
May Rise to highest success in the

550
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,610
world.
Andrew luck the altitudes in the

551
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:41,880
spiritual realm and again descend into
weakness and wretchedness by allowing

552
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,380
arrogant,
selfish,

553
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,180
and corrupt thoughts to take possession
of it.

554
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,340
The victory is attained by thought can
only be maintained by watchfulness many

555
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:54,330
giveaway when success is assured and
rapidly fall back into failure.

556
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,030
Achievement,
whether an a business,

557
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:02,210
intellectual or spiritual world is the
result of definitely directed thought is

558
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,850
governed by the same law and dependent
upon the same method.

559
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,350
The only difference lies in the object
of a payment.

560
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,550
He who had accomplished little needs
sacrifice level II who would achieve

561
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:19,551
much with sacrifice much.
He who would attain highly resacrifice

562
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,880
greatly
vision and ideals,

563
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,410
the visionaries of the saviors of the
world as the visible world is sustained

564
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:36,010
by the end of visible.
So men who all their trials and fins and

565
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:40,990
sordid vocations are nourished by the
beautiful vision was of their sanitary

566
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,380
dreamers.
Humanity cannot forget it's dreamers.

567
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,890
It can not let their ideas fade and die.
It lives in the moment it feels in them.

568
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,700
The reality is which it shower one day.
See and no composer,

569
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,350
sculptor,
painter,

570
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,910
poet,
prophet,

571
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,570
sage,
these are the architects of paradise.

572
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,470
The world is beautiful because they have
lived without them.

573
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,660
The laboring humanity would perish.
Eagle cherishes a beautiful vision,

574
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,580
a lofty idea of in his heart will one
day realize it.

575
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,020
Columbus cherish the vision of another
world and he discovered it.

576
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,410
Copernicus foster that vision of a
multiplicity of worlds and a wider

577
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,850
universe and he revealed it.
Buddha,

578
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,020
we held a vision of a spiritual world,
of stainless beauty in perfect peace.

579
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,280
And he entered into it.
Cherish your vision.

580
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,660
Cherish your ideals.
Cherish the music that stirs in your

581
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,220
heart,
the beauty that forms in your mind,

582
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,560
the loveliness that drapes your purest
thoughts for out of the [inaudible].

583
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,710
All delightful conditions,
all heavenly environment out,

584
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,900
please if you but remain true to them,
your world.

585
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,310
What are the last to be built to?
Desire is to obtain,

586
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,910
to aspire is to achieve,
shall ma'am spaces desire as received,

587
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:11,350
the fullest measure of gratification and
his highest aspiration starve for lack

588
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:16,351
of festivals such as not the law.
Such a condition of things can never

589
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:19,990
obtain.
Ask and receive

590
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,730
dream lofty dreams.
And as you dream,

591
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,270
so shall you become your vision is the
promise of what you shall one day be.

592
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,350
Your ideal is the prophecy of what you
shall.

593
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:39,820
At last unveil.
The greatest achievement was at first

594
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:43,770
and for a time a dream.
The Oak Sleeps in the Acorn,

595
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,550
the bird weights in the egg,
and in the highest vision of the soul,

596
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:53,551
a waking angel stairs.
Dreams are the seedlings of realities.

597
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,350
Your circumstances maybe uncongenial but
they shall not long remain.

598
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:02,980
So have you went perceive an ideal and
strive to reach it.

599
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,540
You cannot travel with them and stand
still without.

600
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:13,690
It was a youth hard pressed by poverty
and labor confined long hours in an

601
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,350
unhealthy workshop unschooled and
lacking all the arts,

602
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,700
but he brings a better things.
He thinks of intelligence,

603
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,920
of refinements,
of grace and beauty.

604
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:28,060
He conceives of mentally builds up an
ideal life.

605
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,490
The vision of a wider liberty and a
larger scope takes possession of it.

606
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,260
Unrest,
urges him to action and he utilizes all

607
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,210
his time and means small,
low.

608
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:43,211
They are to the development of his
latent powers and resources very soon so

609
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:47,150
altered.
It has his mind become that the workshop

610
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,990
can no longer hold him.
It has become so out of harmony with his

611
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,991
mentality that it falls out of his life
as a garment is cast aside and with the

612
00:41:56,451 --> 00:42:01,100
growth of opportunities which fit the
scope of his expanding in better the a

613
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,480
passes out of it forever.

614
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,140
Years later we see this youth as a full
grown man.

615
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,760
We find them a master of certain forces
which he wheels with worldwide influence

616
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,710
and almost unequal power in his hands.
He holds the cards of gigantic

617
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:19,940
responsibilities.
He speaks and low lives are changed.

618
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,530
Men and women hang up on his words and
we mold their characters and the

619
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:27,930
sunlight.
It becomes the fixed and Illumina cetera

620
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:30,620
around which innumerable destiny's
revolves.

621
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,440
He has realized that vision of his
youth,

622
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,040
he has become one with his idea and you
too will realize the vision,

623
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:44,740
not the idols of your heart be its base
or beautiful or a mixture of both for

624
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,910
your will always gravitate toward that
what you secretly,

625
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,940
most love NPR hands will be placed the
exact results of your own thoughts.

626
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,480
You will receive that which you earn no
more,

627
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,050
no less.
Whatever your present environment may

628
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:04,580
be,
you will fall,

629
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,360
remain or rise with your thoughts,
your vision,

630
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,800
your idea.

631
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,120
You will become as small as your
controlling desire,

632
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,810
as great as your dominant aspiration in
the beautiful words of stamp and Davis.

633
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,980
You may be keeping accounts and
presently she'll walk out of the door.

634
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:29,120
That for so long has seemed to you the
barrier of your ideas and you'll find

635
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,630
yourself before an audience that Penn's
still behind your ear,

636
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:37,300
the ink stains on your fingers and then
and there shall pour out the torrent of

637
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,900
your inspiration.
You may be blabbing sheep and you should

638
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:44,060
wander to the city.
Do you call like an open mouth shall

639
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:48,230
wander under the guidance of the spirit
into the studio of a master.

640
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,330
And after a time he,
she'll say,

641
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,400
I have nothing more to teach you.
And now you have become the master who

642
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:58,940
did so recently dream of great things
while driving sheep,

643
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,050
the thoughtless,
the ignorant and the indolent,

644
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,750
seeing only the apparent effects of
things and not the things themselves.

645
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,090
Talk of luck or fortune and chance
seeing a man grow rich.

646
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:17,120
They say how lucky is that was
everything another become intellectual

647
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,010
intellectually exclaim how highly
favored he is and noting that character

648
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:26,390
and wide influence of another,
they remarked how chance Abe's him at

649
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:30,950
every turn.
They do not see that trials and failures

650
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,830
and struggles,
which these men have voluntary and

651
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:36,360
counted in order to gain their
experience.

652
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,790
They have no knowledge of this tech
advice.

653
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,250
If they have made of the undaunted
efforts,

654
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:45,300
they put forward of the faith.
They have exercised that they might

655
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:49,710
overcome the apparently insurmountable
and realize the vision of their heart.

656
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,860
They do not know the darkness and the
heartaches.

657
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,950
They only see the light and joy and call
it luck.

658
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,700
They do not have to see the long and
arduous journey but only behold the

659
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,070
present gold and call it good fortune.

660
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,920
They do not understand the process but
only perceived the result and call it a

661
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,280
chance.
In all of human affairs,

662
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:16,281
there are efforts and there are results
and the strength of the effort is the

663
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:21,120
measure of the result.
Chance is not gifts,

664
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,890
powers,
material,

665
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,430
intellectual and spiritual possessions,
other fruits of effort.

666
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,780
They are thoughts completed objects,
accomplished visions.

667
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:35,250
Realize the vision that you glorify in
your mind,

668
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,700
the ideal that you and throne in your
heart this you will build your life.

669
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:45,891
By this you will become
the remedy.

670
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,110
Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful
jewels of wisdom.

671
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,220
It is the result of long and patient
effort in self control.

672
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,380
Its presence is an indication of ripened
experience and of a more than ordinary

673
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:03,750
knowledge of the laws and operations of
thought.

674
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,720
A man becomes calm in the measure that
he understands himself as a thought

675
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:14,750
evolved to be for such knowledge
necessitates the understanding of others

676
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,700
as the result of thought and as he
develops a right understanding and is

677
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,210
more and more clearly the internal
relations of things by the action of

678
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:29,211
cause and effects a ceases to fuss and
fuel them and worry and grieve and

679
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:33,150
remains poised,
steadfast,

680
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,450
serene,
calm man.

681
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,960
Having learned how to govern.
He himself knows how to adapt himself to

682
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:44,961
others and they intern reverence his
spiritual strength and feel that they

683
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:50,130
can learn with him and rely upon him.
The more tranquil a man becomes,

684
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:53,940
the greater is his success.
His influence is power for good.

685
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,170
Even the most ordinary trader will find
his business.

686
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:03,171
Prosperity increases as he develops a
greater self control and equanimity or

687
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:08,400
people will always prefer to deal with a
man who's demeanor is strongly equable.

688
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,020
The strong common man has always loved
and revered.

689
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,270
It was like a shade giving tree and at
first thirsty land or a sheltering rock

690
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,930
in the storm who does not love a
tranquil heart,

691
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,600
a sweet tempered,
balanced life.

692
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,560
It does not matter whether it rains or
shines or what changes come to those

693
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:33,190
possessing these blessings go.
They're always cheerful,

694
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,350
poised,
calm.

695
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:41,050
That exquisite poison oak character
which we call serenity is the last

696
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,460
lesson of culture.

697
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,570
It is the flowering of life,
the footage of the soul.

698
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,500
It is precious wisdom more to be desired
than gold,

699
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:55,030
even fine gold.
How insignificant mere money looks in

700
00:47:55,031 --> 00:48:00,031
comparison with a serenely joyous life,
a life that dwells in the ocean of truth

701
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,240
beyond the wave,
out of the reach of tempest in the

702
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,130
blesser town.
How many people we know who sour their

703
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:12,280
lives were ruined.
All that is sweet and beautiful by

704
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:17,281
explosive temporaries who destroy their
poise of character and make ill will.

705
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,060
It is a question whether the great
majority of people do not ruin their

706
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:25,630
lives and mother happiness by lack of
self control.

707
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,630
How few people we meet in my life who
are well balanced,

708
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,420
who have the exquisite poise,
which is characteristic of the finished

709
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,470
press.
Yes.

710
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,000
Humanity.
Sturges with uncontrolled emotion is to

711
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:44,160
Mulch us with ungoverned.
Grief is blown about by anxiety and

712
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:49,161
about only the wise man.
Only he whose thoughts are controlled

713
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,660
makes the winds and the storms are bay
tempest tossed souls,

714
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,540
whatever you may be under.
What's the weather conditions he may

715
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:02,500
live no.
This in the ocean of life,

716
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,150
the isles of blessedness,
a smiling and the sunny shore of your

717
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,740
ideal weight.
You're coming.

718
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,560
Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of
thought in the bark of your soul

719
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:17,950
requires the commanding master.
He does asleep.

720
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,940
Wake him.
Self control is strength.

721
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,710
Thought is mastery.
Calmness is power.

722
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,960
Stay on PR.
Heart peace be still.
