1
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,130
When I was a kid,
I can go through them a math book in a

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,770
week,
so I'm going to see about chop.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,580
They got down there.
What job?

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,543
Stockbroker

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,870
stop.
Fuck yeah,

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,390
not an astronaut.
I listened to what Jim Valvano said.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
21 years.
The most poignant seven words ever

8
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:48,960
uttered in any speech anywhere.
Don't give up.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,020
Don't ever give up.
Those great people didn't.

10
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,670
So I now have a responsibility to also
not ever give up.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,330
I'm not special.
I just listened to what the man said.

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,080
But I tell you,
there is some times in life where you

13
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,020
fall down.
I feel like you don't have the swing to

14
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,854
get that gun.

15
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,510
I will try 100 times to get up any five
fail 100 times.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,520
If I fail and I give up,
do you think that I'm ever going to get

17
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,740
up?
No.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,450
If I fail,
I try again and again and again for as

19
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,150
long as I try it this way,
say change to be getting up

20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,370
when the secret is inactive it up.
Everybody who's done something great,

21
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,950
they weren't,
that wasn't resiliency.

22
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:50,140
They have the ability to bounce back all
the grades.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,680
They didn't wait,
wait,

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,100
stay on course guarantee.
You cannot pass it.

25
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,200
If you quit,
I guarantee he's going to fail,

26
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,300
but you don't know what's going to
happen if you keep going.

27
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,300
I'm prejudice.
I feel pain.

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,050
I heard I opened my eyes.
I create victory,

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,470
but do not give up.
I feel no fear.

30
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,110
I fear no man.
I create a conqueror.

31
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,130
I hold the power.
Make a choice.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,690
Just decide what is going to be,
who you're going to be,

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,040
how you're going to do it.
Just decide and then from that point,

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,440
the universe is going to get out your
way.

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,330
We can have another bad year.
You've got to get to the point where

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,660
enough is enough.
You much easier to come up with excuses

37
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,340
why you can't do it.
If you do what is easy,

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
your life will be hard.
If you do want to say is complain about

39
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,000
your situation,
your circumstances,

40
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,540
surrender and give up on your dreams,
become depressed,

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,450
bitter and angry.
Anybody can do that.

42
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,760
If you do what is easy,
your life will be,

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,950
oh,
what have you do?

44
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:22,180
What is hard?
Coming back again and again and again.

45
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,410
Get up dressed every day.
Take Life.

46
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,250
Oh,
taking life by the collar.

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,520
You say,
yes,

48
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,140
I will do it.
I can do this.

49
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,340
And you've said yourself,
I'm willing to face the know.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm willing to,
people laugh at me.

51
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,280
I'm willing to cut this out.
I'm willing to make this happen.

52
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,710
It's possible.
It's necessary.

53
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,450
It's hard,
it's worth it.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,560
Or I'm going to do whatever it takes.
I can do it.

55
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,320
If anybody's ever done at any point in
time and history,

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,550
then what's possible for one,
it's possible for me and I'm going to do

57
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:13,120
it.
And if you do that over and over and

58
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,950
over again,
yeah,

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,630
your life will be easy.
Okay?

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,810
Some is going to be your first day if
you'd like to work here as a broker.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,050
But you like that Chris?

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,453
Yes,
sir.

63
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,750
Yeah.
