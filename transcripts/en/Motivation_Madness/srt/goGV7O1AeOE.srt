1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,730
Beyonce said,
well,

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:04,730
she was doing her thing.
Three days had gone by.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,790
She forgot she didn't eat.
I never forget when 50 cent was doing

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,120
this movie out,
did a little research on 50th 50 said

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,050
that when he wasn't doing the movie,
he was doing the soundtrack and they

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,310
said,
when do you sleep?

7
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,990
50 sleep.
He says,

8
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,990
sleep.
Sleep is for those people who are broke.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,900
I was asleep
so I got an opportunity to make the

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,901
dream become a reality.
The most important thing is this.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,850
To be able at any moment,
to sacrifice what you are for,

12
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,110
what you will be calm,

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,600
what would you,
you can make sacrifices when Monday

14
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,850
night football is not on.
You can make a sacrifice,

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,220
but when the game come on,
for some reason,

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,040
you just attached to it for something to
you.

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,440
When your favorite show come on you,
you can be,

18
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,870
you can make sacrifices on Sunday,
but ain't nothing going on.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,040
What were your favorite show comes on
Monday.

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,600
Some of you,
you focus into the fall winning and then

21
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:14,710
you like,
I got an answer.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,690
If I don't answer the phone,
I'm going to die.

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,240
I'm saying to you today that there's
some of you

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,340
give up your cell phone.
You will be successful.

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,940
What's your cell phone is more and nude
in your success.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,990
You know why people do what they do?
The people who go after that stuff.

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,510
What makes it worth it?
It's got to be your cash.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,120
You got to love it,
ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,870
You got to love it.
It's gotta be what you are supposed to

30
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,590
do.
You want to say to,

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,830
even though they won't invite you to
Carnegie Hall,

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,510
you going to say trading bought it.
I listened to your coo.

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,950
Sang it to yourself.
I you start talking to my plants when

34
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,270
nobody else would listen to me.
You got to write even if no one

35
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,830
published your book,
right,

36
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:33,831
because that was given to you to do.
You'll do what it is you're supposed to.

37
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,200
You're supposed to bill something.
You're supposed to create something.

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,830
I don't know how to do it.
Whatever's required.

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Just go out there.
It's possible you can get what you are.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
It's necessary.
If you wanted,

41
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,470
you got to go into action.
You've gotta be willing to experiment.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,900
You've got to be willing to fail and to
succeed.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,080
You got to be willing to form and
develop new relationships.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,490
It's you,
it's on you.

45
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,800
You got to make that happen.
Nobody's going to bring it to you on a

46
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,750
silver platter.
Here's your dream manifested.

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,950
No,
it's hard.

48
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
Yes.
It's hard.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,530
It's difficult.
Yes.

50
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,990
Right,
and it's worth it.

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,480
[inaudible].
