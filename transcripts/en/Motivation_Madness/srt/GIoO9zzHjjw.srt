1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,540
I,
this is intimate.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,150
I was told,
I was told that the biggest problem

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,980
tyler,
you're going to have this afternoon is

4
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:20,470
getting Tony Robin Robins to come out of
his shell.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,290
Okay.
So,

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,670
so,
so don't be shy here today.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,790
It's all going to be good.
We were talking backstage and,

8
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,600
and,
and you teed up a question that,

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,780
that I think is,
is part of every business owner's

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
journey and that is the art and science
of overcoming the obstacles that you

11
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,630
face.
They are inevitable.

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,790
Yes,
they are existential.

13
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:50,770
Sometimes they are fear inducing most of
the time.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,490
What do you do when you hit one of the
obstacles?

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,950
I think it's,
it's really important.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,450
First of all,
it's great to be with you all here.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,970
I know you've had a full day and I hope
to that's some real value to you in this

18
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:02,330
brief time.
Um,

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,460
I think it's really critical that you
understand that everybody wants to grow

20
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,590
their business and we all go through
different phases,

21
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:08,800
right?

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,450
Just like human beings go through
phases.

23
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,790
You know,
you give birth to your business and

24
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:17,290
you're an infant and an infant as a run
for survival and cashflow problems or

25
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,570
natural process in most cases in your
running.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,020
Hopefully you get to a teenager or were
now cashflow is not a problem.

27
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,970
You're growing like crazy and then you
have a new problem.

28
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,210
You don't have systems in place and
maybe you get the young adult where you

29
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:31,180
have to decide what you're not going to
do eventually hopefully get to prime

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,450
where you're growing your business
revenues and you're growing your profits

31
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:35,850
and you've got a professional
organization.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,430
You're not doing it because as long as
you're doing it really you don't have a

33
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,770
business what you have as you're self
employed and there's nothing wrong with

34
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,620
being self employed,
but there whenever you meet someone

35
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,650
who's in businesses stress,
they're always a business operator and

36
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,180
my focus has become a business owner.

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,960
How do you do that?
You realize that the choke hold on,

38
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,530
the growth of your business is always
the leader and it's your skills and it's

39
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,310
your psychology and I've found it's 80%
psychology and 20% skills.

40
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,590
You've got to have the marketing skills,
you gotta be able to lead,

41
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,450
you've got to be able to recruit,
you got to do all those things.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,690
But really most importantly,
going to get it through what I call the

43
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,020
threshold of control.
And this to me is the secret to really

44
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,360
succeeding in business.
And it's pretty simplistic.

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,210
Uh,
how many of you a snowboard or ski?

46
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,100
Anybody out there?
Some numbers?

47
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,870
Can you give me a sense?
So if you're,

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,970
most people are terminally intermediate
when they get in that sport,

49
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,470
right?
You know,

50
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:23,860
they,
they,

51
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,240
they really never get back.
Good.

52
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:27,400
They're not really a belonger.
They're kind of you in the middle and

53
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,180
they never get much better.

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,630
And I think the reason is they never
pushed themselves beyond what they can

55
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:32,740
handle,
right?

56
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,431
Uh,
you're,

57
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,030
you're used to Greens or blues and you
find yourself on a double black.

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,060
And what happens?
Everything inside you freaks out because

59
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,010
you're a pass,
what I call the threshold of control,

60
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:44,110
your comfort zone.
And you look down and you go,

61
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,200
I could die doing this.
So now you have two choices.

62
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,720
Either.
Most people slam themself on the ground

63
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:53,740
and hang on for dear life and try not to
skid off the cliff and at best what you

64
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,160
do with survive or a few people let go
of their fear,

65
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:01,150
no matter how scary it is and goes I to
go down this thing and there's no other

66
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,520
choice.
And they focus on where they want to go

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,730
instead of what they're afraid of and
they find a way to carve.

68
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,820
And once you carve a few of them that
Doba black is your bitch,

69
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,020
right?
You don't have to worry about that

70
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:14,320
anymore.
And so that's what happens in business.

71
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,270
So for me,
I can remember going and starting my

72
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,070
first business in Vancouver,
British Columbia,

73
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:21,040
Canada.
I got on the radio show and this person

74
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,260
was a shock jock radio show and I didn't
know it.

75
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,670
And they started attacking me and
saying,

76
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,250
I'm a wire and a charlatan.
You can't do these things.

77
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
And this therapist called me up and
said,

78
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,380
you know what?
I've dealt with people forever.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,690
You can't wipe out a phobia in less than
an hour.

80
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,090
It can take seven years.
I've a patient right now,

81
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,070
I've worked with for seven years and
been able will solve this.

82
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,904
And I said,
great,

83
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,840
bring that patient tonight.
I'm doing a free guest event at the

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,600
Holiday Inn and all take care of it.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,230
It should take me 10 to 15 minutes
and do it.

86
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,540
I do it.
And I was able to do it.

87
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,250
A wrap the snake around this woman,
she had a snake phobia phobia is an

88
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:58,450
uncontrollable response.
So because of that I had people coming

89
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:02,350
to these guests events like crazy and I
thought I hit the home run right.

90
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,710
And I did this big guest event.
There was like a thousand people there

91
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,000
for me would be like,
I don't know,

92
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,300
100,000 people under that right now.
And um,

93
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,310
after I was done,
a bunch of people signed up for my

94
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,580
seminar because I did a free value add
event and then I would invite them to

95
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,210
come spend three days with me.
And this man walks up to me and he's

96
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,140
from immigration.
He goes,

97
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,220
a great seminar.
He goes,

98
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,990
uh,
I'd like to see your work permit.

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,580
I said,
what's a work permit?

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
You know when you're in beginner,
you can business.

101
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,090
You don't know these things,
right?

102
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:28,511
He goes,
well,

103
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,130
the work in this country,
you need to work from it.

104
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,080
And he said,
I'll tell you when I got to see you

105
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,880
tomorrow at five 30 I was wanting to
spend with her.

106
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,320
Starts at seven he goes,
you'll,

107
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,350
you'll be fine.
Just you gotta be there at five 30 he

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,021
said,
I'm not asking.

109
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:42,790
It's a requirement.
So I show up at five 30 I wait for half

110
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,750
an hour.
Now I'm starting to stress and finding a

111
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,590
sit down with a guy and he says,
you're taking away Canadian jobs.

112
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,600
They said,
how many Canadian fire walkers are

113
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,021
there?
Come on.

114
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,690
That's what I was doing.
And he said,

115
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,310
no,
you teach nlp skills,

116
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,010
neurolinguistic programming.
And these people have classes of 20

117
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,860
people and you've got a class of 500 and
so they say,

118
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,550
you're taking jobs.

119
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,280
So your event is over.
What do you mean your events?

120
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
He goes,
if you walk on that stage tonight,

121
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,610
we will handcuff you and deport you.
This is what I call a threshold with

122
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,380
control.
He says,

123
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,370
you're going to have to get the money
back.

124
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,390
I said,
I can't get the money back.

125
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,770
I spent all the money and put on the
seminar.

126
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,990
It wasn't a good businessman.
I just wanted to help everybody,

127
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,510
right?
So I spent all the money and he goes,

128
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,310
you have no money while you're going to
have to deal with that.

129
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,590
So I walked out of the building,
I have 40 minutes.

130
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,600
People are going to arrive.
I can't go on stage.

131
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,570
What do you do?
I told my three staff members,

132
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,250
two of which were volunteers,
what happened?

133
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,084
They're like,
Ooh.

134
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,890
And I said,
here's what we're doing.

135
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm doing this seminar.
And he said,

136
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,730
you're going to go to jail so I'm not
going to jail.

137
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:41,731
So how close is the board?
True story?

138
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,031
And they said,
well,

139
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,130
this a place called Bellingham,
Washington.

140
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,530
It's about an hour and 40 minutes.
I said,

141
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,000
rent money,
six buses,

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,120
and I'll meet the people out front
before they go on the hotels is not a

143
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,450
problem.
I made everybody up front.

144
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,990
He said,
this is a traveling seminar.

145
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,600
It's a surprise,
right?

146
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,170
We're going to

147
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,690
go into America.
He was a three day seminar.

148
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:05,200
We had to go and come back each day and
night for three days in a row.

149
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,180
I got all the four people to agree to do
it.

150
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,450
And,
and then I got to go here in Washington

151
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,110
at the Holiday Inn there,
and it was,

152
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,230
there was like a bar Mitzvah or a
wedding or some stuff mixed door and it

153
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:17,470
was so loud you couldn't hear anybody.
And so I said,

154
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,750
just lie on the floor.
Close your eyes is going to hit the ties

155
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,040
you into this shit.
Right?

156
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,460
But so what happened?
Where'd you learn how to get through

157
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:25,150
that?
Right?

158
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,780
And we learned how to be resourceful
when you realize that your problem is

159
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:33,400
not a lack of resources,
if not a lack of money or technology or

160
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,500
contacts.
If not,

161
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,670
it's your psychology.
Because the ultimate resource is

162
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,950
resourcefulness and human emotion.

163
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,590
That's what starts wars.
That's what makes a business begin.

164
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:47,140
That's how you have children.
That's how we end wars.

165
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,600
It's all emotion.
And so what I really learned to do was

166
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,720
how to manage my emotions.
So you know,

167
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,470
once you saw that one,
the next one shows up.

168
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,920
I had somebody,
I started franchise and cup Franchisees

169
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:59,020
were really upset.
We're wanting people representing on my

170
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:02,140
side said they didn't make things clear
to them and you know,

171
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:05,110
it's all bullshit but cost me $5 million
in four years.

172
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,120
I thought the first one was like a
$50,000 challenge and I've got a $5

173
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,600
million challenge and it took all the
money I'd saved in my entire career to

174
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,340
pay that off.
And I was starting over again.

175
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,000
And then I grew from that.
And then I finally got,

176
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,130
you know,
to add a partner in business.

177
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:24,340
And long story short,
they had a business that was losing $1

178
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,970
million a day and he turned it around
and make it 1.8 billion and Ebitda the

179
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:28,870
offer be his partner.

180
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,240
And I signed a document saying we're all
joint and several,

181
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,790
there's 40 million in debt.
I figured I had 10 million of the debt

182
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,240
to have 1,000,008 1.8 billion in
infrastructure.

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,590
And it turned out my partners,
uh,

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,210
two of them were broke.
They weren't billionaires,

185
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,580
they had lost their money and the other
one was the son of a billionaire in his

186
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,860
dad had given them nothing at $5 million
to his band.

187
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,870
I was on the hook shortly after $420
million when they didn't have $120

188
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,400
million.
I forget how to deal with that.

189
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,040
By doing that,
I eventually took my companies to this

190
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,910
year will surpass $6 billion and 33
companies cause I made it through the

191
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,430
threshold of control.
So I want you to know when you see these

192
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:07,750
big numbers by any entrepreneur,
they all started with blocking and

193
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:11,020
tackling and they all started with how
do I get both the skill and the more

194
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:13,240
importantly the psychology,
you can get the skill.

195
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,970
If you can get that part of you that
just doesn't die,

196
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,240
the part of me that finds the way to add
more value than anybody else that you

197
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:22,420
can keep growing.
Where does the perseverance come from

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
for you?
Where,

199
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,290
cause the indomitable spirit come from
here.

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,310
The title of your book unshakeable.
Where does the,

201
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,510
does the drive come from?
You did not grow up in easy

202
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:37,550
circumstances.
No,

203
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,220
at all.
No College at all.

204
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,530
No.
All self educated,

205
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,840
self educated,
a household that was not easy.

206
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,160
True.
Is that part of the reason that you are

207
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,220
as perseverance as you are?
As optimistic as

208
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
you are,
but maybe it was a way to comp it.

209
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,830
Toot too.
I think it developed moxy.

210
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,210
My,
my mother was a really good woman.

211
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,160
I didn't talk about it when she was
alive and I frankly,

212
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,110
even if she passed,
I didn't talk about it until one day I

213
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,890
was sitting in front of a group of 30
kids that are all are abused by their

214
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,170
parents and,
and I told them that,

215
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,160
you know,
your biography is not your destiny and

216
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,000
you're not defined by what happened.
But I could see in their eyes,

217
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,470
big Paul White,
rich guy,

218
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,060
you know,
he doesn't understand.

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
And so I told him the whole story.
My mom beating me against the wall,

220
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,210
to my head bled point with itself down
my throat too.

221
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:32,160
I threw up.
So I think in order to protect my

222
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:35,220
younger brother and sister,
I had to become a practical psychologist

223
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,670
that drove me and I developed moxy to be
able to deal with stuff.

224
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,030
So that was the gift that my mom had
been the mother I'd wanted to be.

225
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,970
I wouldn't be the man I'm proud to be,
I think so that was the gift in it.

226
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,210
But I think the,
the drive part is falling in love with

227
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,280
your customers.
I love people.

228
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,580
I've always loved people and I hate
suffering because I've suffered and I

229
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,440
loved the white people up and not just
light him up,

230
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,150
pump them up.
I love to have another skill.

231
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:58,980
Having a tool,
have a system,

232
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,880
you know,
and I do my bootcamps each year for our

233
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,470
business mastery programs.
I guarantee everybody there,

234
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,750
and the day one,
you have $1 million of value in your

235
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,620
opinion.
Or we'll give you,

236
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,450
keep all of this stuff you've got and
we'll give you your money back.

237
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,440
No one ever leaves because I know how to
add that value in the business for those

238
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:13,770
people.

239
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,770
So I think the drive is the biggest
mistake.

240
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,860
I think businesses make as many
businesses are started by people that

241
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,800
you built a product you love,
and that may still be true for you.

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,210
Like you built this great jewelry or you
built this great software or you or

243
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,530
whatever skill set you have.
But the problem is the world changes so

244
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,400
fast now.
I mean,

245
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm old enough who remembers the Sony
Walkman?

246
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,120
Anybody ancient and that that product
less than 20 years now product like

247
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,410
basketball,
even last a year,

248
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,120
right?
The competition is too high.

249
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,570
So today if you and I are going to
really succeed,

250
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:48,360
you got to fall in love with your ideal
customer.

251
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,780
Because look,
I'm sure you know that right now the

252
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,110
economy we have is looking pretty good,
but it's going to correct because we've

253
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:58,380
done nothing since 2008 set print,
more money and we didn't print money and

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,390
we put ones and Zeros and computers.

255
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,910
So there's gonna be some corrections.
And when those happens,

256
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,730
it's going to shake people up.
You need to fall in love with a client

257
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,490
who's going to do well with you even
when the economy goes to hell.

258
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,480
Think about it.
Starbucks,

259
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,400
I was sitting across from our jolts and
had a great conversation and say,

260
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,470
what does he most proud of him?
He said,

261
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,330
he used to say starting starbucks.
Then he said,

262
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:19,950
now it's surviving 2008 as they closed,
I think it was 1300 stores,

263
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,470
if I remember correctly it for $2
coffee.

264
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,570
So you need to get your ass ready for
winter because it's coming and if you

265
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,930
ever got challenges now,
but if you do,

266
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:30,570
if you do well in winter,
you'll dominate for the rest of the time

267
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,380
and the way you do well mentor is you
fall in love with your ideal clients and

268
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,810
then you come up with the irresistible
offer for them.

269
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,810
You know Steve Jobs created 99 cent
songs,

270
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,880
but he didn't create that shit.
We all know that we're to come from

271
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:44,310
WHO's old enough?
Remember Columbia House where you got

272
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,920
like 10 albums for a buck?
Remember that are for corridor and

273
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,140
stuff.
They built a billion dollar company,

274
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,880
Tom Shoes,
shitty product.

275
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,960
I love him.
Great Greg,

276
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,820
what he does,
but two for one,

277
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:58,090
being able to do something where I get
it and I benefit somebody else.

278
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,910
Brilliant idea,
but the whole company on that,

279
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:02,530
he didn't build on the product,
he booked it on the mission,

280
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,920
right?
So you need an irresistible offer for

281
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,950
the client who is ideal for you and you
want to fall in love with a client.

282
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,040
Don't fall in love with your product or
service because those need to change.

283
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,990
And if you fall in love with your
product or service,

284
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,100
somebody is going to beat you.

285
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,410
They're going to be anticipated.
I always tell businesses,

286
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,440
there's two businesses you have to run
manage right now.

287
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,560
You have to run the business you're in
because if you don't want him at your

288
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,270
castle,
your challenges are going to bite you.

289
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,260
But you also have to run the business
you're becoming and both businesses you

290
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,870
have to making progress on.
If you get all excited about the future

291
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,900
and all the cool stuff that's coming and
you go work on that and there's no

292
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,520
cashflow,
now you're dead in the water.

293
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,620
If you just work on today,
you're going to wake up and go,

294
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,330
what the hell happened?
My competition beat me.

295
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,420
It's those two sides and my 33
companies.

296
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,290
I look at what the company is now and
what it has to be constantly.

297
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,370
So there were,
were doing the,

298
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,960
you know,
the,

299
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
the grunt work,
if you will,

300
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,010
the important day to day work while
we're anticipating the future.

301
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,470
When you were building your businesses
and you've gone through an evolution,

302
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,950
it's all business owners do,
I mean what you were doing 30 years ago

303
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:07,951
isn't really what you're doing today.
How and when did you know that you were

304
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:14,521
doing in life what you were meant to do?
Because I think that's part of the quest

305
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,390
of the entrepreneur is to,
is to achieve that.

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,640
When did you know it?
How did you know it?

307
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,690
When did I know?
I think I've known you,

308
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,850
I think you know,
the different stages at different levels

309
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:28,750
at different times.
You know,

310
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,010
it's like,
uh,

311
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,950
I can remember one that stands out from
you and yes,

312
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,750
that pops in my head is uh,
President Clinton calling me.

313
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,850
I was with Peter Guber,
my,

314
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,660
my partner in the sports business and we
both them the yellow AAFC new in the mls

315
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,440
franchise soccer franchise to build a
stadium there.

316
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,380
I was at his home and asked him that and
he says,

317
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,070
the president is on the line for you.
And it was President Clinton and I

318
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,190
picked the phone and I talked to present
for a few minutes and he told me what's

319
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:51,821
going on.
And I said,

320
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,230
Mister President,
I'm completely honored.

321
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,120
You want me to come visit with you?
And I'd love to,

322
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,390
but I want you to know I'm not a fan.
I said,

323
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:58,000
uh,
you know,

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
it was the time when,
which you said the economy stupid.

325
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,560
And then he turned around and all these
things aren't related to the economy and

326
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,210
he looked like a very weak president at
that point.

327
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,640
And I remember Peter Looking at color,
you just told the fucking United States

328
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,610
you're not a fan.
Oh,

329
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,680
you tell him inviting you to come out to
the camp,

330
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,420
David.
But it was great.

331
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,081
I said,
I just,

332
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:14,914
I want to be sincere.

333
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,900
I love to serve you,
but I'm not,

334
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm not a sycophant.
Right.

335
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,140
Yeah.
And so I went there and spend time with

336
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,390
him.
And I think the moment I know that I was

337
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,640
doing what I loved was when there were a
couple of other people,

338
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,140
then they're all trying to get his
attention.

339
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,940
And he and I went through this walk,
you know,

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,750
and this deer went by and he was telling
me about all these past presidents.

341
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,510
He was honestly at the time complaining
about how unfair things were.

342
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,980
And I thought,
this is a pressing United States and

343
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:40,981
these F up
and I'm 31 years old and I got to help

344
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,070
this bastard,
you know?

345
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,130
And then that night he wanted me to stay
and it was new years and I left Aspen

346
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,620
with my family and Peter and I promised
my family and come back.

347
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,140
And I said,
no,

348
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,410
promised my family was present.

349
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,610
I said I'd be happy to work with in the
future and I left leaving the president

350
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,560
when everybody else stayed,
uh,

351
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,750
was a moment I realize I'm doing what
I'm really supposed to do.

352
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,000
I've kept my party straight,
my family still number one,

353
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,150
making contribution is number two.
I'm able to play on the scale that's

354
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,700
global and a male playing this play
scale that matters most,

355
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,580
which is local and family.
I think that would be a moment that

356
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:12,350
sticks out.
I don't want to spend a lot of time on

357
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,600
this,
but since you brought up the subject of

358
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,000
presidents,
I have to ask you about the current

359
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:17,834
president.
Yes.

360
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Have you had,
have you advised him and if you haven't,

361
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,670
how would you help him?

362
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,680
Brain transplant?
No,

363
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:35,120
just kidding.
I know the president quite well.

364
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,560
I've known for many years.
I gave him his first big speech I'm,

365
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,170
I might be to blame.
He wrote about in his book,

366
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,920
he thought he was coming to speak to 200
people in my seminar with 10,000 people.

367
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,140
And you just kind of lost it a little
bit.

368
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,180
Um,
and then his number one piece of

369
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,340
feedback on how to succeed was get a
prenup.

370
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,450
And I thought,
oh my God.

371
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,730
And I know Mrs. Clark.
I Know Mrs. Clinton very well as well.

372
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:56,564
So,
um,

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,050
I had a great difficulty in this last
election because I felt like both

374
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,620
parties lied.
And I think that's extremely hard.

375
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,640
I mean,
everybody goes white lights,

376
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,070
but some were pretty exaggerated and
obviously on both sides.

377
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,710
And so I thought it was a more difficult
time.

378
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,450
Um,
I help people on both sides of the

379
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,080
aisle.

380
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,450
I don't talk about it and way help
unless they talk about it publicly.

381
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,580
Uh,
President Clinton is shared,

382
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,400
you know,
he called me one day and said,

383
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,430
uh,
you know,

384
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,490
I got the overhead speaker.
The president's calling them in my

385
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,800
offices,
big offices in two floors.

386
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,410
I went to the pickup,
the stone,

387
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,310
and sure enough,
it's the secretary and the presence

388
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,750
waiting and says,
Tony,

389
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:32,510
they're gonna impeach me in the morning.
What should I do?

390
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,780
I was like,
could you call me sooner

391
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,650
morning?
Hey,

392
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,160
what the hell are you going to do?
Right?

393
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,900
So you know,
he said,

394
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,770
what should I do?
And I said,

395
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,110
the answer is not what should they do?
You're asking the wrong question.

396
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,060
The first question you gonna ask is,
what do you want?

397
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,850
Do you want parents,
moms,

398
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:54,320
dads to have their kids look up to you
or do you want him to stay in office?

399
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,820
I mean,
it's a different outcome.

400
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,620
I said,
if you want to stay in the office,

401
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:58,431
I said,
easy for me.

402
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,960
I'm not a lawyer and I'm not in your
position,

403
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,480
but let's be honest,
you're never going to get thrown out of

404
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,250
office.
There's too many votes on your side.

405
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,110
So I said,
you're going to stay an office if be do

406
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,490
nothing.
But I said,

407
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,560
if you really want to be respected,
I said,

408
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,930
you can share the truth.
You're a lawyer without putting yourself

409
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,990
at risk.
And still get more of the truth out.

410
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,020
And we had a great conversation.
He's near.

411
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,290
That's exactly right.
That's exactly what I do.

412
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,210
So I'll call you back,
I'll call you back in 20 minutes,

413
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:24,170
some weight and 2030 45 and an hour
later secretary calls me and says,

414
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,240
[inaudible] want you to know he's still
resolving things.

415
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,110
He wants to get back to you.

416
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,460
And then another 30 minutes went by and
thinking like an effecting history here,

417
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,290
right?
And then I saw him standing with all the

418
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,060
Democrats beside him to say,
nope,

419
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,730
we're doing to kind of keep this theme
component and went through things.

420
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:40,820
So over the years I've had the chance to
work with people on all sides.

421
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,790
And what I think about the current
president is he's terrible communicator.

422
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,410
But I think he actually has some good
ideas.

423
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,800
And I also think he's communicated so
poorly in our world is so,

424
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,410
but now anything he says is seen through
that filter.

425
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,530
If I think you are the nicest man in the
world,

426
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,960
it totally controls my experience of
you.

427
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,790
It has nothing to do with you.
It's my belief.

428
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,760
If you treat me mean one day and we're
best friends,

429
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,590
I'll probably go,
you're having a bad day,

430
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,780
right?
If I can't resolve it with you and who's

431
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,800
ever had a bad day,
when you look,

432
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,080
somebody else thought that about you and
you're just having a bad day,

433
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,970
you know?

434
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,080
So,
but if I think you're a manipulative

435
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,400
bastard and I'm wrong,
but I believe it and you don't treat me

436
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,120
me and you treat me real nice,
what's the first question in our mind?

437
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,810
What does he want?
So your questions,

438
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,000
your belief,
your emotion or your experience has

439
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,190
nothing to do with life.
It's shaped by what you believe in.

440
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,190
Most of you believe what you believe,
not by enduring interacting with these

441
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,920
people personally.
You're doing it through the media and

442
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,380
the media is a great component that
everything's soundbites.

443
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,710
And let's be honest,
it's no longer about informing you.

444
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,430
It's about startling you in farming,
you will never get your attention.

445
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,050
There's too much.
We've got oceans,

446
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,210
you know,
people say that we're living in an

447
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,920
information society that's total
bullshit.

448
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,230
The information society died a long time
ago,

449
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,940
right?
We're drowning in information,

450
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,080
we're starving for wisdom.

451
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,710
And what we get now are sound.
And now people don't,

452
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,110
you know,
it's not news anymore on both sides of

453
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,720
the table.
People basically pretended snooze when

454
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,670
it's all commentary.
And so your perception,

455
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,250
it's like I just had lunch recently with
George W.

456
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,500
Bush.
I brought them out to speak to a,

457
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,290
a group of my funding groups and I bring
up people on both sides of the aisle.

458
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,660
And this year we're working with has an
Obama so you could get him in,

459
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,380
but to give you an idea,
most people their thought they were more

460
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,810
liberal and they were like thinking like
this guy is evil.

461
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,360
And after two hours of conversation
there wasn't a person that you're like,

462
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,450
oh,
thought that right.

463
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,970
They really liked him,
but like I was getting on as decisions

464
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,310
and they got to see why he made the
decisions he did.

465
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,950
And when you see the why,
instead of all the bullshit you hear and

466
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:36,750
the generalizations that he's an evil
guy,

467
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,980
you start to go,
wow,

468
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,220
I might've made a different,
different incentive.

469
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,460
I might not have without information
that he had at that time.

470
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,700
I asked him about the current president
that it was still during the election

471
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,370
when this is occurring.
And I,

472
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,060
I said,
obviously I know you wanted your brother

473
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,160
to win.
And I admired person Bush for never

474
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,440
attacking the past present.
He never attacked President Obama.

475
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,090
It was,
it was a class act even when he

476
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,400
disagreed.
So he told me privately what he felt.

477
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,860
And then he said,
Tony,

478
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,290
I remember when Nixon was elected and he
said,

479
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,510
I fought.
That was the end of the American

480
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,680
presidency.
I mean,

481
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,580
the pressing United States is God.
I mean he's,

482
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,180
he's,
he's the wrong thing.

483
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,700
And he said he didn't destroy it.
He didn't.

484
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,170
And he said,
so here's what I figured out.

485
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,820
The office is bigger than the occupant.
And I really believe that's true.

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
I think if you want to go home tonight
with a little bit of comfort inside,

487
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,480
go back to that truth.

488
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,090
The office is bigger than the occupant
and you'll see it when he does things.

489
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,220
And then there's a judicial branch that
balances it.

490
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,590
And,
and I think we're in a situation where

491
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:32,250
the biggest challenge we have as a
society is we demonize the other side on

492
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:33,320
almost every issue,
right?

493
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,530
They used to be that,
you know,

494
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,500
congressmen and senators would go fight
like crazy on the floor and then they go

495
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,660
have a beer together.
Now your radioactive,

496
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,800
if you talk to somebody and that's huge.
I,

497
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:44,730
I met Mr Gorbachev,
I got a chance to fly him for four and

498
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:47,170
half hours and I asked him what ended
the Cold War and he said at the end of

499
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:49,420
demonization,
you said it used to be you guys were

500
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:51,340
attacking us and everything he did was
evil.

501
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,650
We were the evil empire and we knew you
were evil.

502
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,500
And he said one day said,
I was sitting there with President

503
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,480
Reagan.
He was lecturing me and he said,

504
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,230
I could feel the anger,
I could feel my face burning red.

505
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,860
I was so mad.
And I said to him,

506
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,340
you are not my teacher and I am not your
student and you will not lecture me.

507
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,750
And he said,
then I lectured him.

508
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:08,590
I'm able some capital.

509
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,090
I remember going back and forth and he
said,

510
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,350
so that's one of the Cold War.
And I said,

511
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,430
you know,
that's really great answer,

512
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,710
but I'm with you for four hours and I
want to know the moment.

513
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,140
What's the moment I'm spending this time
with history?

514
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,490
What's the,
what changed the world?

515
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:24,120
Because most of us forget,
that's probably take away terrorism.

516
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:29,121
Terrorism is nothing compared to the
level of nuclear salt the USSR and the

517
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:33,060
US had at that stage,
biggest change we've had and he thought

518
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:35,170
from old talking mountain.
He showed this great moment with bay,

519
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,780
said he hit his leg,
he's talking to the interpreter,

520
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,750
but he recognized us,
understand why the English,

521
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,270
he's smacking his legging giggling like
a little kid.

522
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,030
He goes,
I will tell you the moment he said we

523
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:47,730
were having this fight back and forth,
back and forth,

524
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,710
was lecturing him.
He was lecturing me and you all of a

525
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:51,660
sudden you just stood up like this and
he said,

526
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,890
this is not working.
He turned and walked three steps away

527
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,380
and he turned back and said,
can we start fresh?

528
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,850
My name is Rod.
And to have that same impact they did on

529
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,350
you this now he said he was laughing

530
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,363
uncontrollable.
He goes,

531
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,040
I knew I could do business with this
man.

532
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,080
You have the love the man.
And Minnie said,

533
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:15,790
Reagan also knew the Gorbachev loves
children and there were no children

534
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,110
going to go to the USSR.
Right?

535
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,890
So the union and Reagan brought a group
of children over and let them be in the

536
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:24,410
care of Gorbachev and he said the
completely changed the game for him.

537
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,160
So it was a moment,
just a moment of breaking someone's

538
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,190
pattern and that works in an intimate
relationship.

539
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,340
It works in a business challenge,
but it also works out of scale of

540
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,050
society in history.
I want to go to audience questions and I

541
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,080
hope you all had sent some to the iconic
tour Hashtag.

542
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,880
I'll go to those in just a sec,
but,

543
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,180
but from politics back to to
entrepreneurial is in the

544
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,850
entrepreneurship,
you've built businesses,

545
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,600
you've faced business challenges,
you have talked to people like the

546
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,190
people in this room,
entrepreneurs.

547
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,360
What do they ask you most and what do
you tell them?

548
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,950
Time.
Time seems to be the largest issue.

549
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:03,040
How many of you have time issues and run
your business having to have a life and

550
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,600
your time?
Does he show hands out there who feels

551
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,900
like that's there?
So you can see it's about nine years ago

552
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,130
and some people are just too tired to
raise their hand.

553
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,380
But the issue of time is not

554
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,290
the real issue.
The real issue is that they're operating

555
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,610
as an operator,
not an owner.

556
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,310
And so when I start to do in the
beginning you have to do both,

557
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,710
right?
But when I start to do is show them how

558
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,990
you have to be able to break off and get
other people to do things.

559
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,670
But more importantly,
I teach people.

560
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:28,600
I do a,
you know,

561
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,250
a five day bootcamp,
I called business mastery with a couple

562
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:33,760
of times a year.
Can we bring in businesses from all over

563
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:34,421
the world?
Literally.

564
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,610
And we have people just starting a
business and we have people with,

565
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,780
you know,
this is something they're doing a

566
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,010
billion,
2,000,000,003.

567
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,000
And what you find is that there's a
common pattern amongst all these group

568
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:47,690
of people where they find if they're,
if it's a small business,

569
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,300
they do everything because they figured
that that was the only one can do it or

570
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,750
they tried someone else and they fail.

571
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,670
But that happens in every business.
You have to begin to leverage yourself

572
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,510
or you're just going to be self employed
and you'll never have the scalability.

573
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,570
A business is a system that adds value
even when you're not there and you as a

574
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,480
leader have to get good enough to both
hire people and train people so that

575
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,720
you're not a manager.
A manager works with people to make sure

576
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,340
they get the job done while you're
there,

577
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,910
but if you have to be there,
there's a cry run 33 companies.

578
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,910
I mean every four days I'm on a plane
train helicopter on stage,

579
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,940
somewhere on average in a year and I got
33 companies.

580
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:26,780
There's 12 I managed directly,
but I couldn't do that by management.

581
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:29,810
I do it by leadership.
I build leaders who can make their own

582
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:31,880
decisions.
I hire people that are the best of the

583
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,360
best.

584
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,100
Now in the beginning that's hard cause
you have no money,

585
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,930
right?
So you hire the best,

586
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,370
it's called you and you pay them
nothing.

587
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,090
And then now you try to hire other
people and what do you do?

588
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:43,550
You hire your friends,
which you know is a disaster because

589
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,130
they're not as skilled and you love them
and it's hard to manage them.

590
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,430
And then I hired people that were really
talented but they were mean.

591
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,290
You know,
they didn't share my values.

592
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,530
And so eventually you get to that place
where you can find the right people.

593
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,130
But I think the most important secret
for the growth of any business,

594
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,690
and the question that got us on how to
go over the time,

595
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:01,940
and the answer is you've got to take two
hours,

596
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,280
many minutes a week with your team of
one,

597
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:04,941
two,
three,

598
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,850
2000 and you got to meet where you work
on the business.

599
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,660
And I teach people a format called seven
seven where there's seven areas of a

600
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,610
business that you cannot miss.
Marketing,

601
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,980
sales optimization,
the financials,

602
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,560
culture.
And I'll make sure that each week you

603
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,020
and your team focus on that.
Not been bathed in a business.

604
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,350
But how do we strengthen our marketing,
not just for this run,

605
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:27,080
but overall how we build the brand?
What do we do to change our sales

606
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:28,880
process?
How do we optimize the business?

607
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:32,240
How do we spend no money and grow the
business 30% in the next three to six

608
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,790
months?
And when you take small markers in the

609
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,550
business that are critical and your
improve them five,

610
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:42,160
10 15% that you do 12 of them,
you'll grow your business 120 130% and

611
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,480
40% because there's a compounding
impact.

612
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,130
You don't just get the improvement
you've made.

613
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,920
So I try to help businesses to make
those changes so that,

614
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,590
so you have time to think and be
strategic.

615
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,990
Because if you're just running,
how many of you are stressed?

616
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,310
I'll be honest,
I'll be honest.

617
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:58,070
If you had today being here and not
being at your business,

618
00:25:58,071 --> 00:25:59,930
how many pills?
Some stress in your business being away

619
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,130
even for a day.
Okay,

620
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:02,690
write down,
I'm a business operator.

621
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,690
F that I'm going to come a business
owner.

622
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:06,740
You've got to be,
yeah.

623
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,750
Let's go to a question from the
audience.

624
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,690
Uh,
what would the 13 year old version of

625
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:16,691
yourself say to you today with
conviction and be flat wrong about,

626
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,650
let's see,
we're going to get a 30 year old.

627
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,143
Well,
first of all,

628
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,920
he's dead,
so he's not gonna say shit today.

629
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,700
I buried him a long time ago was the
fifth 57.

630
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,990
Um,
I would say,

631
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,220
um,
I would say the 30 year old would say,

632
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,690
this is what we're going to do this
year.

633
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,350
And it would be these huge numbers.
And I develop a principle around the

634
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,920
time I was 30 is most of us overestimate
work we're going to do in a year.

635
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,670
And we underestimate,
we're going to do in a decade and a

636
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,080
decade happens that fast.
You'll blink,

637
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,870
your eyes will be here.
So I really,

638
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:55,560
truly,
I,

639
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,840
everything I do as long term,
I think it's the biggest challenge we

640
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:01,710
have in your corporate America is always
looking for the next quarter instead of,

641
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:02,940
you know,
the best business people,

642
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,630
the Marc Benioff's,
the Steve Wynn's.

643
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,050
Peter Guber is and people that I hang
with,

644
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,920
they all are decade long people.
When I was 14 I said,

645
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,450
this is how my life's going to go.

646
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,940
I decided,
I sat in my twenties I'm going to help.

647
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,550
I want to have the skill to help anyone
changed their lives.

648
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:18,720
If I'm committed to,
they're committed,

649
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,570
it's going to be done a hobby ability.
So I got to build to that,

650
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,360
which I did and I said in my thirties
and 14 I said,

651
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:27,330
I'll do that with groups of people.
It's been a one on one and then in my

652
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,300
forties I'll do a big groups in my
fifties I'll do it with companies and my

653
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,580
six p's,
I'll either do it in government as a

654
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:35,760
servant there or in a religious context
cause I'm a spiritual person.

655
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,320
But I don't tell people what to believe
religiously.

656
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,610
But at that point I've lived long
enough,

657
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,650
maybe a well,
well do you have a run for office,

658
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,360
a Iul?
I would've said yes.

659
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,880
Now the answer is no.
I've served on both sides of the island.

660
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,730
It's not really about the office,
it's about fundraising right now.

661
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:51,480
So much of the time I would not do that
unless I ran with in my own money on,

662
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,740
you know,
maybe a small number of friends.

663
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,650
But at this stage I think it would
disrupt my wife's life so much.

664
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,190
I'm a very public person and she's not
and I feel bad for her.

665
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,330
So I don't think that would be right.

666
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,990
Let's go to Jeff Collins question.
If mindset is the key or a key,

667
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:08,590
how do you shift your mindset?
I was going to ask a question that's

668
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:13,150
related to that and that is uh,
you're now,

669
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,450
but when you say your top of the world,
but you're a confident guy,

670
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,580
what do you do?
What do you do when you have self doubt

671
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,630
and that's sort of how your mindset,
I think that you deal with self doubt.

672
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,160
I will,
I don't have a lot of it at this stage,

673
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:31,150
but,
but it's shocking.

674
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm being honest.

675
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,090
I think self doubt is,
you know,

676
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,850
instead of self doubt,
I would say questioning.

677
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,820
I think it's critical to question,
but it's certain stages.

678
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,940
If you're questioning all the time,
you have nothing but fear and doubt,

679
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,860
right?
You only believe something cause you

680
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,420
don't question it,
right?

681
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,520
Someone tells me,
Oh so and so talked behind your back

682
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,121
this.
And he'd go,

683
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,800
no,
they're my friend maybe ever do that.

684
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,420
Your belief,
your certain,

685
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:57,040
they're not going to do it so you don't
even entertain it.

686
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,410
But if two or three people tell you that
and they go,

687
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,131
wow,
good John,

688
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:02,190
really be doing this by my back.
I mean,

689
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,930
and you start questioning it.
You ever done that?

690
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,310
You've been upset with somebody,
you confront them and then you find out

691
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,900
it's all bullshit.
They didn't do anything wrong and you

692
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,400
feel like an idiot.
So,

693
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,890
so for me,
I think there's a time to question.

694
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,740
And so I organized that when I'm
beginning something,

695
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:16,840
I do that.
And my investments is a perfect example,

696
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:17,830
you know,
uh,

697
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,420
if you look at somebody,
you know,

698
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,520
uh,
you know,

699
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,580
like Richard Branson for example,
Richard is this giant risk taker,

700
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,230
right?
But he questioned,

701
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,990
he's got one question,
he questions within himself and everyone

702
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:31,090
else.
How are we gonna protect the downside?

703
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,160
It's his number one question.
You never believe it.

704
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:35,050
Cause I got risks.
His life when it comes to investments in

705
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:36,160
business,
he doesn't risk anything.

706
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,350
When he was,
he told me I was building virgin,

707
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,800
he's taking,
I'm British airlands and it's giant

708
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,220
outright at capitol.
I mean this could literally bankrupt I

709
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,570
and everybody said it would.
So he said,

710
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,220
okay,
how to protect the downside.

711
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,350
And he negotiated with Boeing for a year
and a half and convinced them that if he

712
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:55,690
went out of business,
if he was wrong and lost his business in

713
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,090
the first two years,
he could get back all the jabs and have

714
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,410
no liability whatsoever.

715
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,860
So his whole focus is asymmetrical risk
reward.

716
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,590
How do I take the least risk with the
most upside?

717
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,110
If I was going to say anything,
go entrepreneurs in this room,

718
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,460
the illusion that you've been taught is
that great entrepreneurs take giant

719
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,020
risks.
It's total bullshit.

720
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,210
There are some exceptions that have and
they gotten lucky,

721
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,390
but if you look at the ones that
consistently succeed,

722
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,540
they know the upside will take care of
itself.

723
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,460
They focus on how to protect the
downside.

724
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,210
And they take risks where they know I'm
taking a limited risk for an unlimited

725
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,350
upside.
So if I'm wrong,

726
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,820
I'm still okay.
You know,

727
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:34,360
I worked with Paul Tudor Jones,
one of the top 10 traders in the history

728
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,800
of the world,
and Paul,

729
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,810
I've worked with them,
I've coached now for 24 years.

730
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:40,360
He hasn't lost money in those 24 years
on his own personal training.

731
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,350
And during that time I've learned so
much from him and the biggest thing I

732
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,010
learned from him was this asymmetrical
risk reward that when he risks a dollar,

733
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,560
he wants to be certain,
he's going to make five where he doesn't

734
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,560
rest of the doubt.
He must be worth a dollar to make 10% or

735
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,720
20% you won't do that.
If you do that,

736
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,580
you're going to go broke because here's
what happens.

737
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,830
You risk a dollar to try to make five
and you're wrong,

738
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,330
risk another dollar,
and if you win,

739
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,720
you still win big.
You can be wrong four to five times and

740
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:07,660
still break even.
That's how the best in the world do it.

741
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:11,140
They don't do it by taking these
gigantic risks where everything's on the

742
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:12,730
line.
If it doesn't go perfectly,

743
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,430
you're out of business.
That's why most businesses go out.

744
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,200
You want to think of asymmetrical risk
reward

745
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,470
tutor Jones,
curiously as an aside,

746
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,500
was a classmate of mine at the
University of Virginia.

747
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,423
Wow,
man,

748
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,740
I met him there.
He would never remember it,

749
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,640
but a but a fascinating guy.
Uh,

750
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,800
another aside,
because you mentioned that he's a hedge

751
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:35,660
fund manager in Connecticut.
You did a brilliant interview with Ray

752
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,240
Dalio for,
I believe it was facebook not long ago.

753
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,940
And his book is really terrific,
called principles.

754
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,060
I recommend you all go get it.
Very,

755
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,650
very good.
It's one of the greatest business books

756
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:45,970
I've ever read because if you don't
know,

757
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,800
ray is in most of you know Warren
Buffet.

758
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,690
That's because Warren buffet is sweet
and shares and is public nature.

759
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:56,110
But Ray is actually most successful
investor of its type in the history of

760
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,240
the world.
He's returned more money to investors

761
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,190
and the Hedge Fund perspective than
anybody in history.

762
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,720
When I met Ray now 10 years ago,
you had of a $5 billion net worth for

763
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,970
him to talk to you.
You couldn't be a billionaire that's too

764
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,460
weak and you got to give them 100
million to start.

765
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,900
Now.
He won't take your money no matter who

766
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,280
you are.
When I went to go interview him the

767
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,800
first time,
the prime minister of China was talking

768
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,720
to him the phone,
he was coaching China on what to do with

769
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,050
their money.

770
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,970
That's how brilliant his hedge fund
people,

771
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,470
if you're familiar with rich people,
give them money.

772
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,490
Hedge Fund's a big one.
Might be,

773
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,980
let's say 20 billion.
He's 160 billion,

774
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,070
but go get his book.
He flew down to palm beach and my home

775
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,870
and it's called principles.
He said,

776
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,910
I want you to be the first person to
interview me and do it on,

777
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,530
on facebook live.
So I did,

778
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,430
but I love this man and he will show you
how we built from nothing.

779
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,800
You literally started with nothing and
he worked as a caddy.

780
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Um,
he started when he was 26 years old and

781
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,380
a two bedroom apartment and now he's got
1800 employees,

782
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,690
160 billion.
He's 100 richest men in the world and

783
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,160
one of the top 10.
And they go meet.

784
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,070
But his insights about how to run a
business,

785
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,160
how to run your life,
we all need principles to guide our

786
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:55,730
decision making.

787
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,580
If you really think about it,
success is the result of good judgment,

788
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,410
right?
If you make great decisions,

789
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,610
you're going to succeed.
But where does good judgement comes

790
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:04,820
from?
You know,

791
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,803
good judgment,
awesome.

792
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,050
Often comes from experience and
experience often comes from bad

793
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,950
judgment,
right?

794
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,440
So what I found is the way to speed it
up,

795
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,860
way to have less of that bad judgment is
coming out of a,

796
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,510
think about that for a minute.
That's good.

797
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,890
All good?
Yeah.

798
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,100
So I found that the way to speed it up
is not learned through my own

799
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,720
experience,
but learn by modeling.

800
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:27,140
Others compress decades into days.
So if you can get an erase head,

801
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,940
no,
raised in a very private man through

802
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,980
Larry Decade,
but he's,

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,650
he's 68 years old.
He's a good friend and he's entering a

804
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:36,830
stage where he now wants to go public
for a short time,

805
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:40,400
give everybody knows and then disappear
cause he feels an obligation to give

806
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:43,310
back to the society and human beings
that have helped him to again.

807
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,750
So go pick it up and it'll be fantastic.
We had them at another event and he

808
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,950
talks about this idea of,
of radical transparency and yes,

809
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,390
how he runs his business.
It's a very different,

810
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,830
I'm not sure it would work for every
business,

811
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,550
but it certainly worked for him.
Let's go to uh,

812
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,510
uh,
set Torrie's question,

813
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,740
but so many people wanting your help.
What are the factors for you to select

814
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,040
who you privately train or mentor?
I said you're a busy guy,

815
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,040
you've got a time management thing.
I'm sure a lot of people would like a

816
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:18,041
piece of Tony Robbins mind.
How do you decide who whom you are going

817
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:18,801
to help?
Well,

818
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,540
first of all,
I try to do things online.

819
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:21,831
Now.
You know,

820
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,630
like I,
there's a zillion things on youtube,

821
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,510
so no one has to spend any money.
Anybody who wants to be inspired to do

822
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:26,901
that,
they only,

823
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,400
I don't like about that is it's random.

824
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm a system guy,
like I know how to take you from here to

825
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,290
there.
So I have products that can do that for

826
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,730
people.
And then they have events and the events

827
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:36,380
have gotten bigger and bigger.
Now we do 10,

828
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:38,680
14,000 people in a weekend.
Um,

829
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,160
and so anybody can go who I coach or
people that I know by touching them,

830
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,910
I can touch millions more.
So when I work with a Marc Benioff at

831
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:47,870
salesforce,
you know,

832
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,880
in the early days,
mark sat in the front row,

833
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,720
came to three of my same seminars in a
row,

834
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:52,554
and I was like,
are you,

835
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,020
are you new?
Are you a little slow?

836
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:54,854
As a teaser,
there

837
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,910
marches as big as I am.
He stands up and I'm looking at this

838
00:34:58,911 --> 00:34:59,744
guy,
I die.

839
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,261
And he goes,
you know,

840
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:02,270
my name is Marc Benioff.
And because of you,

841
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,440
you finally pushed me over the edge.

842
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,210
I'm gonna Start my own business.
I'm leaving Oracle,

843
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:08,270
I'm gonna Start this company called
salesforce.com and he said,

844
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,770
uh,
and you mark my words,

845
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,360
we're going to change business around
the world.

846
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,490
We're going to do $100 million in
business.

847
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,110
Well,
this year he's going to do 10 billion.

848
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,970
Right?
So he's grown a little bit,

849
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,350
but when you're around people like that,
you get to see what the distinctions are

850
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:23,360
that separate people.
You get to see what,

851
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,610
what makes them stand out and buy.
Coaching him,

852
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,480
I'm able to affect everybody,
not only all of him and his employees

853
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,070
because he's that kind of owner,
right?

854
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:33,820
He's a leader,
but also he's a leader in the social,

855
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,870
you know,
social community.

856
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,980
He's very conscious about that.
And everybody from facebook,

857
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,880
the apple to Ge,
the back end is salesforce.

858
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,410
So impacting him,
in fact,

859
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:44,880
some of the other people,
and maybe by just picked people who I

860
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,860
feel the need is and somebody stops me
in the street,

861
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,960
you know,
my wife will tell you I can't not help

862
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,610
and I got to help someone that I may
have limited time.

863
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:53,610
So then I'll invite them in a seminar or
send them a book or a package or

864
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,010
something so I can give them a guide to
go to the next level.

865
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:59,160
So I don't ever say no,
but I can't coach everybody one on one.

866
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,420
So I tried to do it in groups where

867
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,900
there was a wonderful anecdote I read
since you brought up Marc Benihoff that

868
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:05,610
I guess he was a guest at one of your
bed,

869
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,590
your home or resort in Fiji and middle
of the night you get he and all of the

870
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,970
other guests.
It is,

871
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,430
it goes to the question of how do you
overcome your fears?

872
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Tell that story about Benny Hoff jumping
into the river river and what you didn't

873
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,090
tell him about the river.

874
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,850
Okay.
Well I have a home in Fiji.

875
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,800
I've been going there since I was 2124
years old.

876
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,890
So my favorite places in the world and
the people there are extraordinary.

877
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:33,060
You're carried as a child every day for
six months by someone 24 seven so we

878
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,350
talked about raising them,
you know,

879
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,550
being raised by a village.
It's true.

880
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,650
They're on there.
They sing in four part harmony when

881
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:39,210
they're four years old.
So when I went there,

882
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:43,440
I was touched by it and I went explored
this island and I was with this chief

883
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,230
and I,
they have this river that goes both ways

884
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:50,100
because it's this river where the ocean
comes in and it looks like out of Africa

885
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:53,310
or something you'd see down in South
America and eventually goes,

886
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,170
ms scary looking arrogant into a giant
wake.

887
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,530
But the tide is so fast it would just
take you.

888
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,740
And then your eight hours later when
reverses and goes back out.

889
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,660
So I was whipping missed one day and I
said,

890
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,350
are there any fish in there?
And the Ratu,

891
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,730
which is the main key points that goes a
little about that.

892
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,520
And we looked back and it's a giant
Manta rays slowly going under the

893
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,110
bridge.
So I said,

894
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,640
F it,
I'm doing this.

895
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,510
I just jumped in.
And then the thing took me and it took

896
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,450
me for a wild ass ride for about 20
minutes.

897
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,450
I end up this lake and then dumb ass me.
I didn't think about how the hell am I

898
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,610
going to get back.
He was so strong,

899
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,010
I couldn't swim against this.
I spent eight hours on this little

900
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:31,980
island airport.
So then I came back one time with a

901
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:33,600
friend,
it was nighttime and I was like,

902
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,730
you know,
they were talking about devil rock in

903
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,500
shark alley and all this shit.
I was like,

904
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,080
let's do it at night.
But I had a boat waiting for us

905
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,673
to bring us back,

906
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,740
Ben,
and it was scary as hell in all the,

907
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,200
you know,
all the phosphorescence going on.

908
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,310
What's like Pixie dust?
It's,

909
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,140
it's a wild experience flying fish to
scare the shit out of here.

910
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:54,140
They come by and so when,
when mark came,

911
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,760
he flew over and come spend a week with
me there.

912
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,160
I took him and woke him up and you have
to do when the tide is,

913
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:00,410
it was like two in the morning.
I woke them all up and so I got a

914
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,360
surprise for you.
Like what?

915
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,810
Just trust me.
Dragged them on.

916
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,480
You know what gear on him gave him wife
life preservers and then threw him off

917
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:11,540
and mark was freaking out and I grabbed
his hand and then we'll go on three one

918
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,443
we went on one.

919
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,540
If I can feel him,
he's as big as I tried to jump.

920
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,560
You might be hanging me out there.
There's a whole mum,

921
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,510
oh,
mark talks about that story a lot.

922
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,730
But overcoming fear cause you are
whatever you're afraid of.

923
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,540
It's never as much as you're afraid of.
Right.

924
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,640
You know,
it's how many things you've been afraid

925
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:29,474
of.
It never happened.

926
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,610
Right.
I remember things you do are afraid of,

927
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,140
if they do happen,
you just deal with them.

928
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,250
It's that old phrase,
you know,

929
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:35,590
coward dies.
1,000 deaths.

930
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,930
A courageous man.
I'm only once I discipline myself,

931
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,270
not perfectly,
but for the most part I don't worry

932
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,410
about shit til that happens.
You know?

933
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,940
I anticipate it,
but I don't worry about it.

934
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,920
You have stayed is everything.
I isn't.

935
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,770
That means state of mind.
How do you stay in a great state of

936
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,330
mind?
24 seven.

937
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,450
Should that even be your goal?
I think it's worthwhile to have as a

938
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,590
goal.
I don't think it's realistic.

939
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:57,100
24 seven whatever,
having a blurbs because we all have a 2

940
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,933
million year old brain.

941
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Everything's roommates that I do too.
And it's not designed to make you happy.

942
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,020
It's designed to make you survive.
So if I said to all of you right now,

943
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:08,020
like what does that bring look for?
It looks for what can hurt you and it

944
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,510
exaggerates it.
And since there's no saber tooth tiger,

945
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:12,880
now it says,
what did people thinking of me?

946
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:13,900
Well,
my business make it.

947
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,840
Do I have enough money?
And these are all easy things to solve,

948
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,350
but our reactions in our gut and when we
let the fear part of our mind take over

949
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:23,830
that basically if the survival software,
if it runs you,

950
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,870
you're in trouble.
So a few years ago,

951
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,670
I actually lecture on this now.
I say,

952
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:29,470
you know,
you need to skills to have the quality

953
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,450
of life you want.
If you want an extraordinary life life

954
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,220
on your terms,
whatever your terms are,

955
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,400
he need to master the skill of the
science of achievement.

956
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,190
You've got to figure out how do I take
what I dream about and make it real?

957
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,490
And it's a science and you can model
other people and you can learn.

958
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:44,290
You can speed up.
I spent my lifetime doing that.

959
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,340
But the second skill and the one that
most people don't give enough value to

960
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,530
culturally is more important.
And that is,

961
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:52,630
you knew to Allston,
if you want an extraordinary life,

962
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,970
how many people you know that have
achieved and how many have done this?

963
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,950
Who has achieved the goal?
That was a big Ole,

964
00:39:56,951 --> 00:40:00,070
you worked your ass off and you achieved
it and then your brain went,

965
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,650
is this all there is?
Who's had one of these moments?

966
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,030
Yeah,
almost everybody.

967
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,070
And that's worse than failing because
the low achievers miss riding where I'm

968
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,901
right.
So if you fail,

969
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:08,920
what are you gonna do?
You get back up,

970
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,820
try another approach.

971
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,130
You going eventually succeed.
You know it and your God if you're

972
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:16,090
really driven.
But if you succeed in your miserable,

973
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,040
now you're what I call technically
screwed,

974
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,660
right?
I mean,

975
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,940
because if you're not happy with what
you got,

976
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,160
I mean feeling you'd get up and do
something new but succeeding,

977
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,950
where do you go?
So I really believe you look at somebody

978
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:27,784
like,
um,

979
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,490
uh,
like somebody like say Robin Williams.

980
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,540
I think the loss of him was one of the
greatest losses we had.

981
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,550
He's loved worldwide.
Ask people all over the world last year

982
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:40,450
and China asked him in Japan and Sydney,
Australia throughout the US,

983
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,430
how many nos people,
how many of you loved,

984
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,650
don't let you if you liked it.
How many of you loved Robin Williams?

985
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,940
I'm curious,
keep your hands up.

986
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:49,780
Look around the room like 98%.
Only 2% assholes.

987
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,614
That didn't like her

988
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,430
Williams.
But

989
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,640
when I say this,
I didn't say,

990
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,550
like I said,
love.

991
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,860
And so here's a guy,
was he an overachiever?

992
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,020
He came to Hollywood ever when it comes
to Hollywood,

993
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:01,430
he said,
well,

994
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,580
my own show.
Oh yeah,

995
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,010
sure you are buddy.
How was old MR member the show?

996
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,650
What was it called?
Mork and mindy organ to old people in

997
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:10,470
this room.
Clearly he does mork and mindy,

998
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,090
but he also makes it the number one
show.

999
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,510
Then he says,
I'm going to have a beautiful family.

1000
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,420
Does that.
Then he says,

1001
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,770
I want to make more money than I could
spend.

1002
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:17,610
He does that.
Then he says,

1003
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:18,810
I want to make movies.
He does that.

1004
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,600
Then he says,
I want to win an academy award for not

1005
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:26,601
being funny is number one skill,
and he did it and then he hung himself

1006
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:30,690
in his own home,
leaving his wife and children to find

1007
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:31,650
his lifeless body.

1008
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,630
Highly explained that I thought the
answer.

1009
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,180
He made everybody happy but home.
Then his wife said he had lewy bodies

1010
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,830
and upsets in his brain.
That's all true,

1011
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:45,320
but he used drugs and alcohol his entire
life.

1012
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:49,040
He suffered his entire life,
made everybody happy but himself and so

1013
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,030
I love the guy.
I,

1014
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,800
I might,
one of my birthdays,

1015
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:56,480
I was at Ted and he did this talk was
very popular and he came to my birthday

1016
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,950
party.
A bunch of guys took me out to dinner

1017
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,350
that night and jumped on top of the
table and saying,

1018
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,530
happy birthday as a Russian woman.
And then as a Chinese man,

1019
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,060
and you know,
I've never lost a suicide knock on wood

1020
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,950
out of thousands.
We've made films and followed up and I

1021
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:12,550
had no idea that's where he was.
But I looked at him and I'm like that.

1022
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,830
I say he's a warning.
As much as we all loved him,

1023
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,890
even more so because we left him,
I know none of you are going to kill

1024
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,210
yourself.
I'm not worried about that.

1025
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,720
But a lot of people live a long time,
but they don't really live,

1026
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,280
you know,
because they let,

1027
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,560
they let their stress and the
frustration,

1028
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,510
you know,
I always say achievers don't get

1029
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:30,980
fearful.
We're all achievers and they don't get

1030
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,210
fearful.
We just get stressed.

1031
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,930
Stress is the achiever word for fear.
Because when I say to you,

1032
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,460
what are you stressing about?
What I gotta do this,

1033
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:38,870
I gotta make this thing happen.
What if you know,

1034
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,100
well,
I got to,

1035
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,701
well,
what of your own?

1036
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:41,990
It'll fall apart.
What if it falls apart,

1037
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,070
then it will fail.
What if it fails?

1038
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,570
Then I'm a failure.
What if you're a failure?

1039
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,630
And now if I follow the trail of your
stress,

1040
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,520
it'll take me to your deepest fear.

1041
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,340
And the only way to have your life work
is the face that fear and push through

1042
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:54,530
it.
What is courage?

1043
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,170
Courage does not mean you're not afraid
of means you're afraid and you do it

1044
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:58,850
anyway.
You're scared shitless,

1045
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:01,700
but you do it anyway.
But I think if you're going to succeed

1046
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,410
at the highest level,
you've got to face those fears.

1047
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,140
Leads right to the next question.
Uh,

1048
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,230
based on your experience,
what are the top three characteristics

1049
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,340
to have in order to be successful for
these type of people?

1050
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,460
What does success look like?
What does it feel like?

1051
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,920
What are the characteristics that can
get you there?

1052
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,070
What success looks like and feels like?
It's different for everyone because we

1053
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,430
all define success in a different way.
So I leave that to that.

1054
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,530
But what does it take to succeed that I
can tell you,

1055
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,330
cause I can be an idiot at this point.

1056
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,740
But when you've been with,
you know,

1057
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,890
50 million people,
4 million in live seminars for days and

1058
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,890
nights and days and nights.
I know that whatever we do,

1059
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:39,380
it's the result of our patterns.
It's not us.

1060
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,360
There are certain patterns.
It'll make you angry.

1061
00:43:41,361 --> 00:43:43,400
They'll make you frustrated,
they'll make you pissed off.

1062
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,390
And there's certain patterns of thinking
and feeling and using your body that'll

1063
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,120
make you playful and fun and grateful
and excited and passionate.

1064
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,240
And if you think it's you could,
you've done a pattern so long,

1065
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:55,400
it's hard to change yourself,
but it's easy to change your path.

1066
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,800
What are the patterns come from?
We learned them through our

1067
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,150
conditioning.
When you first born,

1068
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:00,650
you can do anything in your lab.
Do you can,

1069
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,341
you know,
scream,

1070
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:02,330
yell,
go to the bathroom,

1071
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,070
your pants.
Try that when you're 30 see if it works,

1072
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:04,904
right?
You know,

1073
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,810
but you learn very quickly as time goes
by,

1074
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,640
your love for nothing as a baby,
right?

1075
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,560
Your love,
no matter what you do because your

1076
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:13,371
mother is,
you know,

1077
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:15,980
got oxytocin.
She's drug natural drug in her body.

1078
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,500
Men Get it too.
But let me get 10 times as much.

1079
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,840
That's why a healthy woman cannot leave
her child.

1080
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,270
A healthy man can't.
But a woman can.

1081
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,920
I have cheese,
biochemically healthy.

1082
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:27,040
And so you look at this and you say,
you know,

1083
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,270
what are the three things needed?
I can tell you what they are the number

1084
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:31,280
one,
I love intelligence,

1085
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,080
live wickedly intelligent people.
I tried to hire as many of them as

1086
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:35,040
possible,
learn from them.

1087
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,890
But what's more valuable than
intelligence is hunger.

1088
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,110
Do you find,
if you looked at,

1089
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,360
what's the calming down in between
Richard Branson,

1090
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,510
Mark Benioff,
you give me your list of whoever it is.

1091
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,470
I guarantee if you dig underneath,
their hunger has never gone away.

1092
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:53,370
Some people get hungry cause they got a
goal to achieve something or get in a

1093
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,470
swimsuit by a certain date or some
stuff.

1094
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,780
But that's when it,
that's when the identity change,

1095
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,690
right?
These are people that are like myself.

1096
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm hungry today at 57 more than I was
at 26 you know,

1097
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,160
I can,
I,

1098
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,840
I'm feeling me out and when I say
hungry,

1099
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,640
I'm hungry to contribute,
to learn,

1100
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,380
to grow,
to make a difference.

1101
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,610
I'll never settled west when I can be or
do or share or give a create and

1102
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,410
everyone I know that's successful.
That's the driving force because without

1103
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,260
hunger you can get the skill.
With that hunger,

1104
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:21,570
you can figure it out.
Well that there are a lot of very smart

1105
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:24,660
people who can't fight their way out of
a paper bag and a pragmatic way.

1106
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,531
And they got,
you know,

1107
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:27,720
great,
great transcripts and shit like that.

1108
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:30,300
I went to Harvard one time and I spoke
and right before I spoke,

1109
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,820
they had voted at Harvard business
school to not release anyone's

1110
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,180
transcripts to the recruiters of the
businesses coming in to block it.

1111
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,410
And the argument was,
your education is more than just your

1112
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,720
grades.
And I went to Buzzer.

1113
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,890
I got up there.
First of all,

1114
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:47,910
they said,
you know Tony,

1115
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,770
the first,
you know that I expect to be,

1116
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,761
you know,
thousand people.

1117
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:51,720
There are a couple thousand people
there.

1118
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,231
And they said,
no,

1119
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,190
no.
Bill Gates is here.

1120
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,840
We have 300 people.
It's going to be much smaller.

1121
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,480
But we ended up with about 1200 people
standing room only.

1122
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,940
And they gave me 30 minutes.
And of course I went three hours.

1123
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,310
I did.
No one laughed.

1124
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,810
And,
but one of the first things I did,

1125
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,550
I said,
what is this bullshit?

1126
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:08,460
I'm reading this in the paper that day.
I said,

1127
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:09,750
listen,
I'm not trying to be disrespectful,

1128
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:11,610
but you been disrespectful to each
other.

1129
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,021
I said,
you know,

1130
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,820
if you're not willing to show your
transcripts,

1131
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,370
I think I agree with you,
your career,

1132
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:19,920
who you are as more than just your,
your degree here.

1133
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,660
But you chose Harvard for a reason.
And there are people here that have

1134
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,640
worked around the clock and gotten,
you know,

1135
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:30,390
4.0 and you got yourself a 2.6 and
you're going to block them cause there's

1136
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,790
more of you than the 4.0 it's not gonna
work that way.

1137
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,470
When you get in business,
when you going a business,

1138
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,380
you guys who are doing this right now,
you're going to be judged on one thing.

1139
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,380
Results and your grades are the results
in this context.

1140
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,670
And if you think your grades are not up
and convince me as the interviewer that

1141
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,810
the grades are a part of it,
but there's so much more united.

1142
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,600
If you can't do that,
you're never gonna make it.

1143
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:49,434
I said,
you guys,

1144
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,330
you can do.
Anybody voted for that.

1145
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,970
Just count on a future that is full of
pain.

1146
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,950
And the room was like,
you know,

1147
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:57,120
it was,
it was pretty intense,

1148
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:57,540
I guess.

1149
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,070
I thought it was pretty soft personally.
And then all of a sudden people stood up

1150
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,110
and he did a standing ovation and people
said,

1151
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:08,010
this is bullshit because this is what
happens sometimes in a democracy.

1152
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:11,370
Sometimes in a democracy,
the lowest level standard is what

1153
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,110
becomes natural.
We're seeing it right now on the

1154
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:15,750
political side,
we're seeing people that you know and

1155
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:19,170
Berkeley home of free speech,
people throwing things,

1156
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,030
burning things,
destroying things,

1157
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,060
who are supposed to be liberals,
who should be open for open speech and

1158
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:26,640
then you see conservatives,
they're just as dumb sing things that

1159
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:28,230
inflaming people.
It's,

1160
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,670
it's not one side or the other.
It's us as a society.

1161
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:33,220
We gotta shift that.
We got to go from demonization to

1162
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:35,350
saying,
let's say it's a fight over guns,

1163
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,810
very emotional fight.
What's the problem?

1164
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,900
We demonize upside.
Nobody in this room,

1165
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,410
whether you're pro gun or against Gun,
whether you want gun regulation or not,

1166
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,560
there's nobody in this room that doesn't
want their children or their friends or

1167
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:49,000
their family safe and protected.

1168
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,730
We just disagreed.
People disagree on how,

1169
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,720
and if we can start with what we agree
on,

1170
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,310
we can actually make progress.
But today there is no progress because

1171
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,580
we now also augment this,
the social media and we augment it with

1172
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:04,390
a regular media and think about it.
The media is not here to inform you.

1173
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:07,270
They here to startle you.
We all know if we say something

1174
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,670
inflaming,
you're going to talk about it,

1175
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:12,370
share it on social media,
and they got a multiplied effect.

1176
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,060
It's all about advertising.
So you have to really discern yourself.

1177
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,190
Today.
You have to understand it's the wild

1178
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:19,540
west,
not only on the Internet,

1179
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,510
but on television as well.
And you have to decide if you're an

1180
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:25,720
independent thinker,
what is really right and maybe be part

1181
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,140
of the solution instead of another
person that attacks the right or the

1182
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:31,810
left Donald Trump or whoever it is that
can be attacking.

1183
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,790
And there's lots of people that are easy
to attack,

1184
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,770
but attacking doesn't change your
approve anything.

1185
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,680
So in my opinion,
we,

1186
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,560
we gave you 45 minutes.
Would anybody here mind if we went a

1187
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:42,394
little longer?

1188
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,570
Would you mind if we went a little loans
here?

1189
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,690
So let me five or six more hours,
five or six more hours.

1190
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,770
We'll bring the bar inside as well.
We'll do,

1191
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,360
uh,
so,

1192
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,710
so I want to finish what I said just for
one second.

1193
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,540
Please don't answer this person's
question,

1194
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:04,030
which was three things.
So we got through one hunger,

1195
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:04,920
okay,
let's go fast.

1196
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,830
Hunger is the number one.
I think the number two is having a

1197
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:12,520
mission larger than yourself because
it's kind of like having a child,

1198
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,413
right?
You know,

1199
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,210
having a child was a very exciting thing
and then you have a child and you go,

1200
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:18,210
what did I do?
Sometimes really,

1201
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,840
uh,
same thing with the business,

1202
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:20,674
right?
You know,

1203
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,440
you've got to really be able to have
something you're doing it for,

1204
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:24,780
that's more than you can in the early
days.

1205
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,440
The business,
it doesn't really make you any money and

1206
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,220
you work your tail off.

1207
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,170
So you need pride of ownership.
You need joy,

1208
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:31,900
you need a mission.
And I really believe until you find

1209
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,030
something that you care about more than
yourself,

1210
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,210
you'll never discover what you're
capable of because we're all doing more

1211
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:40,000
for others that we love or respect than
we'll ever do for ourselves.

1212
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:41,500
That's part of the beauty of being a
human.

1213
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,360
Most of them to do more for our kids,
for example,

1214
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:45,850
than other people.
And then I think the third thing is you

1215
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,860
got mission in hunger is you really have
to become obsessed with strategies

1216
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,760
because strategies can save you so much
time.

1217
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:56,020
The wrong strategy.
And you know,

1218
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,970
I'll get a stupid metaphor if you said
your number one goal is to see a sunset

1219
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,970
and then you start running east as fast
as you can.

1220
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,990
I don't give a shit how positive you
are.

1221
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,290
I don't care how hard you work,
I don't care how long you been putting

1222
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,670
into,
you've got the wrong strategy,

1223
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:16,660
but the right strategy in business and
in life can save you a decade.

1224
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,050
And someone else may have spent again a
decade figuring it out to trial and

1225
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,140
error and then they figured it out.
You might be a learn it in six weeks or

1226
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:26,890
six months or six days or six hours.
So I think that would be my third.

1227
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:31,390
So let me ask you a question that may be
a little off point but,

1228
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,290
but I hope helpful.
A lot of people in this room and a lot

1229
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:38,340
of people in the world want to follow
their passion.

1230
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,210
Okay.
But they've also got to put food on the

1231
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:45,870
table and pay the rent and pay the the
bills.

1232
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:51,090
How do you do both at the same time?
How do you build,

1233
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,400
follow,
have your mission,

1234
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:58,380
have your passion and do that when you
know the world is a tough place,

1235
00:50:58,381 --> 00:51:00,780
hard to make a living or to pay the
bills,

1236
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,120
places expensive.
How do you do that?

1237
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:04,140
How do you thread that needle?

1238
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,070
Well,
it depends on who you're dealing with,

1239
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:08,590
right?
If the person is entrepreneurial and

1240
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,510
they asked me this question,
I always tell them,

1241
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,550
you know,
you've got to take care of your kids.

1242
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:13,780
You've got to pay the bills.
And I said,

1243
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:15,760
but you know,
tell me when you work.

1244
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:16,481
And they tell me,
well you know,

1245
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:19,180
I work nine to five or eight to five and
I'm exhausted.

1246
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:20,560
And they also said,
well what are you doing with the other

1247
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:22,600
eight hours?
I mean cause that's what I did.

1248
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,300
I worked as a janitor all my long
millburn everything else.

1249
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,850
I could compress time there because it
was based on results,

1250
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,880
not time.
So if I could do a great job in shorter

1251
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,820
time,
I have that time.

1252
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,550
But then you know what I started doing
between,

1253
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:35,560
you know,
seven o'clock at night and two in the

1254
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:37,990
morning,
which is pretty much at the time I work.

1255
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,750
That's when I was developing myself,
getting the skills,

1256
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:41,680
learning,
educating,

1257
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,710
starting the business.
So I think people just have to realize

1258
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,640
it's gut wrenching process.
It's not an entrepreneurship is not for

1259
00:51:48,641 --> 00:51:49,890
everybody.
Most people fail.

1260
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,820
Entrepreneurship,
the vast majority fail,

1261
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,830
you know,
96% of 10 years.

1262
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,710
But what happens after 10 years?
All clear sailing after that.

1263
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Anybody Remember Lehman Brothers?
They ran a century that gross revenues

1264
00:52:02,471 --> 00:52:05,530
over a century of more than a trillion
with a t dollars.

1265
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:08,170
That's when went through their bank
accounts over that century and they're

1266
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:10,840
gone.
So I don't think it's right for every,

1267
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:14,320
but I think you have to really be clear,
is your personality the right

1268
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:16,120
personality?
If you're going to begin in this area,

1269
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,010
and then if you're going to work for
somebody else,

1270
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:20,860
you can still be company free.
But that means you've got to stop being

1271
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:24,400
a consumer and become an owner of our
under entrepreneurs.

1272
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,870
You want to own businesses,
right?

1273
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,400
Get out of just the,
you know,

1274
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:31,270
don't just own an iphone on the company
and not just apple obviously.

1275
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,240
How do you keep your energy up and your
enthusiasm up?

1276
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,150
I,
you know,

1277
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,720
I need to do it.
I'm wired for it.

1278
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,550
You know what Miss,
it's my nature to some extent.

1279
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,320
But also the other part is I get to see
results.

1280
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,390
I mean,
who here has ever been touched by my

1281
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,290
work before?
I'm curious.

1282
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,540
Anybody in this room.
So look around the room and then I just,

1283
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,260
how's it hard to be inspired when I'm in
a room?

1284
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:52,030
Then a third or 40% or 50% have used my
work.

1285
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,790
And so people come up to me every day,
dozens of people a day.

1286
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:58,660
If I'm traveling and they told me the
most amazing stories outside my children

1287
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:00,340
and my wife,
that's probably the greatest gift of my

1288
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:00,520
life.

1289
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,220
I never get tired of hearing it.
And it just makes me want to deliver

1290
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:03,941
more,
give more,

1291
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:05,740
have more impact.
You get the last word.

1292
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,260
Tell them what you want to know.
Well,

1293
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:10,810
if you're entrepreneurs out there,
here's what I'd say to you.

1294
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:13,480
I'd say,
don't be so damn hard on yourself.

1295
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,060
I know that sounds counter to being an
achiever,

1296
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,810
but when you're beating yourself up,
you're sucking out the energy and need

1297
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:22,690
to move forward.
It's kind of like I always tell people,

1298
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,820
there's so much energy and I've built
mine.

1299
00:53:24,821 --> 00:53:27,690
I do a lot of things to build my energy,
be incredibly strong and have really

1300
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:29,760
strong endurance because to me,
energy is life.

1301
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,740
If you don't have strong energy,
I could do anything.

1302
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,820
But even after we look at that energy,
it only goes so many places.

1303
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,140
So if your energy's being caught up,
if you take energy and a business and

1304
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,170
you pour it into external marketing,
going out and reaching people and adding

1305
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:45,240
value,
the business is going to grow.

1306
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,570
But if their inner conflicts in that
business between people,

1307
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,170
then the energy's being sucked in here
and less energy is going out there.

1308
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:54,810
The business is going to have problems.
That's also true of you.

1309
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,820
If you allow your disappointments to
create these inner conflicts and fears

1310
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,600
and you let them run wild within you,
they're going to suck the energy out.

1311
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:05,700
You need to go to the next level in your
business.

1312
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,440
You have to discipline your
disappointment.

1313
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:10,110
Now,
you know mine is the 92nd rule.

1314
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,450
So watch this.
Try something real fast.

1315
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,130
Look around this room.
I'm going to give you a task.

1316
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,210
Look around this room and see
everything.

1317
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,740
It's Brown.
I'm going to test you in a moment.

1318
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:17,790
Look behind you.
Look around you.

1319
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,740
Look clothing like the people at
anything that's Brown,

1320
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,611
Brown,
Brown,

1321
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,260
Brown,
Brown.

1322
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,610
Record recorded in your mind.
Close your eyes.

1323
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,510
Now with your eyes closed,
tell me everything you saw just now.

1324
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:31,590
That was red.
If you see more brown than red,

1325
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:34,320
say I open your eyes.
Look for red.

1326
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,730
Now really look for red.
Look for it.

1327
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,110
Anywhere you can find a look around.
You.

1328
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:38,750
Look beside you.
Look at front back.

1329
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,860
How many found more red this time?
Raise your hand.

1330
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:41,810
If you did say,
ah,

1331
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,980
why did you find more red this time that
you told me to seek and Ye shall find,

1332
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:49,560
but here's what's amazing.
Seek and you shall find.

1333
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,050
Even if it's not there,
I'll prove it to you.

1334
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:54,720
How many saw beige shit called it brown
just to feel successful?

1335
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,500
How many saw burgundy and called it red?
Just download pieces,

1336
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,830
so if you think you're a jerk or someone
else's,

1337
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:06,090
a jerk,
you're going to cover it.

1338
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:08,070
You're going to change it.
You're going to find the jerkiness and

1339
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,390
them.
You're going to find the jerk in you.

1340
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,810
It's really important that you manage
your mental,

1341
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,820
emotional state because you are the
business.

1342
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,910
If you are the leader,
your responsibility,

1343
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:19,200
your job,
your opportunity,

1344
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:23,460
your privilege is to be able to truly
lead and you cannot lead.

1345
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:26,790
If you're living in fear,
you cannot lead in a place of constant

1346
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,680
uncertainty.
We all have uncertainty at times,

1347
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,550
but if you watch an athlete go out to
shoot a free throw or kick her in the

1348
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:35,100
NFL to go kick the ball.
How many were seen that person?

1349
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:36,510
They're about to kick it.
They're about to shoot.

1350
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,550
You go,
they're going to miss it and you know

1351
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,180
they're going to miss it.

1352
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,430
Who's experienced this before?
How did you know?

1353
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,610
You could see in their body that they're
missing the core ingredient,

1354
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,180
absolute certainty.
You've got the great skills in the

1355
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:49,560
world,
but when you lose that certainty,

1356
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,630
the athlete goes down.
That's usually when I get the call.

1357
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:55,560
I got to rewire them and get them back
where they can execute at that level.

1358
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,200
So be kind to yourself,
as Corny as that sounds,

1359
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,380
not to be kind to yourself.
And so there's more energy available to

1360
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:04,590
solve the problems and to build the
business and the meet your mission

1361
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,540
because the time you're beating yourself
up,

1362
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,580
you're trying to prove yourself,
you really care.

1363
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:11,280
But meanwhile what you're doing is
sucking the energy out of your growth.

1364
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,770
I had somebody who,
who embezzle some money when I was a

1365
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:15,990
tiny company,
all I want to tell me this $3 million

1366
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,340
and the guy in a quarter million dollars
and I was seven and $58,000 in debt and

1367
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:21,420
thought I was in profit.

1368
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,550
And in those days,
no,

1369
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,240
every told me I have to go bankrupt.
And I remember I was just like so angry.

1370
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,880
There's so much anger because my
business was like my child,

1371
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,710
this guy tried to kill my child,
you know,

1372
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,950
so I was chasing him in Mexico so I
could beat the hell out of him,

1373
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:38,280
put him in prison.
And um,

1374
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,880
and then I realized in the middle of
this stuff,

1375
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,820
I got to let go of this because while
I'm busy being angry and pissed off,

1376
00:56:42,821 --> 00:56:45,340
the business is gonna go under.
I'm chasing birds.

1377
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,510
When we do,
when it gets to the bird,

1378
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,920
I got to focus on how to have the value.
And so take your energy.

1379
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,510
That's all you have in this life and
invested in the things you love and

1380
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:59,020
those you love and the mission of Your
Business and in your clients.

1381
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,280
If you fall in love with what you do,
who you do with and who you do it for,

1382
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,310
there'll be no limit to your impact.
But you gotta be willing to do it for

1383
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:09,490
decades because it's all bullshit.
Maybe you'll hit the lucky thing and

1384
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,860
don't happen in 12 months,
but even if you don't,

1385
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,840
even if you did,
you know,

1386
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,580
uh,
I've got a friend who's one of my

1387
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:19,670
partners in the La Aafc and so forth in
a chat and started youtube for example,

1388
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:22,630
and one point $6 billion in what,
18 months,

1389
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:23,890
24 months,
that type of thing,

1390
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,730
if not always the best thing.
Because ultimately in life,

1391
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:30,820
whenever you meet people at succeeded,
almost always we talk about the toughest

1392
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:34,120
times and laugh and remember because in
order to have the foreground,

1393
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,790
you need a background and to appreciate
the foreground,

1394
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,940
you need the background.
So I found that the most difficult times

1395
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:43,600
have been the best times because they've
made me appreciate what my life is like

1396
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:45,490
today.
And I'll be able to take care of

1397
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:46,600
yourselves.
And I hope today,

1398
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:48,400
this whole day,
all the speakers and hopefully a little

1399
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,720
of our conversation has been helpful
too.

1400
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:51,070
And I thank you for letting me address
you.

1401
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:51,940
Thank you so much.
