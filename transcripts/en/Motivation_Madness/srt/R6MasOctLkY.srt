1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,120
Let's say you're socially shoes.
Okay?

2
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,460
So what happens when you're socially
anxious?

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,270
You go to a party,
your heart's beating,

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,420
why the party is a monster.
Why?

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,000
Because it's judging you and it's
judging you.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,540
It's putting you low down the dominance
hierarchy because that's what a negative

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,060
judgment is.
And that interferes with your sexual

8
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:34,050
soul success.
And that means that you're being harshly

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,660
evaluated by nature itself,
right?

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,860
So you are confronting that the dragon
of chaos when you go into the social

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:42,630
situation.
And so what do you do?

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,370
You'd like this,
right?

13
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:46,500
You hunch over.
And that's low dominance.

14
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,670
I'm no threat.
It's like,

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,590
oh,
that's not going to get you very far,

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,630
you know?
But that's a logical thing to do in,

17
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,790
in the,
in the face of a tyrant.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,500
So I'm no threat.
You know,

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,200
you look at the king and your dad,
I'm no threat.

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm hunched over.
And then what's happening internally?

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,790
How are,
what are people thinking about me?

22
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,460
What are people thinking about me?
Or am I looking stupid?

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,750
Am I looking foolish?
Geez,

24
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,980
I'm awkward.
I hate being here,

25
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,090
man.
I'm sweating too much.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,460
It's all internalized,
right?

27
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,310
It's all self focused.
The,

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,490
the eye isn't work.
The eye isn't working.

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,100
What do you tell people?
Stop.

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,850
Don't stop thinking about yourself
because you can't,

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,100
it's like don't think of a white
elephant,

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,600
white elephant,
white elephant,

33
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:30,270
white elephant.
You can't tell someone to stop thinking

34
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,040
about something because they get caught
in the loop.

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,830
What you do with socially anxious people
as you say,

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,460
look at other people.
Look at them.

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,200
Right?
Why?

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,230
Because if you look at them,
you can tell what they're thinking and

39
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,040
then you,
you're,

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,530
unless you're,
unless you're terribly socialized and

41
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,500
some people are,
some people have no social skills and so

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,230
the reason they can't go to a party is
cause they don't even know how to

43
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,130
introduce themselves.

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,100
Like they're just,
no one ever taught them how to behave.

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,810
And so they're really good
candidates for behavior therapy cause

46
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:05,811
you walk them through the process of how
you actually manifest the procedures

47
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,370
that are associated with social
acceptability.

48
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,610
But most people aren't like that.
They have the ability.

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,310
So if they're really introverted in high
in neuroticism,

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,290
they can usually talk quite well to
someone.

51
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,790
One on one.
Why?

52
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,700
Because they look at them on,
if I look at you,

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,040
it's another thing to do.
If you're ever speaking to a group of

54
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,390
people,
never speak to the group of people that

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,600
that doesn't exist.
You talk to individuals and then they

56
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,560
reflect for you the entire group because
they're all in trained.

57
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,070
So you look at one person,
they broadcast you what everyone's

58
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,350
thinking and you know how to talk to one
person.

59
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,450
So it's easy.
So as soon as you focus on the person,

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,540
not you push your attention outward,
use your,

61
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,300
I push your attention outward and you
start watching.

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,020
Well then all your automatic mechanisms
kick in and you start being awkward.

63
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,510
Cause if we're talking and I'm looking
here,

64
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,040
I don't know what you're gonna do next
and I'm going to put disjunctions into

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,190
the like,
they're like a bad chords and the melody

66
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,110
of our,
of our conversation.

67
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,630
And the reason is I'm not paying
attention.

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,750
So that's why the I is the thing at the
top of the pyramid.

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,710
It's like the thing that enables you to
win the set of all possible dominance

70
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,280
hierarchies is the I pay attention.
Pay Attention.

71
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,640
That's the critical issue.
That's why the Egyptians worshiped

72
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,100
horace.
That's why horace was the thing that

73
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,661
rescued.
Oh,

74
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,570
Cyrus.
From the,

75
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,300
from the depths.
It's the capacity to pay attention.

76
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
What do you pay attention to most?
What?

77
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,610
Your right hemisphere signals as
anomalous.

78
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,060
It attracts your attention.
It's like this isn't going quite right.

79
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,550
I'm not looking at that wrong.
That's what you look at.

80
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,190
That's what you look at.
What's not going right,

81
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,650
because that's,
see that's the terrible monster that

82
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,110
might eat you,
but it's also the place you get all the

83
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,500
information.
So that's why it's useful to have

84
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:00,730
discussions with your enemies because
they will tell you things you do not

85
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:03,160
know.
And that's such a great thing because if

86
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,410
you don't know them well,
you're not very smart,

87
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,610
are you?
You know,

88
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,300
there may be a time when you go
somewhere this,

89
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,890
that's the thing you need to know and
maybe your enemy will tell you why

90
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,490
you're such a fool,
you know,

91
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:15,430
on a bunch of other things that aren't
true too.

92
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,820
But even one thing that's accurate,
it's like,

93
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,020
yeah,
thanks very much man.

94
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:23,260
Maybe I'll do some work on that and I
won't have to carry that forward.

95
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,020
So,
and then that's part of the reason again

96
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,200
why the terrible predator.
It's always the terrible Predator that

97
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,420
has the gold.
It's like it's the person who delivers

98
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,270
the message you do not want to hear.
So it's rough,

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,490
it's rough,
but it doesn't matter.

100
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,720
Life is rough

101
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,290
to move forward,
you know?

102
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,410
I mean I've dealt with lots of people
who have anxiety disorders,

103
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,660
you know?
And one thing about people who have

104
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,360
anxiety disorders is they are not
mysterious to me.

105
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,680
I understand.
It's no problem for me to understand why

106
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:55,490
people have anxiety disorders or why
they're depressed or why they have

107
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:59,120
substance use problems.
The mystery to me is always why people

108
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:03,470
don't have all of those things at once.
Because everybody has a reason to be

109
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:04,370
anxious.
In fact,

110
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,520
we have the ultimate reason to be
anxious because we know that we're

111
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,440
vulnerable and we know that we're going
to die.

112
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,700
And how you can not be anxious under
those circumstances is a great mystery.

113
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,330
It's a massive mystery.
And that same thing applies with regards

114
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,240
to depression.
And then the same thing applies to some

115
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,310
degree with regards to drug and alcohol
abuse.

116
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,460
As I said last week,
there's plenty of reasons to drown your

117
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,500
consciousness and alcohol,
that's for sure.

118
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,160
We could refer to the aforementioned
anxiety and depression not least.

119
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,820
And so,
and the and the sorts of drugs that

120
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:38,750
people are prone to take our chemicals
that take the aspect of edge off the

121
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,420
tragedy of life.
So,

122
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,610
so
back to back to the issue of,

123
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:51,611
of of fear being Abraham is self
conscious if that's what this commentary

124
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,930
says.
But the thing is as he moves forward,

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,860
despite that he's self conscious and he
knows the danger but he moves despite

126
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,170
that.
And that's actually the appropriate

127
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:05,171
response in the face of actual non naive
understanding of what constitutes life.

128
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,890
Like if you're naive and you move
forward,

129
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,371
it's like,
well,

130
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,890
what the hell do you even know?
You know,

131
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,550
there's no courage in naivety because
you don't know what there is to stop

132
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:13,760
you.

133
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
You don't know what dangers you might
apprehend,

134
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,700
but to be aware of what it is that your
problem is.

135
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,070
So to be alert existentially,
let's say,

136
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,400
or to be fully self conscious means that
you're perfectly aware of your

137
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,210
limitations and how you might be hurt
and then to make the decision to move

138
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:31,430
forward into the unknown in the land of
the stranger.

139
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,630
Anyways,
that's the,

140
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,710
I would say that's one of the secrets to
a good life and I can say that really

141
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,350
without fear of contradiction.
I would,

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
I would say because the clinical
literature on this is very,

143
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,790
very,
very clear.

144
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,690
What you do with people who are afraid
and to some degree depressed,

145
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,370
but certainly anxious,
is you lay out what,

146
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,030
what they're anxious about first of all,
in in detail,

147
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,310
what is it that you're afraid of,
what might happen?

148
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,030
And then you decompose it into small
problems,

149
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,070
hypothetically manageable problems.

150
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,760
And then you have the person expose
themselves to the thing that they're

151
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,310
afraid of.
And what happens isn't that they get

152
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,620
less afraid.
That isn't what the clinical literature

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,210
indicates.
Exactly.

154
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,140
What happens instead is they get braver
and that's not the same thing,

155
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,550
right?
Cause if you get less afraid,

156
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,650
it's like,
well the world isn't as dangerous as I

157
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,580
thought it was.
You know,

158
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,530
silly me.
If you get braver,

159
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,150
that's not what happens.
What happens is,

160
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,800
yeah,
the World Damn worlds just as dangerous

161
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,560
as I thought.
Or maybe it's even more dangerous than I

162
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:29,600
thought,
but it turns out that there's something

163
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:34,010
in me that responds to taking that on as
a voluntary challenge and grows and

164
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,890
thrives as a consequence.
And there's no doubt about this.

165
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,550
Even the psychophysiological findings
are quite clear if you,

166
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,950
if you can,
if you impose a stressor on two groups

167
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:50,750
of people and on one group the stressor
is imposed involuntarily and on the

168
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,930
other group the stressor is picked up
voluntarily.

169
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,620
The people who pick up the stressor,
voluntary voluntarily use a whole

170
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,200
different psychophysiological system to
deal with it.

171
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,130
They use the system that's associated
with approach and challenge and not the

172
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:08,630
system that's a pro associated with
defensive aggression and withdrawal and

173
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,200
the system that is associated with
challenge is much more associated with

174
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,620
positive emotion and much less
associated with negative emotion.

175
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,540
It's also much less hard on you because
the defensive posturing system,

176
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,210
the prey animal system,
man would not thing kicks in.

177
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,250
It's all systems are go for you.
You know,

178
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,090
you're,
the gas is pushed down to the or the

179
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,290
pedal is pushed down to the metal and
the brakes are on.

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,280
You're using future resources that you
could be storing for future time right

181
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,650
now in the present to ready yourself for
emergency.

182
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,020
So there's,
there's,

183
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,040
there's nothing simple or trivial at all
about the idea of being called to move

184
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,550
forthrightly forward into the strange
and the unknown.

185
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,280
And there's real adventure that's
associated with that.

186
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,170
Right?
So that's an exciting thing,

187
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,010
which is part of the reason why people
travel and then also to see yourself as

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,310
the sort of creature that can do that is
willing to do that on a habitual basis

189
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,490
is also the right kind of tonic for,
I hate this word for your self esteem,

190
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,230
you know,
because the self esteem has nothing to

191
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,120
do with feeling good about yourself.
As a,

192
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,540
as I already mentioned,
there isn't necessarily a reason why a

193
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,400
priority,
you should just feel good about

194
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,520
yourself.
But if you can view yourself acting in a

195
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:21,000
courageous and forthright manner and
encountering the world and trying to

196
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,980
improve your lot and,
and,

197
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,720
and taking risks,
you know,

198
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,210
in a non naive way,
well then you have something that you

199
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:31,200
can comfort yourself with at night when
you're wondering what the whole damn

200
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,470
point of,
of your few tiled and miserable life.

201
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,490
And so,
and that's necessary because it's often

202
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,440
the case that you wake up at four in the
morning,

203
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,410
or at least sometimes the case that you
wake up at four in the morning when

204
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,950
things haven't been going that well and
wonder just what the hell the point is

205
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:51,000
of your few and miserable life,
you have to have something real to set

206
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,790
against that.
It can't be just rationalizations about

207
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,670
how you're a valuable person among
others,

208
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,770
even though that's true,
that's not good enough.

209
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,360
You need something that's more realistic
to set against that and observing

210
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,480
courage in yourself is definitely one of
the things that that that could help you

211
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,940
sleep soundly at night when,
when things are destabilized a little

212
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,770
bit around you.
So.
