1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,580
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people use their work,

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,440
their business,
their profession,

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,620
their success.
A lot of people use their pursuit of

4
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,900
education.
They're professional students.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,080
You've been in college for 30 years and
you just keep taking more and more

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,340
classes and courses and more and more
and more things.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,860
Or you work overtime under time,
side of the time,

8
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,770
around the time.
A lot of people are church addicts.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,710
Every time it turns open,
you're not just a member of the church

10
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,860
who don't just come to Bible class.
You're in the choir and the usher board

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,580
and the praise team and the willing to
fried chicken committee and the this and

12
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,530
the that and the other,
and let me tell you something.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,100
If you succeed in every area of your
life,

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,560
if you succeed,
you got the best help.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,750
You're in the best safe,
you're the best looking.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,030
You have the most formidable
personality.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,760
You're successful,
you're financially secure,

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,220
you're respected every time you woke up
down the street.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,340
If you succeed everywhere else and fail
to have peace and joy and love in your

20
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,060
home,
what does it profit you to have all of

21
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,120
this stuff allow outside and have no
place?

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,010
Yeah,

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,350
to lay your head,
to rest your mind,

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,090
to know that this is solid and this
won't shake and this won't bring it is

25
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:23,190
very,
very important to you.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,940
Fucks us.
Whenever they sense danger or trouble or

27
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,900
become a weary,
they always go running into their holes.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,290
That is a safe place.
That's a secure place.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,990
He's grounded there.
Whatever's going to come,

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,290
I'm going to deal with it because I'm in
a place of grounding.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
You understand what I'm saying?
Birds of the air have nests.

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,520
They say,
I know there's a lot of things that one

33
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,340
of the environment I want to get me,
but if I could make it to this nest,

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,960
I could get in this place where it is
difficult to get me if my nes is solid,

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,110
if it's secure and I had the bill list
mess,

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,970
I had to work on this nes.
So all of you who say you don't

37
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:05,730
understand my situation,
you don't understand my house,

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,380
you don't understand what I've been
through.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,420
You don't understand my circumstances.
No,

40
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,190
you don't understand that nes must be
built from broken branches.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,780
If you can build a whole mess from
broken branches,

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,140
you can reel a whole house with broken
people,

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,180
but it's gotta be built.
The problem today is we want prefab

44
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:36,181
houses.
It's easier to go get somebody else's

45
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:41,260
husband
then it is to develop.

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,260
See,
nobody wants to do the work of building

47
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,750
the kid.
They want to scream at the child,

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,110
they want to beat the child,
they want to yell at the child,

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
but the child has learned a lot of that
behavior from what was a model in front

50
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,840
of them and you have to get down all the
ground level wherever they are.

51
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,390
Even if it's a juvenile detention
center,

52
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,510
you got to go where they are and start
building that child block by block by

53
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,190
block.
Wild people were talking about you.

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,810
Well they're criticizing you while
they're saying,

55
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,550
where's your garb?
I thought you were a Christian.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,020
You don't have time to worry about what
people think over outside because his

57
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,830
family thing is too important to,
for me to be yelling back at my

58
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,590
neighbors.
I'm trying to build something out of

59
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,710
these broken pieces that God has given
me.

60
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,750
Oh,
glory to God,

61
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:44,751
where my parents said,
what good is it to build a house?

62
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,760
If you lose the trial,
build the child.

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,960
The child will outlast the house bill,
the child,

64
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,130
the child will take care of you when
you're all bill the trial.

65
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,950
I'm over broken.
I know the crazy.

66
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm only got them new beers.
I know the question.

67
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,440
Now I know you feel like luck big,
big,

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,520
but when you get to feeling like,
man,

69
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,730
get down on the floor and start building
them because you can have a mess if you

70
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,750
can't work with broken branches,
broken husbands,

71
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,560
broken wives,
everything in your house has cracked

72
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:27,561
somewhere,
everything crack somewhere.

73
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,920
Look around this room right now.
Look around this room.

74
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,090
Look at how handsome,
good looking and attract.

75
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,010
These people are in this room.
Both they look good,

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,770
dressed up,
got her hair done.

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,490
Look at the males.
Males all shined up pointing that you

78
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,250
had math nights.
Smeal like a Rhoda did from

79
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,620
just wonderful glory to God in that
wonderful just to him,

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,750
everything you'll see it's cracked
somewhere

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,720
and the only reason you don't know it is
because you haven't got close enough to

82
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:05,710
see where the cracks are.
These three areas,

83
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,560
Bill,
that puts you broken down.

84
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,440
You got to have economic support.
You've got a heavy Kebab and support.

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,740
I know you all think that once you're a
Christian,

86
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,840
all you have to do speak in tongues of
weight on Jesus.

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,620
The Jesus bus is going to come get you
and take you to be with Jesus,

88
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,860
but while you're waiting at the bus,
you're going to get hungry.

89
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,690
When I got rid of talk to my wife about
life insurance,

90
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,830
she said,
I don't want to talk about it.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,310
Okay,
I don't even want to talk about it.

92
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,110
I don't want him up discuss it with you,
but that's all here.

93
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,220
We're going to have to discuss about
this.

94
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,590
She said,
I'm going to leave you.

95
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,830
I'll leave it too cause I ain't gonna
care.

96
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,910
I'm going to be crazy.
I said,

97
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,280
you're going to be crying and you're
going to be hauling and you're going to

98
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,110
be screaming,
but you will have to go to the bathroom

99
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,450
so you will need toilet paper.
You won't get thirsty.

100
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,550
So he couldn't leave water.
She didn't leave.

101
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,380
He will get hungry.
So you've got to meet food and if we

102
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,180
don't have no gas or you're not going to
be a bleed,

103
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,770
I have never seen anybody so brief,
but they didn't go to the bathroom and

104
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,220
eat and live and breathe and it's going
to bring you back to reality.

105
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,060
You need stuff.
You need stuff.

106
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,260
You can't pray it away.
Your need for stuff.

107
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,730
You come up,
put spiritual solutions over practical

108
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,564
mean,

109
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,613
okay.

110
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,460
You cannot fix a physical problem with a
spiritual solution.

111
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,610
Sisters,
more Jesus say they'll make you more

112
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:37,310
wife.
I want to go to a text.

113
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,090
They're having a discussion and the
texts about if you get first timothy

114
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,800
five seven if any,
provide not for his own house,

115
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,280
for his own,
and especially for those of his own

116
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,640
house.
He has denied the faith.

117
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,370
He has been not faith.
If you don't take care of what yours,

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,360
you have the
faith

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,610
and is worse been then bill.

120
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,290
Yeah.

121
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,290
When you look up the word infidel,
you will find that it means unbeliever.

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,570
Okay?

123
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,070
But if you dig deeper,
you will find it is not just an

124
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:27,760
unbeliever who could have never been
exposed to the gospel.

125
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,270
If somebody who's been exposed to it and
rejected it

126
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,530
my best.
Thank you.

127
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,800
Somebody who's been exposed to it and
rejected it is called an infidel.

128
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
You'll notice in the conflict with isis
and terrorists,

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,890
they refer to us as infidels because the
purest form of the word infidel,

130
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,320
it's a to have rejected the truth.

131
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,360
Okay?

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,410
In the Bible,
women call somebody and infidel it is

133
00:07:56,411 --> 00:08:00,010
that you had an opportunity and rejected
it.

134
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah.

135
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,820
And the text is talking about taking
care of widows.

136
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,880
And it says,
if the widow has a family,

137
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,510
if they don't take care of their own
mama and Grandmama opti big Mama,

138
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,630
my beer,
you are worse than an infidel.

139
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,780
Worse than an infidel.
If you don't take care of your own,

140
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,720
you were Berge take care of the old
monkeys.

141
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,790
Take care of the all frogs.
Take care of the whole,

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,180
and you will walk this role like you
don't know and say,

143
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,160
you love Jesus.
I'm really sees him.

144
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,090
Holy goof friend chicken and make up
some chicken noodle soup.

145
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,980
Then I would,
but I'm a prophet.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,950
Test.
You're better profit.

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,540
Clean this house and go home and see
about Mama.

148
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,860
The Bible says you all wore spam and
bill.

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,860
Take care of your own house.
If you're able to.

150
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,180
Some people aren't they?
You don't have,

151
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,030
you can't do it,
but to some degree you do something.

152
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:07,080
You sweep.
Watch this,

153
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,680
and infidel is somebody who had an
opportunity to receive truth and

154
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,030
rejected it.
An infant of the Bible says you are

155
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,150
worse than an infidel if you don't
provide for your house.

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,710
All right.
God said you had the opportunity to make

157
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:30,600
that house work,
but you starved it.

158
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,710
You're worse than an infidel because you
were exposed to something that you

159
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,960
rejected though you stayed in the house.

160
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,600
Infidel.
Somebody say infidel.

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
Ooh,
infidelity.

162
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,300
Root word.
Infidel

163
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,010
primary meaning you rejected an
opportunity.

164
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,770
You know how you would judge it an
opportunity because you felt like you

165
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,620
were rejected.
You know why you felt like you were

166
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,720
rejected because she didn't get the
signal.

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
How do you break the infidel?
Infidelity.

168
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,970
When we start having real conversations
about expectations and responsibilities

169
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,570
mutually and you live up to yours and I
live up to my,

170
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,680
then there's not abandonment.
And if we're not abandoned then we don't

171
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:39,831
have to fake like we love each other,
which creates resentment because love is

172
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,690
hard to be fate.

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,840
So I will stop paying you money to let
me go live.

174
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,820
I will start investing because I will no
longer define myself by dollars

175
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,410
to the Potter's house.
He was so,

176
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,050
so a lot of times we give you stuff to
replace us.

177
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,140
You don't want to feel in this room.
Let me some tea when I fill in his room,

178
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,770
I feel in this room than there are a lot
of people in this room who have

179
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,771
abandoned kids cause he hurts you
parents cause they disappointed you

180
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,090
spouses because he didn't get the
signal.

181
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,230
I feel in this room a lot of people who
are still there but not there,

182
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,060
and so you live in your life like it's
golden.

183
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,570
Did might be golden,
but it's not grounded.

184
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,453
Yeah,

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
not grounded can blow away.
You can blow away and it's expensive to

186
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:16,100
lose it emotionally.
Mentally,

187
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,770
it's expensive.
Generationally.

188
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,710
I'm not saying you can't survive it.
I'm not saying you can't make it on

189
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:23,210
here.
I ain't got not saying you can't do it.

190
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,710
I'm not saying you can't pay your own
bills.

191
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,090
I'm not saying you can take care of
yourself.

192
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,520
You can do it,
but there will be a deduction.

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Yes.
Once I start showing them miracles,

194
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,780
they're going to be drawn to my season
of miracles.

195
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,720
People are drawn to your season of
miracles.

196
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,970
Love your season of miracles.
You can make it happen.

197
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,840
Love your season of miracles.
You did,

198
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,920
Jill thing on the football fields.
Love you'll season of miracles.

199
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,690
People are drawn to your season of
miracles when you were in their heyday,

200
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,080
when did door and the old people love
you.

201
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Phase of every car
always calls my hearing.

202
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,110
You didn't believe you were dumb to you,
heard you though you didn't believe you

203
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,480
could learn to your heard.
Somebody say you couldn't learn.

204
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,440
You didn't believe you want to a them to
your heard somebody say

205
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,570
your unbelief is the result of something
you heard about yourself,

206
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,380
that you believed about yourself and
your life has fulfilled the prophecy you

207
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:04,191
heard about yourself.
He'll crazy lakin daddy.

208
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,720
You had jess slack,
your mammy.

209
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,620
All of these are persists.
They may not be cussing,

210
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,640
but their curses that were pronounced
over you that said you couldn't do this

211
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,990
or that or the other and the more you
heard it and rehearsed it and even

212
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:35,010
argued about it and said you didn't
believe it,

213
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,930
every time you face a challenge,
tell me the truth.

214
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,830
Don't those voices come back up?
Every time you hit a low place,

215
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,120
those voices come back up again.
Every time things go wrong,

216
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,820
don't those voices come back?
You have never changed your belief and

217
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:10,541
you will never completely heal or hole
and to you change the voice inside of

218
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,650
your own head.

219
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
No body,
no body.

220
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,300
Ken Do this,
but you

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,800
new friends can't do it.
New Clothes can't do it more.

222
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,290
Mommy can't do it.
More women can't do it.

223
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,220
More sex can't do it.
They can camouflage it,

224
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,400
but the kid kill it because you are
snared by the words of your mouth.

225
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,460
You can't get him up.
People that tell you your privilege when

226
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:59,090
you think you're ugly,
that's why you keep needing some more

227
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,720
until you change the words that are in
your head.

228
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,170
Your opportunities will continue to
hemorrhage.

229
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,550
Like the woman with the issue of blood.
Her issues were killing her

230
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,750
12 years.
Her issues were chewing her 12 years.

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,090
The life's blood was hemorrhaging out of
her.

232
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,460
It was coming out of the lower
extremities,

233
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,430
but it was coming from her mouth.
Oh No.

234
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,310
The judge that
it is coming out of her lower

235
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,840
extremities,
but it is coming from her mouth.

236
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,910
Can you prove it?
Yes.

237
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,110
Okay.
What?

238
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,130
Heal her.
Good luck.

239
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,580
Calm football,
Lord.

240
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,630
It's treatment
came out of her mouth when she's sad.

241
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,150
Too Harsh.
See,

242
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm till she met Jesus.
Oh,

243
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,030
she believed her mom herself was that
I'm dying.

244
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,490
I'm dying.
I'm dying.

245
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm dying here.
And so her mommy died because she was

246
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,320
dying.
Hold on.

247
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,370
Relationships died because she was
dying.

248
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,460
Her heart was broken because she was
bad.

249
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,580
She couldn't have relationships.
She was dying.

250
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,180
She has spent all of her money because
she was dying.

251
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Hey,
told,

252
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,000
it's how many but touch the hem of his
garment.

253
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,020
She didn't say it to anybody.
What she said to herself,

254
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,640
no,
didn't you read it in the original

255
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,710
language?
What is this?

256
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,500
She said to herself,
it says,

257
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:44,501
she said repeatedly to herself over and
over and over again.

258
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,460
Because when you're trying to drive out
stinken Benjamin,

259
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,440
you don't have to say it.
Oh,

260
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,170
and all that.
I'm a Hilton,

261
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,500
everybody.
So she says,

262
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,040
that's what I'm going to touch,
the hem of his garment.

263
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,650
I'll be made whole.
She took them over to a real family,

264
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,460
but touch the hem of his garment.
I'll be made in a hole.

265
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,920
So to even touch the hem of his garment,
I'll be made whole.

266
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:31,800
It's how many,
but touch the hem of his garment,

267
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,670
I'll be made,
but touch the hem of his garment,

268
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,650
touch the hem of his Karma.
That will be,

269
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,010
if I may,
but touch,

270
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,780
hi.
Hello?

271
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,430
Hello?
Are you all crisis?

272
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,170
Okay.
