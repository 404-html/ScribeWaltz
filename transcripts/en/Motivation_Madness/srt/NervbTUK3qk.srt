1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
Oh,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,680
truth of the matter is that most people
don't realize that the majority of

3
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:17,681
people or suffer the first major heart
attack on Monday morning between 8:00 AM

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,520
and 9:00 AM,
people getting ready to go to jobs that

5
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:25,910
they don't lie,
jobs that are making them sick.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,890
What is it that you could love doing
seven days a week that will bring a

7
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,490
smile to your face?
You've got to start saying yes to your

8
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:37,070
life.
You've got to start saying yes to your

9
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:40,010
dreams.
Yes to your unfolding future.

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,070
Yes to your potential.
You know,

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,570
every year I used to say,
this is my year,

12
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,450
but ladies and gentlemen,
one good year won't be enough for me.

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,580
How many of you could use a good decade?
Raise your hands,

14
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,560
bleed.
Fantastic.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,390
All right.
Now here's what I want to do.

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:59,160
I want to share with you how you can
begin to make this your decade.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,670
How many of you know within yourself,
if you ask yourself the question,

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,140
have I done all that I am capable of
doing or being in living up to my

19
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,630
potential?
How many of you have to really add,

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,800
enter?
No,

21
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,960
I have not done all that I can do.
Raise your hands please.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,340
Okay,
very good.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,210
Now,
here's what we know that people don't do

24
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,030
what they know in life,
but what they do is they operate within

25
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:24,420
the context of the vision they have of
themselves.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,170
So what I want to share with you is how
to begin to get a larger vision of

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,040
yourself and how to begin to make this
your decade.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,860
Because in order to do that,
it's going to be very challenging.

29
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,950
It's going to require a lot of work on
your part,

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,430
an ongoing process of personal and
professional self mastery,

31
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,720
and it's going to require that you began
to see yourself worthy of the

32
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,540
requirements in terms of effort,
in terms of commitment,

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,780
in terms of action,
in terms of preparation or whatever it

34
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,530
is that you need to do in order to take
your life where you want to take it.

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,920
So one of the first things I asked you
to do is I want you to look at your life

36
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,040
right now and think about something
that's important to you.

37
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,380
Something that gives your life a sense
of value.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,980
Think about something that you'd like to
have or something that you'd like to

39
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,770
create for you or your family or for
society.

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,930
Once you hold this thought in mind,
now,

41
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,540
one of the first things I want you to do
is don't worry about the inner

42
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,080
conversation that you're going to have.
Don't worry about how you're going to do

43
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,670
it.
That's going to come.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,170
You're going to develop a plan of
action.

45
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:25,710
You will find the way you will become
the kind of person that can attract the

46
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,680
people,
the resources and everything you need in

47
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,670
order to make that become reality.
But I want you to be mindful of your

48
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,340
inner conversation.
I remember once I was sitting in an

49
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,520
audience and Zig Ziglar who I consider
one of the greatest motivational

50
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,610
speakers on the planet.
He was giving a speech and I was out in

51
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,370
the audience and I saw him going back
and forth and within myself.

52
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,020
I said,
I'd like to do that.

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,750
I can do that.
And I leaned over to the guy next to me.

54
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,280
I said,
how much do they pay him to do that?

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,780
And he said,
$5,000.

56
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,010
I said,
I know I can do that.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,070
And I admired him.
And then on the way when I was driving

58
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,650
from Tampa,
Florida back to Miami for my inner

59
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,380
conversation kicked in and it said,
Les Brown,

60
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,600
you can't do that.
You don't have a college education.

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,340
Les Brown,
you can't do that.

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,440
You don't have the money.
You don't have the contacts.

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,300
You've never worked for a major
corporation.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,720
What makes you think that you can make
more in one hour talking then you've

65
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,660
made working for a whole month.
I want to ask you a question.

66
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,730
How many of you ever thought about
something you wanted to do and you talk

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,290
you out of it?
Raise your hand please.

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,590
That inner conversation,
Ladies and gentlemen,

69
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,980
is the reason that most people take
their greatness,

70
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,800
take their ideas to the graveyard with
them.

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,710
You know,
the wealthiest place on the planet of

72
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,750
minister said recently,
it was so true.

73
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,480
It's not the gold mines and the various
areas of the world or the diamond mines.

74
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,320
The wealthiest place on the planet is
the graveyard.

75
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,580
Because in the graveyard we will find
inventions that we never,

76
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,160
ever were exposed to,
ideas,

77
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,190
dreams that never became reality,
hopes and aspirations that were never

78
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:07,561
acted upon because most people allow
that inner conversation for whatever

79
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,750
reason,
the keep them from ever pursuing their

80
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,210
goals.
So let us begin to look at what's

81
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,850
required in order to to make this our
decade.

82
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,020
Why is it that most people don't ever
reach their goals or live up to their

83
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,210
true potential?
One is fear

84
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,270
and there are only two kinds of fears
that we're born with the fear of falling

85
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,050
and the fear of a loud sound.
All of the fears we learn like the fear

86
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,410
of failure.
The next is the fear of success.

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,080
As one of the major challenges I had to
deal with,

88
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,880
I was working on a major project and
after it began to grow and it was

89
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,710
extremely successful,
I panicked and I walked away from and

90
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:55,390
then gave it to someone else because I
didn't believe that I could handle it.

91
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,040
The other thing that keeps most people
from reaching their goals so that a lot

92
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,540
of people become comfortable,

93
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,350
they stop growing,
they stop wanting anything,

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,360
they become satisfied,
they stop looking at ways in which they

95
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,790
can improve themselves.
They stopped putting things in front of

96
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,220
them.
I was reading something by a great man,

97
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:20,820
George Bernard Shaw,
and he said something to the effect that

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,900
to have succeeded as to have finished
ones business on earth,

99
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,290
like the male spider who was killed by
the female spider.

100
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,830
The moment he has succeeded in his
courtship and he's.

101
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,831
It goes on to say I like a state of
continual becoming with a goal in front

102
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,740
and not behind.
I remember after giving a speech at a

103
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,720
major corporation,
a gentleman came up to me,

104
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,850
he was up in years and he said,
you know,

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,490
that's real great motivation for you
young guys,

106
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,970
but I've done all my work is nothing
else for me to do.

107
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,530
I said,
Oh yes,

108
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,570
you've got a lot to give.

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,090
You have a lot to offer.
The fact that still here means that your

110
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:03,020
business is not through yet.
The other thing that keeps us from

111
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:08,021
reaching our goal is not feeling worthy.
That's where a lot of people get stuck

112
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,070
because see,
when you don't feel worthy of your goal,

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,760
you will begin to unconsciously engage
in self destructive behavior like

114
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,160
procrastinating,
constantly putting things off,

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,730
squandering your time and that's what
life is made up.

116
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,250
Something else that keeps us from
reaching our goal and that is many times

117
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:36,251
because we spend so much time
complaining and blaming everybody or

118
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,400
everything.
I'm reminded of a friend of mine who

119
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,820
talked about the fact that one day he
was walking by this house and some

120
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,540
people sitting on a porch and that was a
dog on the porch and this dog was just

121
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,990
moaning and groaning,
so he was curious and he asked the

122
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,600
honest said,
why is this dog moaning and groaning and

123
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,000
the owners that because he's laying on a
nail,

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,211
he said,
well,

125
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,750
why doesn't he get all his is not
hurting bad enough for him to get off?

126
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,630
How many of you know people will moan
and Groan and complain about life all

127
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,620
the time?
Alright.

128
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,680
They might Moan and Groan about that
job.

129
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,890
I'm sick of this job.
I'm sick of you,

130
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,760
and they just Moan and Groan and
complain all the time and never do

131
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:24,950
anything about it.
They haven't gotten to the point where

132
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,930
they're sick and tired of being sick and
tired.

133
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,730
They just have enough energy to complain
about it and they consider that they in

134
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,340
fact,
they believe that that's equivalent to

135
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,770
doing something about it.
Just complaining.

136
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,070
No,
that can get you where you want to go.

137
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,660
That cannot create your reality for you.
The other thing that keep most people

138
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:49,190
from realizing their true greatness and
their true potential circumstances,

139
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,090
their environment.
There are many people who believe

140
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:57,380
because of where they're born because of
the area where they are in life and

141
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,580
where they find themselves.

142
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,640
That's all they know.
Given my circumstances,

143
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,160
ladies and gentlemen,
I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing

144
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,360
right now.
See,

145
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:09,620
I know something about you even not
knowing you that you've got greatness

146
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,470
within you.
You have the ability to do things that

147
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:17,240
you can't even begin to imagine.
You have talents and skills in you that

148
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,110
you haven't even began to reach for yet?
No one could have convinced me,

149
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,810
given my circumstances,
given my background,

150
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,520
that I would be doing what I'm doing
right now.

151
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,790
I was born in Liberty City on the floor
and 62nd street,

152
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,300
my twin brother and me,
when we were six weeks of age,

153
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,520
we were adopted.
When I was in fifth grade,

154
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:37,100
I was identified as Emr labeled
educable,

155
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,940
mentally retarded and put back from the
fifth grade into the fourth grade and

156
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,310
stayed in that category until I got out
of high school.

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,580
I have no college training,
but here's what happened.

158
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,620
I had an intervention in my life,
a man who saw something in me at a time

159
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:55,560
that I did not see something in myself.
I never forget being in his one day

160
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:59,250
waiting on a friend of mine who was
there to rehearse for play.

161
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,240
He did not show up and he asked me to go
up to the board and write something on

162
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,130
the board and I said,
I can't do that,

163
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:05,791
sir.
He said,

164
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,090
why not?
I said,

165
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,123
well,
I'm.

166
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm in a special education class.
He said,

167
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,150
what do you mean?
I said,

168
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,340
go up to the board and write what I'm
about to tell you.

169
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,300
I said,
I can't do that,

170
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:20,301
so why not educable mentally retarded,
and he came from behind his desk.

171
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,010
He said,
don't ever say that again.

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,180
Someone's opinion of you does not have
to become your reality,

173
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,760
and that changed my life.

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,690
It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who said
that once a person's mind is expanded

175
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,160
with an idea or concept,
it can never be satisfied to going back

176
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,710
to where it was.
So some of you are going to experience a

177
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:42,840
breakthrough.
Some of you are going to go back and

178
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,020
look at your dreams and brush them off.
Some of you are going to begin to look

179
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,950
at yourself and say,
Hey,

180
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,440
look here.
I know I have not done all that I can do

181
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,920
whatever goal that you have in mind.
I want that to be a goal that will

182
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,770
challenge you.
Something that will make you stretch.

183
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,470
It was osborne who said,
unless you attempt to do something

184
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,660
beyond that which you've already
mastered,

185
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:03,960
you will never grow.
What is it that you looked at at some

186
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,060
point in time when you decided that you
couldn't do it,

187
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,800
that you talk yourself out of it?

188
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,020
Whatever it is,
bring it back out there,

189
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,070
how you going to do it that will come to
you in due time so you don't get in life

190
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,270
what you want.
Ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,210
you get in life what you are not what
you want,

192
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,170
and see the good news is that we can
always become more by working to develop

193
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,620
ourselves.
So the first process of making this your

194
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,110
decade,
you've got to begin to take a look at

195
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,120
your life and look at where are you
right now?

196
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,000
What are your strengths?
What are your weaknesses?

197
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,430
What gives your life a sense of
fulfillment,

198
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:39,840
a sense of joy?
What does a full rich life means to you?

199
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,520
What is it that you could love doing
seven days a week that are bringing a

200
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:49,521
smile to your face?
Think about that and all the areas of

201
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,110
your life,
your professional life,

202
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,120
your personal life,
your family life,

203
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,390
your spiritual life.
What is it that you'd like to have?

204
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,930
Once you begin to determine that,
that takes you to the next step,

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
and that is once you decide what it is
that you want,

206
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,220
now you've got to decide that you
deserve that.

207
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,210
Repeat after me,
please.

208
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
I deserve the best that life has to
offer.

209
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,030
I deserve.
Define my purpose in life.

210
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,570
Shake somebody's hand on your right and
left and say,

211
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:25,404
fine,
you're perfect.

212
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,400
Do you know by actively pursuing your
purpose,

213
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,510
it could perhaps extend your life,
the number one killer in this country of

214
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:46,920
all the diseases we have,
heart disease,

215
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,700
that's the number one killer,
and if you asked most people what is it

216
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,920
that that the majority of people have
their first harm tag.

217
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Some people will tell you as a result of
obesity or smoking cigarettes or high

218
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:03,400
cholesterol or high blood pressure,
and all of those are contributing

219
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,080
factors.
However,

220
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,610
the truth of the matter is that most
people don't realize that the majority

221
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:14,611
of people suffer the first major heart
attack on Monday morning between 8:00 AM

222
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,570
and 9:00 AM.
People getting ready to go to jobs that

223
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,050
they don't like,
jobs that are making them sick.

224
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,360
You see,
when you're not pursuing your goal,

225
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:28,480
you are literally committing spiritual
suicide.

226
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,530
When you have some goal out here that
you're stretching for and reaching for,

227
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,550
that takes you out of your comfort zone.
You'll find out some talents and

228
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,070
abilities you have that you didn't know
you have.

229
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,340
I started speaking just to elementary
school kids because I knew they didn't

230
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:49,531
know what I was talking about and they
gave me all God is that we lack Yo.

231
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,410
Yeah.
Then I graduated up to junior high

232
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,500
school and then the senior high school
and then to various community groups and

233
00:12:56,501 --> 00:13:01,010
church groups and civic associations and
then the colleges and to businesses non

234
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,940
traveling across the country and then
traveling nationally and

235
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:07,510
internationally,
but I never would have discovered what

236
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:12,340
I'm able to do right now if I wasn't
willing to take a track chance and

237
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,130
you've got to be willing to do that.
You've got to believe in yourself.

238
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,750
I was doing work for a major corporation
and they were having a major downsizing

239
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,960
because that's another terminology for
major fairings and so the people that

240
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,910
were working there,
they approached them and said,

241
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:31,210
listen,
you are eligible for early retirement.

242
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,750
We will give you a buyout package of
$300,000 if you take it within this time

243
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:38,530
frame.
However,

244
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,290
after this timeframe,
when we have the downsizing,

245
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,470
you might be among the people cut and
you will lose all of the benefits that

246
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:50,320
we're talking about right now and the
most you can get us two weeks severance

247
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,050
pay.
Ladies and gentlemen,

248
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,910
only 50 percent of the people that were
eligible.

249
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,520
Tuck this.
Let me tell you something.

250
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,230
If I'd been there,
I'd have gone to ask for your check.

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,200
Less than Marvin told me to get his
Jackie's home with

252
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,330
Mama.
Thank.

253
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,200
I would have taken that money so quick
and I had other people checks less.

254
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,130
Got Your check.
Say Ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,000
life is too short.
Trying to pledge.

256
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,330
Save is too short and unpredictable.
Being miserable.

257
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,480
It's too sharp for that.
Here's the thing,

258
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,440
there's no safe position in life.
Let me tell you why it's a quiet secret

259
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,250
that most people don't realize.
You can't get out of life alive.

260
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,310
You can't get out of life,
so there's no safe position you can in

261
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,190
the bleachers or you could die on the
field.

262
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,520
You might as well come out on the field
at Hamilton.

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you.

264
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,430
You want to make this your decade.
You've got to decide to be bold,

265
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,360
so you've got to be bold in life.
You got to take life on.

266
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:16,380
I remember I was at a major corporation.
I had to give a presentation and there

267
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:19,740
were two guys sitting across from me and
a guy said to the other fellow,

268
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,860
looking at the last two finalists and
that involved my firm and their firm

269
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,570
said,
listen,

270
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,970
looking at the credentials,
this guy doesn't have any credentials.

271
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,450
We have an advantage here.
We've got two phds between us.

272
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,360
I got up and I went in the bathroom,
start talking to myself.

273
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,200
I said,
let's round.

274
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,370
What do you care about their two phd's?
You have six children

275
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,040
and a mama to take care of.
And I went in that meeting and first of

276
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,600
all,
I went at walking bowl,

277
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:48,080
looking good,
feeling good and smelling good.

278
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,310
Thank you.

279
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,120
Is that tape?
When we started negotiating and operate

280
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:02,530
in a spirit of absolute certainty,
I looked at them as if the only reason

281
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:04,690
that they were born was to give me that
contract.

282
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,000
They survived one out of 9 million
sperms to carry out this transaction.

283
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,580
And I got the contract.

284
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,500
No,
thank you.

285
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,870
Got

286
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,900
Most people go through life trying to
creep.

287
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,541
No,
no,

288
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,490
no.
Trying to be casual about it.

289
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:25,211
No,
no,

290
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,980
no.
You go for live being casual.

291
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:28,980
You'll end up a casualty.
No,

292
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,040
you've got to be bold in life.
You've got to take life on.

293
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,470
Now.
Here's something else you must be

294
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:36,760
positive.
See,

295
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,530
a lot of people,
when things don't happen,

296
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,120
when they wanted,
wanted to happen,

297
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,890
they become negative and they turn out
and stop projecting a lot of negative

298
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,050
energy.
No,

299
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,620
no.
You've got to make a conscious,

300
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:49,720
deliberate,
determined effort to be positive.

301
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,030
Because see,
when you know within yourself,

302
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:53,380
things are gonna.
Work out for you.

303
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,090
When you will know within yourself that
some way somehow you're going to make

304
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,380
it,
and this is just some,

305
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:02,500
these are just some of the hoops you've
got to flip through in order to get

306
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,340
there.
It's okay.

307
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:07,010
I have a friend who went to get a job
and the people didn't hire me.

308
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,270
He was so negative.
Well to hell with you then.

309
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:09,811
Oh,
wait a minute,

310
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,870
wait a minute.
They just don't have a job that

311
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,720
don't burn your bridges behind.
You know,

312
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,490
talk about the guys,
Mama.

313
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,840
Now here's the last thing.
If you want to reach your goal and have

314
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,360
a competitive edge,
you've got to be hungry.

315
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,660
A lot of people love me to tell this
story.

316
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,250
When I got out of school,
you know,

317
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:37,720
my first major goal was to buy my mother
a home in my hero in broadcasting was

318
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,810
Paul Harvey and I wanted to become
involved in broadcasting and I love the

319
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:44,410
disc jockeys that were on the air and I
wanted to become a disc jockey and Mr

320
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,440
Washington said something to me that
I'll never forget who was my mentor in

321
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,670
Highschool.
Repeat this.

322
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:49,890
Whitney is his quote,

323
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,070
it's better to be prepared
for an opportunity and not have one than

324
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,510
to have an opportunity and not be
prepared.

325
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,850
So I started working to develop my
communication skills and expand my

326
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,610
vocabulary.
I started visualizing myself being a

327
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:11,580
disc jockey.
I saw myself on there having a talk show

328
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,860
and playing records and people listening
to me.

329
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,870
That was my vision.
That was my dream.

330
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,710
I held that in mind constantly and I
would practice all the time.

331
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,700
Practice makes what?
Absolutely not this,

332
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,420
this,
just dislodge that from your mind.

333
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,440
Practice only makes improvement.
Perfection doesn't exist.

334
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,000
They need to take it out of the
dictionary.

335
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,770
It doesn't.
It doesn't exist.

336
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,790
Practice only makes improvement.
You can always better your best.

337
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,450
You have not done your best work yet as
long as you're here,

338
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,950
you have a chance to transcend yourself.
So don't believe in perfection.

339
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,790
That doesn't exist.

340
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,860
It only makes improvement.
So I would practice,

341
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,270
practice,
practice everyday,

342
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,170
everyday,
everyday.

343
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,130
And finally I went over to this radio
station asking God for job and Mr

344
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,500
Birdwell and I said,
how you doing Sarah?

345
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,600
Like to get a job?
I was working on Miami beach at at the

346
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,390
Fontainebleau hotel at the time,
the Jackie gleason and June Taylor

347
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,270
dancers were famous and my favorite
program on television,

348
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,700
most people would not remember John
Barris for Tipton.

349
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,080
Hi,
my name is Michael Anthony.

350
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,990
I have a check for $1,000,000.
How many of you remember that protocol?

351
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,250
Right?
The millionaire.

352
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,990
That was my favorite program on
television.

353
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,000
If this is my fantasy,
you know,

354
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,220
and every time we would drive from Bondi
beach,

355
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,060
I would fantasize.
Oh,

356
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,290
that's the house where I give him a
million.

357
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,790
I'm my by my mother.
That home over there.

358
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,970
So that's my fantasy.
So I went up to visit butterball and he

359
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,770
said,
you have any radio experience?

360
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,603
I said,
no sir,

361
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,680
you have any background in journalism?
I said,

362
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,690
no sir.
I said,

363
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:32,340
but I could never get experience if you
don't give me the opportunity.

364
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,810
I've been practicing a lot,
sir.

365
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,850
He said,
I'm sorry we don't have any job for you.

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,380
I say,
thank you sir.

367
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,910
He didn't know my reasons for being
there.

368
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,300
My reason why I wanted to use radios
have means to earn the money to buy my

369
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:44,730
mother a home.
I went back to the radio station again.

370
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,110
I say,
how you doing Mr Butterball?

371
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,790
My name is Les Brown.
I know your name.

372
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,070
Didn't I just see you here yesterday?
I said,

373
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:50,671
yes sir.
I say,

374
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,720
y'all have any jobs here?
Did Not tell you.

375
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,320
I said we didn't have in jail.
Yes sir.

376
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,340
But I thought maybe somebody got fired
or resigned.

377
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,174
I didn't know.

378
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,120
I went the next day.
How are you doing this to butterball?

379
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,140
He said yes,
and I just didn't take it personally.

380
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,320
How you doing?
So you all have any jobs in there?

381
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,320
Not just tell you.
Yesterday and the day before.

382
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:14,610
We didn't have any work while I thought
maybe somebody died so I didn't know.

383
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,400
I didn't know.
I went the next day,

384
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:20,520
showed up like nothing was wrong.
Like I saw him for the first time.

385
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,770
How you doing Mr Butterball y'all have
in there.

386
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,260
He said,
why make yourself useful?

387
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,360
Go get me some food.
I said,

388
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,490
yes sir.
See many times when you want more,

389
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,260
you've got to be willing to pay your
dues,

390
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,380
so I became the errand boy.
I went and we'll get their lunch and

391
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,630
their dinner and all kinds of food for
them.

392
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:39,900
After awhile I would take the food to
them in the control room and I would not

393
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:43,230
leave until they would ask me to and I'd
watched him working the controls and

394
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,170
I've memorized their hand movements and
pretty soon they would trust me with

395
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:48,700
their cars to go pick up entertainers
that came into town.

396
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:52,330
Entertainers like Sam Cooke,
I'm Diana Ross and the supremes,

397
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,660
the four tops and the temptations.
I will drive them all over Miami beach

398
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,210
in the disc jockeys cars.
I didn't have any driver's license,

399
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:58,760
but I'll drive

400
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,593
like I had.

401
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,370
Finally,
one day I was at the radio station and a

402
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,670
guy by the name of rock was drinking
while he was on there.

403
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,700
It was a Saturday afternoon.
I was the only one there.

404
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,380
None of the other jobs were available
and I was looking at him through the

405
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,620
control room window
saying,

406
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:30,621
drink rock drink.
Want to get him tomorrow?

407
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:37,790
If you'd asked me
what is on the phone,

408
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,200
rang was a general manager.
I said,

409
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:40,370
hello?
He said,

410
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,600
les,
this is Mr Klein.

411
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,620
I said,
I know.

412
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,860
He said rock can't finish his program.
I said,

413
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:49,590
I know you said when you call one of the
other djs that come in.

414
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,453
I said,
yes sir.

415
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,770
I hung the phone up.
I said,

416
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:55,940
now he must be thinking I'm crazy.
I called my mom and my girlfriend,

417
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,691
Cassandra.
I said,

418
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,880
y'all come out on the front porch and
turn up the radio.

419
00:21:58,881 --> 00:21:59,714
I'm about to

420
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,110
thank you.

421
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,670
Waited for about 20 minutes not calling
back.

422
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:11,570
I said,
Mr Cline,

423
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:14,180
I can't find nobody.
He said,

424
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,710
young boy,
do you not a Segue,

425
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,580
the records?
I said,

426
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:17,840
yes sir.
He said,

427
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,100
going and don't say nothing.
Hear?

428
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,420
I said,
yes sir.

429
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,900
I couldn't wait to get behind those
controls.

430
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,610
I'll put the headphones on.
I said,

431
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,350
look,
this is me lb triple p,

432
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,030
Les Brown,
Your Platter Playing Papa.

433
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
There was none before.
Man.

434
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,630
That will be that after me.
Therefore that makes me the one and only

435
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,670
young and single and love to mingle.
Certified,

436
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,020
bonafide and duplicate.
They qualify,

437
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,880
they'll bring you satisfaction,
a whole lot of action.

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,290
Look out baby.
I'm your love man.

439
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:40,830
I was

440
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,830
great.
Thank

441
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,310
you.

442
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,540
When you are able to have charge of your
destiny,

443
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,840
doesn't.
It gives you a good feel.

444
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,030
You can get you gives you choices.
You can do more things.

445
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,370
Say,
my first major goal was to buy my mother

446
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,400
a home.
I feel like Abraham Lincoln who said all

447
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,350
that I am and all that,
I have a hope to be.

448
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,800
I owe to my mother and I said to my
Mama,

449
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,000
one desk and Mama,
when I become a man,

450
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,690
I'm going to buy your home and you won't
have to go to work every day.

451
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,000
You won't have to work.
You just sit down.

452
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,980
Mama.
She was getting up getting dressed to go

453
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,980
to the m and m cafeteria.
That is now just following her around.

454
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,060
I said,
watch Mama.

455
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,700
One day.
You won't have to leave here to go to

456
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,170
work no more.
It was raining outside.

457
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,760
You won't have to go to work in the
rain.

458
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,090
You just do what you want to do.
Like stay home and fix me.

459
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,150
Sweet potato.
My mom fix it kind of sweet potato pie.

460
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:41,050
You can't eat with your shoes on.
You have to take your shoes off so you

461
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,920
can wiggle your toes.
But that was my dream.

462
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,100
That was my passion.
I

463
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,120
saw that and that drove me.
That was my reason for being so.

464
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,280
One of the things.
In order to make this your decade,

465
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:55,400
in order to reach your goals,
you've got to find some reasons that

466
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,700
make you strong.
Some reasons that will make you hang in

467
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,460
there when times get rough because
they're going to get rough.

468
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,490
There's got to be very challenging.
Whenever you decide that you want to

469
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:06,350
grow,
whenever you decide that you want to go

470
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,570
to another level,
all hell will break,

471
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:13,490
lose everything that will happen.
The other that can happen will happen,

472
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,040
and at the worst possible moment,
they call it Murphy's law.

473
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,230
See,
whenever you decide that you want to go

474
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,690
to another vibration,
it's like when you get into an airplane,

475
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,730
the first thing they tell you to do is
do what?

476
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,010
Fasten your seatbelt because you're
going to experience some turbulence when

477
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:32,540
you're going up and some of you are
already experiencing that turbulence.

478
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,170
Don't be frightened by that,
so whenever you decide you want to go to

479
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:39,320
another level,
you've got to fasten your psychological,

480
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,340
your mental and your spiritual seatbelt
because they're going to be awhile

481
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,160
before you experienced a comfortable
altitude.

482
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,830
You're going to get there.
It's there,

483
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,300
but you've got to go through this phase
here.

484
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,350
This is how you grow.
This is how you develop.

485
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:53,590
See,
life is like a rollercoaster.

486
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,460
Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.

487
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,890
Sometimes things go well and sometimes
they don't go well,

488
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,460
but in the down moments,
that's when you discover who you are

489
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,400
during the down moments,
in this prosperous time,

490
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,530
you put it in your pocket and the lean
times,

491
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:10,010
you put it in your hall and that's when
you discover who you are.

492
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,790
Thanks.

493
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,980
Five reasons that empower you.
Why is it that you deserve your goal?

494
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,640
What are the five reasons that you won't
give up when life catch you?

495
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:31,450
On the blind side,
when the messenger of misery visits you,

496
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,070
what are you going to do?
What will keep you in the game when life

497
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,200
knocked you to the canvas?
See,

498
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:42,670
the buster douglas that fought in the
last fight was not the buster Douglas,

499
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,630
Mike Tyson.
So the buster douglas that got knocked

500
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:49,840
down while I'm fighting.
Mike Tyson had gotten out on alcohol

501
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,330
recovery center.
His mother had died.

502
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,570
His wife was ill with a terminal
illness.

503
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,250
He was considered a nothing a bomb.
So when he got knocked down,

504
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,790
buster Douglas had a reason to get back
up because he said,

505
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,120
I'm dedicating this fight to the memory
of my momma,

506
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,400
but when he fought the last fight that
he had and it got knocked down and had a

507
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:17,401
guaranteed $24,000,000 in his pocket,
they got up.

508
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,700
He just said,
hurry up and count me out.

509
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Thank you.

510
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,010
Why'd you?
Why'd you leave us on somebody to get

511
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:41,040
hurt?
So you've got to have some reasons that

512
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,840
when life knocks you down,
it's gone.

513
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,340
How long it's going to knock you down
when people disappoint you,

514
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,550
and that's going to happen.
When they been you in,

515
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,100
that's going to happen.
When they lied to you and that's going

516
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:52,711
to happen.
When they say,

517
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,900
well,
you can count on me and they won't show

518
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,900
up and that's going to happen.
When you're wanting to throw in the

519
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:00,210
towel and give up yourself and that's
going to happen.

520
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,000
When live collapse on you and catch you
on the blind side,

521
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,040
it drops you to your knees and start
choking you.

522
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:09,150
You got a dream though I ain't got no
dreams and that's going to happen.

523
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,710
What reason can you remember that you
can call on that you can reach on,

524
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,450
that could make you get back up.

525
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,050
Find that reason.

526
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,970
It was alive and knocked me down.
I said,

527
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,190
life.
I'm doing this because I want to make my

528
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,680
momma proud of me.
I'm doing this because I want my

529
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,480
children to have a better life than what
I have.

530
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm doing this because all my life,
I've been told I'll be a loser that I

531
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:31,750
wouldn't make it all my life.
I've heard people say made me take them

532
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,750
back to the welfare department.
I'm doing this to make them a lot.

533
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,670
I believe like Frank Sinatra,
he said,

534
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,610
the best revenge and life is massive
success.

535
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,810
I'm doing this so I can become massively
successful and what that kind of courage

536
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:46,540
with that kind of affirmation and reason
to empower me,

537
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,550
I got a saying that when life knocks you
down,

538
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,650
try and land on your back because if you
can look up,

539
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,543
you can get off.

540
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,910
Thank you.

541
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,550
When you run out of money,

542
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,090
when things don't work out for you,
when things happened that you could not

543
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:11,820
anticipate,
what are the reasons that you can think

544
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:15,810
of that can keep this strong,
that can keep you in the game,

545
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:19,620
that will be your rod and staff,
the comfort you that can be your bridge

546
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,540
over troubled waters,
those reasons.

547
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:24,450
A very important Nietzsche said,
if you know the why for living,

548
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,690
you can endure almost anyhow,
so find out the reasons that you do what

549
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,730
you do.
Find out the reasons that will make you

550
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,430
strong,
that will make you walk by faith and not

551
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:37,680
by sight.
That will make you pursue your dream

552
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,650
when everybody is against you or don't
believe in you no more,

553
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,900
and let me tell you something that's a
lonely feeling.

554
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,650
It's a lonely feeling,
particularly people that you're doing it

555
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,320
for or people that stand to benefit the
most,

556
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,460
or people who should be the number one
members in the encouragement club,

557
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,070
but they ended up saying you can't do
it,

558
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,320
and they become members of the
discouragement club.

559
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,840
Oh,
it hurts very badly.

560
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:04,080
I know what that's like.
Have people that you love close to you.

561
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,410
They look at you with that look and say,
why don't you try something else?

562
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,750
Why don't you give up?
I say,

563
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,190
but this is my life.
I have got to do this less.

564
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,680
You had a good job at sears.

565
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,500
Bad Man.
Like you

566
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,690
mama.
I can't go back and see.

567
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:25,040
I can't.
I can't do.

568
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,600
I got to be my own boss.
I,

569
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,290
I can't do that.
I mean,

570
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:28,900
you know,
it's,

571
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,560
it's ladies and gentlemen.
You know when you work on a job that's

572
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,800
dead in you,
you can see the ceiling already.

573
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:39,600
It's like going in the middle of a movie
and after you've seen the movie setting

574
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,130
back through that over again,
there's something

575
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,911
missing.
You know,

576
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,720
the heroes not going to die.
You know what the outcome is already and

577
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,640
so that's why a lot of people,
lady was telling me,

578
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:49,950
she said when she went to work,
Bob,

579
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,960
like a refrigerator fell on her shoulder
as soon as she stepped in because she

580
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:58,090
knew she could.
She'd gone as far as she could go see

581
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,730
they're paying or just enough to keep
them from quitting and she's work just

582
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,530
hard enough just to keep from getting
fired.

583
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,570
How many of you know people like that?
Raise your hand,

584
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,750
why you didn't raise your hand you don't
want or

585
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,380
I'll just leave it out.
Just here's something else.

586
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Make a commitment to be happy
so you don't have.

587
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,410
You're laughing a lot,
so life is too short.

588
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,430
Going through and look at,
hopefully tie to Douglas.

589
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,820
Sometimes we take life too seriously.
Oh No.

590
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,650
Make a commitment to be happy.
Find little things just to get tickled

591
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:36,070
about and laugh.
Find ways to be happy in the moment.

592
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:36,970
A lot of people say,
well,

593
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,920
I'll be happy when I pay off all my
bills.

594
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,630
Oh,
no,

595
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,750
no.
I'll be happy when I get by divorce.

596
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,783
No,
no.

597
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,830
I'll be happy with the children.
God.

598
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,610
Oh No,
no.

599
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,890
You want to be happy,
and I said,

600
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:49,690
there are no guarantees.
No one's saying you're going to be here

601
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,310
two,
three or four years from now,

602
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,810
so you want to be happy right now in the
moment.

603
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,710
Repeat after me.
I must make a commitment

604
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,620
to be happy right now,
right now,

605
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,490
all I got.
Take somebody that's had on your right

606
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,930
and left and say,
you deserve to be happy.

607
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,610
Make a commitment to be happy because
life now has new meaning for you.

608
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,910
Just enjoying the sunset or just looking
at life,

609
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,160
looking at nature,
going for a walk.

610
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,380
It's the little things in life that
counts.

611
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,140
Here's something else that you want to
begin to do in order to make this your

612
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:34,370
decade.
He want to began to get all the toxic

613
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,600
people out of your life.
How?

614
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,630
Hello
Energy drainers,

615
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
get them out of your life.
See,

616
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,440
ladies and gentlemen,
it takes a lot of energy to reach your

617
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:48,140
goal.
It takes a lot of emotional,

618
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:51,020
mental,
and spiritual energy to reach our goal,

619
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,600
and you can run faster with a 100 will
want to go then with one around your

620
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:00,350
neck.
So there are two kinds of relationships.

621
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:04,640
It's Simon talks about this nourishing
relationships and toxic relationships,

622
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,390
nourishing relationships,
all the relationships that inspire you,

623
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,930
they motivate you,
they bring the best out of you.

624
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,820
Toxic relationships or relationships
with people that always criticize you.

625
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,230
All they can do is find fought.
All they can do is just explore your

626
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,660
weaknesses.
All they can do is remind you of the

627
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:27,830
mistakes that you've made in the past.
These people are bad for your health.

628
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,890
Toxic people can run your blood pressure
up.

629
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,510
One applicant spoils the whole barrel.
One negative inner greater energy

630
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:40,511
drainer can spa your whole life.
I know people lives have been ruined

631
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,120
because somebody wasn't good for them.
See,

632
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,430
there are some people that aren't good
for you.

633
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,170
Hello,
they aren't good for you.

634
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,530
Got To get them out of your life.
See,

635
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,600
a lot of people put up with a lot of
foolishness because they don't want to

636
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,120
die by themselves.
Here's what I believe.

637
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,790
I believe in a one to a box theory.

638
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Thank you.
Question

639
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,840
of yourself.
Make a list of who you communicate with

640
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:18,590
most and ask yourself the question,
what kind of person am I becoming

641
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,790
because of this relationship?
Is it helping me to grow mentally and

642
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,870
emotionally and spiritually?
Am I becoming a better person because of

643
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,570
this relationship?
Do they bring out the best in me?

644
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,310
They'll do.
They inspire me.

645
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,610
They encouraged me to develop my
greatness.

646
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,870
Do they make me stretch?
So you got to look at the people in your

647
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:42,110
life and find out what kind of person
are you becoming?

648
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,630
Because of that relationship my mother
used to say,

649
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,070
birds of a feather flock together.
You run around with losers.

650
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,070
You will end up a loser.
Unconsciously,

651
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,030
unconsciously you will pick up their
wage.

652
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,870
You'll pick up their habits.
You'll pick up,

653
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,330
most importantly,
their attitude about life.

654
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,260
If you around cynical,
negative people all the time,

655
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,530
you will become cynical and negative.

656
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,120
So you gotta watch yourself.
Many of us are living out the lives of

657
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,920
other people,
living out their conclusions,

658
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,240
living out of their consciousness.
The other thing is that you begin to

659
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,660
look at looking at your life and looking
at what it is that you want to achieve.

660
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,280
Another crucial thing that you must do
is align yourself with powerful people.

661
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,030
Align yourself with people that can
encourage you,

662
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,540
people that can empower you,
people that you can learn from,

663
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,050
people that you can grow from.
That's very important,

664
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,650
so if you have people around you that
can contribute to your growth.

665
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,210
When I wanted to become a speaker,
I joined the National Speakers

666
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,270
Association.
I wanted to be around the Dr Norman

667
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,350
Vincent Peale's,
the Zig Ziglars,

668
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,280
the Dwayne dyers.
This.

669
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,630
I wanted to be around people that were
doing what I wanted to do.

670
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,480
I want to learn from them,
and you want to do that too.

671
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,690
You want to align yourself with people
who think like you,

672
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,210
people who dream like you,
people who want more out of life,

673
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:07,100
people that are stretching and searching
and seeking some higher ground in life

674
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,440
as opposed to the majority of people.
Somebody said,

675
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,770
always strive to get on top and life
because it's the bottom that's

676
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:15,590
overcrowded and so you don't want to be
on the bottom.

677
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,570
See,
it's easy to be on the bottom.

678
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,550
It doesn't take any effort to be a
loser.

679
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,260
It doesn't take any motivation and
didn't drive in order to stay down there

680
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,710
on a low level,
but it calls on everything in you.

681
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have to harness your will to say,

682
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm going to challenge myself.
Sometimes I have to pull myself out of

683
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:37,410
bed to come on.
Less things I know I shouldn't do.

684
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:40,200
I don't do things I shouldn't do.
I do.

685
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,860
I found that the biggest enemy you have
to deal with is yourself.

686
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,050
There's an old African proverb that
says,

687
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:50,220
if there's no enemy within the enemy
outside can do us no harm.

688
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,110
So think about that.
Thank you.

689
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:00,910
You

690
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,650
begin to look toward making this.
Your decade as you begin to look toward

691
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,170
making your life different,
he'll begin to look at yourself.

692
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:12,220
You've got to redefine yourself.
Who are you right now and who must you

693
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:16,600
become in order to create what you want?
What else has changed about you?

694
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,060
What is it that you're doing right now
that would be a liability for you as you

695
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:25,420
begin to look toward the future and take
inventory of yourself?

696
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,530
What is it about you right now that
you've got to leave this behind because

697
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:34,480
this no longer fits looking at where you
want to go and the kind of person that

698
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:37,090
you must become,
the kind of standards that you have for

699
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:40,390
you.
What is it that you must do differently?

700
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,720
Repeat after to me please.
If you want to keep on getting what

701
00:36:43,721 --> 00:36:44,554
you're getting.

702
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,490
Keep on doing what you're doing
so that doesn't take an Einstein for

703
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:55,060
that.
It makes sense unless you change your

704
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,190
pattern,
unless you change the way you're

705
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,350
thinking,
unless you change your behavior,

706
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,080
you're going to continue to produce the
results in your life.

707
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:03,280
See,
all of us are winters,

708
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,840
but some of us are producing results
that we don't want and so all you have

709
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:10,130
to look at your game plan.
Look at your strategy.

710
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,870
How is it that you have been been?
What is it that you've been doing to

711
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,930
produce this so you have a director,
you're the producer,

712
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:19,360
you're writing the script,
you're the star of your life,

713
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,170
and as you begin to look at your life,
you can decide whether or not it's a

714
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:27,010
smash and whether or not it's a flop
that's in your hands.

715
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,740
Look at your life,
look at where you want to go.

716
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,830
Don't worry about your circumstances.
Don't worry about your age.

717
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,910
Have a friend who was up in age,
over 70 and she wanted to build a

718
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:41,470
multimillion dollar complex name is Dr
Johnny Coleman Lenders and bankers say,

719
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,300
you can't do that.
You're too old.

720
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,860
She ignored them.
That building now stands ladies and

721
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:50,650
gentlemen on long time,
million dollar structure,

722
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,130
but are a lot of people who would have
listened to that,

723
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,840
that a lot of people that would not have
even gotten to that point,

724
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,920
they were to talk themselves out of even
going down to the bank to ask for it

725
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,710
because they've already said no to
themselves.

726
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,970
See,
it's time now.

727
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:07,690
If you want to make this your decade,
you've got to start saying yes to your

728
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:10,270
life.
You've got to start saying yes to your

729
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:13,240
dreams,
yes to your unfolding future,

730
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,140
yes to your potential as opposed to say,
no.

731
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:19,600
C,
87 percent of our self talk is negative.

732
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,360
So you've got to make a conscious,
deliberate,

733
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:25,180
determined effort to say yes to your
dreams.

734
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,910
Why not?
Why not me?

735
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Don't spend time like most people going
through life complaining.

736
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,960
Don't try and get on talk shows and tell
everybody how life has done you.

737
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,390
Here's what's happening in the audience.
Eighty percent don't care.

738
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,490
And 50 percent.
Gladys,

739
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:47,540
you
alright?

740
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,710
So,
so when you know that you all go wrong,

741
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,660
what they did to get away from me before
they come back,

742
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,280
thanks.

743
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,190
Ramana said something very important.
He said,

744
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,820
hey,
it doesn't matter what happens to you.

745
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
The only thing matters.
What are you going to do about it?

746
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,910
That's all that matters.
Okay?

747
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:20,730
Life knocked you down.
What do you do about how long are you

748
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:22,990
going to sit there and say,
you know what that did to me?

749
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,050
Who was the head I racquet.
Use that energy to get up

750
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,830
from and move on and get on with your
life.

751
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,910
You got to learn to let the past go so
you can grow.

752
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,840
Many people never act on their dreams
because they allow their past

753
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,930
experiences to determine what their
possibilities are.

754
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,410
Whatever you've done in the past that's
not a reflection of your possibilities.

755
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,510
That's just a reflection of your
consciousness.

756
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,210
That's just a reflection of your
development and your growth.

757
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,240
The future is unfolding for you right
now.

758
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,790
The future is unlimited for you right
now.

759
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,700
No one knows where you can go.
No one knows what you are,

760
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,810
what you're capable of lava,
what's possible for you.

761
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,120
You don't even know that.
I had no idea.

762
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:09,170
Ladies and gentlemen,
no one could have convinced me that I

763
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,940
was able to do this.
I never forget.

764
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:15,750
I was speaking in Detroit in a high
school friend of mine saw me afterwards

765
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,000
and he was backstage.
He said,

766
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,770
I can't believe it's the same person,
and I thought for a moment and I said,

767
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,790
it's not the person you know you go,

768
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,740
he doesn't live here anymore.
We have the

769
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,000
power to change our personal history,
changing the direction of our lives,

770
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:38,150
changing our thoughts,
changing where we want to go,

771
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,830
exploring new horizons.
So as you began to look at this decade

772
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:46,580
and affirming that this is your decade
as you set goals that will make you

773
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:49,310
stretch,
that will bring out the best in you as

774
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:54,020
you begin to remove the negative toxic
people from your life as you decide to

775
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:57,350
take some chances in life.
And that's one of the things that's very

776
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,310
important.
This God said,

777
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:01,670
if you're not willing to risk,
you cannot grow and if you cannot grow,

778
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:04,970
you cannot become your best.
And if you cannot become your best,

779
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,620
you cannot be happy.
And if you can't be happy and what else

780
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,380
is there?
I'll never forget.

781
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:17,300
When I reached my first major goal of
buying my mother left home,

782
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,620
I never forget what it was like.
And you're going to have this experience

783
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:25,700
when you reach some major goal.
When I drove up to the house and I got

784
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:28,820
out and I gave mom a key and I said,
Mama,

785
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,580
this is for you.
I'll never forget the look on her face.

786
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:35,414
She said.

787
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,570
She said,
well my God,

788
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,300
no one could have convinced me when I
adopted you off that this would happen.

789
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,340
She's so thank you.
She said,

790
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,220
you
me so many damn problem.

791
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,260
Yeah,

792
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,750
that's what I was given.
Had a lot of energy,

793
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,480
but no one knew what I was going to
become.

794
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,430
It was a great philosopher,
Gerta.

795
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,460
He says,
look at a man the way that he is,

796
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:18,490
he only becomes worse,
but look at him as if he were what he

797
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,770
could be.
Then it becomes what he should be.

798
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,550
And what Mr Washington did was he looked
beyond my faults and saw my needs and he

799
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,020
said,
I see something in you.

800
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,790
And I was there.
Oh God,

801
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:34,380
I hope he's right and I want to live up
to his expectations.

802
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:37,930
He no one rises to low expectations.
Finally,

803
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,720
here's one last thing I like to leave
with you going to make this your decade,

804
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:45,930
find some cause that you believe in,
so this is my profession,

805
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:50,200
but my greatest joy in life is working
with young kids.

806
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Every Monday I fly up to Chicago to work
with 600 young kids and Christ Universal

807
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,900
Temple Church,
working with them to develop a sense of

808
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:00,040
purpose and direction.

809
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,900
With alliance,
we've developed a training program.

810
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,310
If they're addicted to drugs or alcohol,
we help them to get into a permanent

811
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:08,620
recovery program.
If they're not,

812
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:12,100
we help them to develop a vision of
themselves where drugs and alcohol does

813
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:15,520
not fit.
I love it when I go into the Cook County

814
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:20,521
jail and see the look on these young men
faces that anger and the self hatred and

815
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,580
then when we leave there,
see the difference in them as we begin

816
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,330
to touch a spark in them as Mr
Washington touched in me and there's no.

817
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:33,610
You cannot put a dollar price on that.
That's my reason for being.

818
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,340
What is it that you would like to give
the planet?

819
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,370
What is it that you'd like to leave
here?

820
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,020
See,
someone paid a price for us to be here.

821
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,260
I believe that we live in the greatest
country in the world that gives us an

822
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,360
opportunity to make a difference in
life.

823
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,750
We are blessed to have been dropped off
on this part of the planet.

824
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,780
A friend of mine was in Manila and saw a
bumper sticker say Yankee,

825
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:57,781
go home and take me with you.
So as you began to look at your life,

826
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,280
decide what kind of legacy do I want to
lead?

827
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,280
What kind of statement do you want to
make with your life?

828
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,610
What three things you want said when you
die,

829
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,290
what contribution do you want to make?
I don't know what you want to do.

830
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,050
I don't know what you want to achieve
with your life.

831
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,220
Here's what I know about you and about
you and about you and about you.

832
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,900
That you have greatness within you,
that you have things and gifts and

833
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:31,440
talents that you've been bestowed with
that as you work consciously making a

834
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:32,310
conscious,
deliberate,

835
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:36,150
determined effort to cultivate and bring
them out and develop a sense of purpose

836
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:39,630
and knowing that your life can make a
difference and decided to make and leave

837
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:42,870
a legacy with your life.
I say to you that the planet will never

838
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:46,590
be the same again because you showed up
as you begin to look toward the future

839
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:49,710
and affirmed that this is your decade.
This is what I like to leave with you,

840
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:53,400
that I'm known by.
It's become my motto and it says simply

841
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,750
this,
what are you want to do?

842
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,150
My goal is to be the best son that I can
beat up my mother.

843
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,320
My goal is to be the best father that I
can be to my children and my goal is to

844
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:04,380
create a drug free America.
Be the best motivator that I can be.

845
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,220
Whatever your goal is,
this is what I like to leave with you

846
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:11,070
says simply this,
that if you want a thing bad enough to

847
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,890
go out and fight for it to work day and
night,

848
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,140
for it to give up your time,
your peace,

849
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:19,650
and your sleep for it.
If all that you dream and scheme is

850
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,890
about it and life seems useless and
worthless without it,

851
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,000
and if you'd gladly sweat for it and
fret for it and plan for it and lose all

852
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:30,690
your terror of the opposition for it,
and if you simply go after this thing

853
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:34,290
that you want with all of your capacity,
strengthen sagacity,

854
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,360
faith,
hope and confidence and stern

855
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,700
pertinacity.
If neither cold poverty,

856
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:43,080
famish or go sickness or pain of body
and brain can keep you away from the

857
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:45,900
thing that you want.
If dogged and grim you besiege and

858
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,880
visited with the help of God,
you'll get it.

859
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,480
This is Mrs Mamie Brown's baby boy,
Leslie Calvin Brown saying it's been a

860
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:52,320
plum pleasing pleasure.

861
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,740
Thank you.
