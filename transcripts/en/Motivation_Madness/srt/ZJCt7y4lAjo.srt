1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,710
What is it that gives your life a sense
of meaning and purpose?

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,050
Because once you find that,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,810
it puts you in your power place.
See if you know what your life work is.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:16,340
I encourage you to start working on it.
If you can't do it all at one time,

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:21,140
do just a little bit of it and if you
don't know what it is that you showed up

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,420
to do,
if you don't know why you're here,

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,040
I encourage you to find out what your
purpose is here.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,370
What is the meaning of your life?
What will be different?

9
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,840
Have you ever asked yourself that
question?

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,070
I've done that.
I,

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,510
I remember coming from a friend of
mine's funeral and I was reflecting on

12
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,430
how much time I had left and I went for
a walk in the park thinking about this

13
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:48,230
guy whose life was so promising and I
mean he wasn't an old guy who was quite

14
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:51,170
young in fact,
and I thought about all of the things

15
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:55,490
that he said he was going to do and he
never got a chance to do those things.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
And I start thinking about my own life
and how much time I had left to do the

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:08,021
things that I would like to do.
And at that time I wasn't sure what my

18
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,660
life purpose was,
what my life's work was.

19
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,520
I wasn't sure about it at that time and
I thought about it quite a lot.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,900
I had some idea,
but I wasn't convinced that I don't

21
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:25,060
think I felt worthy.
I didn't believe that it could be me to

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,050
do this kind of work that I'm doing
right now.

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,200
And I say to you that if you began to
take a conscious effort to find out what

24
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:38,201
it is and you're supposed to do,
I say that it can literally save your

25
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,790
life.
I said that it can literally save your

26
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,190
life.
80 five percent of the American public.

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,890
I caught him to recent studies are going
to jobs that they hate working on jobs

28
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:59,841
that do not challenge them.
They get sick.

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,410
Thinking about going.
Because see,

30
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,190
when you go to a job and you already
know how far you can go,

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,300
you can already see that proverbial
glass ceiling.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,600
See,
when you're going someplace and you

33
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,910
already know how much you're going to
make,

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,900
you already know how far you can go.
You're in a dead end position.

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,620
It erodes your self esteem.
It lowers your sense of yourself.

36
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,890
It creates an inner turmoil.
It creates an emptiness in you.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,940
Say That your life is worth finding what
it is that you're supposed to do,

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,630
and I'm not saying quit your job.
I'm saying find it to do just a little

39
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,940
bit on just on working at it just a
little bit,

40
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,290
but do find out what your work is and
hold onto it and don't let your dream

41
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,600
go.
Don't let it go.

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,150
See,
and here's something else I want you to

43
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:00,280
begin to look at.
Why is it that most people don't pursue

44
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,980
their dreams that don't do better than
what they're doing?

45
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,120
If they're capable of doing it?
I think that many of us don't go the

46
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,520
next step because we don't know what to
do yet,

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,920
and I say that,
that the reason that we don't even

48
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:19,921
explore the possibility of what to do is
because subconsciously we don't believe

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,290
that it can happen for us and we don't
believe that we deserve it.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,250
So here's what I'm suggesting.
How much time do you spend working on

51
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,630
you?
How much time do you spend every day

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,710
working on your dream and the last 90
days,

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,920
how many books have you read
and the last year,

54
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,480
what new skill or knowledge have you
acquired?

55
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,960
What kind of investment have you made in
you?

56
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,160
So I'm saying that as you begin to look
at where you want to go,

57
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,550
if you want to make it today and things
are changing so fast,

58
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,860
you have to literally run to stand
still.

59
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,810
I'm saying that you've got to make some
conscious effort to begin to work to

60
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,080
develop you.
Here's something else.

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,350
Most people are not living their dreams
because of fear.

62
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:19,210
Ladies and gentlemen,
fear limited vision and lack of self

63
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,720
esteem is what keeps most people doing
things.

64
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,220
They don't want to do.
The same reason that people stay in

65
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:31,060
relationships where they abuse or
they're unhappy or it's unfulfilling.

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,060
They can't see themselves beyond that
relationship.

67
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,360
They can't see themselves enjoying life
without that person.

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,900
They think that this has all been.
They can do the same reason that people

69
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,890
get stuck at a certain level in life.
They can't see things being better for

70
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:48,100
them and they think that this is,
and this is all they deserve.

71
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,350
This is all they've ever seen.
It's been passed onto them and they fade

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,080
with this is it for them.
Oh No.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,600
I'll look in what Dr Blanton Smiley
Blanton,

74
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,820
who is a colleague of Dr Norman Vincent
Peale,

75
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,990
what he said about theories that fear is
the most subtle and destructive of all

76
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,020
human diseases.
Ladies and gentlemen,

77
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,580
fear kills dreams.
Fear kills hope.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Fear what people in the hospital fear
can age you.

79
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,160
Fair Ladies and gentlemen can hold you
back from doing something that you know

80
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,410
within yourself that you are capable of
doing,

81
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,420
but it will paralyze you

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,350
and it seems like you're in a hypnotic
spell and I asked you a question.

83
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:44,760
What is the benefit?
What's the benefit of allowing fear to

84
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,260
hold you back?
What's the benefit of giving up on

85
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:52,680
yourself?
I'm not stepping out on life and taking

86
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,070
life on what is the benefit for you?
What's The plus in that?

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,040
So

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,210
one of the things I had to ask myself,
so I didn't want to make any mistakes.

89
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,870
I wanted everybody to like me.
I want it to be perfect.

90
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,200
The first time I did something.
It's not gonna happen.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,690
You're gonna.
Make some mistakes.

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
You're going to hurt some folks,
feel it.

93
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,890
You're going to create some enemies
whenever you decide that you want to

94
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,150
begin to take life on,
you got to ask yourself,

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,450
how long am I going to allow this to
hold me back?

96
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,340
I like what Zig Ziglar says.
He said,

97
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,460
fear is false evidence appearing real.

98
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,660
That is the illusion that we create in
our mind.

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,900
It is a state of mind that can be
changed,

100
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,550
so let's look at how we can begin to
take some steps to restructure that

101
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,250
fear,
to begin to expand our visions of

102
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:47,520
ourselves to begin to increase our self
esteem.

103
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:52,521
Webster said that self esteem means
competence and satisfaction in one self.

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,780
Look at your life right now.
Whatever you've done up to this point in

105
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,070
time,
your life is working.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,710
Whatever you have produced it came out
of you as result of the kind of person

107
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,440
that you have become as a result of your
choices,

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,040
as a result of your consciousness.
Now you have to ask yourself,

109
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,070
are you satisfied with what you had
produced?

110
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,350
Is this what you want?
Would you like things to be better than

111
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,900
this?
Do you believe that you deserve better

112
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,110
than this?
Aren't you content?

113
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,220
This is it.
You don't have to do everything.

114
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,290
Anything else that you already with Zan
yourself in life and said,

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,580
well,
I'm happy I'm not starving like the

116
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:34,350
people in Calcutta.
Are you allowing yourself to get off the

117
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:38,760
hook like that or do you believe
somewhere in the back of your mind or in

118
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,790
your heart that there are some other
great work for you to do this,

119
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,340
something else that has me you,
and that's why you are here?

120
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,940
How do we handle this fear factor?
How do we increase our self esteem?

121
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,900
You have to begin to fortify yourself.
How do we do that?

122
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,730
I believe that you have to begin to
consciously monitor your inner

123
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,880
conversation and start talking to
yourself.

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,690
Start building yourself up.
Sometimes the only good things you will

125
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,150
hear about you,
other things that you say to you.

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm saying,
learn to be your own booster.

127
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,040
Start building yourself up.
Start encouraging yourself.

128
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,560
Start saying,
I can do this.

129
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,920
I can make this happen.
When I started thinking about becoming a

130
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,671
speaker,
I said,

131
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,930
yes,
I can do this.

132
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,020
I can make this happen.
When I stopped trying to convince myself

133
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:34,700
I can be a businessman after flopping
and failing and losing thousands of

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,240
dollars and feeling stupid and dumb and
having people take advantage of me

135
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,820
because of what I did know,
I had to talk to myself because people

136
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,650
were saying to me that I was dumb and
somewhere in the back of my mind I was

137
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,380
saying,
you're right.

138
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,270
Look at what I've done.
I had to say,

139
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:47,841
no,
no,

140
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,351
no,
no,

141
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,040
no,
no,

142
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,950
no.
Hey,

143
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,380
hey.
Come on man.

144
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,990
Get your stuff together.
You can handle this.

145
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,670
You just haven't figured out yet.
It's all right.

146
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:59,280
This is your training theory.
This is tuition.

147
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:04,281
You have to pay for what you don't know
you can do this other people have done

148
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,360
it.
Doesn't take an Einstein.

149
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,020
Get you some people that can teach you
some stuff that you don't go get you

150
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,870
some people that have done it
successfully and learn from them.

151
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,580
Take some seminars,
workshop.

152
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,650
Read some books on how to manage your
business,

153
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,880
changed the way you see yourself and
begin to attend to the personal details.

154
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,030
Understand that nobody's gonna take care
of your business better than you,

155
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,530
and when I started changing that kind of
mindset of beating myself up because of

156
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:33,950
my mistakes,
and start looking at the possibility of

157
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,370
my doing better of my making,
the adjustments that would have enabled

158
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,240
me to do what I want to do successfully,
things began to change.

159
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,810
I say stopped beating up on yourself.
You do do it.

160
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,190
I know you're doing it.
I've done it.

161
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,090
It's a natural inclination for us to put
ourselves down.

162
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,190
See,
we're born negative.

163
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,150
I think in a negative consciousness
because we live in a negative world.

164
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,830
Here's some other things.
Ladies and gentlemen,

165
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,230
begin to guard your mind against
negative programming like turn off the

166
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:07,250
television.
Don't watch the news so you've got the

167
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,990
God the kinds of things that you put in
your mind.

168
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,700
See,
if you don't program your mind,

169
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,870
your mind will be programmed because
human beings are goal oriented.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,810
That's why we die of broken hearts
early.

171
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,450
That's why we're running through life to
early grades.

172
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,190
We're going through life,
ladies and gentlemen,

173
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,280
and I think that Henry David Thoreau
said that most men live in quiet

174
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,770
desperation.
Most of us go through life running

175
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:31,340
scared,
so we had created this in our mind is

176
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:36,341
false evidence appearing real?
We made it real in our minds.

177
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,630
That's why Churchill said,
there's nothing to fear but fear itself,

178
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,350
that's the disruptive monster.
So turn off things that can contribute

179
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:52,190
to your fear.
Turn a deaf ear to people that all they

180
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:56,630
can do is talk about how negative things
are because they have bought into the

181
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:01,580
consciousness of the world.
Start attending workshops,

182
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,520
seminars,
listening to tapes on a daily basis to

183
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,850
begin to recondition your mind,
to retrain your thinking.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,060
Faith comes by what hearing and hearing
and hearing,

185
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,400
listening to things that could empower
you,

186
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,480
that can enable you to create a new
reality for yourself in a new life for

187
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,090
yourself.
You might appear to be strange around

188
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,500
most people you know.
Most people think you're strange.

189
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,000
If you're happy today,
say these people have not found their

190
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,920
purpose in life.
That's why they are grumpy,

191
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:31,070
but that's why they're miserable.
That's why they're so negative,

192
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,290
they're hurting and they want to hurt
other people.

193
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,700
So start practicing using programs for
your mind,

194
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,440
seminars,
books,

195
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,570
workshops.
Keep a journal.

196
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,100
Record your thoughts,
what's happening with you everyday when

197
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,320
you get up,
have a journal near you.

198
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:50,370
See,
ladies and gentlemen,

199
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,970
we get three to four thoughts a year
that if we would act on those thoughts,

200
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,580
hey can change I ally.
What I did are you setting on write your

201
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:05,260
ideas down and then once you get that
idea,

202
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,480
take the lead.
Take the lead out here in the universe.

203
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,280
If you don't take the pledge,
I guarantee you somebody else will take

204
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,530
the plunge.
Go into action,

205
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,640
and ladies and gentlemen,
you will be surprised at how things will

206
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,100
come together.
You'll be surprised.

207
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,900
Now you're going to have some difficult
challenges.

208
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,470
I can tell you that now.
Be aware of that.

209
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,440
Things are not going to work out exactly
right for time.

210
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,560
They will sometimes,
and that's when life is just playing the

211
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,160
game with you.

212
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,700
I
want you to feel good and relaxed,

213
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,230
but ladies and gentlemen,
go into action with your dream and don't

214
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,160
avoid where the fights are.
Get in the midst of the fight.

215
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,260
Get knocked down so you can learn how to
fight so you can hold your position.

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,500
Say,
most people don't get out in the arena

217
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,420
of life because they don't want to
fight.

218
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,630
Most people don't get out of there
because they don't want to get knocked

219
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,980
down.
They don't want to be dropped to their

220
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,260
knees,
but say you're going to be dropped.

221
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,870
Whether you on the field or where
they're not just sitting on the

222
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,450
sidelines,
you're going to be dropped,

223
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,020
so at least get dropped with something.
See,

224
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,190
that's not most people are spectators in
life.

225
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,000
You don't want to be a spectator.
You want to get out in the field where

226
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:24,001
the action is and you will be amazed
after the struggle,

227
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,060
there will be a calm period and it began
to click for you.
