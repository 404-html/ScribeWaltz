1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,410
The one commodity that is most valuable.
Oh,

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,480
and this earth is time,
time to love,

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,040
to live.
From the moment the human body is born,

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,150
it begins dying.
I don't think you,

5
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,140
man,
you quite caught that.

6
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,560
Let me say it again.
From the moment the human body is born,

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,310
it begins dying.
Some happening faster,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,760
some happening slower.
Some of US help them happy,

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,150
go faster.
Some of them prevented from happening

10
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:44,151
sooner than later.
Coach high coming to you live on the

11
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,220
field of life.
How many seconds?

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,250
How many minutes do we waste every day?
Doing things that are nowhere near the

13
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:59,450
goals and aspirations and passions that
we have inside.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,500
How many times are you go through the
course of a day and realize,

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,400
did I do anything I set out to do today?
Write down those goals each and every

16
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:12,560
day.
No matter if there's two goals a day.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,090
If you can accomplish those,
then you're doing more than just making

18
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:21,110
it through the day you are living and
achieving your dreams.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,900
You know as inspirational speakers,
we don't want to just talk to you.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,680
We want to live that as well.
I've done that in my life as well.

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,370
Find time to better yourself.
Read,

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,630
explore research,
live life,

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,540
do things you've never thought of doing
before.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,840
That's what it's all about when you're
born,

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,050
that's their date that they put on the
left side of the tombstone.

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,790
When you die,
they put another date on the right side

27
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,791
of the tombstone,
but that dash in the middle is the most

28
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,450
important thing on that tombstone.
That is alone.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,760
That throughout that entire timeframe
you were able to impact and touch others

30
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,660
lives.
You were able to leave your mark on this

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,350
earth.
You were able to build a legacy there.

32
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,040
Nobody could change.
You were able to have it to where people

33
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,560
remember who you are,
no matter what.

34
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,860
When you're living for that dash in the
middle,

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,400
you're going to remember your why,
your why.

36
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:29,780
Why are you here,
not,

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,750
not the why.
Why did you do something your why,

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,960
your reason for getting up in the
morning,

39
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,970
your reason for pushing yourself past
the brink of exertion and given up your

40
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:44,270
reason for moving on and and and getting
things done in life.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,860
That dash in the middle.
That's the thing that pushes you.

42
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,320
Just stop for a second.
Write down your why.

43
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,910
What are you doing this for in life?
If your does it make you cry and that's

44
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,570
not your why.
Again,

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,260
if your why doesn't make you cry,
then that's not your why.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,780
Your why should be something so big that
it moves your family tree.

47
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,570
Your why should be something so big that
it changes the whole outlook on how

48
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,780
things are with you and your home,
your family,

49
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,760
your religion,
your purpose.

50
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,270
Think about your passion,
thinking about your opportunities and

51
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,910
that's how you find your purpose.
OPP.

52
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,720
Yeah.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,350
When ned,
why meets up with your passion,

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,970
your opportunity,
your purpose,

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
then you'll find out the most important
day in your life is the day you remember

56
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,180
why you were born,

57
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,080
how you can live an easy life.
You know,

58
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,470
accomplishing goals and be successful
and going out in the world and as tough.

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
The only way to live an easy life is to
basically give up on all your dreams and

60
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,550
aspirations and just sit around doing
nothing.

61
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,340
Shit that is easy is not worth
accomplishing.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,290
Therefore a life that is easy.
It's not even worth living.

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Nothing in this world is worth having,
are doing unless it means effort,

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,510
pain,
and difficulty.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Would you listen to me?
He used to be good.

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,110
You are going to die.
All of you,

67
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,860
all your friends,
your family,

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,590
everyone you know,
everyone you care about,

69
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,830
it's going to die if you love life,
not waste time because time is what life

70
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,040
is made of.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,160
So if you respect and appreciate the
time that you've been given,

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,620
one,
you out there doing what you want to do,

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,750
where you need to be telling yourself is
it's an acceptable to be seen around the

74
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,330
procrastinate.
And I no longer wanted to be a loser.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,900
I no longer want to be awkward.
I know what it is that I want and I'm

76
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,370
going to work hard and I'm going to get
it.

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,350
When you want to succeed,
as bad as you want to breathe,

78
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,930
then you'll be successful.
Someone you lost late morning.

79
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,170
My success,
and I'm here to tell you today,

80
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,950
if you're going to be successful,
you've got to be willing to give up

81
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,830
sleep.
You gotta be willing to work on for

82
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,150
three hours of sleep,
two hours.

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,630
If you really want to be successful,
some days you will have to stay up three

84
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,464
days in a row,

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,180
but you don't need to
if you don't really want it.

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,450
How badly are you wanting success rather
than actually working towards your

87
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,310
dreams?
A lot of you are just thinking about it.

88
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,950
I have high hopes for everybody watching
this.

89
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,170
I want to remember your name.

90
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,390
It is not the things we do in life that
we regret on our deathbed.

91
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,560
It is the things we do,
not because I assure you I've done a lot

92
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:14,130
of really stupid things.
None of them bothered me.

93
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,250
All the mistakes and all the dopey
things and all the times I was

94
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,690
embarrassed.
They don't matter.

95
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,890
Find your passion and in my experience,
no matter what you do at work,

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,340
what you do in official settings,
that passion will be grounded in people.

97
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,420
Pound,
grounded in the relationships you have

98
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:44,421
with people and what they think of you.
When your time comes

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,450
in the teeth of these stupefying odds,
which is you and buy,

100
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,660
you know ordinariness.
That's right here.

101
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,910
Oh,
one thing I can tell you every single

102
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:10,310
day of my life,
if I trying to find somebody else to

103
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,420
change their life,
I waited till 39 to get married because

104
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:30,211
I had to wait that long.
Or for happiness was more important,

105
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,790
the Fi,
and if nothing else,

106
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:38,791
I hope that all of you can find that
kind of passion and that kind of love in

107
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,140
your lungs.
Thank you.

108
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,140
A Journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step,

109
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,220
so I'm an old Chinese proverb.
Most people have heard it or have come

110
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:08,530
across it at some point and the meanings
pretty straightforward,

111
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,280
right?
And advocates having the courage to take

112
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:14,190
that step towards a goal and that's
huge,

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,670
and making that decision to move forward
towards something you want,

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,710
but it's what happens immediately
following that first step that I'm

115
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,340
interested in.
What happens when the journey's be gone

116
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,770
and it's you and your goal in all of a
sudden you realize how long that road

117
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:36,850
ahead really is.
Now this is a turning point for a lot of

118
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:41,851
people and those who can succeed or able
to take their daunting,

119
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,920
intimidating goal or journey and see it
for what it really is.

120
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,750
Just a bunch of small manageable tasks
strung together.

121
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,130
You know,
when you look at why people quit,

122
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,900
a lot of the time it's because they were
overwhelmed by their goals and

123
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:09,850
ambitions.
Well,

124
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,020
let's say you have this wonderful plan
in your head to climb a mountain.

125
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,110
You're thinking about that feeling of
being on top,

126
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,260
looking down with pride.
Every time you think about it,

127
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,960
your heart starts racing,
so you pack your stuff,

128
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,870
you make your way down in the base of
the mountain and then you look up

129
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,500
different ballgame right now,
the entire mountains in front of you and

130
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:35,250
you realize that that's no small feat.
That is when people walk away,

131
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,200
when they aren't able to see a challenge
as a sum of tiny steps.

132
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,680
They see it as a crazy impossible task.
It's like saying you want to be the next

133
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:53,110
Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall
mountain to climb,

134
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,370
like trying to hit a target from a mile
away.

135
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,980
But if you can identify and map out what
you need to conquer in order to become a

136
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,110
better basketball player,
a football player,

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,070
and begin taking those small steps
improving every day,

138
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,520
that makes dreams real.
That's what gives goals life,

139
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,750
the ability to see your objective not as
a marathon,

140
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,720
but as a series of little 400 meters
stretches,

141
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,040
stepping stones.
You know what your objective is today,

142
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,860
tomorrow,
the end of the week and the end of the

143
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,020
year,
and then completing them day by day.

144
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:32,050
These little victories,
that's what gives you a dream life.

145
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:35,680
It's what gives you momentum.
You feel good about the process

146
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,860
and by the way,
when things blow up in your face,

147
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,420
which happens every so often on this
little place we call earth,

148
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,770
you'll have that foundation and that
sense of accomplishment to stay focused

149
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,860
because your approach is tangible and
it's realistic.

150
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,640
This applies with everything.
Losing a job,

151
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,990
a breakup,
failing a test.

152
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
These things that are monumental.
If you allow them to be,

153
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,120
you know,
they can turn into that unclimbable

154
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:09,121
mountain
or they can roll map a new path for you.

155
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,220
And if you define what you want,
you define success and begin stepping

156
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,650
towards it one hour,
one day at a time,

157
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,230
you'll get where you want to be quicker
than you thought.

158
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,580
What changes our whole life is action.
Why don't we take action?

159
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,660
Fear?
Well,

160
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,200
we got to do to get ourselves to do it.
We got to make sure that we push

161
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,730
ourselves through it by making a
decision.

162
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,150
The point in which change happens is
that decision,

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,750
every change in your life that you want
will come from something simple.

164
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,340
A decision people are,
what does it take to change?

165
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,420
Decide
if I persist,

166
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,370
if I continue to try,
if I continue to trudge forward,

167
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I succeed.
I will persist until I succeed.

168
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,400
I was not delivered under this world in
defeat,

169
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,560
nor does failure course in my veins.
I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded

170
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,700
by my shepherd.
I am a lion and I refuse to talk,

171
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,460
to walk,
to sleep with the sheet.

172
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,790
Don't be a follower.
Be a student.

173
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,060
Take advice but not orders.
Take information.

174
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:25,840
But don't let somebody you know order
your life not to do what someone else

175
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,300
says.
Take what someone else says.

176
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,690
Processing.
Think about it.

177
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,520
Ponder it makes you wonder,
makes you think,

178
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,820
then it's valuable.
Then when you go take action,

179
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,980
make sure that the actions,
not what somebody told you.

180
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,140
Make sure the action is the product of
your own.

181
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,890
What I'm exactly where I wanted to be
because I realized I've got to commit my

182
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:51,100
very being to this thing.
I gotta I gotta read it.

183
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,420
I got to eat it and until you get there
will never be successful.

184
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,200
Once you get there,
I guarantee you the world is yours.

185
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,490
Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.
Can Bench yourself.

186
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,160
Reinvent yourself.
Change your tone and shave so often that

187
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,200
they can never categorize you.
Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is

188
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,120
be self taught and reinvent your life
because you mentioned it to you'll life

189
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,793
and they choose to

190
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,480
belongs only to you.

191
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,390
Positive Vibes.
What my hope is to pick tool,

192
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,820
not
everybody that comes in and out.

193
00:13:55,821 --> 00:14:00,821
Your life is put in place.
If this is just a totally happy place,

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
this
gain the courage and to

195
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,040
every body is put in place in your life,

196
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,530
not to fail.

197
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,710
No,
I never want to be that nine to five

198
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,770
person that just lives my entire life
working a nine to five and just be happy

199
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,750
with a modest lifestyle.
Um,

200
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:28,620
you know,
being secure.

201
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,300
A lot of people,
that's all they want and they just want

202
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,340
a secure lifestyle.
Um,

203
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,750
you know,
own a house,

204
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,730
you know,
and be able to retire and that makes

205
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:36,451
them happy,
you know?

206
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:39,270
And I just believe that we should always
be,

207
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,630
always be pushing,
you know,

208
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,710
to achieve more.
It's become more,

209
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,180
you know,
and sit at a job.

210
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:49,830
The same job for 30 years is not
something I would ever choose to do in

211
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,710
the society.
Know we,

212
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,820
we are tied to go to college and get a
job.

213
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,240
That's what we're taught.
If you become a doctor or a lawyer,

214
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,630
you're successful,
you know.

215
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,270
But most of the time you still have a
boss,

216
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,060
so have someone you know Tony what to do
and you still have this schedule and you

217
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:10,680
have to stick to,
um,

218
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,990
you know,
so it's not much different than working

219
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,700
at Mcdonald's.
I mean it's just you're making more

220
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,250
money but you're still on the same exact
situation.

221
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,390
And you know,
working at Mcdonald's is not sinking or

222
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,820
same scenario and making more money,
you know,

223
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,980
to me,
you got to enjoy what you're doing and

224
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,140
you know,
to have the lifestyle and the freedom to

225
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,880
do what you want when you want.
You know,

226
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:32,550
it was the most incredible thing.
People don't understand it.

227
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,280
You got to work hard at whatever you do,
whether you're working for someone else

228
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,180
or working for yourself.

229
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,620
And if you want to put that in,
you know,

230
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,910
you're going to end up being successful.
You can't be satisfied.

231
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,510
But that's what keeps us going.
You know,

232
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:47,511
when you become content then whites over
the mentality is what's going to make

233
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,410
things happen,
you know,

234
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,190
is having a mentality of never give up,
keep pushing forward and trying to

235
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,230
accomplish your goals.
And hopefully that you have more goals,

236
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,470
constantly trying to move on to bigger
and better things and trying to improve

237
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:05,490
ourselves in every area.
You really have to believe what you're

238
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,760
doing is working.
You know,

239
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,440
it was very important to believe you
have to believe to achieve.

240
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,210
If you're doing something,
you're not hundred percent confident

241
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:13,770
what you're doing,
you're going to fail.

242
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
You know,
someone who is doing something,

243
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,870
maybe not 100% correctly,
but they truly believe in their mind

244
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,170
that they're doing the best they can
possibly do and they believe what

245
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,970
they're doing is the best possible
scenario.

246
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,490
I think they're going to have a lot more
success than someone that is doing it

247
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,500
100% right but aren't positive and what
they're doing.

248
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,430
You know,
the mind is the most powerful tool we

249
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,410
have.
And in order to be a winner,

250
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,650
you have to lose.
You know,

251
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,560
you know,
that's,

252
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,740
that's,
that's how you learn.

253
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,040
You know,
one day I may is telling me I better get

254
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,810
out there and you know,
start busting your ass,

255
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,130
you know,
going forward and never stopped.

256
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:48,130
Don't miss a day.
You know one day miss is that you can't

257
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,320
get back.
Always.

258
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:53,080
Always look at the positive.
You know the glass is always half full.

259
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,920
If you think positive and you look at
the positive,

260
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,050
you know you're,
you're only going to continue to get

261
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,880
better.
And it's being positive in every area is

262
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,110
the secret.
You know,

263
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,963
it's a secret to life.

264
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,800
If you're negative about anything you're
going to fail no matter what it is.

265
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,280
You're not happy,
you want to be better.

266
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,930
But that's what you one in every aspect.
Like you want to better yourself and

267
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:20,931
every way
a lot of people,

268
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,110
you
know,

269
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,660
and it just comes around,
goes around.

270
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,100
The most important thing is fight in
life and not give a shit what other

271
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:37,911
people think.
You know?

272
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,670
That's the most important thing.
And to have that kind of an attitude or

273
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:43,770
mentality is rare.
You know,

274
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,390
people are always concerned about what
other people think,

275
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,420
no matter who they are.
It really doesn't matter what other

276
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,590
people think,
you know?

277
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:56,670
It really doesn't matter if you can have
that kind of mentality is so much

278
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,420
further in life.
People don't like to think they like to

279
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,410
ask.
No,

280
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,800
they don't like to fake.
And they don't have enough confidence in

281
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,960
their decisions that they make on their
own.

282
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,410
When they get advice from someone else,
that gives them more confidence to

283
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:11,430
believe that that's going to work.

284
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,140
We should always be trying,
you know,

285
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,810
to be better at every aspect in life.
I mean,

286
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,910
you know,
are you a good husband?

287
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,310
Are you a good wife?
Are you a good son?

288
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,690
You know,
are you a good,

289
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,490
you know,
you know,

290
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,230
whatever it could be.
You know,

291
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,240
there's a million things in life that we
are,

292
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,940
we,
I think we should constantly be trying

293
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:36,941
to be better in every area.
I kind of liked to just,

294
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,120
you know,
relax,

295
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,300
you know,
enjoy life and that's kind of what I do.

296
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,390
Um,
and being able to,

297
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,180
to not stress and do what I want to do
when I want to do it.

298
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,380
It's just a great feeling.

299
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,640
Whatever it takes to get you to try
harder.

300
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,250
Read Mar,
set your goals and go for it.

301
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,040
Here's the next attitude.
Disease over caution.

302
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,213
Okay.

303
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,290
Some people never will have much there
too cautious.

304
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,980
Now you can also be too reckless,
but you can also be too cost.

305
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,640
Yes.
This is called the timid approach to

306
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:24,641
life
and my caution was always the risk.

307
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,080
Risk used to drive me right up the wall.
I used to say,

308
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:35,081
what if this happened?
It's called the language of the poor.

309
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,860
What if this happens?
And on top of that,

310
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:42,070
if this was to happen,
look at the Phipps ib and I better not

311
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:42,904
try.

312
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,723
Okay?

313
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,420
I could always ask myself out.
Then I'll tell you what changed my whole

314
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:53,260
life when I finally discovered it's all
risky.

315
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,563
Yeah.

316
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,930
The minute you were born at got risky.
If you think trying is risky,

317
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,180
wait til they hand you the bill for not
trying.

318
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,220
If you think investing is risky,
wait till you get the tab or not

319
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,060
investing.
See,

320
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,400
it's all risky.
Getting married is risky.

321
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,920
Having children as risky,
going into business is risky.

322
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,440
Investing your money as risky.
It's all risky.

323
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,640
I'll tell you how risky life is.
You're not going to get out alive.

324
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,180
Huh?
That's risky.

325
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,600
They Englishman says,
well,

326
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,770
if that's the way it's going to work
out,

327
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,540
let's give it a go.
Right?

328
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,820
That's what it's for.
Give it a go.

329
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,851
Somebody says,
yeah,

330
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,420
but I'm looking for safety and security.
Find then huddle in a corner,

331
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,490
little cover you with a sheet.
Bring it three meals a day and we'll

332
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:45,960
protect you.
Feed you.

333
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,290
Look after you care for you.
We won't let anything happen to you and

334
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,250
you'll probably live to be 100
the guy said,

335
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:54,491
well,
yeah,

336
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:57,400
I'd live to be 100 but what a way to
live,

337
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,430
right?
What a way to live safe and secure dog.

338
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,320
Ask for security.
Ask for adventure.

339
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,310
Better to live 30 years full of
adventure than a hundred years safe in

340
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,500
the corner

341
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,420
and see it's not important how long you
live.

342
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:23,421
What's important is how you live.
Here's the next attitude.

343
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,610
Disease.
We're almost through with this motley

344
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:28,151
list.
In fact,

345
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,410
we're almost through.
Hang on.

346
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,700
The next one is pessimism.

347
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,513
Okay?

348
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,980
Pessimism,
the deadly disease of always looking on

349
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:42,780
the bad side,
the problem side,

350
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,240
the difficult side,
checking all the reasons why it can't be

351
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:49,110
done.
The poor pessimists leads an ugly life.

352
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,760
He doesn't try to figure out what's
right.

353
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:56,900
He tries to figure out what's wrong.
He doesn't look for virtue.

354
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,090
He looks for faults and when he finds
him,

355
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,740
he's delighted how ugly
this is.

356
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,260
The poor guy looks through the window,
doesn't see the sunset.

357
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,350
He sees the specs on the window
and this is the poor guy,

358
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,480
right?
Who rushes up,

359
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,330
takes us to leave of your senses.
This guy rushes up and he says,

360
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,550
I've got five good reasons why it won't
work.

361
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,770
He's so dumb.
He doesn't know.

362
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:24,660
All you need is one.
He's got five

363
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,790
to the pessimists.
The glass is always half m d to the

364
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,520
optimist.
The glass is half full.

365
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,520
Why would the same measure affect
people?

366
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,020
Two different ways.
Answer.

367
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,200
It all depends on how you look at it.
Our lives are mostly affected by the way

368
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,860
we think.
Things are not the way they are.

369
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,780
The way we think they are affects us
know.

370
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,073
Yeah.

371
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,540
There's a subject we don't have time to
get into tonight called better thinking

372
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:09,680
habits.
One of the major things shoaff taught me

373
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,300
when I met him.
He said,

374
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:15,290
poor thinking habits keeps most people
poor,

375
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,680
not poor working habits.
Most people work hard,

376
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,790
but they don't think hard.
And shoaff taught me that the mind is

377
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,070
like a factory,
a mental factory,

378
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,030
and whatever you think about all day
long pours ingredients into this mental

379
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,010
factory,
and that's what bill's,

380
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,350
the economic,
social,

381
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,280
financial fabric of your life.
He quoted me a Bible phrase that says as

382
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:47,711
you think so you become
how awesome.

383
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,310
When he talked about poor thinking
habits,

384
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,460
he had me,
I used to start the day reading the

385
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,070
morning newspaper.
I mean,

386
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,830
you can leave that or not.
I'd get a cup of coffee and read the

387
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,380
paper.
I load up on wars and riots and murders

388
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,320
and stabbings and killings and bank
robberies or muggings and car wrecks and

389
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,430
tragedies.
I'd even read the back pages.

390
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,130
I seem to like that stuff for some weird
reason.

391
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,470
I'd load up on all that and then I start
the day.

392
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,210
You can imagine the kind of days I used
to have you walk around on your

393
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:21,920
financial needs.
They call you economic peewee.

394
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,453
Good.

395
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,290
The guy says,
I want to be a great leader.

396
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,740
Wonderful.
The first thing we do is follow him to

397
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,960
his house.
When we get there,

398
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,560
we walk in and check his library.

399
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,080
Number one,

400
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,891
somebody says,
well,

401
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:50,891
why check his library?
The reason is because what a man reads

402
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:56,801
pours massive ingredients in to his
mental factory and the fabric of his

403
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,530
life is built from those ingredients.

404
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,960
You would not believe what some people
have got in their house to read.

405
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,490
You would not believe one of the best
dressed up boards.

406
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:16,491
I know for a lot of it is trash.
Can you imagine dumping a bale of trash

407
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,370
into this mental factory every day and
coming out with a rich dynamic,

408
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,500
positive life?
It can be done.

409
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,000
You might as well try making a cake with
cement.

410
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,630
The kids back in Danbury,
Connecticut High School,

411
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,010
they're asking me questions.
One day I'm talking to the kids.

412
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,920
Kids got good questions these days.
One of them said to me,

413
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,440
Mr Rohan,
how do you build the good life?

414
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,340
I said,
it's simple.

415
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,600
It's not easy,
but it's simple.

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Here's how you build anything.
Select the right ingredients,

417
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,640
keep out the wrong ingredients,
and it starts with thought.

418
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,050
Everything starts with thought,
so you must be wise and careful what you

419
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,510
think about because that starts
everything.

420
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,693
Okay?

421
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,120
You gotta be wise and careful.
I asked the kids

422
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,990
what would happen if somebody drops
sugar in my coffee?

423
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,431
They said,
well,

424
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,590
you'd be okay.
I said,

425
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,170
what if somebody dropped strychnine in
my coffee?

426
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,061
They said,
well,

427
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:33,130
you'd be dead.
I said,

428
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:37,510
correct.
Less than one life is both sugar and

429
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:42,511
strict nine
you got a big care full.

430
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,580
I said,
what is my worst enemy?

431
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:48,350
Drops in the sugar.
They said,

432
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,190
well,
you'll be okay.

433
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,710
I said,
what if my best friend,

434
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,720
even by accident drops in the
strychnine?

435
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,471
They said,
well,

436
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:55,910
you'd be dead.
I said,

437
00:26:55,911 --> 00:27:00,911
correct lesson to watch your cough.
You gotta be careful.

438
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,970
See,
it doesn't matter who hands you the bad

439
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:10,430
stuff.
It doesn't matter where you get the bad

440
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,830
stuff.
It'll still do its damage on your bank

441
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:17,831
account wherever you get it.
Mr Shelf gave me one of the greatest

442
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:20,800
phrases when I first met him when he
said,

443
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:25,801
gym every day.
Stand guard at the door of your mind.

444
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,700
How important.
Stand guard at the door of your mind

445
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,030
and you decide what goes into your
mental factory.

446
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:46,750
Don't let anybody just dump anything
they want to in your mental factory

447
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,370
cause you've got to live with the
results.

448
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,480
Okay,
here's the last disease and we're

449
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,710
through with this list.
In fact,

450
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,760
we're almost through.
Hang on.

451
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,150
The last subject is very brief,
the last disease,

452
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:05,700
but this one is deadly.
Engage in this.

453
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,090
When indulgent it even slightly and you
might as well forget the future because

454
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:14,091
it's going to forget you complaining,
crying,

455
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,250
whining,
griping,

456
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,550
a Bible word called murmuring.
See,

457
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:25,551
that'll ace your future.
Spend five minutes complaining and you

458
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:30,300
have wasted five and you may have begun
what's known as economic cancer of the

459
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:33,990
bone.
Surely they will soon haul you off into

460
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:38,340
a financial desert and there let you
choke on the dust of your own regret.

461
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,880
I hope I said that well so you won't
forget.

462
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,020
It's a deadly disease.

463
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,340
If you don't think it's bad,
ask the children of Israel of Old

464
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,310
Testament fame.
Typical of us all their story just

465
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:56,550
happened to get in the book.
Story says,

466
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,470
children of Israel were slaves.
God performed a series of dazzling

467
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,940
miracles and got him out,
and now they're heading for the promised

468
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:06,060
land.
Remember,

469
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:10,170
the story hadn't for the promise land
tragedy of the story.

470
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,290
They never got their reason from day
one.

471
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,670
They started to complain.
They griped about the water.

472
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,760
They griped about the weather.
They whined and cried and griped about

473
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:31,260
the food they griped about the
leadership.

474
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,930
They whined and cried because it was too
far,

475
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,910
too cold,
too hot,

476
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,130
too difficult,
too miserable.

477
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,330
I mean,
they widened,

478
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,830
whined and cried for years.
Finally,

479
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,260
God said,
I've added tip canceled

480
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,950
or something like that.
The story says they died in the desert,

481
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,540
never got to the promised land.

482
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,720
Okay?

483
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,570
Which I think means two things.
Indulge in this long enough.

484
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:07,890
You get your future cancer,
and I guess it also means even God

485
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,080
himself can only take so much,

486
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,203
okay?

487
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,750
Just be on the lookout of the things
that can destroy all the good you start

488
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,643
the war is on.

489
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:24,950
Yeah,

490
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,420
and this evening.
Tomorrow,

491
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,710
mentally,
personally,

492
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,060
socially,
economically.

493
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,670
You got to make sure you're winning the
war.
