1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,720
There's this thing that exists,
this,

2
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:13,320
this multi-headed snake,
and it's got this infinity problem.

3
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,450
It's everywhere.
That's that little circle down there,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,670
and the problem is,
well,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,200
what do you do with it?
You cut off one head,

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,220
seven more,
grow.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,710
That's the eternal problem of life and
the problem is they're there.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,630
There is the category of problems in
life and it ain't going anywhere.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,340
And so the question is can you deal with
the whole category at the same time?

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,150
That's the thing.
That's how to be in the world is to deal

11
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,820
with that category all at the same time
and so how did,

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,850
how did human beings,
what did they come up with as a

13
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,920
solution?
And that's so cool too,

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,700
because the solution they come up with
not only was the heroism that allows you

15
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,660
to approach what you're terrified by and
what you find that offensive and to

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,620
learn from it,
but also the idea of sacrifice and that

17
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:01,950
was played out by cultures everywhere,
including human sacrifice.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,670
And you think what the hell was up with
those crazy bastard so long ago?

19
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,010
They were sacrificing to the gods all
the time,

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,250
but kind of clueless behavior was that
burned something and please God burned

21
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,570
something valuable and pleased.
God.

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,930
It's like,
what was with that?

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,190
What were they thinking?
Well,

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,930
they weren't stupid.
Those people,

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,910
if they were stupid,
we wouldn't be here.

26
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:25,620
They were not stupid,
and believe me,

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,770
they lived under a lot harsher
conditions than we do.

28
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:31,260
So those were some tough people,
man.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,530
You know,
back then you'd last about 15 minutes.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,790
So you don't want to be thinking of your
ancestors as stupid,

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,330
like there's no real evidence that we're
much different cognitively than we were

32
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,750
150,000 years ago.
So anyways,

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,360
sacrifice.
What does that mean?

34
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,410
Sacrifice?
Well,

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,980
it's a discovery man.
It's the discovery of the future.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,080
It's like the future is actually the
place where there is threat and it's

37
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,860
always going to be there.

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,520
So what do you do?
You make sacrifices in the present so

39
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:05,550
that the future is better,
right?

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,610
Everyone does that.
That's what you're doing right now.

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,370
That's what you're doing here.
That's what your parents are doing when

42
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,050
they pay money to send you to
university,

43
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,260
they think you can bargain with reality.
It's amazing.

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,070
You can bargain with reality.
You can force stole gratification now

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,470
and it'll pay off at a place in time
that doesn't even exist yet.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,500
It's like,
who wouldn't believe that?

47
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,160
It's like that's a miracle that that
occurs and it's not like people just

48
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:39,180
figured that out overnight.
We were champs for Christ's sake.

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,610
Like how are we going to come up with an
idea like that?

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,140
While it's like,
well,

51
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,440
we thought about it for 7 million years
and you know,

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,960
we got to the point where we could kind
of act it out,

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,000
but we didn't know what we were doing,
but it was a emerge is like a dream.

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,030
It was so the terror of the future is a
dream and his solution to the terror,

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,560
the dream of the terror of the future is
another dream and it comes out in

56
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,690
mythology and in fantasy and in drama
where you act out the sacrifice and then

57
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,640
it's a step on the way to full
understanding.

58
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,880
So we can say sacrifice now instead of
doing it,

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,500
you know,
although we still do it,

60
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,020
it's just not conquer like it used to
be.

61
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,090
We do abstractly and we all have faith
that it will work,

62
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,000
you know,
and we also set up our society so that

63
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,770
it'll work.
And one thing about,

64
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,390
you know,
I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a

65
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,840
variety of reasons,
partly because I think it's an,

66
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,210
it's an extreme form of cowardice.
But anyways,

67
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,280
apart from that,
no,

68
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:42,971
no,
no,

69
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,980
no.
There's minimal ways that you can set up

70
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,981
a society that will work and so one of
them is that this society has to be set

71
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,280
up so that your sacrifices will pay off
or you won't work,

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,930
and then the society will die.

73
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,980
And so it has to make promises.
People have to make promises to one

74
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,510
another.
And that's what money is.

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,920
Money is a promise that your sacrifice
will pay off in the future.

76
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,820
That's what money is.
And so if the society is stable,

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you can store up your work right now.
You can sacrifice your impulses and you

78
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:21,031
can work and you can store up credit for
the future and then you can make the

79
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:25,000
future a better place,
but society has to be stable enough to

80
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,270
allow for that.
Hyperinflation will do you in.

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,130
So the promise that's implicit in the
currency is the promise that what you're

82
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:37,000
doing now will pay off in the future,
and if people don't have that promise,

83
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,050
then what?
We know what they do because in any

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,440
gangs,
for example,

85
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:45,310
and say gangs in North America,
the time horizon of the gang members

86
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,950
shrinks rapidly because they don't
really expect to be alive.

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,220
Pat Much past 21.
And so they get really impulsive and

88
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,210
violent and like,
why the hell not that's.

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,340
That's what you do when,
when the future doesn't matter,

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,480
when it's not real you,
you default back to living in the moment

91
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,260
and you take what you can get right now
and no wonder because you don't know if

92
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,800
you're gonna,
be around in a,

93
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,770
in a year and you get whatever you can.
Well you can bloody well get it and

94
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,830
that's like anarchy that state.
And so you don't want to live in,

95
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,980
some people like to live in that state
because they're really wired for that,

96
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,830
you know?
And so they're,

97
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,870
they're much more comfortable in those
conditions.

98
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,420
They're,
they're kind of like warrior types,

99
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:27,670
I would say in some sense.
But you know,

100
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:32,230
for most people,
that's just where that stress will just

101
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,100
do,
you know,

102
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,410
the stress of a life like that.
So

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,200
I've said that some people will tell you
that the purpose of life is to be happy

104
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:47,280
and those people are idiots and was a
bit of a rough statement.

105
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:52,170
But I what I meant by that.
It was actually inspired by a statement

106
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:55,530
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the
great critic of the Soviet prison

107
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:59,420
system.
And he commented that happiness is

108
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,530
something that's done in by the first
harsh blow that reality deals you.

109
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,120
And,
and,

110
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,850
and I believe this to be the case.
There are many circumstances in life

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,870
where happiness is not only the wrong
response,

112
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,680
but also where the expectation of
happiness as a response,

113
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,190
we'll put you,
the person attempting to be happy in

114
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,470
absolutely the wrong psychological
state,

115
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:26,030
to be prepared for what must be done.
People are built so to speak,

116
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:30,830
to experience a very wide range of
motivational and emotional states that

117
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,560
only bear a tenuous relationship to one
another,

118
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,490
and the reason for that is that the
environment that human beings inhabit is

119
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:42,491
so complex that are adaptation depends
on a variety of very finally

120
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,660
differentiated responses and so there is
a time to be compassionate and there's a

121
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,960
time to be aggressive,
massive,

122
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:53,250
and there's a time to be in pain and
there's a time to be anxious and there's

123
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,040
a time to be joyous and a time to be
satisfied,

124
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,510
and the healthy and well adapted person
has a very wide range of finally

125
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:05,511
differentiated responses which cannot be
boiled down to a single dimension.

126
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,870
Say happiness versus unhappiness.
A life is not that simple.

127
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,600
If it was,
we'd only have one emotional system

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,000
making happiness.
The focal point of your life trivializes

129
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,920
your experiences because in order to
regard anything as truly important,

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,640
you also have to regard it's loss as
truly meaningful,

131
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,080
and that means that to open yourself up
to experiences of deep meaning also

132
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:35,460
simultaneously means that you have to
open yourself up to the possibility of

133
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,210
deep hurt and sore.
It's something strange that I've

134
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:44,211
observed with my students is that when I
state the proposition tubing clearly

135
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:48,870
that life is suffering and that the
purpose of life is not happiness.

136
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,490
They actually experienced that as a
great relief and the reason I believe

137
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,620
that they experienced in this great
relief is they already know it.

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,920
You know,
even if they wouldn't necessarily

139
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:03,330
articulate that their experience has
taught them that life is complex and

140
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:04,380
tragic and difficult.

141
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,410
And the problem with the public
portrayal of the ideal state of

142
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,250
humanness as happiness is that it makes
all of these people.

143
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:17,280
These young people feel ashamed of their
own suffering.

144
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,450
They feel that if they're suffering and
if they find their life tragic in its

145
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,160
essence,
that that means that there's something

146
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,360
wrong with them and instantly that makes
it impossible for them to communicate

147
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:31,740
anything real about their own tragedy
and so it appears to me that the price

148
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:36,270
we paid for being in suffering and then
the issue there,

149
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,630
and I believe that this is what the
greater religious traditions of the

150
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:44,631
world have been attempting to elucidate
is that the purpose of life given that

151
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:49,881
is to identify and and follow a motive
being that makes life justifiable even

152
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,110
given the radical necessity of
suffering.

153
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,770
If you're constantly in a state of
placidity satisfaction and happiness,

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,140
then nothing is going to affect you
deeply enough.

155
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,380
Not your own suffering and the suffering
of other people,

156
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,050
not injustice,
not not the horrors of the world.

157
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:14,640
Nothing is going to affect you deeply
enough so that you'll become deep and

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,470
life without depth is by definition
shallow and meaningless,

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,360
and there's a problem that's associated
with that because life is tragic and

160
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,050
because life involves suffering.
If your philosophy is shallow and

161
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,760
meaningless,
when you suffer,

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,500
you will become resentful and hostile
and self critical and then you'll become

163
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,310
cruel and destructive,
and so not only is there a necessity for

164
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:49,761
your own mental health to forthrightly
confront the deepest questions of life,

165
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,790
but if you don't,
then you remained a danger to yourself

166
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,680
and maybe more importantly to others,

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,920
you know,
as an adolescent,

168
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,950
you also shed childhood potential to
become the limited but specialized and

169
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,130
potentially useful thing that you will
become.

170
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,450
And so you might say,
well,

171
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,090
is it worth it?
Is it worth shedding that potential?

172
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,490
And Peter Pan's answer to that is,
well,

173
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:16,040
no,
he wants to remain in Neverland as a

174
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,400
magical boy forever,
and he's King of the lost boys,

175
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,830
which I would say is not a very.
That's not much of a dominance

176
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,664
hierarchy,
right?

177
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,300
It's like you're,
you're the king king of the King of the

178
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,740
losers,
so to speak.

179
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,190
People who can't get their act together
and mature.

180
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,830
Now,
and you notice in Peter Pan that Peter

181
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,890
Pan doesn't grow up.
He doesn't establish a relationship with

182
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:41,600
Wendy who's actually real.
He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you

183
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:45,980
know is a ferry and they don't exist and
so she's really in some sense of figure

184
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,380
of his imagination because he won't
mature,

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,590
he can't have an actual relationship
with a genuine person.

186
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,580
So he has to satisfy himself with while
it's something like a pornographic

187
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:58,250
fantasy actually.
So seriously it is.

188
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,530
It is like that.
I mean it's,

189
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,020
it's,
it's a toned down a lot in the movie

190
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:05,330
version obviously,
but still that's what's underlying it.

191
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,820
Now you might say,
well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow

192
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,400
up?
And the answer is the only figure of

193
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:14,720
authority that's around for him as his
captain Hook and he doesn't like Captain

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,010
Hook.
And that's because captain hook is a

195
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:17,810
tyrant.
He's brutal,

196
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
you know,
and he's also a coward because he's,

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,960
he's lost a hand already to a crocodile
with a clock in its stomach.

198
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,720
That's chaos and time,
you know,

199
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,030
that's the dragon that lives underneath
everything.

200
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:32,420
It's like the basset lisc can Harry
Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already

201
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,790
got a piece of him,
which is exactly the case.

202
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,620
Like that crocodile has got a piece of
me,

203
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,670
you know,
I'm older than 50 and so time is already

204
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,590
God,
its grip on me and you know,

205
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,420
part of the problem of being adult is
that you also have to take the fact that

206
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:51,440
your finite and limited into account and
if you're terrified by that,

207
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,980
which people tend to be,
then it can easily turn you into a

208
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,340
tyrant because you're afraid of
everything or disgusted by everything

209
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,590
and you have to ramp up the amount you
control it.

210
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,660
And so Peter Pan looks at Captain
Norcott,

211
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,830
he thinks there's no damn way.
That's what I want to end up as.

212
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,880
So he's got a bad role model.
I've been telling people online in

213
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,970
various ways in the lectures the patient
start fixing the world.

214
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,670
Bye.

215
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,060
Cleaning up the room and I want it to
just elaborate on that a little bit

216
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:22,061
before I get back to the lecture itself.
So I'd say it's become this Internet

217
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,260
weird Internet meme,
you know,

218
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,220
and,
and,

219
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,960
and,
and it's a joke and good.

220
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,820
It's a jewel.
I'm really happy about the fact that so

221
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:35,960
much of this has got like the leaving of
humor and it's really important because

222
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:40,040
that's what stops things from
degenerating into into conflict humor

223
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,150
and I was thinking about this idea of
cleaning up your room in relationship to

224
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:47,810
the mustard seed idea and you see the
thing about cleaning up your room.

225
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,070
This is also something I learned from
Carl young and his studies on alchemy

226
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,760
because for young,
when the alchemist was attempting to

227
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,310
make the philosopher's stone,
he was not only engaged in the

228
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,730
transformation of the material world,
but he was engaged in a process of self

229
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:05,730
transformation that occurred at the same
time as the,

230
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,420
as the chemical Trent,
as the chemical transformation.

231
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,430
So it was a psychological work in some
sense.

232
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,150
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified because the beauty is

233
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:17,360
also important and let's say that all
you have is just a little room like

234
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,480
you're not rich or you're poor and you
don't have any power.

235
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,550
That's another thing,
but you've got your damn room and you've

236
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,010
got this space right in front of you.
You know that,

237
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,630
that that's a part of the cosmos that
you can come to grips with and you might

238
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:29,991
think,
well,

239
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:32,120
what's there in front of you right in
front of you?

240
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,230
And the answer to that is it depends on
how open your eyes art.

241
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,920
That's the proper answer because you
could say,

242
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,510
w William Blake said this,
for example,

243
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,270
eldest Huxley made comments that were
very similar that in a transcendent

244
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,610
state,
you can see infinity in the finite and

245
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,541
you might say,
well,

246
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,820
you can say,
and you can see infinity in what you

247
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,500
have within your grasp.

248
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,140
If you look and you could save,
maybe that's the case with your room and

249
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,590
so you want to clean up your room.
Well,

250
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,150
okay,
how do you do that?

251
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,530
Exactly?
Well,

252
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,950
a room,
his room is a place to sleep and so if

253
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,710
you set your room up properly,
then you figure out how to sleep and

254
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:10,280
when you should sleep and how you should
sleep and then you figure out when you

255
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,830
should wake up and then you figure out,
well what clothes you should wear

256
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,230
because they have to be arranged
properly in your dresser and then you

257
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,690
have to have some place to put your
clothes and you're going to have some

258
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,820
clothes.
You have to figure out what you're going

259
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,170
to wear those clothes to do.
Right,

260
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,960
and then that means you have to figure
out what you're going to do and then

261
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:27,170
your room has to serve that purpose
because otherwise it isn't set up

262
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:27,590
properly.

263
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,610
And if it doesn't set up,
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

264
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,370
you will be unhappy and not happy in the
room.

265
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:39,371
Because the way that we perceive the
world is as a place to move from point a

266
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:43,610
to point B in.
And then if the place that we're in

267
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:46,520
facilitates that movement,
then we're happy to be there.

268
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,630
And if the place that we're in serves as
an obstacle to that movement,

269
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:54,470
then we're unhappy to be there.
And so what it means to set up your room

270
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:57,470
is that you have to have somewhere to go
that's worthwhile,

271
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,860
or you can set up your room and your
room has to be set up to facilitate

272
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:02,930
that.
And then the next thing is,

273
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,730
well,
maybe you have to make it beautiful,

274
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,020
but that's not easy,
right?

275
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,110
That means you have to have some taste
and that doesn't mean you have to have

276
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:09,590
money.

277
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,190
It doesn't,
because you can be garish with money and

278
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:17,390
you can be tasteful with nothing.
All you need is taste and taste beats

279
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,260
money when it comes to beautifying
things.

280
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,710
Not that money is trivial because it's
not.

281
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:26,270
But taste is crucial and people who are
very artistically oriented can make

282
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,100
beautiful things out of virtually
nothing.

283
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,650
And not only that,
the literature suggests that if you're

284
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,160
going to make beautiful things,
putting real constraints on,

285
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,820
on what you allow yourself to do,
facilitates creativity instead of

286
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,610
interfering with it.
Because let's say you have to make

287
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,090
something out of nothing,
right?

288
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,610
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,
right?

289
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,650
You have to make something out of
nothing.

290
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,890
You have to be creative in order to do
that,

291
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,780
and so then to beautify your room means
that you also have to develop your

292
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:58,781
capacity to be creative and so then you
can make your room shine,

293
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,120
but then what will happen is that if
your family isn't together,

294
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,380
they will interfere with that.

295
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,650
You will interfere with that because you
won't have the discipline to do it

296
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,920
properly,
but then when you start building this,

297
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,500
this,
this little microcosm of perfection with

298
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:16,760
what you have at hand and it'll evoke
all the pathologies of everyone in your

299
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,620
household.
The wonder what the hell you're up to in

300
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,950
there and they won't necessarily be
happy because if you're.

301
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
If they're in a lowly place,
let's say and so are you and you're

302
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,670
trying to move out of that,
then the higher you move out of that,

303
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,880
the more the place they're in looks bad
and you might say,

304
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,560
well,
what they should do is celebrate your

305
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,770
victory over chaos and evil,
but that isn't what will happen.

306
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:39,950
What will happen instead is that they
will attempt to pull you back down.

307
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,640
They'll attempt to.
I mean obviously all families don't do

308
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,390
that,
but,

309
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,390
but all families do that to some degree
and some families do almost nothing but

310
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,120
that.

311
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,660
And so what that means is that if you're
going to organize your room,

312
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,320
then you're going to have to confront
the devils in your house and that's

313
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,840
often.
That's often a terrifying thing because

314
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:03,320
some of those devils have have lineages
that go back many,

315
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,200
many,
many generations and God only knows what

316
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,420
you have to struggle with in order to
overcome that.

317
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,550
And so and then and so to sort yourself
out into fix up your room is a

318
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,230
nontrivial matter.
You know,

319
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,160
and you can do that.
You'll learn by doing that and then

320
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,250
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that
so that you can fix up your family a

321
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,230
little bit.
And then having done that,

322
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:27,740
you'll have enough character so that
when you try to operate in the world at

323
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,650
your job or maybe in the broader social
spheres,

324
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,050
that you'll be a force for good instead
of harm.

325
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,860
Because you will have learned some
humility by noting just how difficult it

326
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:40,670
was to put your damn room together well
and yourself for that matter,

327
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:45,110
and so you'll proceed cautiously with
your eyes open towards the good.

328
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,790
I talked to people very frequently whose
families have them with too much

329
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,420
protection and they know it themselves
and that means they're deprived of

330
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,210
necessity.
You know,

331
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,440
one of the things that you see in the
United States,

332
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,310
for example,
is that

333
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,480
the children are first generation
immigrants often do better than the than

334
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:07,340
the than their children.
And the reason for that is that the

335
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,510
children are first generation
immigrants,

336
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,320
have necessity driving them and you
don't know how much you need necessity

337
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,840
to drive you because maybe you're not
very disciplined.

338
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,470
And if an a catastrophe doesn't
immediately befall you.

339
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,830
If you don't act forthrightly today,
then maybe you'll never act

340
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,850
forthrightly,
right?

341
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,050
Because the gap between your foolishness
and the punishment is,

342
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,610
is lengthened by your unearned wealth.
And so you never grow up and learn and

343
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,611
you have to get yourself away from your
dependency in order to allow necessity

344
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:42,000
to drive you forward.
And that's to become independent and to

345
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,880
become mature.
And I think part of what's happening in

346
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,570
our culture is that the,
the,

347
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,630
the force that's attacking the
forthright movement forward of young men

348
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:58,851
in particular is afraid of the power of
man because it's confused about the

349
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,430
distinction between power and authority
and competence.

350
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Like I know a man who's who has
authority and competence has power as a

351
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,920
byproduct,
but the authority and competence is

352
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,120
everything.
And,

353
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,550
and,
and people who can't understand that

354
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,890
fail to make the distinction between
power and authority of competence and

355
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,280
they're afraid of power and so they
destroy authority and competence.

356
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,220
And that's a terrible thing because we
need authority and competence.

357
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,130
What else is going to,
what else is going to allow us to

358
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,330
prevail in the long run?
And so you get away from your country

359
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,450
and you get away from your kin and from
your father's house,

360
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,820
right?
And you go out there and you establish

361
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,950
yourself in the world.
It's a call to adventure.

362
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:44,470
That's what this,
the first lines in the Abrahamic story

363
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:49,350
is a call to adventure.
So great unto a land that I will show

364
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:51,300
you.
Well,

365
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,260
you know,
what does that mean?

366
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,930
You know,
one of the things that

367
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,190
I've been struck very hard by a number
of writers,

368
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,810
Carl Young,
obviously among them,

369
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,890
I mean he,
he wrote things like Nicha that if you

370
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,170
understand them,
they just break you into pieces you

371
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:12,890
know,
and one of the things that you and

372
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,790
understood in the psychoanalysts
understand,

373
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,240
it's one of the most terrifying elements
of psychoanalytic thinking is very

374
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:22,410
tightly aligned with religious thinking,
which is that you are not the master of

375
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:26,010
your own house.
There are spirits that dwelling within

376
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:29,550
you,
meaning you have a will and you can

377
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:33,630
exercise a certain amount of conscious
control over your being,

378
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,810
but there are all sorts of things that
occur within you that seemed to be

379
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,330
beyond your capacity to control your
dreams.

380
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,430
For example.
That's a really good example of your

381
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,600
impulses.
For example,

382
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,340
you might,
you might think of those as so foreign

383
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,420
from you that they're not even.

384
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,690
You don't even want them to be part of,
but,

385
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,160
but more subtly even.
How about what you're interested in?

386
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,890
What compels you like where does that
come from?

387
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,650
Exactly?
Because you can't,

388
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,500
you can't conjure it up of your own
accord,

389
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,930
you know,
so if you're a student and you're taking

390
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,030
difficult course,
you might say to yourself,

391
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,190
well,
I need to sit down and study for three

392
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,200
hours,
but then you sit down and that is what

393
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,870
happens.
Your attention goes everywhere and you

394
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:11,704
might say,
well,

395
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,540
whose attention is it?
Then?

396
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,210
If it goes everywhere because you say
it's your attention,

397
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,044
it's like,
well,

398
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,720
if it's your attention,
maybe you'd be able to control it,

399
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,030
but you can't.
And so then you might think,

400
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,700
well jen and just exactly what the hell
is controlling it.

401
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,991
And you might say,
well,

402
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,330
it's random.
It's better not be random.

403
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,300
I can tell you that that's,
that happens to some degree in

404
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,400
schizophrenia.
There's an element of randomness in

405
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,930
that.
It's not random.

406
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,810
It's driven by the action of phenomena
that I think are best considered as

407
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:43,100
something like subpersonalities or
they'll even.

408
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
That's only a partial description.
You can't make yourself interested in

409
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:53,671
something.
Interest manifests itself in grips you.

410
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,660
That's a whole different thing.
And so what is it that's gripping you

411
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,050
and how do you conceptualize that?
Is that a divine power?

412
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,820
Well,
it's divine as far as your concerned

413
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:06,550
because it grips you and you can't do
anything about it.

414
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,110
And so there's a calling in you towards
what you're compelled by and what you're

415
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:13,270
interested in,
and sometimes that might be very dark

416
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,230
and sometimes not,
but you're compelled forward by your

417
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:19,210
interest.
And so

418
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,030
and so the idea that what moves you away
from your country and your father's

419
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,160
house and the comforts of your childhood
home is,

420
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,790
is something that's beyond you and that
you listened to in Harken to.

421
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,190
That's exactly right.
And you can say,

422
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,630
well,
I don't want to call it that God.

423
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,210
It's like it doesn't matter what you
call it.

424
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,320
Exactly.
It doesn't matter to what it is,

425
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,170
what it's called.
It still is.

426
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,930
And if you don't listen to it,
that's the other thing.

427
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,660
If you don't listen to it,
and I've been a clinician and talked to

428
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,660
enough people now as old as I am to know
this.

429
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:55,180
Absolutely.
If you do not listen to that thing that

430
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:58,030
beckons you forward,
you will pay for it like you cannot

431
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,420
possibly imagine.
You'll have everything that's terrible

432
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,800
about life in your life and nothing
about it that's good and worse.

433
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,180
You'll know that it was your fault and
that you squandered what you could have

434
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:15,181
had.
So this is not only a calling forth,

435
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:19,960
but a warning unto a land that I will
show thee and that's it.

436
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,680
That I will show the that and you don't
want to be too concrete about this.

437
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:26,800
You know,
there's all sorts of new territories

438
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:30,310
that you can inhabit.
If you abstract and conceptual

439
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:33,610
territories of Gilda University and you
study biology or you study physics or,

440
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,010
or any discipline,
you're in a territory,

441
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,690
right?
You're in the territory that all of the

442
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:40,690
scholars have established and then as
you master the discipline,

443
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,970
you move out beyond the established
territory,

444
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,770
into the unknown.
And that's a new right.

445
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,770
Maybe it's even a land of your enemies
for that matter,

446
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,740
but it's a new land to the frontier is
always in front of you.

447
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,860
And so you know,
when they earth was less inhabited than

448
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,920
it is now,
the frontier was the psychological

449
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,950
frontier and the geographical frontier
was the same thing and now they've

450
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,370
separated to some degree because there's
not so much geographical frontier,

451
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,990
but there's the frontier is a place that
never disappears and the land that's

452
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,270
beyond the land that you know is always
there.

453
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,340
And it's always where you should go.
And all of that packed into these four

454
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,430
phrases so
well.

455
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:21,860
So when I've been thinking about
narrative,

456
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,350
you look at the world through a story,
you can't,

457
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,650
you can't help it.
And this story is what gives value to

458
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:31,370
the world or or the stories.
What you extract from the value of the

459
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,720
world.
You can look at it either way,

460
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,300
you're somewhere and it's not good
enough,

461
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,490
right?
That's the eternal human predicament.

462
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,050
Wherever you are,
isn't good enough.

463
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,810
And to some degree that's actually a
good thing because if it was good

464
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:44,180
enough,
well there's nothing for you to do.

465
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,270
So it's actually maybe a good thing that
it's insufficient.

466
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,400
And that might be why sometimes having
less is is better than having more.

467
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,040
And I don't want to be a pollyanna about
that.

468
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,620
I mean,
I know that there's deprivation that can

469
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,070
reach to the point where it's no where
it's completely counterproductive,

470
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,410
but it isn't always the case that
starting with little is you.

471
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,960
If you start with little,
you start with more possibility.

472
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,560
It's something like that.
So you moved from always from what's

473
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:15,020
unbearable about the present to some
better future.

474
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,790
Right?
And if you don't have that,

475
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:20,570
then you have no,
you have nothing but threat and negative

476
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,340
emotion.
You have no positive emotion because the

477
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:26,390
positive emotion is generated in the
conception of the better future.

478
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,450
And then the evidence that you generate
yourself,

479
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,390
that you're moving towards it.
That's where the positive and fulfilling

480
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:34,730
meaning of life comes.
So you want to set up this structure

481
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,900
properly.
It's very,

482
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,660
very important.
And so what it means is that you want to

483
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:43,661
be going somewhere that's good enough so
that the going is worth the while and

484
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:47,420
you can ask yourself that.
And that's partly what we tried to build

485
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,010
into the future authoring program,
which is,

486
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,470
well,
we know what's wrong with life.

487
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,040
It's rife with suffering and
insufficiency and deception and evil.

488
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,020
It's all of that obviously.
Okay.

489
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,640
What would make the journey worthwhile?
Well,

490
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,470
you can ask yourself that.
It's like,

491
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,081
alright,
right.

492
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:06,830
In order to bear up under this load,
what is it that I would need to be

493
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,710
striving to attain?
And if you ask yourself that,

494
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:13,340
that's to knock and the door will open.
That's what that means.

495
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,490
If you ask yourself that,
then you will find an answer and you'll

496
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,290
think you'll shrink away from it.
You'll think,

497
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,000
well,
there's no way I could do that.

498
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,170
It's like,
well,

499
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,580
you don't know what you could do.
You don't know what's possible and

500
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:30,050
you're not as much as you could be,
and so god only knows what you could,

501
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,110
what you could do and have and give if
you sacrificed everything to it.

502
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,270
And that's the reason that Abraham is
constantly making sacrifices.

503
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,440
It's archaic,
right?

504
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:44,220
He's burning up like baby,
but like,

505
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,690
well,
they're alive.

506
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,170
You know that's something and they're
valuable and that's something it's you

507
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,020
have to admit,
even if you think about it as a modern

508
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,930
person,
that the act of sacrificing something

509
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
might have some dramatic compulsion to
it,

510
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,730
you know,
to go out into a flock and to take

511
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:03,420
something that's new board and to cut
its throat into bleed it into burn.

512
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,290
It might be a way of indicating to
yourself that you're actually serious

513
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,700
about something and it isn't so obvious
that we have rituals of seriousness like

514
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:15,390
that now and so it's not so obvious that
we're actually serious about anything

515
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,570
and so maybe that's not such a good
thing and so maybe we shouldn't be

516
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:22,020
thinking that these people were so
archaic and primitive and superstitious.

517
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,450
It's possible that they knew something
that we don't.

518
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,040
It's certainly in the abrahamic stories.
One of the things that maintains

519
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,690
Abraham's covenant with God is his
continual willingness to sacrifice it.

520
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,200
It's so that sacrificial issue is so
important because you are not committed

521
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,510
to something unless you're willing to
sacrifice for it.

522
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,760
Commitment and sacrifice are the same
thing and I think its borders on

523
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:49,020
miraculous that those concepts are
embedded into this narrative at the

524
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,760
level of dramatic action.
You know,

525
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:55,000
instead of abstract explanation,
people are acting this out and the

526
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,810
fundamental conception is so profound
that it's really quite.

527
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,380
It's quite inspiring and it's
breathtaking.

528
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:04,260
Really,
when you understand what message is

529
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:07,920
trying to be conveyed,
you have to make sacrifices and what do

530
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:11,670
you have to sacrifice.
You have to sacrifice that which is most

531
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:16,671
valuable to you currently that stopping
you and God only knows what that is.

532
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,050
It's certainly the worst of you.

533
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,190
It's certainly that and god only knows
to what degree you're in love with the

534
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:27,600
worst of you so
well,

535
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:31,950
so you moved from the unbearable
president to the ideal future and and

536
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,230
you can't help that.
You have to live in a structure like

537
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,190
that.
That's your house.

538
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:38,040
That's another way of thinking about it
and if you want to get your house in

539
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:41,730
order and if you want it to be a place
that you can live properly,

540
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:46,731
then you have to plan the future.
That is perfect.

541
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,010
And then I think,
well,

542
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,610
what does that mean?
It means it's good for you.

543
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,840
Right?
And one of the things that I,

544
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,470
I'm,
I do all the time with my clinical and

545
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,650
consulting clients is trying to figure
out what would be good for them,

546
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,050
but we do more than that.
We try to think,

547
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:04,660
okay,
well what,

548
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,050
how can we set this up so it's really
good for you?

549
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,950
And that all the consequences of that
are things that are good for other

550
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,980
people.
And so because people are often also

551
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,860
timid about trying to get something
that's good for themselves because they

552
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:18,960
feel that it's selfish or that they
don't deserve it.

553
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,970
So we set it up so that.
Well look,

554
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:25,800
we're going to set it up so that it's
plainly obvious that this will not harm

555
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:30,480
the structure of the universe for you to
have what you need and to do it in a way

556
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,870
that's of benefit to other people.
There's no downside,

557
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,680
right?
So let's say you have oriented yourself

558
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,070
but not perfectly because you're full of
and errors.

559
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,970
So then what do you do?
Because you have to fix those errors.

560
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,350
But you still have to be oriented.

561
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,170
This is why I started getting interested
to get interested in the phenomenon of

562
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:56,980
meaning as a,
as a phenomenological experience to

563
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:00,730
experience something as meaningful.
It's not exactly obvious what that means

564
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,520
to experience something as meaningful.
I think that you can,

565
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,100
you can approach it obliquely,
you know,

566
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,430
like if I said,
watch yourself for two weeks and notice

567
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,650
when you're doing something that you
regard as meaningful,

568
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:12,484
I could say,
well here,

569
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,250
here's some,
here's some markers.

570
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,220
You lose a sense of time.
You lose a sense of vulnerability.

571
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:20,470
You're deeply engaged in it.
It seems,

572
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,990
it seems worth the effort,
right?

573
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,760
You forget yourself while you're doing
it.

574
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,360
Maybe you forget your existential
concerns while you're doing it.

575
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:32,740
You're not
ruminating or obsessing about the

576
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:34,570
meaning of your life.
Right?

577
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,830
So,
so there's markers for,

578
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:38,590
it's like the flow states that chicks at
my highly described.

579
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,373
Um,

580
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,860
and then you can experience it.
You experienced it under a certain sort

581
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:48,440
of ritualistic conditions.
You might experience it when you go see

582
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,690
a great movie,
you might experience it when you listen

583
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:52,370
to music.
I think music is a very,

584
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:57,080
very standard pathway for people to have
that kind of experience because

585
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,380
virtually everyone gets intimations of
mute of meaning from music and I think

586
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:07,571
music music is hierarchically structured
patterns that are representative of

587
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,080
being laying itself out properly.
It's something like that,

588
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:17,081
so it's an abstract representation of
proper being and so we can.

589
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,030
We can grapple with the phenomena of
music and we can.

590
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,180
We can bark or phenomenon meaning we can
box it in a little bit and start to

591
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,050
conceptualize it.

592
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,810
W

593
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,040
we can start to conceptualize it perhaps
as the manifestation of a deep instinct

594
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,490
and so I would say well meaning is what
manifests itself when you are,

595
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,830
when you've oriented yourself properly
and when you've optimized the flow of

596
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,860
information between you and you,
between you and chaos.

597
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,830
That might be the right way of thinking
about it because literally you think

598
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,900
about a piece of music because you want
it to be predictable,

599
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,570
but you don't want it to be perfectly
predictable.

600
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:03,320
You want it to be predictable with some
interesting variations and predictable

601
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,200
with some variations that make sense and
maybe you can conceptualize that as

602
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:09,830
something like this.
It's like it's predictable at this order

603
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,600
of of stability,
but it's varying down here from time to

604
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:18,170
time and so you've got stable stability
there,

605
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,560
but variability there and you can handle
that so you want

606
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,530
an overarching structure stability with
some internal variability and maybe

607
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,230
that's the way that you update yourself
without falling apart,

608
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,500
and then I would say you can find the
pathway to the optimal rate of update by

609
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,290
relying on your sense of meaning.

610
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,000
That's what it's for.
What it tells you is that you're.

611
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,170
You're wandering you're way through the
world between the catastrophes of chaos

612
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,910
in the catastrophes of order and now and
then you swing into the proper locale.

613
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,650
You're,
you're where you should be,

614
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,110
and what happens is you get engaged by
that.

615
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,810
You get meaningfully engaged by that and
it's fragile.

616
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,860
It'll move on you,
right?

617
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:05,570
Because it's very difficult to exist at
that point constantly.

618
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,850
Your bad habits,
all sorts of things,

619
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,770
your situation.
There's all sorts of things that are

620
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,190
going to interfere with that,
but that doesn't mean that that isn't

621
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,500
where you should be,
and so then you might say,

622
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,960
well,
that's where you should strive to be all

623
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,120
the time,
and then the question might be,

624
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,310
well,
what would it be like if you were there

625
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:27,311
all the time and I think that's where
intimations of paradise come from being

626
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,560
when words think it was words.

627
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,500
Wordsworth talked about intimations of
immortality and childhood.

628
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,860
People tend to romanticize their
childhood because of the sense of

629
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,120
intense engagement that goes along with
being a child and it's one of the

630
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,710
wonderful things about being around
children.

631
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,340
Actually.
It's,

632
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,810
it's,
it's why they pay you for their care and

633
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:52,220
the way that children pay you for their
care is that they turn normal things

634
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:57,050
into magic again when you're around them
because you've seen it 100 times before.

635
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,060
And so when you see it,
you don't see it.

636
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:02,870
You see what you already know.
But when a child sees that they don't

637
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,640
because they don't know,
they see it.

638
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,490
And then when you watch them see it,
you see it too.

639
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,940
And so it's just,
it's tremendous fun leading a small

640
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,810
child around to do things that you've
done before because they're so,

641
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,340
you know,
they're like this,

642
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,370
they're like all the time and you know,
maybe that's too much.

643
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,200
Then they cry and they get upset and all
of that,

644
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:25,040
but a good part of the time it's just
wild eyed wonder and then you can see

645
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,960
the world through their eyes and it's
payment.

646
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,290
And so that's that sense of being
engaged.

647
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,650
Like that is something that people love
about children and rightly so,

648
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,400
but it's also a marker to the proper way
of being.

649
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,460
You know,
there there's a dictum in the.

650
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,610
This is a union idea that there's no
difference between the archetype of the

651
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,440
wise old man in the archetype of the
child.

652
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,820
They're the same thing because the wise
old man is the person who found what he

653
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,400
had in childhood but lost.
Right?

654
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:53,870
It's a.
that's a very powerful moment.

655
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,640
Tif is that the purpose of maturation is
to return to this state of childhood as

656
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:01,790
a mature being,
not to stay in the state of childhood,

657
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:06,260
that's Peter Pan,
but to make the sacrifices necessary for

658
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:09,440
maturation and then return so well.

659
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,490
How do you do that?
Well,

660
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,230
you do that in part by noticing what it
is that's meaningful for you to engage

661
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,420
in.
I would say it's your nervous system

662
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:20,180
reporting to you,
right hemisphere and left hemisphere

663
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:23,120
balanced.
The balance between chaos and order

664
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,760
produces an output that says you are in
the right place.

665
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,300
It's a perception.
The meaning is a perception of being in

666
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,430
the right place.
It's the genuine thing.

667
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,570
However,
because it can be pathologized.

668
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the thing and that's why I think
there's a call to virtue in most great

669
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:41,910
religious traditions.
If you're going to rely on your sense of

670
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,840
meaning to Orient you,
you have to play a straight game because

671
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:50,760
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs
and then the mechanism won't function

672
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:51,960
properly.
You know?

673
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,030
It's like if you.
If you were only.

674
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,930
If you're,
if you blinded yourself to half the

675
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:00,140
world,
you can't use your perception story at

676
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,150
yourself properly because the half of
the world that you ignoring is going to

677
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:05,730
pop up at you unexpectedly and take you
down,

678
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,600
and so if your relationship with the
world isn't pristine,

679
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,370
honest,
primarily,

680
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,510
then you can't rely on your own internal
orienting mechanisms and then you either

681
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,200
fall into chaos which is an absolute
catastrophe or you have to rely on some

682
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,550
kind of external authority and that
makes you prone to possession by

683
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,320
tyrannical etiologies,
for example,

684
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:28,650
which give you that sense of meaning
that you should in fact have as a

685
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,910
consequence of your own action.

686
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,370
What should you be aiming for in your
life?

687
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,870
I can.
I can tell you that roughly speaking,

688
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,150
if you're looking for something that
will give your life meaning,

689
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:39,050
that's,
that's.

690
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,620
That's actually quite straightforward as
far as I'm thinking in detail.

691
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,610
This is where the nihilists happened so
wrong that it's almost unbelievable as

692
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:48,050
far as I'm concerned.
Fundamentally,

693
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,480
they're just escaping from
responsibility anyways.

694
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Even though they are perfectly rational
arguments for their nihilism.

695
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,640
Everything's meaningless.
It's like,

696
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
no.
First of all,

697
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,940
no pain.
It's not meaningless.

698
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,450
You never going to meet anyone who will
tell you that their pain is meaningless

699
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,870
so we can forego the whole meeting was
right off the bat.

700
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,010
There may be no positive because yes,
we can have a discussion about that,

701
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,900
but south the negative meaning exists
and everyone knows even someone who's in

702
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,110
Archicad,
nihilistic to the core drug,

703
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,870
a spike through their hand,
they're going to act like that has

704
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:28,871
meaning and since I'm not an existential
and look at how people are instead of

705
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:34,040
what they say and they'll act out the
idea that that has meaning very,

706
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,170
very rapid,
so we'll just go with that.

707
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,640
Now you might say,
well,

708
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,990
there's all sorts of,
but that's not the kind of meaning that

709
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,080
I believe doesn't exist.
I believe that only positive meaning

710
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:47,660
doesn't exist,
which is a little on the negative side,

711
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:50,540
I would say at the beginning,
but I can understand it.

712
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,030
People have.
People can have pretty dreadful lights,

713
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,960
you know,
and you can easily get yourself into a

714
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,820
situation where it seems like there's
nothing at all to your life.

715
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,140
Accept suffering.
And that's what happens to people who

716
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,620
become suicidal,
for example,

717
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,920
and it's no joke and they have the
reasons.

718
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:07,370
Now you know sometimes those people have
been hurt in ways that are absolutely

719
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,180
unimaginable and so when they see a
horizon that's full of nothing but

720
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:13,580
suffering,
you can't just wave that away,

721
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,960
but I would say

722
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,750
the first thing we might hypothesize is
that pain is an unalterable fact of

723
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:25,610
meeting and certainly seems to be
negative,

724
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:29,210
but one of the things you might want to
try to orient yourself in relationship

725
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,990
to is the reduction of human suffering.
Now,

726
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,970
because I think that's you know the
answer,

727
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,240
what you do about a child who's
suffering in a concentration camp is it

728
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,880
who the hell is going to care the
billion ears,

729
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,280
right?
That's not the right answer.

730
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,060
And if it's not the right answer in that
situation that perhaps it's not the

731
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:53,530
right answer at all and the right answer
to who the hell is going to care anyways

732
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,100
in a million years is why the world
would you frame in state that

733
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,800
idiotically mean anybody,
anybody?

734
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:03,370
This has kind of a trick of the
imagination in some sense of anybody

735
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:07,270
who's quick witted can come up with a
frame of reference that makes anything

736
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,320
that makes almost anything,
lack meaning within that frame of

737
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,154
reference.

738
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,640
What all that means to me is that you
pick the stupid frequent reference,

739
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,780
right?
Why should you?

740
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,140
Why should you?
Except without doubt,

741
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:22,090
the consequence of your stupid
algorithm.

742
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,000
Who's going to care in a million years?
Yeah,

743
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,710
God,
really,

744
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,360
you got to be able to do better than
that.

745
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:30,060
If that's what you're going to wipe
meaning.

746
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,870
Well,
so what do you want for meaning?

747
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,460
All right,
reduce suffering.

748
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,040
That'd be a good one.
You could devote your life to that and I

749
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,720
would say start locally and,
and,

750
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,810
and I think this is the alternative to
rightly nationalism and which is too

751
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:46,900
much order and left wing the chaos,
which is too much chaos.

752
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,850
We don't want to go down that rabbit
hole again,

753
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,280
either of it.
So what's the alternative?

754
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,990
I thought about this for a very long
time.

755
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,000
It took me decades to come to this
conclusion.

756
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,720
The conclusion is just that you
straightened yourself out and you do

757
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,620
that humbling.

758
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,250
Here's this idea that the new testament,
which I get quite a kick out of,

759
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,550
that you're not supposed to pray in
public and a little more complicated

760
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,131
than that.
Actually.

761
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:11,140
You're not supposed to frame the problem
until you sorta out the dispute that you

762
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,150
have with your brother.
For example.

763
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,170
I really like that idea because what it
means is that you shouldn't make a

764
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,710
public display of your virtue until
you've straightened up your damn life,

765
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,220
and this is one of the things I really
liked about protests and I really don't

766
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:27,640
like the fact that university students
are taught by their pathway and

767
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,530
professors.
That the way that you change your world.

768
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:35,870
Thank you.

769
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,160
You don't change the world by going and
waving signs that people that you've

770
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:50,480
defined as more equal than,
but first of all probability that

771
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,850
they're more useful than you is actually
quite low

772
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:59,390
because he up may be you're in the same
damn boat and if you've divided the

773
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:03,230
world up conveniently so that you can
identify the innocence and the and the

774
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:06,560
dam or the oppressor and the oppressed,
and you think that if you're in the

775
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,470
positive category,
then the probability that you're part of

776
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:12,620
the solution and not part of the problem
is zero.

777
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,950
So it's just not that easy.
Know I'm the most profound people that

778
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:19,050
don't have you said the same thing over
and over.

779
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:22,040
It's like the line between good and evil
runs down the middle of every human

780
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,220
heart and the first thing that you're
supposed to do is win that battle on

781
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,800
your own territory,
and that's no bloody joke.

782
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,370
That's a difficult thing to do because
it means that you have to recognize

783
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:34,520
that.
Recognize yourself as a of gravy and

784
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:38,660
that is what you are and that's a
terrible thing for me to learn.

785
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,850
You know,
when you look at the 20th century and

786
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:41,631
you think,
well,

787
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:45,260
who brought on the horrors of the
cognitive systems and the horrors of the

788
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:47,960
Nazi system is the answer is people just
like you.

789
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,960
That's the answer.
If you don't understand that and you

790
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:55,770
think that answer is wrong,
then you're not very wise and the and

791
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,090
it's not surprising because the price
that you paid for wisdom,

792
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:02,660
this is radical disillusion,
disillusion lip and the confrontation

793
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:05,630
with England and no one wants that.
Really.

794
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,490
It's a terrible thing to confront and
that's because human beings are terrible

795
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,370
creatures.
Now.

796
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:13,670
I think we're also absolutely remarkable
creatures and wonderful creatures.

797
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,800
We have an unlimited capacity for
brutality and evil and every one of us

798
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,040
carries it,
and so what you do is you try to sort

799
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,380
that out in your own life and you start.

800
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,120
I haven't gotten to talk to me just a
while back about about his life.

801
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:32,150
Haven't been going very well.
He decided to put himself together and

802
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:33,890
he started doing this little ritual
thing,

803
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:38,120
which I thought was quite cool.
He was kind of an isolated guy,

804
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,770
very overweight guy.
When I talk to him,

805
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,850
he lost about 130 pounds,
which was quite impressive for this part

806
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:47,210
of the putting himself together,
but he started doing it by bill.

807
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:51,020
He had a bunch of labels leftover from
his childhood and the first thing he

808
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,880
did,
because he was feeling very nihilistic

809
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,670
and hopeless,
he,

810
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,280
he,
he found that he got a little bit of

811
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,080
satisfaction out of building little
things,

812
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,150
other labels,
you know,

813
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,040
and I thought,
well that was pretty interesting.

814
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,240
And so he built a bunch of these things
and then he said,

815
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,730
well,
I got a bunch of these things built.

816
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,670
Then I had to figure out how to organize
them in the room angry.

817
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,700
I thought that's cool because he started
higher resolution at the level of

818
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:11,401
detail.
You know,

819
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,130
what it was building something that was
trivial.

820
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,780
He knew that he was just playing the
game,

821
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,210
but then as soon as he had a collection
of those,

822
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:20,300
then you have to sort out the space that
he was going to organize them in many

823
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,960
figured out under sort of the room that
they were going to be.

824
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,720
So we started organizing and beautifying
the room and at the same time he

825
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,150
modified his diet and he was putting
himself together.

826
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,500
That's the right thing to do.
That's the right thing to do is that

827
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,660
there is,
there are responsibilities that are

828
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:39,110
awaiting you,
right that are in your own grass and you

829
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,720
know what they are.
And this is also something that no one

830
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,370
can preach to you about.

831
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,400
It's something you have to decide for
yourself and you can do it quite

832
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,160
straightforwardly.
It's something that I do on a regular

833
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:51,710
basis.
You sit down the anything or in the

834
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:56,711
morning and ask yourself like you're
asking someone that you want the answer

835
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:00,290
from like really genuinely needed to
have the chicken.

836
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,830
Not telling yourself none of that.
You're asking yourself,

837
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,950
right?
There's a bunch of things about my life

838
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,040
that are in an order that aren't
together and I know it and they're

839
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:12,950
making me suffer and they're making me
less than I am.

840
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,220
And there's some of those things that
are staring me right at the face and I

841
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,320
know what they are.
And there are some of those that I can

842
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:23,210
put in order today with a little bit of
work so that when I wake up tomorrow,

843
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,070
the domain of my experience,
which is basically being itself,

844
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,380
that the main,
my experience will be more pristine and

845
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,040
better put together than it is today.

846
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,620
And you asked yourself that,
you will find that right away.

847
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,420
You know what they are finding things
that come up,

848
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,051
Bang,
Bang,

849
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,561
Bang,
Bang,

850
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,750
and they'll all be things that aren't
very heroic.

851
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:43,470
They're kind of trivial and that you
knew the voiding you've been avoiding

852
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,570
me.
Those are little dragons of chaos.

853
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:47,540
They space and you know they're just
little.

854
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,830
That's good because you're not much of a
hero warrior.

855
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:52,650
And so maybe a little tiny dragons are
all the ones that you've been put up.

856
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,250
You know,
you sort those things out and they will.

857
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:57,660
First of all,
they will order.

858
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,720
You're in an order that being around you
in a more pristine and productive way.

859
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:06,180
I think you just a little bit more
focused in together.

860
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,720
And what that'll mean is that the next
thing you can do is ask yourself the

861
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,840
same question and the end of the
problems that will emerge will be

862
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:17,550
slightly larger and more complex,
and then you can try to put those in

863
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:21,570
order and that will make everything
around you more pristine and benefit

864
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,630
together and it'll make you a little bit
stronger and more clear habit.

865
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,990
And then another set of problems will
emerge that's a little bit larger.

866
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,700
If you continue to do that,
you know you'll sort yourself out,

867
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,650
you clean up your room and you put your
house in order and then you could start

868
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:38,490
to work in the community and by that
time you'll actually have some power and

869
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:43,010
some and some self confidence and some
competence and some cream cheese and

870
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:45,810
you'll be much more,
much less likely to stupidly hit

871
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,810
something complicated with a stick and
say that you fixed it,

872
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,870
but you have to start low.
You have to be Carl Jung said,

873
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,530
very an interesting one,
interesting phrases.

874
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,920
He says that the reason that monitor
people can't see this because they won't

875
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:01,080
look low enough.
I really liked that.

876
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,640
I mean,
he's an extraordinarily wise person.

877
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,920
What he meant by that was something like
what I'm telling you is that the secret

878
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:12,060
to your existence is right in front of
you and it manifests itself as all those

879
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,820
things you know you should do,
but you're avoiding because one of the

880
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,460
things you might ask yourself as a
curse,

881
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,430
you're useless and weak and miserable
and cruel than all of those horrible

882
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:22,560
things,
but partly that's because you're also

883
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:23,690
not what you could be in.

884
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,030
Part of the reason for that is that what
you know you shouldn't be doing.

885
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,300
So you might ask yourself,
because this is a very interesting game.

886
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,840
If you started doing the things that you
know you should do,

887
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,510
this is a discussion with your own
conscious.

888
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,200
If you started doing those things that
you know you should do and you did that

889
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,510
diligently,
what beheld would you be like in 10

890
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,980
years?
Now?

891
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:48,570
That's an exciting game.
That's an interesting game and if you

892
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,340
play that,
we will find that you're hell a lot more

893
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,490
than you were and that's something at
least you might not hit the pinnacles

894
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,440
that you're going to be a lot more than
you are,

895
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,920
and then if you're not and miserable or
direction in sovereign digital,

896
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,620
sound,
pitying and all those things,

897
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:05,210
you're going to be a lot less resentful.
You're going to be a lot less broom.

898
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,250
You're going to be a lot less cruel to
yourself and to other people.

899
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,900
Well,
that's a pretty good start.

900
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,090
You know?
Even if you're not a positive force for

901
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:15,420
good in the world,
if you just were wretched horrible,

902
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:18,600
that would be a good additional
contribution.

903
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,090
No,
you.

904
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,180
I would say too,
there's a corridor that goes along with

905
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:26,850
that
and I,

906
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:30,580
and this is so,
so you could look at it this way.

907
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,270
This is something that I tried to
explain.

908
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:39,271
I didn't video on a couple of videos
which I've been fascinated by because

909
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:45,031
it's a very good relation and cultural.
How architects manifest themselves and

910
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,520
how people understand the earth.
Even if they don't know,

911
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:52,450
they understand them because it gives a
very interesting movie and think about

912
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,570
it,
don't you?

913
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,880
You might ask.
Well,

914
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,530
with modern people,
think about people going to church.

915
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,700
They think,
how can people believe those foolish,

916
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,740
those superstitions.

917
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,260
Fair enough.
Well,

918
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:07,360
what the hell do you think you're doing
when you were moving?

919
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,330
What are you doing here?
Here you are.

920
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,700
You're family.
You probably haven't seen Nokia lately,

921
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,710
but whatever
you're an adult,

922
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:18,980
you bring your five year old to seem to
know you're just as interest as he is

923
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,710
and think about what you're doing.
First of all,

924
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,800
you know those are drawings.
They're not real creatures.

925
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,980
There draws second pot wouldn't pop up.
Who actually happens to wander around

926
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:35,170
who is being guided to life.
Quite cricket was highest goal is to for

927
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,070
recent snow onto and understand and
somehow that makes a fairy tournament to

928
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,030
something that's real.
It's like that's strange people.

929
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,920
The fact that you're doing that is very
peculiar and it says something about

930
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:51,360
what people are like means that we
understand the things that we don't

931
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,740
normally understand and so it's.

932
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,610
It's a very interesting movie.
I can tell you what it's fundamental

933
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,740
presupposition is I'll just guide you
through it very,

934
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:02,770
very rapidly.
So the beginning of the movie,

935
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,910
Japan,
who's,

936
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,500
who's,
uh,

937
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,520
the archetype of the good father,
by the way,

938
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:10,480
which is an archetype that we forgot
about us because our culture isn't just

939
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:15,460
a tyrannical patriarchy as you can tell
by the fact that farm and comfortable

940
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:17,890
and we're not tearing each other to
shreds at the moment,

941
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,320
which is what you do in a state of
absolute chaos,

942
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:21,770
right?
It's made him on.

943
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,730
You're freezing and starving,
right?

944
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,920
And that is what one have.
We have a piece and it's rare and it's

945
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:33,460
amazing that we have,
we shouldn't take it for granted because

946
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:37,300
it's not the normal order of things.
The normal order of things is

947
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:40,600
destructive chaos.
And if you're fortunate enough to live

948
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,100
somewhere that's peaceful,
productive,

949
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,130
you should thank your lucky stars every
second of your life.

950
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,470
And if you don't do that,
all that means is that you don't know

951
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:51,370
anything about history and you know
nothing about human beings because

952
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:53,010
things can get out smoothly,
monster.

953
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,420
And it happens all the time and there's
always a fraction of the population who

954
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,000
thinks that's how they like things to be
and perhaps there's a fraction of you

955
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:01,210
have.
It's like that too.

956
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,830
And I wouldn't nurture that fragment
pharmacy you unless you want to go.

957
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,240
We're equal taking.
Anyways,

958
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,133
back to

959
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:17,490
thank you,

960
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,400
and then you can tell that he's got a
warm house and it's full of toys and

961
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:27,020
it's full of music boxes and the
goldfish.

962
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,130
He takes care of them and so it's a good
guy.

963
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,140
It makes this pop and then he puts us on
the puppet and that's the final act and

964
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,190
the public can have its capacity to
speak.

965
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,650
And that's what you want.
If you're a good father because you want

966
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:44,651
to take your son and turn them into
someone who can speak right,

967
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,390
who can speak his soul and soldier
battle,

968
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:53,120
puts a smile on his son space and says,
wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be

969
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,730
a good boy sweater?
Yeah.

970
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,500
Wouldn't it be wonderful,
right?

971
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,170
Because that's what you're doing.
You're a good father.

972
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,850
You think,
wouldn't it be possible that this puppet

973
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,200
could actually become something genuine
and independent with its own voice?

974
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:11,540
While he says that sounds likely it goes
off to bed and then the star appears up

975
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:14,110
in the window and the wishes on the scar
and you think,

976
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,780
what does that mean?
What does it mean to wish on a star?

977
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:17,200
It's like,
well,

978
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,580
the star is that light that gets into
the darkness,

979
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:21,250
right,
and it's something transcendent.

980
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,340
You go show up into the night sky and
it's.

981
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,090
It's odd inspiring whether you're
religious or not.

982
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,180
You're looking into the incident while
you make a relationship with the

983
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:30,710
infinite.
By wishing on a star,

984
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:35,711
you raise your eyes above the horizon
and point at the light that shines in

985
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:39,350
the darkness
and you say,

986
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,970
I wish more than anything else that my
son can become a real person.

987
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,730
So that's what you do.
If you're a good for the water may come

988
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,060
into a slave.
You don't want to be a tyrant.

989
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,550
You don't want them to be a puppet.
You want them to be something as strong

990
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:53,920
and independent.
Also,

991
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,430
Pinocchio goes out into the world.
He faces all these different moral

992
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,320
problems.
He's armed with his conscience.

993
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:02,700
It turns up to the other bug,
right?

994
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,950
Well,
why?

995
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,570
Well,
it's because things bug you.

996
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:11,090
You know you're conscious bugs you and
the reason that the conscience is

997
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:15,460
jimminy cricket is because that's the
same initials as Jesus Christ and

998
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,220
Jimminy cricket is southern US slime for
Jesus Christ and no doubt the other

999
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:22,550
mangers thought that was very comical.
I'm not telling you that that is a very

1000
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:24,930
strange representation of Christ.
That's for sure.

1001
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:28,560
It would make it into a cricketer and he
is also rather error prone in the movie

1002
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,880
because the movie doesn't have besides
the affordable Christian structure.

1003
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,540
But part of the reason this took me a
long time to figure out too is that you

1004
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,610
have to have a dialogue with your
conscience,

1005
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,480
but it has to be a dog because it's
actually not 100 percent right.

1006
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,460
It has to be something that you build by
having a discussion with it across time.

1007
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:48,620
And that's actually where Pinocchio,
junior cricket,

1008
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:53,030
as the movie progresses,
both the puppet and the conscience get

1009
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,520
wiser by begging themselves against the
world.

1010
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,430
And the pop and house to resist the
temptation of Isi,

1011
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,940
fame and celebrity.
That's the first temptation,

1012
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,830
right?
Because he's asked to be an actor,

1013
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,610
which is an easy way to be celebrities
like the Kardashians,

1014
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,560
right?
It's it's status without responsibility

1015
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:14,561
or or competence and so that that exists
and the traffic and then he's,

1016
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,380
he's.
He learns that lying is a very bad idea,

1017
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
right?
That's what he's knows.

1018
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:23,990
Grocery has to get that sort of know.
And then he said he's asked to present

1019
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:28,830
himself as a victim of circumstances.
That's what the Fox and the coyotes and

1020
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,160
when he decides that he's too ill to go
back to school,

1021
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,210
they take them to pleasure.

1022
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,260
It varies trained to be a jackass that
works for slavers into soul lines.

1023
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,610
Right?
Not Bad for animation,

1024
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,800
I could say.
And then at the end of it,

1025
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,990
the leaky tries to go back home because
he's terribly lost in these half.

1026
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:49,130
Jack asked because the people that
pleasure island have told him,

1027
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,330
taught him to do nothing but break,
which I can't help it

1028
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,330
offers or what would you.
What would you say is,

1029
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:00,480
is an appalling parallel to what's
happening to educate people who are

1030
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:04,350
being educated in modern universities,
which are increasingly play houses where

1031
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:07,880
you're taught to break in the listen,
I can't listen to the protesters.

1032
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,240
It just,
it just.

1033
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:14,270
It's just painful.
It's this constant repetition of a soul.

1034
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:19,730
Nonsense thank loudly chanted is because
the protesters,

1035
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,780
they're trying to convince themselves
even more desperately than they're

1036
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:31,710
trying to convince them.

1037
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,130
So anyways,
Pinocchio goes back home and half

1038
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,330
jackass in half again and trust to find
his father.

1039
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,460
There's no going home right now.
Once you're an adult,

1040
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,400
it's your young adult.
You don't get to go back because there

1041
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:49,440
isn't anyone there that can tell you
what to do anymore,

1042
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,990
and so they go as far as fair and finds
out that he has to go to the bottom of

1043
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:58,410
chaos itself to rescue his father and
that's what we have to do,

1044
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,050
right?
Because our civilization is in a state

1045
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:04,210
of crisis now is predicted long ago by
people like Dj.

1046
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,520
And partly what you're trying to do with
you go to university is to go to the

1047
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:11,640
heart of therapist right to the place
that terrifies you the most,

1048
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,280
and to find your values,
your culture really has,

1049
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:17,400
and that's what it means to go down to
the bottom of the desk to the thing that

1050
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:21,450
terrifies you the most integrative
before your father to very little story.

1051
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,060
The Egyptians were telling that story
for a thousand years ago.

1052
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,010
It's one of the oldest stories of
mankind,

1053
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,970
and so that's what you have to do.
You and the United Yourself with your

1054
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:33,300
culture so that you're more than just a
weakened symbol minded individual,

1055
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,550
right?
You dedicate yourself to the study of

1056
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:38,670
what's great about the past and you
incorporate it so that there can be

1057
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:42,480
something to you and then you bring your
father back up to the surface so that

1058
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:45,900
the culture can see and live in yet,
and then that makes you into a real

1059
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:47,090
individual.
Well,

1060
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,200
that's the movie.
Well,

1061
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:55,140
we watch it were captivated by it.
Now it's time to understand.

1062
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:59,760
It takes time to understand that in an
articulated and conscious map because

1063
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,640
it's too late for us to be unconscious
anymore.

1064
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,610
And so we have stella and shrimp,
this,

1065
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,950
we have the chaos of the left and the
left says,

1066
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:10,940
well we need to tear down structures
because they own press.

1067
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,880
So like obviously instructors who
oppressed because something's good at

1068
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:17,700
the top of the structure and also good
at the bottom.

1069
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,990
So if you have any values dropped,
it's going to privilege some things and

1070
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,340
exclude others,
but if you scrap structures and there's

1071
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:27,070
nothing to live for,
so we can't do that.

1072
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:30,220
That's just chaos.
And then the radical right says back to

1073
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:33,880
the nation and it's like really?
You know,

1074
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,420
we went back to the nation a couple of
times so it doesn't really look that

1075
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,600
great.
And part of the reason for that is that

1076
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:41,720
the purpose of the nation isn't the
nation.

1077
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,080
The purpose of the nation is to produce
citizens who transcend Emma juvenate,

1078
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,710
the nation.
And so the nation should be probably

1079
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,830
properly subordinated to the individual,
right to the divine individually for

1080
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:56,440
that map.
And that's what we figured out in the

1081
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:56,970
West.

1082
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,160
Now it is that we only figured that out
in the west,

1083
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:04,300
but so far we've been fortunate enough
to put it into a reasonable practice in

1084
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,000
our political institutions and thank God
for that.

1085
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,080
At least it's worked somewhere and we'd
be completely foolish to give that up

1086
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:13,330
because look at what it's provided us
with.

1087
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,860
Its remarkable for free,
as free as we can,

1088
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:20,680
but that doesn't mean that we're happy
because freedom and happiness are not

1089
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:23,710
the same thing at all.
But we did figure out what the state

1090
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,290
should be subordinate to the wisdom of
the individual,

1091
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:29,740
to the site and the wisdom of the
individual that puts a heavy

1092
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,150
responsibility on everyone.
That mean to you have to be the

1093
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,090
individual who can see at speed.
That's your job.

1094
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,910
And if you do that,
the thing that's so cool about that is

1095
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:44,200
you know you need a meaning in your life
that enables you to bear the suffering

1096
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:46,180
of their life without becoming
corrupted.

1097
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,370
That's the basic rule and you have to
build yourself into something that you

1098
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:56,371
can actually respect so that you can see
yourself bearing not terrible

1099
00:57:56,621 --> 00:58:00,700
existential burger properly and then you
don't lose hope and you don't use

1100
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,090
meaning because you can see that you're
strong enough to stand up underneath

1101
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:07,830
that Burger and then there's something
about you that you can respect and then

1102
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:11,950
maybe other people can respect that will
help bring suffering in the world to an

1103
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:15,430
end and that will help people develop
fully as individuals and that will

1104
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:19,830
enable us to avoid the dehumanizing
rigid.

1105
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:25,550
A I'll uniformity of the nationalistic
lack and appalling devouring chaos of

1106
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:32,140
the radical left.
How about no

1107
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,220
the individual

1108
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,240
that's the secret to the world and
you're all individuals.

1109
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:43,590
You're all the secret to the world and
then all you have to do

1110
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:51,200
to discover that is picked up
responsibility.

1111
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:55,050
Stop listening to people who keep
burdening you with rights.

1112
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,080
How many Goddamn rights deal?
Why you need some responsibility?

1113
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,170
So pick it up,
open your eyes and learn how to make

1114
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:07,850
yourself articulate,
and that made the world one sentence of

1115
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:11,850
a series of health than it already
descended into the 20th century.

1116
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,400
You've think detailed what you think
students shouldn't do in these examples

1117
00:59:19,591 --> 00:59:23,360
of like protests and these examples of
certain types of activist tactics.

1118
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,350
What advice would you have for students?
How can students make the changes that

1119
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:29,120
they want to make?
Particularly?

1120
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,950
Do you have any advice for students
here?

1121
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,420
Yeah.
Read great books.

1122
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,250
Really,
man,

1123
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,810
you've got this four year period that
has been carved out of your lives by

1124
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,690
society.
They given you an identity,

1125
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,500
like a high quality identity and freedom
at the same time and you're not going to

1126
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,570
get that again in your life.
You've got a.

1127
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,310
you've got a respectable identity,
university student and complete freedom

1128
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:55,250
associated with that or as near as
you're ever going to get and you've got

1129
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:58,310
these unbelievable libraries that are
full of the writings of people who are,

1130
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,540
who are intelligent and articulate
beyond comprehension and you know,

1131
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,960
and and you can go there and you can
learn all this and you might think,

1132
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:08,870
well,
why should you learn it while you learn

1133
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:09,770
it to get a job?

1134
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,800
Or you learn it to get good grades or
you learn it to get a degree and that's

1135
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:14,990
all nonsense.
It's nonsense.

1136
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,290
The reason that you come to university
to be educated is because there is

1137
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,560
nothing more powerful than someone who
is articulate and who can think and

1138
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,860
speak.
It's power and power of the best,

1139
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:28,880
sort of its authority and influence and
respectability and competence.

1140
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,960
And so you come to university to craft
your highest skill and your highest

1141
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,450
skill is to be found in articulated
speech.

1142
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,160
And if you're,
if you're,

1143
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,040
if you're a master at formulating your
arguments,

1144
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,420
you win everything and better than that,
when you win everything,

1145
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,560
everyone around you wins too.
Because to transform yourself into,

1146
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,500
let's consider,
consider your transformation into

1147
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:55,730
something approximating the logos.
It means you shine a light on the whole

1148
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:56,780
world.
Well,

1149
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,550
there's nothing more exciting to do than
that.

1150
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,320
There's nothing better you can possibly
do.

1151
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,190
And to think that you're going to
university to be trained to have a job,

1152
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:06,080
it's like great.
That's a hell of a lot better than being

1153
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:10,070
unemployed and covered with cheeto dust
while you're snacking away in front of

1154
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:12,620
your video game in the basement,
but it's not.

1155
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,260
It's not a.
and I don't have anything against video

1156
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:20,261
games by the way,
but it's hardly a triumphant call to,

1157
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,620
to being in the world.
And that's what universities should be

1158
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:26,420
calling forth.
It's like God,

1159
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:28,010
you people,
you as you know I,

1160
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:30,500
I know what Harvard students are like.
I taught here for five years.

1161
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:33,650
You people are spectacular.
You're spectacular.

1162
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,341
You're,
you're,

1163
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,620
you're,
you're all capable of being world

1164
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:39,050
beaters.
You transform yourself into something

1165
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:42,860
that's articulated and sensible and
grounded in history and knowledgeable

1166
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:45,590
and wise man,
you can do anything you want and

1167
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:48,860
hopefully anything you want for good
because if you have any sense,

1168
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,160
everything you want to do would be for
the good because there's nothing more

1169
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:57,340
compelling or meaningful or or useful in
combating the tragedy of life than to

1170
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,980
than to struggle with all your soul on
behalf of the good and the university

1171
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:04,300
hasn't forgotten that.

1172
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,430
It's why everyone's bailing out of the
humanities and they should.

1173
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:11,170
The humanities are corrupt and they're
corrupt because they're not telling the

1174
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:13,280
students this.
It's so bloody obvious.

1175
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,000
So like learn to think,
learn to speak,

1176
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,590
let to read.
It makes you a super power and the

1177
01:02:20,591 --> 01:02:25,591
individual superpower you have it under.
I don't understand why that isn't just

1178
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,180
told to students.
It's not that hard to understand and

1179
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,440
everyone wants to hear it.
It's like,

1180
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:32,390
really?
I could do that.

1181
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,990
I can do that.
It's like,

1182
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,850
yeah,
really you could do that,

1183
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:40,650
and the whole society around you is
labored for really thousands of years to

1184
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:44,250
provide every single one of you with
this spectacular opportunity that you

1185
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:46,880
have while your undergraduates and
graduate students here.

1186
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,731
Man,
they're just.

1187
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:52,290
Everyone's just praying that you would
come here and manifest everything that

1188
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:55,230
you could manifest and that's what you
should be doing.

1189
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,310
Instead of waving placards and
complaining about how you're oppressed

1190
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:02,490
for God's sake,
you see these Yale students complaining

1191
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:04,020
about their oppression.
It's just,

1192
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,980
it just leaves me aghast and it's like,
well,

1193
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:09,840
we're against the ruling class.
It's like,

1194
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:10,231
no,
no,

1195
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:12,930
no.
Your baby ruling class members.

1196
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:13,943
You're young.

1197
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,520
Thank you.

1198
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,780
The only reason you're not rich just
because you're young,

1199
01:03:23,781 --> 01:03:25,630
you know that's the best.
Really.

1200
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,680
That's the.
If you look at the one percent,

1201
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:29,880
even the dreaded one percent,
you know,

1202
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,660
most of those people are old.
Why?

1203
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,610
Well,
when you progress through life,

1204
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:38,630
if you're reasonably successful,
you trade in your promising youth for

1205
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:41,780
your wealthy old age,
but you're still bloody old.

1206
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,170
Were you,
when you trade it,

1207
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:47,720
would you trade your youth for that?
Like if you factor age out of the

1208
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:49,670
economic equation,
things look a lot different.

1209
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:51,530
Well,
of course older people have more money.

1210
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,350
If they have any sense they'd been
collecting it for their whole life.

1211
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:57,620
Is that somehow unfair?
It's not unfair unless you want to want

1212
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:01,220
to be poverty stricken when you're 70
and you and you don't want to be

1213
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,800
poverished strict poverty stricken when
you're 70.

1214
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:08,330
So I just don't understand what's
happened to the universities.

1215
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,840
I can't believe that you're not told
when you come the first day,

1216
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:12,674
look,
man,

1217
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,080
you are,
you're here on a heroic mission.

1218
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,770
You're going to take your capacity to
articulate yourself to levels that are

1219
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:22,190
undreamed of you're going to come out of
here unstoppable.

1220
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,020
You're going to be able to do anything
you want.

1221
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,090
It's like,
that's what you're here for.

1222
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,650
Instead,
you're taught that,

1223
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,630
well,
you know the world's a pretty oppressive

1224
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,950
place and you're probably the bottom of
the victim pile.

1225
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:32,631
And,
and,

1226
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:33,620
and,
and there's,

1227
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,600
and there's,
there's virtually nothing you can do

1228
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:36,650
about it except,
you know,

1229
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:41,330
deconstruct the patriarchy.
And it's so neat and so pathetic that

1230
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,570
the university should be embarrassed
that that's what they're peddling to

1231
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:46,790
students.
I'm embarrassed by it.

1232
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:47,601
You know,
I've,

1233
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:50,240
I've gone on public record telling
parents what do you well,

1234
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:54,110
send your boys to trade school because
at least they'll learn something useful

1235
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,130
and that's a terrible thing for someone
like me to say because I do believe that

1236
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,570
the are being articulated and educated
in the highest possible manner is

1237
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,380
there's nothing that's better for you
and for society.

1238
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,470
And why or why have the university's
forgotten this?

1239
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,120
Well,
that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.

1240
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,630
You know that.
Then the philosophy of intense

1241
01:05:14,631 --> 01:05:18,910
resentment and oppression and group
identity and god,

1242
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:22,070
it's just pathetic.
Dr Susan.

1243
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,300
I think a lot of students here would
agree with you that one of the main

1244
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:28,120
purposes of education and college,
particularly at Harvard,

1245
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,730
is to develop their sense of
articulation,

1246
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,190
their ability to read,
their ability to create a critically

1247
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:35,230
think.
But then what comes after,

1248
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,050
particularly at Harvard,
there's a big discussion on what is a

1249
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:40,750
good life,
what does it mean to use those skills

1250
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:43,660
that we get here?
And then we graduate.

1251
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:49,020
What do we do from there,
I stopped unnecessary suffering.

1252
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,250
That's what you do.
You know that that's your calling.

1253
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:54,971
It's like you say,
well,

1254
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:56,520
what do you do after you graduate?
Well,

1255
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,830
if you graduate,
articulated and powerful,

1256
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,860
there will be people giving you so many
opportunities.

1257
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,930
You won't even be able to keep up with
them.

1258
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,570
You know,
and I've worked with very,

1259
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:10,210
very competent people in many different
domains in my life.

1260
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:13,480
Hyper competent people.
And I can tell you some very interesting

1261
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:17,230
things about hyper competent people.
The first thing is they are not selfish

1262
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,070
and they're not greedy and one of the
great pleasures in their lives is to

1263
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:25,540
find people who have the capacity to
also be hyper competent and to open

1264
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:28,090
doors for them as rapidly as they can
possibly be opened.

1265
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,760
They delight in that because there is.
There's nothing there.

1266
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,610
There's very few things that are more
intrinsically meaningful.

1267
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,850
If you're an accomplished person,
then to find young people who have the

1268
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,770
possibility of being accomplished and
say,

1269
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,780
hey look,
here's an opportunity for you.

1270
01:06:40,781 --> 01:06:41,531
It's like,
go out there,

1271
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:42,364
man,
kill it.

1272
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:43,530
And then they go out there and kill it.

1273
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,860
You think right on,
man,

1274
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,720
here's another opportunity to go ahead.
Go there near that to new think.

1275
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,120
No,
no.

1276
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,460
They're all hurting their wealth and
they're not going to share it with

1277
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:53,560
anyone.
It's like that's absolute complete

1278
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,960
rubbish.
So you don't even have to worry about

1279
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:57,940
what you're going to do after you
graduate from here.

1280
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,950
If you,
if you turn yourself into half of what

1281
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:02,680
you could be,
because people will be dying to offer

1282
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:05,770
you every opportunity that you can
possibly make use of.

1283
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,100
So it's,
it's,

1284
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,720
it's a moot point.
The,

1285
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,350
the,
the world is always desperately short of

1286
01:07:11,351 --> 01:07:14,260
people who can think and speak and,
and you think,

1287
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:16,270
well,
I won't be made use of.

1288
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,370
Well first of all,
you can't say that if you're at.

1289
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,030
If you're at Harvard for God's sake,
I mean people already figured out who

1290
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:24,220
you are.
They've already figured it out and

1291
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:26,950
they're offering you the world on a,
on a golden platter.

1292
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:28,930
It take it,
it's yours.

1293
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,220
Take it.
So like,

1294
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,160
great man.
Pull yourself together and deserve.

1295
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,980
That would be great.
And that's what everyone wants.

1296
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:38,050
It's what your parents want.
It's also what you want.

1297
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,060
You know it.
It's what you want.

1298
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:42,640
It's what men.
It's what women want from men.

1299
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:46,390
It's what men want from women.
It's like for you to be who you could

1300
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:49,180
be,
and then the highest faculty of the

1301
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:54,181
human being is articulated speech.
It's the divine faculty and there is

1302
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:57,850
nothing more powerful than that.
There was nothing that's even in the

1303
01:07:57,851 --> 01:08:00,190
same league,
and so if you.

1304
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,140
If you don't have faith in that than
your,

1305
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,830
then your priorities are misplaced and I
can't even understand why you wouldn't

1306
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,540
have faith in that being,
say,

1307
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,560
Harvard students because look where it's
got you already know you're already

1308
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:15,650
sitting on top of the world,
so make deserve it.

1309
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,290
Make use of it,
right?

1310
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,880
Go out there and fix things up.
That's what you need to do.

1311
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:23,120
There's lots of things that need to be
fixed up and what do you want to do is

1312
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:27,050
burden yourself with so much
responsibility that you can barely stand

1313
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,930
and then you'll get stronger trying to
lift it up and you'll be.

1314
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:33,320
Won't be asking what should I be doing
with my life or what's the meaning of

1315
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:36,500
life or any of that.
It will be self evident and self evident

1316
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:40,460
at minimum you can say there's more
suffering in the world than there should

1317
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:43,760
be and I could probably do something
about that and you can do something

1318
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,460
about that,
so go do something about it and then

1319
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:49,310
there'll be less suffering in the world
and then when you're 80 you can look

1320
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:50,450
back on your life and say,
well,

1321
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,930
you know,
there's less suffering in the world than

1322
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,140
there would have been had.

1323
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:58,640
I know it existed and and you don't have
to even have a sense of,

1324
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:02,840
of ultimate destiny or even any sort of
theistic belief to regard that as a

1325
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:06,610
positive good.
Like I think it goes beyond the mere

1326
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,460
pragmatic utility of addressing the
world's ails because I think we do live

1327
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:11,294
in a,
in a,

1328
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,930
in a world that has a transcendent
reality as well as the reality that we

1329
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,180
can detect,
but even independently of fat,

1330
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:18,800
it doesn't matter.
It's like.

1331
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,900
I mean,
this is part of the reason I like people

1332
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:22,760
like Bill Gates is a great example,
man.

1333
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:25,550
That guy is.
He's after five major diseases at the

1334
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:26,930
same time.
Right?

1335
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,420
He's trying to wipe out polio.
He's trying to wipe out

1336
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,420
malaria.
Yeah,

1337
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,310
exactly.
He's trying to wipe out malaria.

1338
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:35,330
It's like,
well,

1339
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:37,070
what should you do with your life?
Well,

1340
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:39,590
you know,
take a look at Bill Gates and see if you

1341
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:41,330
could do something like that.
That would be good.

1342
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,510
So.
So Dr Peterson,

1343
01:09:44,511 --> 01:09:49,040
you talked about this idea of ending
unnecessary suffering and this idea of

1344
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,770
committing one's life to that at a
minimum.

1345
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,440
That's the minimum thing that you could
do.

1346
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,640
A lot of students,
I think accept that premise and view

1347
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:02,480
what they're doing as trying to
eliminate or reduce unnecessary

1348
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:06,920
suffering and they see activism or other
forms of direct service as fulfilling

1349
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:10,130
that goal.
Do you simply disagree with the content

1350
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,780
of what they think the tactic that they
are using to end unnecessary suffering

1351
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,220
or do you think that their motives or
their intentions are not even the same

1352
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:20,054
as yours?

1353
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,500
Arts to public?
You know,

1354
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,380
there's this,
there's this,

1355
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,360
there's this old saying from the,
from the new testament about not praying

1356
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,040
in public,
right,

1357
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,280
and now idea is that if you're going to
commune for the higher good,

1358
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,310
you should do it in private because
otherwise you're warping your ethic in

1359
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:44,120
some sense by demonstrating how virtuous
you virtuous you are to the world.

1360
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,250
It's like,
you know,

1361
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,770
you go out there with a stick and a sign
on it that says I'm against poverty.

1362
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:49,490
It's like,
yeah,

1363
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,540
no kidding.
That's really like for poverty,

1364
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,500
poverty,
so it's,

1365
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,400
it's,
it's,

1366
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,520
it's an abdication of responsibility
with the mask of social virtue and you

1367
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:04,040
want to solve difficult problems.
You've figured out how to get along with

1368
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,690
your brother,
the one you've been fighting with for

1369
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:08,630
five years or see if you can staple your
family back together.

1370
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:11,720
See if you can stop fighting with your
girlfriend and have a relationship that

1371
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:13,100
lasts for more than two weeks.

1372
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,270
You know,
it's like there are things that you

1373
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,840
should be doing in the confines of your
own life that are private and humble.

1374
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:19,831
That would,
would,

1375
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:21,900
that would constitute genuine
accomplishments.

1376
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:24,330
And those are the things that you should
attend to and no one's going to come

1377
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:25,380
along and say,
hey,

1378
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,490
you know,
good job,

1379
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,770
you're,
you're changing the world because it's

1380
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,370
private,
but it's real and people don't do that.

1381
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,204
And so no,
I don't,

1382
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:37,590
I don't trust the activist.
I don't trust the activist ethos at all.

1383
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,740
I think it,
I think everything about it is,

1384
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,870
is superficial and,
and trendy and,

1385
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,690
and too easy.
And,

1386
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,730
and the externalizes the blame,
the evil is always elsewhere,

1387
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:57,570
which is a dreadful mistake to make
because the evil isn't elsewhere.

1388
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:59,700
That's,
that's the thing that you understand

1389
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:02,610
when you're wise is the evil is not
elsewhere.

1390
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,880
It's you because you're not everything
you could be.

1391
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,081
And so,
you know,

1392
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:10,230
you should work on that before going in
telling someone else that maybe they're

1393
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:12,780
not who they should be.
So I think it's,

1394
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,970
you know,
so I don't buy it.

1395
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:17,760
It's too easy.
It's far too easy and it's too public

1396
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,420
and it's too self congratulatory.
And then there's the murderous,

1397
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,690
like Marxist element,
which I'm always often inclined to

1398
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:28,320
mention.
So certainly I think you've identified

1399
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:33,321
certain causes where the public element
or the self congratulatory time to do

1400
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,250
good could be harmful,
but do you think there are cases,

1401
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:40,620
for instance,
I'm thinking of policy influencing

1402
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:44,340
policy being a policymaker.
It seems like something like that public

1403
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:49,341
policy could be used to eliminate some
unnecessary suffering but would involve

1404
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:53,610
a more public domain,
something where you are trying to

1405
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:56,850
attract followers,
trying to attract praise from other

1406
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:57,750
people.
Look,

1407
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,390
look,
if you,

1408
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:03,150
if you've established yourself in the
world as a credible human being and

1409
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:08,130
people are asking you to enter public
service because of your accomplishments,

1410
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,290
then it's time to do it right?

1411
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:14,910
But before that it's a little on the
premature side and if you're just

1412
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:18,990
setting your for self forward as an
Avatar of an idea of an ideology,

1413
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,040
then there's nothing to you except I
think of it as the chattering of various

1414
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:26,720
forms of demons.
It's like you're not helpful and if you.

1415
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,020
If you look,
you want to think,

1416
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:29,580
okay,
are you fit to lead?

1417
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,960
Let's,
let's put it that way.

1418
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:32,130
Okay.
First of all,

1419
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,770
do you know where you're going?
Because that's actually one of the

1420
01:13:34,771 --> 01:13:37,560
hallmarks of a leader.
Leader knows where he's going and maybe

1421
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:39,840
other people are also interested in
going that way,

1422
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:43,500
but the leaders I've met have carved
themselves out a personal vision,

1423
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,753
right?
It's not some.

1424
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:49,290
It's not some cookie cutter ideological
solution to the ills of the planet.

1425
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,450
They've done a detailed analysis,
right?

1426
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:54,060
They know what they're talking about and
they're usually people.

1427
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,480
They've had a successful relationship,
they've had a successful family,

1428
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,650
they have a couple of degrees.
They've established a business like

1429
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,660
they've made themselves credible in five
or six dimensions.

1430
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,380
Well then maybe you know enough about
the world to dare to mess with its

1431
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:09,240
internal mechanisms,
and if you.

1432
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:12,080
If you don't have that kind of in depth,
then you should just.

1433
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,680
You shouldn't.
You should know more work on the

1434
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:17,260
economic systems of Western
civilization.

1435
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:21,760
Then you should try to adjust the
electronic systems of your automobile

1436
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:26,140
because the latter is far less complex
than the former.

1437
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,500
So of course there's utility in policy
formulation and in,

1438
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,960
in government service and in all of
those sorts of things.

1439
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,680
But you have to.
You have to have transformed yourself at

1440
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:38,140
least to some degree,
into someone who's actually competent

1441
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,360
before you should even dare to do such
things.

1442
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,380
You think,
well,

1443
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,200
I have read some marks and now I know
how to change the world.

1444
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,630
That's a very bad idea because the
probability that you're going to take

1445
01:14:50,631 --> 01:14:55,070
something complex that doesn't work too
badly and fix it with your idiotic

1446
01:14:55,071 --> 01:14:57,640
intervention is zero.
So

1447
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:02,260
hmm.
Well put

1448
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:14,440
the chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and so,

1449
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,290
and that's very interesting observation
because since the chaos is virtually

1450
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,760
infinite,
it's a real questions.

1451
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,750
Where the hell do you put it while you
put it in what you ignore and you can

1452
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:27,230
ignore it as long as it isn't actively
interfering with your movement forward,

1453
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:32,231
you can assume that it's that it doesn't
matter that it doesn't matter that it

1454
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:34,360
doesn't matter.
Same thing.

1455
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:37,600
All right,
so here's the kicker.

1456
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:42,601
There's one more class of things that
you can run into along the way and this

1457
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:46,180
is where the chaos breaks through.
So let's say

1458
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,400
you're moving from point a to point b
and something that you don't expect

1459
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:02,740
occurs and it gets in the way.
So let's say that you're living with

1460
01:16:04,281 --> 01:16:07,610
someone and maybe you kind of like them,
you're not married so you don't like

1461
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:09,890
them that much because otherwise you'd
ask them to marry you.

1462
01:16:09,891 --> 01:16:12,000
But anyways.
Um,

1463
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:17,260
and so had quarter view is looking for
something better in three quarters view

1464
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,160
is half satisfied,
something like that.

1465
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:23,810
And then a person because we're
ambivalent about such things.

1466
01:16:23,811 --> 01:16:27,320
And then the person you discover or the
person announces that they've been

1467
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:29,510
having an affair.
Okay.

1468
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,690
So then how are you supposed to respond
emotionally to that?

1469
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,430
Well,
the part of you that wasn't all that

1470
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,070
committed to the relationship is kind of
exhilarated by that.

1471
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:40,660
And then the three quarters of you
that's half satisfied is hurt and,

1472
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,390
and you're going to exploit that part
for sure in the ensuing discussions and

1473
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,680
not mention the,
oh,

1474
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,290
that's kind of exciting that you've
betrayed me that way.

1475
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,450
So,
so,

1476
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,330
but the point is,
is that you,

1477
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:57,230
that's a whole.
Now what's happened is a whole has you

1478
01:16:57,231 --> 01:17:00,230
have this structure that you're walking
on ice,

1479
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,190
like the thin ice that you're skating on
and now there's a hole in it and the

1480
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:06,620
whole.
We don't even know how deep the hole is,

1481
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:09,140
but you know there's a hole there and so
now you're anxious.

1482
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:09,800
It.
Oh,

1483
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,650
they'll maybe also a little bit excited
because God only knows what's down

1484
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:16,220
there,
but but you don't know what to do with

1485
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:19,130
that whole because it could spread very
badly on you.

1486
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:24,131
It could be that you know the whole
relationship was a facade and that all

1487
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:26,780
your relationships have been facades,
facades,

1488
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,750
and that the reason that is is because
you're so damn shallow that it's

1489
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:33,080
impossible for you to have a
relationship that isn't just a facade

1490
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,960
and that's partly because you don't pay
any attention to other people.

1491
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,330
And it's also partly because you're
malevolent and selfish.

1492
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,740
So that's a nasty thing to discover.
Or maybe that's the sort of person that

1493
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,050
you're attracting.
Which would make sense actually if

1494
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:47,480
that's the sort of person that you are.
And so.

1495
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,160
So there are certain things that you can
encounter that basically unglue you,

1496
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:57,080
and what happens is that those moments
of being unglued travel up that entire

1497
01:17:57,081 --> 01:18:01,970
hierarchy of presuppositions.
It's like because the one of the logical

1498
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:04,760
conclusions to being betrayed in a
relationship is that you are,

1499
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,880
that you're truly a bad person.
Now another

1500
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:13,730
equally logical conclusion is that the
person that you're with is really a bad

1501
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,550
person.
And another logical conclusion is all

1502
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:19,100
people are truly bad people.
You know,

1503
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,290
I mean in,
in,

1504
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,320
in macro ways that in microwaves you
can't trust anyone.

1505
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:26,030
You can't trust women.
You can't trust men.

1506
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:28,220
You can't trust human beings.
You can't trust yourself.

1507
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,520
The whole place is a catastrophe.
It's a nightmare.

1508
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,000
Well then you can fall through into
chaos.

1509
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:38,600
Now the way your body responds to that,
when something or maybe you know you're

1510
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:40,280
supposed to be getting a promotion at
work,

1511
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:42,590
that's good.
You're all chipper about the promotion

1512
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:47,150
at work and you walk into your boss's
office because he or she wants to see

1513
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:49,700
you and they say,
well,

1514
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:53,090
you know,
we've reviewed your performance over the

1515
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:58,090
last few years and your performance has
been somewhere between mediocre and

1516
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,900
decent and we're downsizing and see
later.

1517
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,730
That's not a raise or a promotion,
that's for sure.

1518
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,930
That's a whole that you fall into and
the question is,

1519
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:13,220
well,
what do you make of that?

1520
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,560
Right.
How do you frame that?

1521
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:19,390
How do you take that emergent chaos and
make habitable order out of.

1522
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,700
You don't know.
Is the whole capitalist system rotten to

1523
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:23,930
the core?
I mean,

1524
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:26,690
that's a convenient explanation under
those circumstances,

1525
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,390
that's for sure.
Where you're working for a psychopathic

1526
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:32,570
son of a bitch.
Did you make the wrong choice in

1527
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:35,750
university and was that your father's
fault because you never did what you

1528
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:39,530
wanted or was it your fault for not
standing up to them or is it a dying

1529
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,770
industry or is maybe this is a wake up
call that you should go do something

1530
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:45,940
else that you've been waiting to.
Do you know that you've actually wanted

1531
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:49,490
to do your whole life and that's why
you're doing such a miserable job at

1532
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:52,460
your current occupation because you're
bitter and resentful about the fact that

1533
01:19:52,461 --> 01:19:53,600
you never did what you want.

1534
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,230
You don't know.
It's all of those things at once and

1535
01:19:57,231 --> 01:20:01,160
that's very stressful because all of
those things at once is too many things

1536
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:05,390
and that's the reemergence of chaos.
That's the flood.

1537
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,640
That's the return to the beginning of
the cosmos.

1538
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:10,320
That's another way that it's been
represented.

1539
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:13,260
Mythologically stayed.
You voyage all the way back to the

1540
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:17,940
beginning of the cosmos when there's
nothing but undifferentiated chaos and

1541
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:21,900
that's what you're confronting and maybe
it's too much for you and often it is.

1542
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:25,920
I mean that that can really.
That can be traumatizing.

1543
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,170
It can hurt your brain.
You know,

1544
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:30,870
it's just too much for you to bear,
but it doesn't matter.

1545
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:33,600
You're stuck with it.
And so how do you respond to that?

1546
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,790
Well,
some of it is catastrophic,

1547
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:39,180
negative emotion.
You freeze and that's protective and

1548
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:41,760
maybe you don't even want to move.
You don't want to bloody well get out of

1549
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:46,350
bed for a week and that's because your
body is reacting as if the bedroom floor

1550
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:49,410
is covered with snakes and the best
thing for you to do is just not move,

1551
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,460
just freeze.

1552
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,600
Not a pleasant situation to be in
because it's your aroused,

1553
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,090
very,
very physiologically demanding,

1554
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,720
and there's zero about it that's
productive except maybe the snakes won't

1555
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:02,340
see you,
but they've already seen you,

1556
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:05,700
so that isn't helping very well.
So you've got all this undifferentiated

1557
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:06,990
nadir,
negative emotion,

1558
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:08,310
anxiety,
fear,

1559
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,180
hurt,
anger,

1560
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:10,080
guilt,
shame,

1561
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:13,140
emotional pain,
the whole plethora of catastrophes.

1562
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:16,860
And then maybe on the other side lurking
down there is,

1563
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,920
thank God I'm done with that job.
I just bloody well hated.

1564
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:24,750
I dragged myself off to work every day
and there's a little part of my soul

1565
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,960
that so goddamn happy.
I finally got fired that I can hardly

1566
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,160
stand it.
You know,

1567
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:31,890
and maybe you don't even admit that to
yourself because well,

1568
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:35,190
that would mean that all that time you
spent at the job was just sunk costs.

1569
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,880
You're deluding yourself the whole time
on.

1570
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,430
It is an interesting thing to consider
those sometimes if you're in the

1571
01:21:41,431 --> 01:21:44,700
unpleasant circumstance of having to
fire someone,

1572
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,550
you know,
sometimes firing someone is the best

1573
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:50,310
thing that can happen to them,
which doesn't mean that you should go

1574
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:55,200
out and like enjoy it.
Although I have met very disagreeable

1575
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:58,890
people who actually enjoyed firing
people and I'll tell you a story about

1576
01:21:58,891 --> 01:22:00,840
that at some point because it's quite
interesting,

1577
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:03,450
but you know,
sometimes if someone's just limping

1578
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:08,451
along in their job and doing it as
miserably in wretchedly as they possibly

1579
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:11,370
can imagine,
the best thing you can do to them for

1580
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:12,420
them is to say,
you know,

1581
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,820
you're failing at this and,
and that doesn't necessarily mean that

1582
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:21,180
you would have to be failing at
absolutely everything else in the entire

1583
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:23,340
world.
So maybe you should just accept the dam

1584
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,950
failure and go off and try something
new.

1585
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:29,610
And I mean that's terrifying for people
and I know they hate it and all that,

1586
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,800
but,
but,

1587
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,680
but sometimes it's better than the
alternative,

1588
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:37,110
which is just slow torturous death.

1589
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,470
No,
the idea of dream analysis,

1590
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,560
I suppose it's one of Freud's perhaps
Freud's major contribution to modern

1591
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,660
western thought.
The idea was there was something to

1592
01:22:47,661 --> 01:22:51,620
dreams and I suppose what I did is said,
hey look,

1593
01:22:51,621 --> 01:22:55,820
isn't it strange we have this whole
other form of thought that we engage in

1594
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:01,340
at night it and it speaks in the
language that we don't really understand

1595
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:05,980
and so what the hell is that?
And you can say many modern people

1596
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,550
do dreams are of no significance or even
that they're random processes,

1597
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,910
which is an absurd proposition obviously
because they're by Terrell,

1598
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,250
whatever they are,
they're obviously not random.

1599
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:19,270
So.
So Freud's idea was that there was some

1600
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,550
something in dreams that was
informative,

1601
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,750
so that's his.
Now he had a method for describe for

1602
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:30,751
extracting out from the dream what dream
purported to represent and he outlined

1603
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:36,250
that in great detail in the
interpretation of dreams and if you want

1604
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:39,430
to read one book by Freud,
I would highly recommend that when it's

1605
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,390
a very long book and it's very detailed,
but for a desert extraordinarily

1606
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:45,700
comprehensive analysis of the way that
dreams work.

1607
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,800
Now he made the because because he had
brought a theoretical framework to bear,

1608
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,160
even on his investigation into dream
structure,

1609
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:58,120
he concluded that dreams were
essentially wish fulfillments,

1610
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,540
and that's where young and Freud
disagreed.

1611
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:06,010
He also believed that the primary
motivating factor of human beings with

1612
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:08,860
sexual,
and now that's a tougher one to toss

1613
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:11,380
aside because even if you're a
Darwinian,

1614
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,090
rather than afraid,
Ian,

1615
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:18,300
you're going to obviously support the
proposition that sexual motivation among

1616
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,540
any living creature is going to be one
of the highest order motivations because

1617
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:27,010
otherwise creatures don't reproduce and
and prevail over the long run.

1618
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,310
So the question is,
is that is that the ultimate source of

1619
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:33,040
motivation?
And in some sense the answer to that has

1620
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,600
to be yes.
Well,

1621
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:38,080
Freud wanted to make that in some ways
the sole source of motivation,

1622
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:41,620
and I'm oversimplifying and I hate to do
that in relationship to Freud because he

1623
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:44,830
was not as simple minded character
young.

1624
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,200
How to dream once,
if I remember correctly,

1625
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:51,820
that Freud and jung were excavating a
basement.

1626
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,840
And so freud had outlined in Freud had
already discovered the basement,

1627
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:56,230
let's say.

1628
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,680
So that would be the unconscious
structure of the psyche and young broke

1629
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:03,310
through into another basement that was a
multi chambered place.

1630
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,330
So many,
many,

1631
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:09,180
many rooms and I suppose what drove
young and freud apart was the

1632
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,190
proposition that there was a hell of a
lot more going down,

1633
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,430
going on down there.
Then had already met the eye and they

1634
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:19,390
broke on the idea that the sexual
impulse was primary,

1635
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,510
roughly speaking,
they broke when you wrote a book called

1636
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:24,490
symbols of transformation,
which is actually.

1637
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,070
There's,
there's three books that I know of that

1638
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:30,250
are sort of like maps of meaning.
One is symbols of transformation.

1639
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,000
One is a book by Eric Norman called the
origins and history of consciousness.

1640
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,980
And the third and the third one,
while his maps of meaning,

1641
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:40,960
they're the same book.
They're just like,

1642
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:43,960
they're trying to solve the same problem
from three different directions.

1643
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,600
They're all attempts to address the same
problem.

1644
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,830
And so symbols of transformation was a
book that you wrote about the fantasies

1645
01:25:50,831 --> 01:25:53,560
of schizophrenia,
a American woman,

1646
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,280
and he was.
He was trying to relate her fantasies to

1647
01:25:57,281 --> 01:26:00,220
these old mythological ideas and young's
idea.

1648
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,650
Essentially,
and this is an idea that was shared by

1649
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:04,130
people like piaget,
so we

1650
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,790
were not going to say that you and Freud
just pulled this idea out of the air,

1651
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:13,030
was that the the birthplace of myth,
mythology and literature for that matter

1652
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,790
was the dream that that they share
structural,

1653
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,670
they share,
they share,

1654
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:27,790
they share what mode of information
presentation and it's a relatively

1655
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,790
radical hypothesis,
but,

1656
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:42,280
but given that they both,
they both represent

1657
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,773
hm

1658
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,980
dreams,
dreams and mythological representations

1659
01:26:47,981 --> 01:26:52,060
share and essentially narrative
structure and they use their literary

1660
01:26:52,061 --> 01:26:54,160
like you know,
I mean it's not so unreasonable to

1661
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:58,660
notice that a dream at night is like the
movie that you play in your head and

1662
01:26:58,661 --> 01:27:02,350
it's not unreasonable to note as well
that the dreams that you have at night

1663
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:05,830
bear a relationship to the daydreams
that you have during the day.

1664
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,010
It's a form of cognition.
It seems like an involuntary form of

1665
01:27:09,011 --> 01:27:10,930
cognition though.
And that's a very strange thing.

1666
01:27:10,931 --> 01:27:13,300
So young thought about the dream as
nature,

1667
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:16,180
speaking of its own accord,
roughly speaking.

1668
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,890
And so his idea was,
well,

1669
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:19,600
when you,
when you sleep,

1670
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,580
you dream,
but the dream happens to you.

1671
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:25,210
It's not something that you create the
way that you don't even think about

1672
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:26,740
creating it,
because I might say,

1673
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,880
well,
what are you thinking about?

1674
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:30,550
And you'll say,
I'm thinking about whatever it is,

1675
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,970
and you'll take credit in some sense for
thinking that because it seems like a

1676
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:37,030
voluntary activity,
but what happens at night is that you

1677
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:39,730
think,
but you think involuntarily and so what

1678
01:27:39,731 --> 01:27:43,240
young would say is that means that
something is thinking in you

1679
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:47,980
and that's a perfectly reasonable way of
looking at it and this is one of the

1680
01:27:47,981 --> 01:27:52,000
things that's uncanny about the cycle
analysts as they were willing to take

1681
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:54,880
their observations to their logical
conclusion.

1682
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,600
There are things that think in you.
What are those things and what are they

1683
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:05,170
thinking and why are they thinking it?
Now,

1684
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,060
if you do dream analysis,
and this is a tricky thing because who's

1685
01:28:10,061 --> 01:28:12,430
to say if your damn analysis is correct?
Right?

1686
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:14,840
It's very difficult to understand that
if you.

1687
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:18,790
If you do dream analysis with someone,
you generally have them lay out their

1688
01:28:18,791 --> 01:28:23,020
dream and then you ask them when they're
going through their dream of second

1689
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:24,430
time,
they lay out their dream and you can

1690
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:27,490
kind of get a picture of it,
and then they lay out their dream a

1691
01:28:27,491 --> 01:28:31,420
second time and as they go through it,
every time they mentioned a detail or a

1692
01:28:31,421 --> 01:28:34,210
character,
you ask them what that reminds them of

1693
01:28:34,211 --> 01:28:39,211
and the hypothesis is that the dream is
presenting an image or an idea that's

1694
01:28:39,521 --> 01:28:44,020
associated with a network of ideas and
then if you can expand on the network of

1695
01:28:44,021 --> 01:28:47,410
ideas as you go through the dream,
you can elaborate on the dream.

1696
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:51,820
You can expand it upwards and you can
start to see what it might be attempting

1697
01:28:51,821 --> 01:28:53,950
to put forward.
Now.

1698
01:28:53,951 --> 01:28:56,770
Freud's idea was that the dream knew
what it was doing,

1699
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,580
but that its content was being
suppressed and oppressed by an internal

1700
01:29:00,581 --> 01:29:02,100
sensor.
The dream had to be

1701
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,480
sneaky about what it was saying because
it was going to deliver a message that

1702
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:11,100
the person didn't want to hear.
That that was tied up with his idea of

1703
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:13,800
repression,
but that's not young's idea.

1704
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,330
See,
young's idea was different.

1705
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,370
He said,
no,

1706
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:19,110
no.
The dream is trying to tell you what is

1707
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:23,580
trying to tell you as clear as it can.
That's just the best it can do,

1708
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,030
and so you could think of the dream,
and this is I believe,

1709
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:30,000
the right way to think about it.
The dream is the birthplace of thought.

1710
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:32,730
The same way that artists are the
birthplace of culture.

1711
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:37,110
It's exactly the same process.
It's that your mind is groping outward

1712
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:42,300
to try to comprehend what it has not yet
comprehended and it does that first by

1713
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,170
trying to map it on to image and it's
doing that in the dream and it's

1714
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:50,100
somewhat incoherent and and,
and well,

1715
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:53,760
let's stick with coherent because it's
not yet a full fledge thought.

1716
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,110
It's the birthplace of thought.
It's a fantasy about what might be,

1717
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:03,540
and then if you can grip the fantasy and
share it with other people,

1718
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:07,530
then maybe they can elaborate upon it
and bring it into being with more

1719
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:10,230
clarity than it would be if it merely
existed.

1720
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:14,010
As the precursor of a thought in your
imagination,

1721
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,970
do you know if you take people and I've
told you this and you expose them

1722
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:21,750
voluntarily to things that they are
avoiding and are afraid of,

1723
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,640
you know,
that they know they need to overcome in

1724
01:30:23,641 --> 01:30:26,100
order to meet their goals,
their self defined goals.

1725
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:29,880
If you can teach people to stand up in
the face of the things they're afraid

1726
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:32,850
of,
they get stronger and you don't know

1727
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:36,120
what the upper limits to that are
because you might ask yourself like if

1728
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:41,040
for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing
what you knew you needed to do by the

1729
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,360
depth,
by your own definitions,

1730
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:44,010
right?
Within the value structure that you've

1731
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:46,050
created,
to the degree that you've done that,

1732
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,760
what would you be like?

1733
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,630
Well,
you know,

1734
01:30:50,631 --> 01:30:53,510
there are remarkable people who come
into the world from time to time and

1735
01:30:53,511 --> 01:30:58,280
there are people who do find out over
decades long periods what they could be

1736
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:03,281
like if they were who they were.
If they said if they spoke their being

1737
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:08,090
forward and they get stronger and
stronger and stronger and we don't know

1738
01:31:08,091 --> 01:31:10,250
the limits to that.
We do not know the limits to that,

1739
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:11,510
and so you could say,
well,

1740
01:31:11,511 --> 01:31:15,590
in part perhaps the reason that you're
suffering unbearably can be left at your

1741
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:18,890
feet because you're not everything you
could be and you know it,

1742
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,520
and of course that's a terrible thing to
admit and it's a terrible thing to

1743
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:25,010
consider,
but there's real promise in it,

1744
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,300
right?
Because it means that

1745
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,660
perhaps there's another way that you
could look at the world and the number

1746
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:33,030
another way that you could act in the
world.

1747
01:31:33,031 --> 01:31:35,730
So what it would reflect back to you
would be much better than what it

1748
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:39,240
reflects back to you now.
And then the second part of that is,

1749
01:31:39,241 --> 01:31:41,940
well,
imagine that many people did that

1750
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,070
because we've done a lot as human
beings.

1751
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:46,890
We've done a lot of remarkable things
and I told you already,

1752
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,990
I think before that today,
for example,

1753
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:54,260
about 250,000 people will be lifted out
of abject poverty and about 300,000

1754
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,610
people attached to the electrical power
grid.

1755
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,040
We're making.
People were lifting people out of

1756
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,470
collectively at a faster rate that's
ever occurred in the history of

1757
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:07,330
humankind by a huge margin and that's
been going on unbelievably quickly since

1758
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:11,050
the year 2000.
The UN employee plan to have poverty

1759
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:15,670
between 2000 and 2015 and it was
accomplished by 2013.

1760
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:20,230
So there's inequality developing in many
places and you hear lots of political

1761
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:24,820
agitation about that.
But overall the tide is lifting everyone

1762
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:27,970
up and now it's a great thing.
We have no idea how fast we can multiply

1763
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:31,000
that if people got their act together
and really aimed at it.

1764
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:32,171
Because,
you know,

1765
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:35,140
my,
my experience is with people that were

1766
01:32:35,141 --> 01:32:38,410
probably running at about 51 percent of
our capacity.

1767
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,630
Something mean you can think about this
yourselves.

1768
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:45,700
I often ask undergraduates how many
hours a day you waste or how many hours

1769
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:48,550
a week you waste.
The classic answer is something like

1770
01:32:48,551 --> 01:32:50,770
four to six hours a day,
you know,

1771
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:52,730
inefficient studying,
uh,

1772
01:32:52,731 --> 01:32:56,020
watching things on youtube that not only
do you not want to watch,

1773
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:58,990
that you don't even care about that make
you feel horrible about watching.

1774
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:01,930
After you're done,
that's probably four hours right there.

1775
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,600
Now you think,
well that's 20,

1776
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,830
25 hours a week.

1777
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,950
It's 100 hours a month.
That's two and a half full work weeks.

1778
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:14,160
It's half a year of work weeks per year.
And if your time is worth $20 an hour,

1779
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:17,770
which is a radical underestimate.
It's probably more like 50.

1780
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,140
If you think about it in terms of
deferred wages,

1781
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:25,440
if you're wasting 20 hours a week,
you're wasting $50,000 a year and you

1782
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:29,770
are doing that right now and it's
because you're young wasting $50,000 a

1783
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:33,070
year as a way bigger catastrophe then it
would be for me to waste it because I'm

1784
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:36,310
not going to last nearly as long.
And so if your life isn't everything,

1785
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:37,720
it could be.
You could ask yourself,

1786
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:39,550
well,
what would happen if you just stopped

1787
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:42,340
wasting the opportunities that are in
front of you?

1788
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,700
You be who knows how much more
efficient,

1789
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:49,360
10 times more efficient,
20 times more efficient.

1790
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,200
That's the prieto distribution.
You have no idea how efficient,

1791
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:54,340
efficient people get.

1792
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,980
It's completely.
It's off the charts

1793
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,790
well,
and if we all got our act together

1794
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:04,870
collectively and stopped making things
worse because that's another thing

1795
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:08,260
people do all the time.
Not only do they not do what they should

1796
01:34:08,261 --> 01:34:11,170
to make things better,
they actively attempt to make things

1797
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:16,171
worse because they're spiteful or
resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or

1798
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:21,541
homicidal or genocidal or all of those
things all bundled together in an

1799
01:34:21,881 --> 01:34:25,990
absolutely pathological package.
If people stopped really,

1800
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:29,710
really trying just to make things worse,
we have no idea how much better they

1801
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:33,670
would get just because of that.
So there's this weird dynamic that's

1802
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:37,990
part of the existential system of ideas
between human vulnerability,

1803
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,140
social judgment,
both of which are are,

1804
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,290
are,
are major causes of suffering and the

1805
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:47,950
failure of individuals to adopt the
responsibility that they know they

1806
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:50,590
should adopt.
And that's the thing that's interesting

1807
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:52,810
too,
is that like one of the,

1808
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:56,170
another thing I've asked often asked my
undergraduate classes,

1809
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,390
you know,
there's this idea that people have that

1810
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:00,770
people have a conscience

1811
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:03,750
and you know what the conscience is.
It's,

1812
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,940
it's this feeling or voice you have in
your head just before you do something

1813
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:10,170
that you know,
is stupid,

1814
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:13,710
telling you that probably you shouldn't
do that stupid thing.

1815
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,500
You don't have to listen to it strangely
enough,

1816
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:20,640
but you go ahead and do it anyways.
And then of course exactly what the

1817
01:35:20,641 --> 01:35:24,060
conscience told you was going to happen
inevitably happens so that you feel even

1818
01:35:24,061 --> 01:35:26,790
stupider about it than you would if it
happened by accident.

1819
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,960
Because,
you know,

1820
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:31,590
I knew this was going to happen,
I got a warning it was going to happen

1821
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:34,770
and I went and did it anyways.
And the funny thing too is that that

1822
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:38,160
conscience operates within people and we
really don't understand what the hell

1823
01:35:38,161 --> 01:35:38,994
that is.

1824
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,160
So you might say,
well,

1825
01:35:41,161 --> 01:35:44,700
what would happen if you abided by your
conscience for five years or for 10

1826
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:47,070
years?
What sort of position might you be in?

1827
01:35:47,071 --> 01:35:50,460
What sort of family might you have?
What sort of relationship might you be

1828
01:35:50,461 --> 01:35:55,050
able to forge and you can be bloody sure
that a relationship that's forged on the

1829
01:35:55,051 --> 01:36:00,000
basis of who you actually are is going
to be a lot stronger and more welcome

1830
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,670
than one that's forged on the basis of
who you aren't.

1831
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:03,871
Now,
of course,

1832
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:08,430
that means that the person you're with
has to deal with the full force of you

1833
01:36:08,431 --> 01:36:10,650
in all your ability and your
catastrophe,

1834
01:36:10,651 --> 01:36:13,200
and that's a very,
very difficult thing to negotiate,

1835
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,110
but if you do negotiate it well,
at least you,

1836
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,320
you have something,
you have somewhere solid to stand and

1837
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:22,590
you have somewhere to live.
You have a real life and it's a great

1838
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:25,770
basis upon which to bring children into
the world,

1839
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:27,630
for example,
because you can have an actual

1840
01:36:27,631 --> 01:36:30,960
relationship with them instead of
torturing them half to death,

1841
01:36:30,961 --> 01:36:35,961
which is what happens in a tremendous,
a tremendously large minority of cases.

1842
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,140
Well,
it's more than that too because,

1843
01:36:40,141 --> 01:36:43,200
and this is what I'll close with and
this is why I wanted to introduce social

1844
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,580
knutson's readings to you.
You see,

1845
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,740
because it isn't merely that your fate
depends on whether or not you get your

1846
01:36:49,741 --> 01:36:54,030
act together and to what degree you
decide that you're going to live out

1847
01:36:54,031 --> 01:36:57,120
your own genuine being.
It isn't only your fate,

1848
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,900
it's the fate of everyone that you're
networked with and so you know,

1849
01:37:00,901 --> 01:37:01,734
you think,
well,

1850
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:05,310
there's 9 billion,
7 billion people in the world.

1851
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,530
We're going to peak at about 9 billion
by the way,

1852
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:11,160
and then it'll decline rapidly,
but 7 billion people in the world and

1853
01:37:11,161 --> 01:37:13,890
who are you?
You're just one little dust mote among

1854
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:16,410
that 7 billion,
and so it really doesn't matter what you

1855
01:37:16,411 --> 01:37:19,080
do or don't do,
but that's simply not the case.

1856
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:23,040
It's the wrong model because you're at
the center of a network.

1857
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:26,580
You're a node in a network.
Of course that's even more true now that

1858
01:37:26,581 --> 01:37:28,170
we have social media.
You'll,

1859
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:32,190
you'll know a thousand people at least
over the course of your life and they'll

1860
01:37:32,191 --> 01:37:35,640
know a thousand people each and that
puts you one person away from a million

1861
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:40,470
and two persons away from a billion,
and so that's how you're connected and

1862
01:37:40,471 --> 01:37:43,500
the things you do.
They're like dropping a stone in a pond.

1863
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:48,240
The ripples move outward and they effect
things in ways that you can't fully

1864
01:37:48,241 --> 01:37:52,110
comprehend and it means that the things
that you do and that you don't do are

1865
01:37:52,111 --> 01:37:57,090
far more important than you think,
and so if you act that way,

1866
01:37:57,091 --> 01:37:59,340
of course,
the terror of realizing that is that it

1867
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:02,040
actually starts to matter what you do
and you might say,

1868
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:04,140
well,
that's better than living a meaningless

1869
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:06,480
existence.
It's better for it to matter,

1870
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,260
but I mean if you really asked yourself,
would you be so sure if you had the

1871
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:10,920
choice?

1872
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,560
I can live with no responsibility
whatsoever.

1873
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:18,360
The price I pay is that nothing matters
or I can reverse it and everything

1874
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:21,330
matters,
but I have to take the responsibility

1875
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:24,660
that's associated with that.
It's not so obvious to me that people

1876
01:38:24,661 --> 01:38:27,480
would take the meaningful path.
No.

1877
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:28,171
When you say,
well,

1878
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:30,960
nihilists suffer dreadfully because
there's no meaning in their life and

1879
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:31,950
they still suffer.
Yeah,

1880
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:34,200
but the advantages,
they have no responsibility.

1881
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,740
So that's the payoff and I actually
think that's the motivation.

1882
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:38,041
Say,
well,

1883
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:41,040
I can't help being nihilistic.
All my belief systems have collapsed.

1884
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:41,821
It's like,
yeah,

1885
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:44,280
maybe.
Maybe you've just allowed them to

1886
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:47,400
collapse because it's a hell of a lot
easier than acting them out and the

1887
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:49,020
price you pay is a meaningless
suffering,

1888
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:51,960
but you can always whining about that
and people will feel sorry for you and

1889
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:54,870
you have the option of taking the
pathway of the martyr so that's a pretty

1890
01:38:54,871 --> 01:38:55,410
good deal.

1891
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:59,130
All things considered,
especially when the when the alternative

1892
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:04,131
is to bear your burden properly and to
live forthrightly in the world.

1893
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:06,870
Well,
what SOS units and figured out in so

1894
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:09,450
many people in the 20th century,
it's not just him,

1895
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:14,400
even though he's the best example,
is that if you live a pathological life,

1896
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:18,540
you pathologize your society and if
enough people do that,

1897
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:23,190
then it's held really,
really,

1898
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,500
and you can read the Gulag archipelago.
If you have the fortitude to do that and

1899
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:32,310
you'll see exactly what hell is like and
then you can decide if that's a place

1900
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:34,740
you'd like to visit or even more
importantly,

1901
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:37,440
if it's a light.
If it's a place you'd like to visit and

1902
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:41,400
take all your family and friends because
that's what happened in the 20th

1903
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,234
century.

1904
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,730
Okay,
so now I'll read you the story of the

1905
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:47,880
Buddha,
the father of Prince Gautama,

1906
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:51,600
the Buddha savior of the Orient,
determined to protect his son from

1907
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:55,470
desperate knowledge and tragic awareness
built for him and enclosed pavilion,

1908
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:58,200
a walled garden of earthly delights.
Okay,

1909
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:03,201
so the story goes that an angel visited
Buddhist father and said that he's going

1910
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:06,720
to have a son and the son is either
going to become the greatest ruler that

1911
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:10,680
the world has ever seen or a spiritual
leader and the father being a practical

1912
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:14,520
man thought where there's no bloody way.
I want my son to be some like wandering

1913
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:17,310
spiritual leader.
I want him to be the greatest king that

1914
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,140
the world has ever seen.
Okay?

1915
01:40:19,141 --> 01:40:24,141
And so the father decides,
how am I going to get my son to be the

1916
01:40:25,411 --> 01:40:29,160
greatest ruler the world has ever seen?
I better get them to fall in love with

1917
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:32,420
the world because then he's not going to
go traipsing after some sort of pathway.

1918
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,450
Did spiritual knowledge.
He's going to stick to practical tasks,

1919
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:38,430
right?
That's something that a father should do

1920
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:40,500
to some degree is orient you in the
world.

1921
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:42,840
Right?
And maybe shouldn't subvert your

1922
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:45,780
spiritual development to any great
degree,

1923
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:49,080
but there's a practical element to this
and and so anyways,

1924
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:51,210
that's how it works.
And so that's what happens.

1925
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:56,730
The father bill is this of perfection
and he eliminates from it everything

1926
01:40:58,271 --> 01:41:01,600
that's a reminder of the suffering
that's associated with life.

1927
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:04,660
So the only thing that's allowed,
the only creatures that are allowed to

1928
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:06,280
be in there,
the only people that are allowed to be

1929
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:07,960
in there are healthy,
young,

1930
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:11,200
and happy people.
So the Buddha grows up surrounded by

1931
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,510
nothing but the positive elements of
life.

1932
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:14,171
Well,
you think,

1933
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:15,100
well,
what does that mean?

1934
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:20,200
While it's akin to the paradise idea,
obviously walled enclosure of paradise

1935
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,710
where there's no death,
but there's more to it than that too.

1936
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,500
It's also in some sense what a good
father would do.

1937
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,070
What do you do with your young children?
Well,

1938
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,650
you don't expose them to death and decay
at every step of the way.

1939
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:33,370
Right?
To you.

1940
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:37,270
You build a protected world for them
like a wall enclosure,

1941
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:41,050
and you only keep what's healthy and
life giving inside of it,

1942
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:44,500
and you don't expose them to things that
they can't tolerate.

1943
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:46,330
You know,
maybe you don't take a three year old to

1944
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:47,500
a funeral.
Now maybe you do,

1945
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,750
but maybe you don't.
There's things that you don't expect

1946
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:53,020
them to be able to cope with.
You regulate what they're allowed to

1947
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:54,730
watch.
You're not going to show them the tech

1948
01:41:54,731 --> 01:41:58,000
Texas chainsaw massacre when they're
four years old.

1949
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:00,970
Right,
so so you're staving off knowledge of

1950
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:03,640
mortality and death,
and so he's just being a good father in

1951
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:04,480
many ways here.

1952
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:09,220
All signs of decay and degeneration
where thus kept hidden from the prince,

1953
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,510
immersed in the immediate pleasures of
the census in physical love and dance

1954
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:17,140
and music and beauty and pleasure.
Gautama grew to maturity,

1955
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:20,200
protected absolutely from the
limitations of mortal being.

1956
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,360
However,
he grew curious,

1957
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:26,650
despite his father's most particular
attention and will and resolve to leave

1958
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:28,300
his seductive prison.
Well,

1959
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:32,140
it's that curiosity element.
It's the same thing that lurks in the

1960
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:34,630
Adam and Eve story.
It's like God tells Adam and Eve,

1961
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,530
see that tree over there.
Don't be bothered with it.

1962
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,760
Well,
you know what's going to happen with

1963
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:42,100
human beings,
especially if there's a snake associated

1964
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:43,360
with it.
They're going to be over there right

1965
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:45,100
away.
Check in that place out,

1966
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,480
and that's exactly what happens with the
Buddha.

1967
01:42:47,481 --> 01:42:51,760
It's like he's raised to be healthy and
what is.

1968
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:55,990
What's the consequence of that is that
the fact that he's healthy makes them

1969
01:42:55,991 --> 01:43:00,580
look for what's beyond the protected
confines of the thing that made him

1970
01:43:00,581 --> 01:43:01,060
healthy.

1971
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,460
It's like what's like even in the Japan
story,

1972
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:06,400
you know where Japan Paints on
Pinocchio,

1973
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:07,630
his mouth,
and he's ready to go.

1974
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:11,230
He puts them outside the next day and
Pinocchio is ready to run away with all

1975
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:12,011
the kids.
Right?

1976
01:43:12,011 --> 01:43:16,060
So the consequence of raising a child in
a healthy way is that the child is going

1977
01:43:16,061 --> 01:43:20,950
to be curious enough to go out there and
look for some trouble and we actually

1978
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:23,680
know that because there is followup
studies of teenagers,

1979
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:27,220
you imagine that there's teenagers who
never break any rules and then there's

1980
01:43:27,221 --> 01:43:28,990
teenagers who break all the rules.
Okay?

1981
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,290
These teenagers don't do very well.
Introverted,

1982
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:33,520
depressed,
anxious,

1983
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,990
depressed.
Sorry,

1984
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:37,510
I said that twice.
These ones are antisocial.

1985
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:39,970
The ones in the middle,
that's what you want.

1986
01:43:39,971 --> 01:43:43,780
You want your damn teenager to get out
of the paradisical confines of your

1987
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:46,780
house and to go cause some trouble and
to investigate.

1988
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,300
Maybe you don't want to know about it
anymore than you have to.

1989
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:53,300
You don't want them to be breaking rules
all the time and you don't want them to

1990
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:57,470
be so timid into press that they can't
make a move on their own and never make

1991
01:43:57,471 --> 01:44:00,500
a mistake.
So the paradoxical thing here,

1992
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:02,900
and it sort of echoed are,
this is why I like these two stories

1993
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:06,320
back to back is like if you give people
what they want,

1994
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:09,290
then the first thing they're going to do
is try to get beyond it.

1995
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,320
And Dostoevsky says the same thing and
notes from underground.

1996
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,450
He says,
if you gave people everything they

1997
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:16,010
wanted,
pure utopia.

1998
01:44:16,011 --> 01:44:19,010
So he says,
so that they're sitting in a pool of

1999
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,460
bliss with nothing but bubbles of
happiness coming up from the surface and

2000
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:25,970
all they have to do is eat cake.
And busy themselves with the

2001
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:27,590
continuation of the species.

2002
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:32,180
Dusty said Dostoyevsky's observation is
the first thing that people would do is

2003
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:35,960
find something to smash that with.
Just so that something interesting and

2004
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:37,760
perverse could happen.
It's like,

2005
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:38,451
well,
yes,

2006
01:44:38,451 --> 01:44:41,570
we're,
we're creatures that are designed to

2007
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:44,780
encounter the unknown.
We want to keep moving beyond what we

2008
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:47,120
have.
Even if we have what we have is what we

2009
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:49,250
want.
And maybe that's partly because we're

2010
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:51,410
oriented towards the future.
We think,

2011
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:53,390
well this is great,
but it's not good enough.

2012
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,130
It's great,
but it's not good enough.

2013
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:58,130
There's always something more that
drives us forward.

2014
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:00,020
While.
So that's what happens with the Buddha.

2015
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,290
He gets curious.
He sees the walls,

2016
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:05,240
he thinks there's walls,
there's probably something outside of

2017
01:45:05,241 --> 01:45:07,400
those walls.
So then he goes to his father

2018
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:12,330
and he says,
I'm,

2019
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:14,540
I want to go outside,
what's outside?

2020
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,570
And his father says,
no,

2021
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,610
you don't want to go outside.

2022
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:17,450
And Buddha says,
yeah,

2023
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:20,840
well I really do want to go outside.
And his father knows that unless he lets

2024
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:22,640
him go outside,
he's going to climb over the walls.

2025
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:26,570
And so the father decides he's gonna.
Let them go inside,

2026
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:28,340
please go fix everything out there
first.

2027
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:31,430
So he goes outside.
It's like the Chinese preparing for the

2028
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:33,200
Olympics,
you know when they sprayed the grass

2029
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:36,790
with with with green paint,
got rid of all the homeless people is

2030
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:39,560
the same thing.
So he goes outside the city and he tells

2031
01:45:39,561 --> 01:45:40,394
everyone,
all right,

2032
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:42,920
old people,
sick people dying.

2033
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:46,250
People hit the road.
We don't want to see it for awhile.

2034
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:49,130
Clean all this out.
We want the attractive people around the

2035
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:52,760
sides of the roads like waving palm
fronds and all of that and so when my

2036
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:54,650
son comes out,
he's going to see nothing but what's

2037
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:56,870
good and so we get that all arranged it.

2038
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,080
He lets his son go outside.
Now his son goes outside in this little

2039
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:03,500
chariot thing and he has someone with
him now,

2040
01:46:03,501 --> 01:46:06,710
unbeknownst to his father,
that person that's with them as an

2041
01:46:06,711 --> 01:46:09,320
emissary of the gods.
And so in a perverse way,

2042
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:13,550
he plays the same role as the serpent in
the story of Adam and eve,

2043
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:19,090
and the gods have already arranged so
that the father's a carer is going to be

2044
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:23,150
insufficient and it's the snake in the
garden idea.

2045
01:46:23,151 --> 01:46:26,540
It's like no matter how much care you
take to make things perfect,

2046
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:31,640
some of the some of what what you're
excluding is going to come back in.

2047
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:36,020
So anyways,
Buddha goes outside and he's in his

2048
01:46:36,021 --> 01:46:39,830
chariot and preparations were made to
guild is chosen route to cover the

2049
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:43,340
adventurous path with flowers and to
display for his admiration and

2050
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:45,440
preoccupation,
the fairest women of the kingdom.

2051
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:49,680
The print set out with full retinue in
the shield and comfort of a chaperone

2052
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:52,410
chariot.
And delighted in the Panorama previously

2053
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:54,330
prepared for him.
The gods,

2054
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:57,270
however,
decided to disrupt these most carefully

2055
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:02,271
laid plans and sent an aged man to
hobble in full view alongside the road.

2056
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,450
The princess fascinated gaze fell upon
the ancient interloper.

2057
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,270
Compelled by curiosity.
He asked his attendant,

2058
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:14,010
what is that creature stumbling,
shabby bent and broken beside my retinue

2059
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:18,360
and the attendant answered that is a man
like other men who was born in infant

2060
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,950
became a child,
a youth,

2061
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,210
a husband,
a father,

2062
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:25,560
a father of fathers.
He has become old subject to destruction

2063
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:26,730
of his beauty,
his will,

2064
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:29,910
and the possibilities of life like other
men,

2065
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,100
you say,
hesitantly inquired the prints.

2066
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:36,810
That means this will happen to me,
and the attendant answered inevitably

2067
01:47:36,811 --> 01:47:39,240
with the passage of time.
Well,

2068
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:40,350
that's the end of that party.

2069
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:44,340
The world collapses in on Buddha and
paying he hightails at home.

2070
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:45,570
Well,
what does that mean?

2071
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,950
Well,
that's what children do.

2072
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,200
Roughly speaking is there around their
mother.

2073
01:47:49,570 --> 01:47:50,910
There are.
They've got security there.

2074
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:53,820
They go out into the unknown,
they encounter something that's just a

2075
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:55,300
little bit too much for them.
Bang,

2076
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:56,620
they come home,
they get old,

2077
01:47:56,621 --> 01:47:58,230
padded,
back into shape and hugged,

2078
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:01,290
didn't taken care of.
Hugging children and patting is actually

2079
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:03,990
analgesic.
It actually reduces pate.

2080
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,260
Unsurprisingly,
that's what you do with someone who's

2081
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:07,103
grieving,
right?

2082
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,370
So you hug them because grief is paid
so,

2083
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:11,911
so they,
you know,

2084
01:48:11,911 --> 01:48:13,580
you pat them and they get rid of their
pain.

2085
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,980
They get rid of their anxiety,
you calm them down and what happens?

2086
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,720
Well,
the next day they want to go out again.

2087
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,550
Well,
that's exactly what happens to the

2088
01:48:20,551 --> 01:48:23,010
Buddha.
So he's all shorted out by his encounter

2089
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:25,200
with death,
which is very little different than what

2090
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:29,820
happens to Adam and eve runs back
recoveries for six months.

2091
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:34,050
He has posttraumatic stress disorder.
He runs home and he recovers for six

2092
01:48:34,051 --> 01:48:34,884
months,
right

2093
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,370
in time.
His anxiety lessened his curiosity,

2094
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:39,780
grinny.
He ventured outside again.

2095
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:43,980
This time that God sent a sick man
interview this creature,

2096
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:46,050
he asked his attendance,
shaking and palsy,

2097
01:48:46,110 --> 01:48:48,360
horribly afflicted,
unbearable to behold,

2098
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:50,850
a source of pity and contempt.
What is he?

2099
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:54,090
And the attendant answered that's a man
like other men

2100
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:58,620
was born whole,
but who became ill and sick,

2101
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:01,830
unable to cope,
a burden to himself and others suffering

2102
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:04,650
and incurable like other men,
you say,

2103
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:07,500
inquired the prince.
This could happen to me and the

2104
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:10,620
attendant answers,
no man is exempt from the ravages of

2105
01:49:10,621 --> 01:49:12,810
disease.
Once again,

2106
01:49:12,811 --> 01:49:15,270
the world collapsed and Gautama returned
to his home,

2107
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,150
but the delights of his previous life
were ashes in his mouth and he ventured

2108
01:49:21,151 --> 01:49:25,080
forth a third time,
the gods in their mercy sent him a dead

2109
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:27,960
man in funeral procession.
This creature,

2110
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:30,570
he asked his attendant laying so still
appearing,

2111
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:34,170
so fearsome,
surrounded by grief and by Soro last and

2112
01:49:34,171 --> 01:49:35,460
for Lauren.
What is he?

2113
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,150
And the attendant answered that is a man
like other men,

2114
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,430
born of woman,
beloved in hated.

2115
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:43,680
Who is once you.
Who once was you,

2116
01:49:43,681 --> 01:49:47,680
and now as the earth like other men you
say acquired prince,

2117
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,940
then this could happen to me.
This is your and said the attendant and

2118
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:53,890
the end of all men.
Well,

2119
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:55,480
that's the end of childhood,
right?

2120
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:59,080
There's no going back after that.
It's like Pinocchio goes back.

2121
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,560
There's no one home anymore.
It's there's nothing that your father

2122
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:05,710
can do to protect you from knowledge of
death.

2123
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:09,970
There is no returning to the childhood
unconsciousness because you're.

2124
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:12,490
You now know,
and there's no going backwards.

2125
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,830
Suicide.
That's going backwards.

2126
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:19,510
That's how you replace your emergent
self consciousness with the old blissful

2127
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:22,960
unconsciousness,
and that's exactly what suicidal people

2128
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:27,730
wish that are going to destroy their
painful selfconsciousness and make it

2129
01:50:27,731 --> 01:50:32,460
all go away.
The world collabs to final time and

2130
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:36,330
Gautama asked to be returned home,
but the attendant had orders from the

2131
01:50:36,331 --> 01:50:39,210
prince's father and took them instead to
a festival of women.

2132
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,931
Oh,
curing.

2133
01:50:39,931 --> 01:50:42,150
Near occurring nearby in a grove in the
woods.

2134
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,140
The prince was met by a beautiful
assemblage who offered themselves freely

2135
01:50:46,141 --> 01:50:50,100
to him without restraint in song,
dance and play in the spirit of sensual

2136
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:52,950
love,
but Gautama could think only of death

2137
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:56,970
and the inevitable decomposition of
beauty and took no pleasure in the

2138
01:50:56,971 --> 01:50:57,804
display.

2139
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:03,600
Well,
so you see the parallels between one

2140
01:51:03,601 --> 01:51:05,490
story and the other.
They're the same.

2141
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,640
They have the same underlying structure,
initial paradise,

2142
01:51:08,670 --> 01:51:11,040
partly childhood,
partly unconsciousness.

2143
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:16,050
The emergence of knowledge of mortality
into that and the demolition of the of

2144
01:51:16,051 --> 01:51:18,600
the paradise.
This is the same story that we've been

2145
01:51:18,601 --> 01:51:22,590
talking about all along.
Ordered state collapse into chaos.

2146
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:25,080
While the rest of the story is the
return,

2147
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:27,660
like in the Bible,
Bible is actually set up that way,

2148
01:51:27,661 --> 01:51:31,230
it's collapse into history and then

2149
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:34,020
a movement upward.
The question is,

2150
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,570
what's the movement upward?
That's the question here.

2151
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,880
When the collapse is caused by knowledge
of mortality and self caught and the

2152
01:51:41,881 --> 01:51:44,190
emergence of self consciousness and
knowledge of death,

2153
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:49,220
is there any manner in which redemption
can be attained or is that the final

2154
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:50,820
like,
is that finally,

2155
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:53,160
is that.
Does that finally demolished you?

2156
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:55,880
Well,
that's the question and that's that's,

2157
01:51:56,100 --> 01:52:01,100
that's it's the answer to that question
that entire civilizations constantly

2158
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,770
pursue and the question is,
well,

2159
01:52:04,771 --> 01:52:08,820
what is the answer?
And part of the answer is identification

2160
01:52:08,821 --> 01:52:12,390
with this spirit that generates order
out of chaos.

2161
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:15,140
Well,
I'll tell you a couple of strange things

2162
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,180
that it thinks that I don't really
understand.

2163
01:52:17,181 --> 01:52:20,390
The first is when we've done the
analysis of the effects of the future

2164
01:52:20,391 --> 01:52:23,600
authoring program,
it has had a different differential

2165
01:52:23,601 --> 01:52:28,340
impact on men and it's had a
particularly differential impact on what

2166
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:32,870
I would call it excluded men and so that
would be non western ethic minority men

2167
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:38,080
or or what majority of men who aren't
doing very well.

2168
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,190
So for example,
at Mohawk College,

2169
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:44,750
the future authoring program had a
particularly robust effect on Mohawk

2170
01:52:44,751 --> 01:52:46,100
college who are men who

2171
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:50,810
hadn't done very well in high school and
who hadn't picked a major that had a

2172
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:53,170
destination,
a career destination edits,

2173
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:57,560
and so you can imagine those people are.
They have an ambiguous relationship with

2174
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:02,450
the idea of education and they're not
oriented specifically towards a goal.

2175
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:07,250
They're not very motivated.
Now why did it have a differential

2176
01:53:07,251 --> 01:53:09,800
effect on men?
That's a good question.

2177
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:11,691
Well,
first of all,

2178
01:53:11,691 --> 01:53:15,320
the women are doing better,
so it might just be a matter of the fact

2179
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:18,410
that it does better for people who
aren't doing as well and at the moment

2180
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:20,930
most of them are men.
I don't believe.

2181
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:24,260
I think that might be part of it,
but I don't believe that's all of it.

2182
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,590
I think that part of the reason that
women are doing better is because

2183
01:53:27,591 --> 01:53:31,970
they're agreeable and so if a system
sets out a structure and says,

2184
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,180
here's a pathway to attainment,
the women won't rebel against that.

2185
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:37,610
They'll go along with it and that's
working very well for them at the

2186
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:38,750
moment.
The men,

2187
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:42,110
especially the men on the disagreeable
end of the distribution and there's way

2188
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:45,020
more men on the district disagreeable
end of the distribution.

2189
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:46,370
Then there are women,
right?

2190
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:49,130
That's what you get from.
If you look at overlapping normal

2191
01:53:49,131 --> 01:53:51,560
distributions.
So there's the male district,

2192
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:55,670
female distribution for agreeableness,
mail distribution for agreeableness.

2193
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:57,920
Tremendous overlap.
Okay.

2194
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:00,350
Women are higher.
All the really agreeable people are

2195
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:02,780
women.
All the really disagreeable people are

2196
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:06,020
meant and maybe the real differences
occur at the extremes,

2197
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:06,943
right?
So,

2198
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:07,840
so,
and it's,

2199
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,170
it's a very interesting side effect of
overlapping distributions so people can

2200
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:15,890
be mostly the same,
but that can still produce radical

2201
01:54:15,891 --> 01:54:19,130
differences.
Disagreeable men won't do anything they

2202
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:21,410
don't want to do.
They just say,

2203
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:25,110
up yours,
I'll go home and play video games with

2204
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:25,300
you.

2205
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:28,970
I'm not listening to your stupid classes
and why should I work for you?

2206
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:32,510
I'll just go have fun.
I'll do my own thing.

2207
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:36,260
I don't think they're motivated.
And so then if you take the men who are

2208
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:37,610
like that and you say,
okay,

2209
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:40,460
what do you want?
You can have what you want,

2210
01:54:40,461 --> 01:54:43,270
but you have figured out what it is.
So then they write down what they want

2211
01:54:43,271 --> 01:54:44,104
and they think,
oh hey,

2212
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:46,910
well that might be worth having.
So maybe I'll put some effort into it.

2213
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:49,310
That's what it looks like to me.
Now,

2214
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:52,190
you know,
that's weak evidence and this is a weak

2215
01:54:52,191 --> 01:54:54,680
argument,
but I'm trying to stretch out my

2216
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:57,140
understanding to account for this,
but I'll tell you something else that's

2217
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,240
really weird.
I don't understand this either.

2218
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:04,220
So more than 90 percent of the people
who watch my videos on youtube are men.

2219
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:08,420
Now that's weird because now about 80
percent of psychology students are

2220
01:55:08,421 --> 01:55:11,030
women,
so that is not what you would expect,

2221
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:13,460
right?
You would expect that the majority of

2222
01:55:13,461 --> 01:55:14,990
them would be women and you might say,
well,

2223
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,420
it's because of the political stance
I've taken and I thought,

2224
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:19,880
well that's possible.
So I went and looked at the demographic

2225
01:55:19,881 --> 01:55:23,150
data because I have that.
Well before I did any of the political

2226
01:55:23,151 --> 01:55:25,700
videos,
85 percent of my viewers were men,

2227
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:30,320
so it's actually increased a bit.
It's increased by six percent and that's

2228
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:33,890
not trivial,
but it was still overwhelmingly men.

2229
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:35,900
So that was interesting.
I thought,

2230
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:37,040
what the hell,
why is that?

2231
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:39,980
Exactly.
And then now I've been watching crowds

2232
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:43,710
when I've been talking to them and the
crowds that have come to see me in

2233
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:46,860
person.
This happened at the University of

2234
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:49,470
Toronto Free Speech Debate and I
actually noticed it and commented on it

2235
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,590
before the debate took place because I
was talking about intrinsic differences

2236
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:54,930
between men and women and I looked
around the room and I thought,

2237
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:57,420
hey,
80 percent of the people in this room

2238
01:55:57,421 --> 01:55:58,050
are men.

2239
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:00,780
So I had all the men,
women and women stand up and then all

2240
01:56:00,781 --> 01:56:01,830
the men stand up.
I said,

2241
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:05,460
look like here's a natural experiment.
For some reason,

2242
01:56:05,461 --> 01:56:07,770
80 percent of the people who showed up
to this are men now.

2243
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:11,550
Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to
to do that and it was a risk,

2244
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,740
but I thought,
no,

2245
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:17,130
there's something going on here.
And then what's interesting now is that

2246
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,180
every public appearance that I've made
that's related to the sort of topics

2247
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:23,460
that we're discussing is overwhelmingly
men.

2248
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:27,420
It's like it's like 85 to 90 percent.
And so I thought,

2249
01:56:27,421 --> 01:56:28,260
wow,
that's weird.

2250
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:30,060
Like what the Hell's going on here?
Exactly.

2251
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:34,530
And then the other thing I've noticed is
that I've been talking a lot to the

2252
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:36,960
crowds that I've been talking to,
not about rights but about

2253
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:38,280
responsibility,
right?

2254
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,260
Because you can't have the bloody
converse.

2255
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:42,570
What are you doing?
You can't have the conversation about

2256
01:56:42,571 --> 01:56:47,040
rights without the conversation about
responsibility because your rights are

2257
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:50,760
my responsibility.
That's what they are technically.

2258
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:55,130
So you just can't have only half of that
discussion and we're only having half

2259
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:56,940
that discussion.
The question is,

2260
01:56:56,941 --> 01:56:58,680
well,
what the hell are you leaving out?

2261
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:02,580
If you only have that half of the
discussion and the answer is,

2262
01:57:02,581 --> 01:57:04,560
well,
you're leaving out responsibility and

2263
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:05,880
then the question is,
well,

2264
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:08,640
what are you leaving out?
If you're leaving out responsibility and

2265
01:57:08,641 --> 01:57:09,870
that answer might be,
well,

2266
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:11,550
maybe you're leaving out the meaning of
life.

2267
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,340
That's what it looks like to me.
It's like,

2268
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,630
here you are suffering away.
What makes it worthwhile?

2269
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:21,450
Rights.
You know you're completely,

2270
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:23,010
oh,
you're completely.

2271
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:28,310
You have no idea what you're you.
It's almost impossible to describe how

2272
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:33,060
bad an idea that is.
Responsibility.

2273
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:35,820
That's what gives life meaning.

2274
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:40,050
It's like lift a load.
Then you can tolerate yourself,

2275
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:41,760
right?
Because look at your useless,

2276
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:44,310
easily hurt,
easily killed.

2277
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:48,090
Why should you have any self respect?
That's the story of the fall.

2278
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:50,510
Pick something up and carry it.
Pick.

2279
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,290
Make it heavy enough so that you can
think,

2280
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:54,690
yeah,
well useless as I am.

2281
01:57:54,691 --> 01:57:57,060
At least I could move that from there to
there.

2282
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,130
Well,
what's really cool about that is that

2283
01:57:59,131 --> 01:58:04,131
when I talk to these crowds about this,
the man's eyes light up and that's very

2284
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:06,420
like I've seen that phenomena because
I've been talking about this

2285
01:58:06,421 --> 01:58:09,090
mythological material for a long time
and I can see what I'm watching.

2286
01:58:09,091 --> 01:58:11,550
Crowds people you know,
their eyebrows lift,

2287
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:14,970
their eyes light up because I put
something together for them,

2288
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:18,570
not what mythological stories do,
so I'm not taking responsibility for

2289
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:20,070
that.
That's what the stories do.

2290
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,720
So I say this story to people,
go click,

2291
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:22,554
click,
click.

2292
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:25,680
You know when their eyes light up,
but this responsibility thing that's a

2293
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:29,310
whole new order of this is that young
men are so hungry for that.

2294
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:32,370
It is unbelievable.
And one of the things I've been talking

2295
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:36,480
to some of the people who've been
running for the conservative leadership

2296
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:39,120
in Canada and I've been talking to them
about,

2297
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:40,470
well,
if the difficulties they have

2298
01:58:40,471 --> 01:58:42,760
communicating with young people because
conservatives,

2299
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,620
what the hell are they going to sell to
young people,

2300
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:46,420
right?
Because being conservative is something

2301
01:58:46,421 --> 01:58:49,240
that happens when you're older.
They can sell responsibility.

2302
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:52,360
No one's selling it.
And the thing is,

2303
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:54,550
for men,
there's nothing but responsibility.

2304
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:57,250
You know,
I was watching the simpsons the other

2305
01:58:57,251 --> 01:58:59,830
day.
I watched the simpsons episode and I

2306
01:58:59,831 --> 01:59:02,770
deconstructed it,
and so it's really interesting.

2307
01:59:02,771 --> 01:59:07,120
So what happens in the first Simpson
episode is that it's Christmas and homer

2308
01:59:07,121 --> 01:59:09,280
and marge are going to buy some
Christmas presents,

2309
01:59:09,281 --> 01:59:11,350
but homer doesn't get his Christmas
bonus.

2310
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:14,080
And so it was absolutely crushed by
that.

2311
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:18,190
And that actually is a recurring theme
in the simpsons where homer loses his

2312
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:20,440
job or something like that or can't make
enough money.

2313
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:23,110
He's completely crushed even though he's
kind of useless,

2314
01:59:23,111 --> 01:59:24,730
bumbling,
laughing,

2315
01:59:24,731 --> 01:59:26,710
full of a guy,
you know?

2316
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:30,430
The thing that gives that show its soul
is that he still oriented towards his

2317
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:31,990
family.
That's what makes them honorable,

2318
01:59:31,991 --> 01:59:36,730
is that foolish as he is.
He's decided to adopt responsibility for

2319
01:59:36,731 --> 01:59:39,760
his family and to try to bear that.
And so he's not.

2320
01:59:39,761 --> 01:59:41,770
He's a holy fool.
He's not a complete fool.

2321
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:45,700
And so interesting watching the story
because he suffers dreadfully as a

2322
01:59:45,701 --> 01:59:48,700
consequence of not being able to fulfill
this responsibility.

2323
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:49,990
Well,
that's for men.

2324
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:52,840
Women have their sets of
responsibilities.

2325
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,240
They're not the same,
right,

2326
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:58,690
because they're complicated because
women of course have to take primary

2327
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:01,810
responsibility for,
for having infants at least,

2328
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:03,850
but then also for caring for them,
they're.

2329
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,290
They're structured differently than men
for biological necessity,

2330
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:11,620
even if it's not a psychological issue
and it's also partly a psychological

2331
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:13,960
issue.
Women know what they have to do.

2332
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:18,910
Men have to figure out what they have to
do and if they have nothing worth living

2333
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:22,690
for them,
they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not

2334
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:28,660
because the alternative to valued
responsibility is

2335
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:33,130
impulsive,
low class pleasure,

2336
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,560
and you saw that in the Pinocchio Story,
right?

2337
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:37,240
That's pleasure island.
It's like,

2338
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:39,490
well,
why lift the load if there's nothing in

2339
02:00:39,491 --> 02:00:42,130
it for you?
That's another thing that we're doing to

2340
02:00:42,131 --> 02:00:44,530
men.
That's a very bad idea and two boys,

2341
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:47,740
so like your pathological and
oppressive.

2342
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:48,521
It's like,
fine.

2343
02:00:48,521 --> 02:00:50,630
Then why the hell am I going to play if
that's the.

2344
02:00:50,631 --> 02:00:53,440
If that's the situation.
If I get no credit for bearing

2345
02:00:53,441 --> 02:00:55,960
responsibility,
you can bloody well be sure I'm not

2346
02:00:55,961 --> 02:00:58,690
going to bear it,
but then you know your life is useless

2347
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:01,810
and meaningless and you have your full
of self contempt,

2348
02:01:01,811 --> 02:01:04,360
denialism and,
and that's not good.

2349
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:08,740
And so that's why I think that's what I
think is going on at a deeper level with

2350
02:01:08,741 --> 02:01:13,030
regards to men needing this direction.
A man has to decide that he's going to

2351
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:15,280
do something.
He has to decide that,

2352
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:16,421
yeah,
well,

2353
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:19,420
you know partly what you're trying to do
in the future authoring process to say,

2354
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:20,770
okay,
well what's your highest value?

2355
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:22,660
Right?
It's the star.

2356
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:23,650
It's like,
okay,

2357
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:26,470
what are you aiming for?
You can decide man,

2358
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:29,590
but you know there is some criteria.
It should be good for you.

2359
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:33,760
It should be good for you in a way that
facilitates your moving forward.

2360
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:36,730
Maybe it should be good for you in a way
that's also good for the family and the

2361
02:01:36,731 --> 02:01:38,940
community.
It should cover the,

2362
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:44,060
the domain of life mean there's
constraints on what you should regard as

2363
02:01:44,061 --> 02:01:45,570
a value,
but you.

2364
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:49,250
But within those constraints,
you have the choice.

2365
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:51,890
You have choice.
Well,

2366
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:55,420
the thing is is that people will carry a
heavy load if they get to pick the god

2367
02:01:55,421 --> 02:01:58,580
damn load so and they think,
well,

2368
02:01:58,581 --> 02:01:59,870
I won't carry any load.
It's like,

2369
02:01:59,871 --> 02:02:00,561
okay,
fine,

2370
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:02,780
but then you're like the sled dog that
doesn't have a sled.

2371
02:02:02,781 --> 02:02:03,710
Depaul,
you're just gonna.

2372
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:07,640
You're in a terror pieces out of your
own legs because you're bored,

2373
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,490
you know you need.
People are pack animals.

2374
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:13,760
They need,
they need to pull against a weight and

2375
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:16,040
that's not true for everyone.
It's not true.

2376
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:18,170
Particularly say for low conscientious
people.

2377
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:21,260
I mean maybe they're open and creative
are extroverted and some other things,

2378
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:24,020
but for the,
for the typical person,

2379
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:25,913
they,
they,

2380
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,820
they'll eat themselves,
they'll eat themselves up unless they

2381
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:30,590
have a load.
This is why there's such an opiod

2382
02:02:30,591 --> 02:02:34,910
epidemic among a dispossessed white,
middle aged guys who are unemployed in

2383
02:02:34,911 --> 02:02:35,744
the US.

2384
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:39,050
So like they lose their job,
they're done right?

2385
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:42,920
They despise themselves,
they develop chronic pain syndromes and

2386
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:45,770
depression and the chronic pain is
treated with opiates.

2387
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:49,550
That's what we're doing.
So yeah,

2388
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:52,430
that's what it looks like to me is you
have to.

2389
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:55,280
And it's so interesting to watch the
young men when you talk to them about

2390
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:57,410
responsibility.
There is a God damn thrilled about it.

2391
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:59,170
It just blows me away.
It's like,

2392
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:01,070
really?
That's what's.

2393
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:06,170
That's the counterculture.
Grow the hell up and do something

2394
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:07,070
useful.
Really.

2395
02:03:07,071 --> 02:03:07,910
I could do that.
Oh,

2396
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:11,570
I'm so excited by that idea.
No one ever mentioned that before.

2397
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,800
It's like rights,
rights,

2398
02:03:12,801 --> 02:03:13,700
rights,
rights,

2399
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:14,800
Jesus.
It's,

2400
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:16,760
it's,
it's appalling.

2401
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,940
It's an end.
And I feel that that's deeply felt by

2402
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:23,870
the people who are,
who are coming out to to listen to these

2403
02:03:23,871 --> 02:03:24,920
sorts of things,
to there.

2404
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:29,690
They've had enough of that so.
And they better have because it's a non

2405
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:32,270
productive motive being responsibility,
man.

2406
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:35,090
That's where the meaning in life is.
So

2407
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:48,790
the most fundamental element,
creativity is actually conceptualized as

2408
02:03:49,241 --> 02:03:54,241
a biological trait.
Different personalities.

2409
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:59,090
We all know our terminology for
describing those personalities is broad

2410
02:03:59,091 --> 02:04:02,360
and somewhat difficult to categorize,
but psychologists progress

2411
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:07,780
in the last 40 years pretty from the
strictest scientific perspective.

2412
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:10,580
And they know that people differ in
extroversion,

2413
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:12,970
extroverted,
gregarious,

2414
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:17,820
and enthusiastic and assert.
And so they seem to wind their way

2415
02:04:17,821 --> 02:04:21,730
through the world by utilizing social
capital and social networks.

2416
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:26,330
Extroverts don't necessarily like you
and creative people.

2417
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:31,380
Extroverts,
well create creative people is slightly

2418
02:04:31,381 --> 02:04:34,190
tilted towards extroversion,
but that's not the fundamental dimension

2419
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:36,540
of introverted.
People like to spend time alone and

2420
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:37,980
there's plenty creative introverted

2421
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,280
people,
um,

2422
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:43,740
that another personality dimension is
known as neuroticism,

2423
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,870
somewhat unflatteringly,
and it's,

2424
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:50,220
it's an index of sensitivity to negative
emotion so that if people,

2425
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:53,400
if you know people who are volatile,
you know they're touchy and they tend to

2426
02:04:53,401 --> 02:04:58,230
fly off the handle,
or they're a or they're sad or morose or

2427
02:04:58,231 --> 02:05:02,070
anxious,
or tend to avoid stressful situations,

2428
02:05:02,071 --> 02:05:04,080
then they tend to be higher in trait
neuroticism.

2429
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,300
And that's specifically a negative
emotion dimension.

2430
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,880
Extroversion is an index of positive
emotion.

2431
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,430
And so people,
they're separate biological systems,

2432
02:05:11,431 --> 02:05:15,870
positive and negative from them trying
to get back to creativity or the third.

2433
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:19,680
The third category is agreeableness.
Agreeable people are compassionate and

2434
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:21,390
they basically live for,
for close,

2435
02:05:21,391 --> 02:05:22,980
intimate,
personal relationships.

2436
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,410
There's conscientious people who are due
to full.

2437
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:28,950
And then there are open people and the
open people,

2438
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:31,590
it's the dimension is called openness to
experience.

2439
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:35,040
There are people who are fundamentally
interested in ideas,

2440
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:38,360
so if you're talking to an open person,
they will immediately move the

2441
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:41,550
conversation to to the discussion of
ideas.

2442
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:43,170
So most of the people in the audience
tonight,

2443
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:46,710
for those who aren't here for political
curiosity are here because they're open

2444
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:47,820
people,
they want to,

2445
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:51,930
they want to hear an intellectual
discussion and and so open people are

2446
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:54,540
interested in ideas.
That's the intellect component of

2447
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:57,690
openness and then they're also
interested in aesthetics and that would

2448
02:05:57,691 --> 02:06:01,770
be where the artists really intellect
and aesthetics is where the artists come

2449
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:04,460
out and that was the thing that's
important to know about that and it's

2450
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:07,350
why I went through all five traits.
These are fundamentally,

2451
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:10,230
these are attributes and ways of looking
at the world,

2452
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:13,260
ways of behaving that are fundamentally
rooted in biology.

2453
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:14,340
They're very,
very deep.

2454
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:19,350
It's not a surface trait by any stretch
of the imagination and creative people

2455
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:22,180
also tend to be a higher in,
in,

2456
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,280
in trade intelligence,
technically speaking,

2457
02:06:25,281 --> 02:06:28,680
and that's the ability to manipulate
abstractions rapidly.

2458
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:30,840
So is creativity is sort of second
level.

2459
02:06:30,841 --> 02:06:31,620
Then comes the,
the,

2460
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,191
the,
uh,

2461
02:06:32,191 --> 02:06:34,800
the traits that you've just described,
don't include them.

2462
02:06:34,801 --> 02:06:37,380
Where are they in that group?
While creativity,

2463
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:39,690
creativity loads very highly with
openness.

2464
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:42,510
It,
it's getting idiot create creativity and

2465
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:45,630
openness are probably synonymous more or
less,

2466
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:50,631
although it isn't obvious that interest
in ideas per se is the same as

2467
02:06:51,451 --> 02:06:53,700
creativity,
but there's very few people who are

2468
02:06:53,701 --> 02:06:55,550
artistic who aren't very interested in
ideas.

2469
02:06:55,551 --> 02:06:57,570
So they,
they move along the same path very

2470
02:06:57,571 --> 02:07:00,760
tightly.
So let's unpack this notion because you

2471
02:07:00,761 --> 02:07:03,840
know,
it's axiomatic that creativity and art

2472
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:07,950
are a indistinguishable.
Is that true from the point of view of a

2473
02:07:07,951 --> 02:07:09,800
psychologist?
I would say it's,

2474
02:07:09,801 --> 02:07:10,500
it's,
it's,

2475
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,930
it's a pretty decent,
it's a pretty decent truth.

2476
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:15,270
It's open.
People are the ones that are interested

2477
02:07:15,271 --> 02:07:17,190
in aesthetics.
So you know,

2478
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:20,220
there are lots of people who are in some
sense blind too,

2479
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:22,860
but it's actually one of the things that
distinguishes,

2480
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:25,110
strangely enough,
it distinguishes conservatives and

2481
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:30,090
liberals roughly speaking because
liberal liberal people tend to be high

2482
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:30,924
in openness.

2483
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,760
They tend to be creative,
but they're low in trait

2484
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:34,590
conscientiousness.
So they're not very beautiful.

2485
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:37,690
They're not orderly,
they're not particularly industrious,

2486
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:39,280
not,
not compared to conservatives,

2487
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,590
liberals,
yes and well,

2488
02:07:41,591 --> 02:07:44,440
it's partly because you see this is one
of the paradoxes.

2489
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:47,410
Conservatives are high in
conscientiousness,

2490
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,570
especially orderliness and they're low
in openness.

2491
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:53,560
And I think the reason for that in part
is that it's not that easy to be

2492
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:55,810
creative if you're too industrious or
orderly.

2493
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,570
Because imagine,
imagine you want to be a musician and

2494
02:07:58,571 --> 02:08:00,460
you're 18,
19 years old or worse,

2495
02:08:00,461 --> 02:08:01,780
25 years old,
you know?

2496
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:06,520
Well,
the thing is is that it's an insane

2497
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:10,270
thing to do if you,
if you're someone who's dutiful and

2498
02:08:10,271 --> 02:08:13,420
career oriented and practical because
the probability that you're going to

2499
02:08:13,421 --> 02:08:17,860
monetize your creativity is so low that
it's futile to even attempt it in many

2500
02:08:17,861 --> 02:08:20,830
situations.
And so if you're too concerned with

2501
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,650
convention and,
and productivity,

2502
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,800
then that's going to undercut your
ability to,

2503
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,650
to,
to manifest adherence to your creative

2504
02:08:29,651 --> 02:08:31,480
vision,
which also takes you and all sorts of

2505
02:08:31,481 --> 02:08:34,060
directions,
none of which are necessarily practical.

2506
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:37,830
So one of the ways of thinking about
creativity is that it's,

2507
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:42,340
it's a gambling strategy and,
and conservatives make low risk,

2508
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:45,340
low return,
but certain bets really.

2509
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:48,130
And whereas the more liberal types and
the more creative types,

2510
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:50,470
they make high risk,
high return bits.

2511
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:53,950
And so almost all of them fail,
but those who succeed succeed

2512
02:08:53,951 --> 02:08:56,530
dramatically.
And they also changed the world.

2513
02:08:56,950 --> 02:09:00,100
And so although it's very foolish to be
creative,

2514
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,940
it's creative people who,
who lead the vanguard for forward into

2515
02:09:03,941 --> 02:09:06,940
the unknown and transform the world.
So foolish as it is,

2516
02:09:06,941 --> 02:09:09,550
it's absolutely necessary.
Foolish because risky.

2517
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,690
Yes,
because risky.

2518
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:13,060
Yes,
I mean it's risk.

2519
02:09:13,061 --> 02:09:15,070
It's foolish in the same way that a high
risk,

2520
02:09:15,071 --> 02:09:18,130
high return bet is foolish.
There's a high probability that you'll

2521
02:09:18,131 --> 02:09:20,590
lose.
And so if you're a conservative person,

2522
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:22,390
you're very concerned about hedging your
bets.

2523
02:09:22,391 --> 02:09:25,330
You don't want to lose being creative as
a very bad game to play,

2524
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:27,810
but you won't play it anyways because
you're conservative so it isn't going to

2525
02:09:27,811 --> 02:09:28,644
matter.

2526
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:32,050
So you are a,
an open,

2527
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:37,060
a late teen and you have conservative
parents and you say,

2528
02:09:37,061 --> 02:09:38,020
mom,
Dad,

2529
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:39,910
I'm,
I think I've decided that I'm going to

2530
02:09:39,911 --> 02:09:43,260
be an artist and they think what's wrong
with that kid that the death.

2531
02:09:43,261 --> 02:09:45,070
A complicated conversation,
isn't it?

2532
02:09:45,071 --> 02:09:45,821
Yes,
yes,

2533
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:46,360
it's,
it's,

2534
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,490
it's,
it's like discussing color with someone

2535
02:09:48,491 --> 02:09:52,030
who's colorblind and,
and I mean that like it's actually a

2536
02:09:52,031 --> 02:09:55,030
perverse things about perverse thing
about conservatives in some sense

2537
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:58,870
because the data on the economic utility
of artists is really,

2538
02:09:58,871 --> 02:10:00,520
really strong.
I mean artists,

2539
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:03,640
artists and entrepreneurs are the same
people and of course entrepreneurs are

2540
02:10:03,641 --> 02:10:07,780
the people who provide all of the vision
for the entire capitalist system.

2541
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:11,170
They're absolutely necessary,
but conservatives tend to be so blind to

2542
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:14,860
art that they can't even see that the
artists are the people who drive the who

2543
02:10:14,861 --> 02:10:16,210
drive the economy forward.

2544
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:18,270
But you make them sound so bad.
No,

2545
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,590
there you lord.
So here's,

2546
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:23,710
here's another way of thinking about it
as we're talking about political,

2547
02:10:23,711 --> 02:10:25,740
conservative political liberals,
yes,

2548
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:28,630
they're also talking about trait,
like personality traits,

2549
02:10:28,631 --> 02:10:30,550
determined voting patterns to a great
degree.

2550
02:10:30,551 --> 02:10:33,890
So people vote their temperaments and
this is something that's useful to

2551
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:37,700
understand when you're engaged in a
political discussion is that the person

2552
02:10:37,701 --> 02:10:41,480
across the table from you who holds
viewpoints other than yours is not doing

2553
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:43,280
it because they're stupid or ill
informed.

2554
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:46,280
They're doing it because they are not
the same sort of person you are.

2555
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:50,750
And the the funny thing about about
creative people versus conservative

2556
02:10:50,751 --> 02:10:54,530
people say are liberal people versus
conservative people is that liberal

2557
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:56,330
start companies and conservatives run
them.

2558
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:02,350
So and I'm really glad to know you need
to conserve their managers like

2559
02:11:03,291 --> 02:11:06,140
conscientious people make good managers
and good administrators.

2560
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:10,130
It's and they tend to do better in
school too because diligence and due to

2561
02:11:10,131 --> 02:11:12,830
fullness is an excellent predictor of
academic performance.

2562
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:16,070
So if you want something,
if you want something that's already

2563
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:18,470
been invented,
implemented,

2564
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:22,580
and then turned into a machine,
you don't get someone creative to do

2565
02:11:22,581 --> 02:11:24,080
that.
They're off to do the next thing.

2566
02:11:24,081 --> 02:11:26,480
They're not even interested in that
you'll bore them to death.

2567
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:28,690
So,
uh,

2568
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:32,750
so let's say you're an employer and you
need some creative people.

2569
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:37,310
They're a psychometric test to find out
if someone's actually creative and

2570
02:11:37,311 --> 02:11:38,180
they're going to be useful.
Well,

2571
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:39,710
Iq tests work.
I mean,

2572
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:41,840
not,
not everyone with a high Iq is creative.

2573
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:45,050
Lots of lawyers have high Iq and they
tend not to be creative at all.

2574
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:47,860
Well,
you think to think about why that is a.

2575
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:50,090
because lawyers are bound by precedent
and,

2576
02:11:50,091 --> 02:11:53,030
and rules and so that isn't the same as
being creative.

2577
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:55,250
And you don't,
you want a creative accountant?

2578
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,810
No,
not really.

2579
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:59,780
Not,
not unless you're looking for a jail

2580
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:03,590
sentence.
So they don't like that word at all.

2581
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,260
No,
no.

2582
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:04,850
Absolutely.
Yeah,

2583
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:07,240
that's right.
My creative accountant wake.

2584
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:08,640
Wake right.
It's so,

2585
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,820
so,
so.

2586
02:12:10,950 --> 02:12:11,960
I mean,
I tested,

2587
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:16,270
I tested psychometrically tested 100
most creative lawyers in Canada as,

2588
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:19,820
as a project about 15 years ago with a
magazine called expert,

2589
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:22,280
which was a high prestige magazine among
lawyers.

2590
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:26,930
We had lawyers from across the country
be nominated for their by their firms,

2591
02:12:26,931 --> 02:12:30,290
for creativity and and so we got some
really like these were outstanding

2592
02:12:30,291 --> 02:12:33,020
lawyers,
so and we tested them psychometrically

2593
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:34,970
very,
very high and intelligence,

2594
02:12:34,971 --> 02:12:38,330
but I'm not creative at all.
The first,

2595
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:40,880
the first trait was conscientious due to
full,

2596
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:43,160
hardworking,
diligent,

2597
02:12:43,161 --> 02:12:44,330
industrious,
orderly,

2598
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:46,520
because you know,
you're working 70 hours a week and you

2599
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:48,860
better bloody well work if you're in a
position like that too.

2600
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:52,850
So it's nose to the grindstone stuff
very low in neuroticism because it's

2601
02:12:52,851 --> 02:12:55,300
very stressful.
So they didn't experience a bunch of

2602
02:12:55,310 --> 02:12:59,000
negative emotion,
very disagreeable people while their

2603
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:00,540
letter get litigated.
And so they would,

2604
02:13:00,541 --> 02:13:02,420
they want to win.
They're not compassionate and they're

2605
02:13:02,421 --> 02:13:05,020
not polite and only after that where
they opened.

2606
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:08,300
So they weren't creative at all,
but they were extraordinarily

2607
02:13:08,301 --> 02:13:11,750
intelligent.
So do employers look for creative

2608
02:13:11,751 --> 02:13:12,830
people?
No.

2609
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:15,410
No,
not generally.

2610
02:13:15,411 --> 02:13:16,041
Well,
it's a real.

2611
02:13:16,041 --> 02:13:18,470
It's a real conundrum.
So one of the things that's happening

2612
02:13:18,471 --> 02:13:23,471
right now is that in most businesses,
the noncreative people are increasingly

2613
02:13:24,921 --> 02:13:26,660
being replaced by machines,
right?

2614
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:30,730
Because anything that's creative can
really be turned into an algorithm and

2615
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:34,260
that you can run as a machine,
but anything that isn't creative can be

2616
02:13:34,261 --> 02:13:38,760
and so there's increasing demand
incorporations for creative people,

2617
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:42,060
but the problem with being creative is
that you're useless at the bottom of the

2618
02:13:42,061 --> 02:13:45,270
dominance hierarchy because at the
bottom of the dominance hierarchy,

2619
02:13:45,271 --> 02:13:48,300
so a power hierarchy,
you should do what you're told to do.

2620
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:50,220
You're not there to think outside the
box.

2621
02:13:50,221 --> 02:13:52,500
You're there to learn what you're
supposed to do and implement it and

2622
02:13:52,501 --> 02:13:54,540
creative people are like,
that's.

2623
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:59,400
That is what they do.
Now what happens though to companies is

2624
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:02,580
that because they filter all the
creative people out at the bottom and

2625
02:14:02,581 --> 02:14:06,300
then people start to rise up to the top.
You really need creative people at the

2626
02:14:06,301 --> 02:14:09,060
top because they are the entrepreneurial
types and they're the ones.

2627
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:10,350
For example,
in law firms,

2628
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,090
even though lawyers aren't very
creative,

2629
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:14,820
the more entrepreneurial ones are the
ones that bring in all the business.

2630
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:18,780
There's like great lawyers who can,
who can implement,

2631
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:20,250
who can,
who can,

2632
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:23,430
who can write well and communicate well.
Are there not a diamond dozen,

2633
02:14:23,431 --> 02:14:26,160
but they're relatively common,
but the ones who are entrepreneurial who

2634
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:28,080
can go out there and drum up new
business?

2635
02:14:28,081 --> 02:14:30,210
Man,
those people are super hyper valuable

2636
02:14:30,211 --> 02:14:31,770
and they're very rare,
but they are,

2637
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:35,820
but it's also very difficult to nurse
them within any system because systems

2638
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:39,870
do not nurture creativity.
There are the antithesis of creativity

2639
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:44,340
because the artist is always the person
who stands outside the structure and so

2640
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,920
or maybe builds his or her own
structure,

2641
02:14:47,290 --> 02:14:49,800
which is also why it's hard to evaluate
creative people.

2642
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:54,830
You can't really because if they're
operating within the confines of a

2643
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:59,220
system that has an evaluative structure,
they're not creative.

2644
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:05,820
We're having a conversation.
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.

2645
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:09,390
Right?
That's different than how people

2646
02:15:09,391 --> 02:15:12,240
generally communicate because usually
when they communicate,

2647
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:14,400
they're doing something like,
okay,

2648
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:18,540
we're going to have a conversation and
I'm going to tell you why I'm right and

2649
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:21,990
all win.
If you agree or maybe you're having a

2650
02:15:21,991 --> 02:15:24,510
conversation where I don't know what
you're trying to do,

2651
02:15:24,511 --> 02:15:27,120
maybe you're trying to impress the
person you're talking to so you're not

2652
02:15:27,121 --> 02:15:28,890
listening to them at all.
You're just thinking about what you're

2653
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:29,820
gonna.
Say Next.

2654
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:31,860
Okay,
so that's not this.

2655
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:36,240
This is.
You might have something to tell me and

2656
02:15:36,241 --> 02:15:40,380
so I'm going to listen on the off chance
that you'll tell me something that would

2657
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:43,890
really be useful for me to know and so
you can take about it as an,

2658
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:49,250
as an extension of the Piagetian.
Piaget talked about the fundamental,

2659
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:54,150
the fundamentally important element of
knowledge being to describe how

2660
02:15:54,151 --> 02:15:56,610
knowledge is sought,
the process by which knowledge is

2661
02:15:56,611 --> 02:15:57,420
generated.

2662
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,990
Well,
if you agree with me and I find that

2663
02:16:00,991 --> 02:16:02,880
out,
I know nothing more than I knew before.

2664
02:16:02,910 --> 02:16:07,320
I just know what I knew before and maybe
unhappy about that because it didn't get

2665
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:09,900
challenged,
but I'm no smarter than I was before,

2666
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:13,350
but maybe you're different than me and
so while I'm listening to you'll tell me

2667
02:16:13,351 --> 02:16:14,880
something I wouldn't.
I don't like.

2668
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:18,060
Maybe it's something I find contemptible
or difficult,

2669
02:16:18,061 --> 02:16:20,070
whatever.
Maybe you'll find you'll tell me

2670
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:24,060
something I don't know and then I won't
be quite as stupid and then maybe I

2671
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:28,950
won't run painfully into quite as many
things and that's a really useful thing.

2672
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,820
Know,
especially if you live with someone and

2673
02:16:30,821 --> 02:16:34,630
you're trying to make longterm piece
with them as they are not the same as

2674
02:16:34,631 --> 02:16:37,660
you and they're away.
They look at the world and the facts

2675
02:16:37,661 --> 02:16:41,950
that they pull out of the world aren't
the same as your facts and even though

2676
02:16:41,951 --> 02:16:45,790
you're going to be overwhelmed with the
proclivity to demonstrate that you're

2677
02:16:45,791 --> 02:16:48,460
right,
it is the case that two brains are

2678
02:16:48,461 --> 02:16:53,461
better than one and so maybe nine of the
10 things they tell you are dispensable

2679
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:59,790
or maybe even 49 out of 50,
but one thing all you need to get out of

2680
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:02,140
the damn conversation is one thing you
don't know.

2681
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:07,180
And one of the things that's very cool
about a good psychotherapeutic session

2682
02:17:07,181 --> 02:17:09,310
is that the whole conversation is like
that.

2683
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:15,090
All you're doing is trying to express
the truth of the situation as clearly as

2684
02:17:17,321 --> 02:17:18,910
possible.
That's it.

2685
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:24,690
And so now rogers' proposition,
and I'll tell you why he derived it,

2686
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:30,820
was that if you have a conversation like
that with someone,

2687
02:17:31,090 --> 02:17:35,470
it will make both of you better.
It will make both of you psychologically

2688
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:37,990
healthier.
So there's an implicit presupposition

2689
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:42,160
that the exchange of truth is curative.
Well,

2690
02:17:42,161 --> 02:17:44,170
that's a very cool idea.
I mean,

2691
02:17:44,171 --> 02:17:45,740
it's a very deep idea.
Uh,

2692
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:49,160
I think it's the most profound idea.
It's the,

2693
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:53,080
it's the idea upon western civil upon
which Western civilization,

2694
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:57,490
although not only Western civilization,
is actually predicated the idea that

2695
02:17:57,491 --> 02:18:00,130
truth produces health.
But for Rogers,

2696
02:18:00,131 --> 02:18:02,740
that was the entire purpose of the
psycho therapeutic alliance.

2697
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:05,620
You come to see me because you want to
be better.

2698
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:09,160
You don't even know what that means
necessarily.

2699
02:18:09,161 --> 02:18:11,620
Neither do I.
we're going to figure that out together.

2700
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:13,330
But you come and you say,
look,

2701
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:17,620
things are not acceptable to me and
maybe there's something I could do about

2702
02:18:17,621 --> 02:18:19,750
that.
So that's the minimal precondition to

2703
02:18:19,751 --> 02:18:22,120
engage in therapy.
Something's wrong.

2704
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,280
You're willing to talk about it
truthfully,

2705
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,440
and you want it to be better.
Without that,

2706
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:29,830
the therapeutic relationship does not
get off the ground.

2707
02:18:30,130 --> 02:18:31,450
And so then you might ask,
well,

2708
02:18:31,451 --> 02:18:35,560
what relationships are therapeutic?
And the answer that would be if you have

2709
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:37,660
a real relationship,
it's therapeutic.

2710
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:40,570
If it isn't,
what you have is not a relationship.

2711
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:43,000
God only knows what you have.
You're a slave,

2712
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:44,580
they're a tyrant,
you know,

2713
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,630
you're both butting heads with one
another.

2714
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:49,060
It's a primate dominance hierarchy
dispute.

2715
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:50,200
Oh,
I don't know.

2716
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:53,440
You're like two cats in a barrel or two
people with their hands around each

2717
02:18:53,441 --> 02:18:56,410
other's throats.
But what you have is not a relationship.

2718
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,610
So alright,
we may say that the greater the

2719
02:19:00,611 --> 02:19:04,090
communicated congruence of experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of

2720
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:05,770
one individual,
that's,

2721
02:19:05,810 --> 02:19:09,520
that's a reference to the same idea that
I was describing with regards to yoke.

2722
02:19:09,521 --> 02:19:13,660
So let's say you come and talk to me and
you want things to go,

2723
02:19:13,661 --> 02:19:15,310
well,
well I'm going to have to more or less

2724
02:19:15,311 --> 02:19:18,340
be one thing.
Because if I'm all over the place,

2725
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:22,000
you can't trust any continuity in what I
say.

2726
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:25,060
There's no.
And there's no reason for you to believe

2727
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:29,570
that I'm capable of actually telling you
I'm capable of expressing anything

2728
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:33,020
that's true.
So the truth is something that emerges

2729
02:19:33,021 --> 02:19:36,650
as a consequences of getting yourself
lined up and beating all the,

2730
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:42,890
what would you call
all the impurities out of your,

2731
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:47,420
out of your,
out of your soul for black of a better

2732
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:48,254
word.

2733
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:51,500
You have to be integrated for that to
happen and you do that at least in part

2734
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:55,670
by wanting to tell the truth.
The more the ensuing relationship will

2735
02:19:55,671 --> 02:19:59,150
involve a tendency towards reciprocal
communication with the same qualities.

2736
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:03,500
So one of the things that I've been
quite influenced by Rogers,

2737
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:06,710
one of the things I tried to do in my
therapeutic sessions is first of all to

2738
02:20:06,711 --> 02:20:09,780
listen to really listen and then,
well,

2739
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:13,370
well I listen,
I watch and while I'm listening things

2740
02:20:13,371 --> 02:20:15,410
will happen in my head,
you know,

2741
02:20:15,411 --> 02:20:18,860
maybe I'll get a little image of
something or I'll get a thought or a

2742
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:21,800
question will emerge and then I'll just
tell the person what that is.

2743
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,570
But it's sort of directionless,
you know?

2744
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:27,110
It's not like I have a goal except that
we're trying to make things better.

2745
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:30,590
I'm on the side of the person.
I'm on the side of the part of the

2746
02:20:30,591 --> 02:20:33,440
person that wants things to be better,
not worse,

2747
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:38,090
and so then those parts of us have a
dialogue and the consequences of that

2748
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:41,330
dialogue is that certain things take
place and then I'll just tell the person

2749
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:43,880
what happened and it isn't that I'm
right.

2750
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:45,950
That's not the point.
The point is,

2751
02:20:45,951 --> 02:20:49,820
is that they get to have an hour where
someone actually tells them what they

2752
02:20:49,821 --> 02:20:52,310
think.
Here's the impact you're having on me.

2753
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:54,800
You know,
this is making me angry.

2754
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:57,800
This is making me happy.
This is really interesting.

2755
02:20:57,830 --> 02:21:00,860
This reminds me of something that you
said an hour ago that I don't quite

2756
02:21:00,861 --> 02:21:02,660
understand,
and the whole,

2757
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:08,440
the whole point is not for either person
to make the proposition or convince the

2758
02:21:08,961 --> 02:21:13,850
other that their position is correct,
but merely to have an exchange of

2759
02:21:13,851 --> 02:21:18,851
experience about how things are set up
and it's extraordinarily useful for

2760
02:21:19,041 --> 02:21:22,910
people because it's often difficult for
anyone to find anyone to talk to that

2761
02:21:22,911 --> 02:21:26,090
will actually listen.
And so another thing that's really

2762
02:21:26,091 --> 02:21:28,520
strange about this listening is that if
you listen to people,

2763
02:21:28,521 --> 02:21:31,520
they will tell you the weirdest bloody
things so fast,

2764
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:32,870
you just cannot believe it.

2765
02:21:33,170 --> 02:21:36,020
So if you're having a conversation with
someone and it's dull,

2766
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:40,280
it's because you're stupid.
That's why you're not listening to them

2767
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:44,690
properly because they're weird.
They're like wombats or albatrosses or

2768
02:21:44,691 --> 02:21:47,720
rhinoceroses or something like they're
strange creatures.

2769
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:50,630
And so if you were actually
communicating with them and they were

2770
02:21:50,631 --> 02:21:53,270
telling you how weird they really are,
it would be.

2771
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:56,540
It would be anything but boring.
So.

2772
02:21:56,770 --> 02:21:59,480
And you can ask questions.
That's a really good way of listening.

2773
02:21:59,481 --> 02:22:02,540
But you know one of Roger's points as
well.

2774
02:22:02,541 --> 02:22:04,820
You have to be oriented properly in
order to listen.

2775
02:22:04,970 --> 02:22:08,000
And the orientation has to be.
Look what I want out of this

2776
02:22:08,001 --> 02:22:11,600
conversation is that the place we both
end up is better than the place we left.

2777
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:13,820
That's it.
That's what I'm after.

2778
02:22:14,060 --> 02:22:15,920
And if you're not after that,
you've got to think,

2779
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:18,200
why the hell wouldn't you be after that?

2780
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:21,290
What could you possibly be after that
would be better than that?

2781
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:26,490
You walk away smarter and more well
equipped for the world than you were

2782
02:22:26,491 --> 02:22:29,550
before you had the conversation,
and so does the other person.

2783
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:32,190
Well,
maybe if you're bitter and resentful and

2784
02:22:32,191 --> 02:22:36,270
angry and anxious and you know,
generally annoyed at the world,

2785
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:39,570
then that isn't what you want.
You want the other person to walk away

2786
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:41,790
worse than Youtube because you're full
of revenge,

2787
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:45,480
but you know you'll get what you want if
you do that,

2788
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:50,880
so we know from our research that such
empathic understanding,

2789
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,250
so already defined that I want to hear
you.

2790
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,850
I want to hear what you have to say so
we can clarify it and move forward.

2791
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:00,090
I want to have your best interests in
mind and mine as well,

2792
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:03,480
but you know both at the same time and
your families too.

2793
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:06,420
If we could manage that,
we're after making things better.

2794
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:09,960
We know from our research that such
empathic understanding,

2795
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:12,150
understanding with a person,
not about him.

2796
02:23:12,151 --> 02:23:15,060
It's such an effective approach that it
can bring about major changes in

2797
02:23:15,061 --> 02:23:18,030
personality.
Some of you may be feeling that you

2798
02:23:18,031 --> 02:23:20,790
listen well to people and that you have
never seen such results.

2799
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:24,690
The chances are very great that you have
not been listening in the manner that

2800
02:23:24,691 --> 02:23:26,340
I've described.
Fortunately,

2801
02:23:26,341 --> 02:23:30,300
I can suggest a little experiment that
you can do to test the quality of your

2802
02:23:30,301 --> 02:23:32,970
understanding.
The next time you get into an argument

2803
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:35,580
with your wife or your friend or a small
group of friends,

2804
02:23:35,581 --> 02:23:39,630
stop the discussion for a moment and for
an experiment institute this rule.

2805
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:45,530
Each person can speak up for himself
only after he has first restated the

2806
02:23:45,541 --> 02:23:48,960
ideas and feelings of the previous
speaker accurately.

2807
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:52,830
What accurately means is they have to
agree with your restatement.

2808
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,590
Now,
that's an annoying thing to do because

2809
02:23:55,591 --> 02:23:58,050
if someone is talking to you and you
disagree with them,

2810
02:23:58,051 --> 02:23:59,820
the first thing you want to do is take
their argument,

2811
02:23:59,821 --> 02:24:02,730
make the stupidest possible thing out of
it that you can.

2812
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:05,220
That's the straw man,
and then demolish it.

2813
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:08,910
It's like so then you can walk away
feeling good about it,

2814
02:24:08,911 --> 02:24:12,930
and primate diamonds dominated them
really nicely.

2815
02:24:12,931 --> 02:24:14,850
So,
but that isn't what you do.

2816
02:24:14,851 --> 02:24:15,481
You say,
okay,

2817
02:24:15,481 --> 02:24:18,330
well I'm going to take what you told me
and maybe I'm even going to make your

2818
02:24:18,331 --> 02:24:21,750
argument stronger than the one you made.
That's useful if you're dealing with

2819
02:24:21,751 --> 02:24:24,540
someone that you have to live with
because maybe they can't bloody well

2820
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:28,110
express themselves very well,
but they have something to say so you

2821
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:30,550
make their argument strong.
Alright,

2822
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:35,280
then you see what this would mean.
It would mean that before presenting

2823
02:24:35,281 --> 02:24:37,680
your own point of view,
it'd be necessary for you to really

2824
02:24:37,681 --> 02:24:41,550
achieve the other speakers frame of
reference to understand his thoughts and

2825
02:24:41,551 --> 02:24:44,250
feelings so well that you could
summarize them for him.

2826
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:46,140
Sounds simple,
doesn't it?

2827
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:50,310
But if you'll try it,
you'll find that it's the most difficult

2828
02:24:50,311 --> 02:24:52,650
thing that you've ever done.
Okay,

2829
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:54,240
good.
We'll leave it at that and then we'll

2830
02:24:54,241 --> 02:24:55,170
see you on Tuesday.

2831
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:02,960
What's my advice to young men seeking a
woman for marriage and family?

2832
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:05,630
Yeah.
Well,

2833
02:25:05,631 --> 02:25:06,464
okay,
fine.

2834
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,660
That's the same quest.
Second question.

2835
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:10,520
That's,
that's pretty straightforward man.

2836
02:25:10,521 --> 02:25:14,270
I mean,
you can't eliminate the necessity of

2837
02:25:14,271 --> 02:25:16,310
being attracted to one another.
That's important.

2838
02:25:16,311 --> 02:25:18,290
And that's mysterious,
you know?

2839
02:25:18,291 --> 02:25:19,610
Um,
so for example,

2840
02:25:19,611 --> 02:25:21,920
here's a funny thing,
if you,

2841
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:25,420
one of the things know that attracts
people to one another is bilateral

2842
02:25:25,421 --> 02:25:29,680
symmetry.
And so if you take men and you ranked

2843
02:25:29,681 --> 02:25:34,681
them by the cemetery of their faces and
then you give the asymmetrical men tee

2844
02:25:36,521 --> 02:25:41,080
shirts to wear clean t shirts for a day
and the symmetrical men clean t shirts

2845
02:25:41,081 --> 02:25:44,560
to wear for a day and then you give the
t shirts to women and you have them rate

2846
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:46,060
the,
the older,

2847
02:25:46,690 --> 02:25:51,220
the women rate the odor of the
symmetrical men as more attractive than

2848
02:25:51,221 --> 02:25:52,930
the odor of the asymmetrical man.

2849
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,060
And then,
and there were other,

2850
02:25:55,310 --> 02:25:57,790
uh,
factors that determine sexual

2851
02:25:57,791 --> 02:26:01,720
attractiveness that are based on
biological factors that are so deeply

2852
02:26:01,721 --> 02:26:03,700
embedded in terms of smell,
for example.

2853
02:26:03,701 --> 02:26:08,701
So a women also tend to not be sexually
attracted to the,

2854
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:13,360
to the scent of men whose,
who have,

2855
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:17,650
if I remember correctly,
it's rh factors that would make for

2856
02:26:17,651 --> 02:26:22,390
potential trouble in childbirth.
And the often,

2857
02:26:22,391 --> 02:26:26,220
the reason that the women give for not
preferring the scent of those men is

2858
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:28,000
that they smell too much like their
brother.

2859
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:30,670
Something like that.
So there was weird,

2860
02:26:30,671 --> 02:26:33,640
mysterious things that determine whether
or not people are sexually and

2861
02:26:33,641 --> 02:26:36,470
physically attracted to each other.
And I think it's very important that

2862
02:26:36,471 --> 02:26:41,471
that's part of a marital relationship.
The next most important thing is trust.

2863
02:26:41,771 --> 02:26:45,970
Man.
It's like there's no marriage that's

2864
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:49,240
successful without trust you guys.
You got to tell each other the truth.

2865
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:53,300
And one of the reasons that you'll
believe that marriage as a,

2866
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:57,520
an oath and Carl young as a bond was
necessary.

2867
02:26:57,521 --> 02:26:58,960
It's really wise.
It's like,

2868
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:01,510
you know,
telling the truth to someone is no

2869
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:05,350
simple thing because there's a bunch of
things about all of us that are terrible

2870
02:27:05,351 --> 02:27:08,560
and weak and reprehensible and shameful
and all of those things.

2871
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:11,350
And they kind of have to be brought out
into the open and dealt with.

2872
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:16,030
And you're not going to tell the truth
about yourself to someone who can run

2873
02:27:16,031 --> 02:27:18,220
away screaming when you reveal who you
are.

2874
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:21,520
And so the marriage bond is something
like,

2875
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,810
okay,
here's the deal.

2876
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:28,390
I'm going to handcuff myself to you and
you're going to handcuff yourself to me

2877
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,700
and then we're going to tell each other
the truth.

2878
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:32,800
And neither of us are going to get to
run away,

2879
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,290
and so our,
once we know the truth,

2880
02:27:35,291 --> 02:27:38,260
then we're either going to live together
in mutual torment or we're going to try

2881
02:27:38,261 --> 02:27:41,830
to deal with that truth and straighten
ourselves out and straighten ourselves

2882
02:27:41,831 --> 02:27:42,664
out jointly.

2883
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:47,760
And that's going to make us more
powerful and more resilient and more and

2884
02:27:48,311 --> 02:27:51,640
deeper and wiser as we progress together
through life.

2885
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:54,130
And,
and I think that's absolutely brilliant

2886
02:27:54,131 --> 02:27:55,900
because if you leave a backdoor open
man,

2887
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:57,340
you're going to use it,
that's for sure.

2888
02:27:57,580 --> 02:28:00,970
And the oath is there.
And this was [inaudible] commentary on

2889
02:28:00,971 --> 02:28:04,790
the spiritualization of,
of the human parable.

2890
02:28:04,850 --> 02:28:07,030
And by Christian marriage,
for example,

2891
02:28:07,190 --> 02:28:08,770
which emphasized,
uh,

2892
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:10,510
the,
the,

2893
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:14,050
what would you call it,
the subordination of both members of the

2894
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:19,051
marital union to a higher order,
a personality that was embodied in the

2895
02:28:20,711 --> 02:28:21,740
figure,
the logos.

2896
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,350
So the idea is that in,
in,

2897
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:23,890
in,
in,

2898
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:25,460
in the Christian marriage,
for example,

2899
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,850
the man isn't the boss and the woman
isn't the boss,

2900
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
the boss is the mutual personality
composed by the seeking of truth in both

2901
02:28:35,451 --> 02:28:37,870
of them.
And that's conceptualized as their,

2902
02:28:38,090 --> 02:28:41,870
their joint subjugation to the logos and
that is absolutely dead on,

2903
02:28:41,871 --> 02:28:42,410
man.

2904
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:47,410
It's like the ruler of your marital life
should be your vowed to tell each other

2905
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:51,440
the truth because like in hard times
during your life,

2906
02:28:51,441 --> 02:28:53,580
when you've done something stupid and
idiotic,

2907
02:28:53,581 --> 02:28:57,140
that might take you down and you don't
have anybody that you can turn to,

2908
02:28:57,170 --> 02:28:58,910
you know,
if you have a partner that you can

2909
02:28:58,911 --> 02:28:59,990
trust,
you can go say,

2910
02:28:59,991 --> 02:29:00,824
hey,
you know,

2911
02:29:00,830 --> 02:29:04,580
I made a big financial mistake man and
it's really torturing me and I feel like

2912
02:29:04,581 --> 02:29:06,500
a complete idiot and it's really
dangerous.

2913
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:09,530
And the person there,
it's going to help you figure out what

2914
02:29:09,531 --> 02:29:11,780
to do about it.
And they're going to know that when they

2915
02:29:11,781 --> 02:29:14,210
make a stupid mistake and they're bloody
well going to,

2916
02:29:14,211 --> 02:29:17,240
that they can come and talk to you and
that you guys are going to work your way

2917
02:29:17,241 --> 02:29:19,580
through it.
And that's a big deal.

2918
02:29:19,581 --> 02:29:22,430
And there's a couple of things our
culture gets really wrong.

2919
02:29:22,430 --> 02:29:26,630
And one is it devalues marriage.
That's really a very bad idea because

2920
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:30,080
marriages,
marriages like a third of your life.

2921
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:33,710
And maybe more and kids are a third of
your life and your,

2922
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:36,740
your,
your life outside of marriage and kids

2923
02:29:36,741 --> 02:29:38,780
is a third of your life,
you know,

2924
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:43,580
approximately speaking and to miss any
of that is a massive,

2925
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:45,170
massive mistake.
Now,

2926
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:49,850
having said that,
I will also say that for some people

2927
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:54,020
missing one or more of those is
necessary because they have a reason.

2928
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:56,660
You know,
maybe they're brilliantly creative

2929
02:29:56,661 --> 02:29:59,930
artists and they need to devote
themselves entirely to their career or

2930
02:29:59,931 --> 02:30:01,970
they're outstanding in some way and so
they need,

2931
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,750
they can justify the sacrifice of one
part of that triad,

2932
02:30:05,751 --> 02:30:07,850
of being to another part,
but for.

2933
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:10,460
But generally speaking,
it's a very dangerous thing and,

2934
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,510
and it,
it,

2935
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:15,140
it shouldn't be done.
And also kids get an absolutely terrible

2936
02:30:15,141 --> 02:30:16,040
rap,
you know,

2937
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:19,580
because kids are delightful if they're
well behaved.

2938
02:30:19,730 --> 02:30:22,940
One of the chapters in my new book is
called don't let your children do

2939
02:30:22,941 --> 02:30:25,850
anything that makes you dislike them.
And you can do that,

2940
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:29,180
especially if you discuss it thoroughly
with your spouse.

2941
02:30:29,181 --> 02:30:32,630
You're the person that's helping you
discipline the kids and children are the

2942
02:30:32,631 --> 02:30:36,980
best company because they're really
enthusiastic about everything they love

2943
02:30:36,981 --> 02:30:39,080
doing new things.
They really love you,

2944
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:43,460
so they're happy that you're around.
All you have to do is make sure they're

2945
02:30:43,461 --> 02:30:46,700
not too hot and they're not too cold and
they've had something to eat and they're

2946
02:30:46,701 --> 02:30:51,701
not too tired and you don't expect them
to stay engaged in something for longer

2947
02:30:52,521 --> 02:30:55,340
than they can manage because we used to
take our kids when they were little out

2948
02:30:55,341 --> 02:30:58,070
to restaurants for example.
And they could sit there no problem and

2949
02:30:58,071 --> 02:31:00,110
behave really nicely when they were two
and three,

2950
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:02,840
but they couldn't do it for more than
about 45 minutes.

2951
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:06,350
He can't push your luck.
But I also noticed with little kids is

2952
02:31:06,351 --> 02:31:11,180
that they got antsy and unreasonable
about five to 10 minutes before the

2953
02:31:11,181 --> 02:31:13,670
adults did too.
It's just the adults were too stupid to

2954
02:31:13,671 --> 02:31:15,410
notice.
The kids would notice right away.

2955
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:16,663
So,
um,

2956
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:19,260
so back to marriage,
while you look for someone you're

2957
02:31:19,261 --> 02:31:20,700
attracted to,
that you love,

2958
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:23,400
and then you look for someone that you
can bloody well trust.

2959
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:28,110
And then you tell them the truth and
that way maybe you can get through life

2960
02:31:28,111 --> 02:31:33,111
and you can have someone to weave the
rope of your being with and together to

2961
02:31:33,841 --> 02:31:37,500
make to make your joint ropes stronger
and you can have some continuity in your

2962
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:41,190
narrative and you can have children and
then you can have grandchildren and like

2963
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:43,740
you can have a life man and there is
nothing.

2964
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:46,530
You are so fortunate if you can manage
that.

2965
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:48,070
And so.
Okay,

2966
02:31:48,090 --> 02:31:51,660
so there's that one.
So what's my advice to young men seeking

2967
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:53,520
a woman for marriage and family?
Yeah.

2968
02:31:53,521 --> 02:31:55,650
Well,
and also,

2969
02:31:55,651 --> 02:31:57,690
you know,
marry someone you think would be a good

2970
02:31:57,691 --> 02:32:00,420
mother and that has enough sense
generally speaking,

2971
02:32:00,421 --> 02:32:04,680
to know that she wants children.
Now some women don't want children and

2972
02:32:04,681 --> 02:32:07,680
fair enough and some women perhaps
shouldn't have children.

2973
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:12,810
That's also possible.
But the general rule of thumb is,

2974
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:14,440
especially once a woman's,
you know,

2975
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:17,760
in her mid twenties,
if she doesn't know that she wants

2976
02:32:17,761 --> 02:32:19,850
children or wounded,
met it,

2977
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:23,730
unless she has a viciously important
reason,

2978
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:28,200
then she's not oriented properly.
Psychologically she,

2979
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:29,280
she,
she isn't.

2980
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,530
She doesn't know what's important in
life.

2981
02:32:32,130 --> 02:32:33,810
Now,
that might also be the case with you and

2982
02:32:33,811 --> 02:32:35,850
it probably is,
but as a rule of thumb,

2983
02:32:35,860 --> 02:32:36,810
that's a really good one.

2984
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:40,500
How do men and women differ in the way
they evaluate mates?

2985
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:43,970
Well,
here's the study.

2986
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:47,330
More than a thousand respondents,
primarily female.

2987
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:51,800
What they looked at was how much each
person,

2988
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:54,660
how much prestige each person had in
their occupation,

2989
02:32:54,661 --> 02:32:56,990
so kind of where they were situated in
the dominance hierarchy,

2990
02:32:57,380 --> 02:32:59,810
what their income was under education,
so there are all markers.

2991
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:04,310
They're all pretty decent markers of
socio economic status or they're pretty

2992
02:33:04,311 --> 02:33:08,720
decent markers of status,
so and then they looked at how many

2993
02:33:08,721 --> 02:33:12,830
partners each person had number of
lifetime partners and number of

2994
02:33:12,831 --> 02:33:17,810
preceding year sexual partners,
lifetime occurrence of simultaneous

2995
02:33:17,811 --> 02:33:19,550
partner.
So that was someone who was in a

2996
02:33:19,551 --> 02:33:21,590
relationship,
a sexual relationship with more than one

2997
02:33:21,591 --> 02:33:26,591
person at the same time and lifetime
frequency of simultaneous partners from

2998
02:33:26,901 --> 02:33:29,660
one very seldom or never to five.
Very often,

2999
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:33,620
here's their assumption,
the number of partners,

3000
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:38,621
a member of sex.
A acquires is an index of how often this

3001
02:33:39,231 --> 02:33:42,050
individual is chosen.
By the other sex,

3002
02:33:43,010 --> 02:33:46,490
it's just a definition,
it's an indication of reproductive

3003
02:33:46,491 --> 02:33:49,580
fitness as judged by members of the
opposite sex

3004
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:53,150
results,
male criteria

3005
02:33:55,810 --> 02:34:00,120
for women,
the correlation between their fertility

3006
02:34:00,121 --> 02:34:03,270
rates and the number of partners in the
previous year was point nine four,

3007
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:08,930
so that's basically markers of
biological youth and also markers of

3008
02:34:08,931 --> 02:34:13,100
biological health like symmetry or waist
to hip ratio,

3009
02:34:13,101 --> 02:34:15,590
which actually tends to be correlated
with reproductive

3010
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:22,290
fitness because women with lower waist
to hip ratios are generally healthier

3011
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:29,440
because especially in youth,
the acquisition of abdominal fat is

3012
02:34:29,441 --> 02:34:32,440
often an indicator of subpar physical
health.

3013
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:36,640
The correlation between the fertility
rate and the number of partners in the

3014
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,980
previous year is point nine Ford.
That's all of it,

3015
02:34:40,570 --> 02:34:42,250
right?
You never see a correlation to point

3016
02:34:42,251 --> 02:34:47,251
nine for anywhere ever.
Males choose fertility indicators,

3017
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:50,320
beauty waist to hip ratio,
youthful appearance,

3018
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:55,240
neotenous facial features,
and monotonous means like a infant.

3019
02:34:55,450 --> 02:35:00,450
So one of the.
One of the markers of feminine beauty is

3020
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:05,680
a face that has small childlike
features,

3021
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:13,980
female criteria all respondents.
The correlation between socioeconomic

3022
02:35:14,141 --> 02:35:16,480
status and frequency of simultaneous
partners.

3023
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:20,710
For men it's point five,
so the higher the status of the man man,

3024
02:35:20,711 --> 02:35:23,620
the more likely yes simultaneous sexual
partners,

3025
02:35:23,770 --> 02:35:26,440
so it means he's going out with someone
sexually at the same time.

3026
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:28,210
For men,
it's point four,

3027
02:35:28,211 --> 02:35:32,080
nine.
For Women it's zero age 30 and over

3028
02:35:32,081 --> 02:35:36,760
correlation between socioeconomic status
and frequency of simultaneous partners.

3029
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:39,670
For men it's point eight.
For Women it's zero

3030
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:45,100
age 30 to 39.
The correlation between socioeconomic

3031
02:35:45,101 --> 02:35:48,100
status for women and frequency of
simultaneous partners.

3032
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,580
For men point nine two.
That's a very small end though.

3033
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:52,930
For Women,
it's point one,

3034
02:35:52,931 --> 02:35:57,240
one
female criteria.

3035
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:00,150
For men,
it might reflect a tendency on the part

3036
02:36:00,151 --> 02:36:03,870
of females to choose high status
partners during their own reproductive

3037
02:36:03,871 --> 02:36:05,850
years.
This might account,

3038
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:10,290
especially for this strong relationship
founded men between the age of 30 and 39

3039
02:36:10,890 --> 02:36:14,760
women who typically prefer men three to
eight years older than they are,

3040
02:36:14,761 --> 02:36:16,650
would then be in their mid to late
twenties,

3041
02:36:16,651 --> 02:36:20,250
a time when accountability and that
sensitivity to male resources is at its

3042
02:36:20,251 --> 02:36:21,084
peak

3043
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,650
supporting evidence.
I don't believe that,

3044
02:36:26,651 --> 02:36:29,020
by the way,
I don't think that women pick man for

3045
02:36:29,021 --> 02:36:31,880
the socioeconomic status.
I think that women pick men for the

3046
02:36:31,910 --> 02:36:36,370
ability to climb the status hierarchy
because we forced women in an experiment

3047
02:36:36,371 --> 02:36:39,220
that we never published to choose
between those two things.

3048
02:36:39,550 --> 02:36:43,390
Wealth versus ability.
The women overwhelmingly chose ability.

3049
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:45,640
They just use wealth as a marker of
ability.

3050
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:50,890
Yep.
It was an honors thesis and often honors

3051
02:36:51,191 --> 02:36:52,960
thesis,
even if they're publishable,

3052
02:36:52,961 --> 02:36:56,500
drift into the thing all do next month
and then they stay there forever.

3053
02:36:56,990 --> 02:37:00,040
So because it's a heart,
it's actually quite hard to turn an

3054
02:37:00,041 --> 02:37:04,060
honors thesis into a publishable paper
and if there isn't some single person

3055
02:37:04,061 --> 02:37:06,970
driving that forward,
it's it's not going to happen.

3056
02:37:07,390 --> 02:37:10,810
So that that was the only reason.
Okay,

3057
02:37:10,811 --> 02:37:15,530
so trevor's parental investment model
contends that women are more likely than

3058
02:37:15,531 --> 02:37:18,650
men to seek a mate who possesses
nonphysical characteristics that

3059
02:37:18,651 --> 02:37:22,010
maximize the survival or reproductive
prospects of their Osprey,

3060
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:27,070
and we're examining in a Meta analysis
of meat selection research as predicted,

3061
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:32,090
women accorded more weight than men to
socioeconomic status of ambitiousness

3062
02:37:32,091 --> 02:37:35,360
character and intelligence and the
larger differences.

3063
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,380
Largest Jeff gender differences were
observed for cues to resource

3064
02:37:39,390 --> 02:37:42,500
acquistion,
acquisition status and ambitiousness.

3065
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:46,100
I'll also as predicted,
gender preferences were not found in

3066
02:37:46,101 --> 02:37:49,310
preferences for characteristics
unrelated to progeny survival,

3067
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:52,220
like sense of humor in general,
personality

3068
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:55,430
were valid,
comparisons could be made.

3069
02:37:55,431 --> 02:37:58,070
The findings were generally invariant
across generations,

3070
02:37:58,071 --> 02:38:03,071
cultures and research paradigms.
I'll go to this next one.

3071
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:07,090
Yeah.
Okay,

3072
02:38:07,150 --> 02:38:10,690
so here's some correlations.
One of them is between how much money

3073
02:38:10,691 --> 02:38:15,550
you make and your personality,
so the correlation between neuroticism

3074
02:38:15,551 --> 02:38:17,860
and how much money you get paid as
negative point three.

3075
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:20,890
The higher you are in neuroticism,
the less you make,

3076
02:38:21,190 --> 02:38:22,750
less you get paid.
Why?

3077
02:38:27,810 --> 02:38:30,980
Why do you think that is?
Well,

3078
02:38:30,990 --> 02:38:32,880
because you're not confident in your own
abilities.

3079
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:36,480
You have low self esteem,
and if you're not confident in your own

3080
02:38:36,481 --> 02:38:38,760
abilities and you're anxious about your
performance,

3081
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:43,560
the probability that you're going to
feel confident and calm about

3082
02:38:43,561 --> 02:38:47,400
negotiating for more money or even
asking for a raise is quite low.

3083
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:52,250
Extraversion and money made virtually no
correlation.

3084
02:38:52,251 --> 02:38:53,420
Openness,
no correlation.

3085
02:38:53,421 --> 02:38:56,660
Agreeableness negative point two.
For now,

3086
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:58,970
you might not think that those
correlations are very large,

3087
02:38:58,971 --> 02:39:02,690
but if the correlation between
neuroticism and money made is negative.

3088
02:39:02,691 --> 02:39:05,720
Point three,
if you translate that into an effect

3089
02:39:05,721 --> 02:39:07,190
size,
because this is called the binomial

3090
02:39:07,191 --> 02:39:11,600
effect size distribution,
just the effect of neuroticism will

3091
02:39:11,601 --> 02:39:16,601
ensure that 65 percent of men make more
money than average on 35 percent of

3092
02:39:17,421 --> 02:39:21,830
women make more money than average.
Just the effect of neuroticism and if

3093
02:39:21,831 --> 02:39:24,560
you add neuroticism and agreeableness
together,

3094
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,720
I have to do the math because I have to
square.

3095
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:29,840
I take the square root,
two point five,

3096
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:32,570
point five,

3097
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:41,350
I can't do that in front of a class.
Unfortunately it's going to push it up

3098
02:39:41,351 --> 02:39:43,480
to about 70 slash 30 or higher than
that.

3099
02:39:44,890 --> 02:39:47,710
There's a little bit of a negative
correlation between conscious

3100
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,670
conscientiousness and money made
ascendancy.

3101
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:54,850
How well you progress up the rates?
Yes.

3102
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:05,280
I don't know because I didn't look.
I didn't look in detail into the models

3103
02:40:05,281 --> 02:40:07,080
they use,
so I was just going to stick to the zero

3104
02:40:07,081 --> 02:40:12,081
order correlations,
so ascendancy negative point one for

3105
02:40:13,591 --> 02:40:15,540
neuroticism.
Negative point one,

3106
02:40:15,541 --> 02:40:17,070
four,
four.

3107
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:22,970
Agreeableness.
The effects are larger if you total

3108
02:40:22,971 --> 02:40:25,250
them.
Let's see.

3109
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:28,280
Here's a good one.
This is something to think about.

3110
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:33,560
Job Satisfaction.
The correlation with neuroticism is

3111
02:40:33,561 --> 02:40:35,400
negative point four,
two,

3112
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:38,330
that's a big one.
One of the things that's very

3113
02:40:38,331 --> 02:40:41,540
interesting about eroticism is it's also
a very good predictor of marital

3114
02:40:41,541 --> 02:40:46,370
satisfaction and it's interesting in
that light to note that 70 percent of

3115
02:40:46,371 --> 02:40:48,680
divorces are initiated by women.
Now,

3116
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:53,800
one reason for that is that men are
impossible get along with and the other

3117
02:40:54,081 --> 02:40:57,140
possibility is that women are too
sensitive to that and there's no way of

3118
02:40:57,141 --> 02:40:59,960
sorting that out,
but it's nonetheless interesting to note

3119
02:40:59,961 --> 02:41:02,090
that that's still where the gender
difference lies.

3120
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:07,680
Neuroticism,
correlation with job satisfaction,

3121
02:41:07,681 --> 02:41:10,470
negative point for two,
correlation with life satisfaction,

3122
02:41:10,471 --> 02:41:13,560
negative point for two,
correlation with career satisfaction,

3123
02:41:13,561 --> 02:41:14,820
negative point four,
one,

3124
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:20,130
so one of the things you want to
remember is that almost all the measures

3125
02:41:20,131 --> 02:41:24,600
that purport to measure something like
wellbeing or happiness or satisfaction

3126
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:28,830
are so contaminated with neuroticism,
that it's not even clear that they're

3127
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:33,420
measuring something different.
You see agreeableness.

3128
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:36,960
The correlation with career satisfaction
is negative point two,

3129
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:45,450
if you get men to rate their performance
and you get their bosses to rate their

3130
02:41:45,551 --> 02:41:48,520
performance,
men rate their performance pretty much

3131
02:41:48,521 --> 02:41:51,910
the same as the boss is rate their
performance or maybe they rate them a

3132
02:41:51,911 --> 02:41:54,460
little bit more,
but if women raped their own

3133
02:41:54,461 --> 02:41:57,190
performance,
they rate their own performance as worse

3134
02:41:57,191 --> 02:42:00,040
than their bosses rating of their
performance consistently,

3135
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:03,670
and the predictor of that seems to be
negative emotionality.

3136
02:42:08,190 --> 02:42:11,940
Now you might wonder if negative
emotionality is something that's

3137
02:42:11,941 --> 02:42:16,941
associated with lower levels of life
satisfaction across a broad variety of

3138
02:42:17,251 --> 02:42:20,160
measures.
What possible use could it be,

3139
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:23,520
but then you have to wonder,
well,

3140
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:28,580
exactly how is the physical environment
different for women and for men and one

3141
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:33,960
clearer fact is that at an individual
level,

3142
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:38,490
at least in relationship to dominance
battles with men,

3143
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:42,210
women are at a disadvantage not least
because of their size.

3144
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:50,750
Here's another,
here's another something worth

3145
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:52,490
considering.
I don't know how important it is,

3146
02:42:52,491 --> 02:42:56,300
but it might be really important.
It depends on how important this is.

3147
02:42:56,301 --> 02:42:59,060
Something that Carl Young said,
so it depends on how important.

3148
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:04,061
Youngest now,
Freud established the field of

3149
02:43:04,131 --> 02:43:09,131
psychoanalysis and with an investigation
I would say rigorous investigation into

3150
02:43:10,641 --> 02:43:12,160
the contents,
the unconscious,

3151
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:15,190
a modern psychologists and psychiatrists
like to,

3152
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:19,220
what would you say denigrate Freud,
but uh,

3153
02:43:19,230 --> 02:43:22,030
and I think there's a reason for that.
I think that Freud's fundamental

3154
02:43:22,031 --> 02:43:25,570
insights were so profound and so
valuable that they got immediately

3155
02:43:25,571 --> 02:43:29,070
absorbed into our culture and now they
seem self evident and so that all that's

3156
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:33,490
left of Freud is his errors because we
believe everything else,

3157
02:43:33,491 --> 02:43:35,560
we believe all the profound things he
discovered,

3158
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:38,290
we just take them for granted.
And so we don't believe the things that

3159
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:42,790
he said that weren't quite on the money
and that's all we credit with him with

3160
02:43:42,791 --> 02:43:45,100
now.
But he was certainly the first person

3161
02:43:45,101 --> 02:43:49,960
who brought up the idea of the
unconscious in a rigorous manner and he

3162
02:43:49,961 --> 02:43:53,920
was the first person to do a rigorous
examination of dreams because the

3163
02:43:53,950 --> 02:43:55,720
interpretation of dreams is a great
book.

3164
02:43:55,750 --> 02:43:59,110
It's well worth reading.
And he was the first person to note that

3165
02:43:59,111 --> 02:44:04,000
people were in some sense inhabited by
subpersonalities that had a certain

3166
02:44:04,001 --> 02:44:08,290
degree of autonomy and independent life.
Brilliant observation,

3167
02:44:08,291 --> 02:44:10,330
the cognitive psychologists haven't
caught up with that at all,

3168
02:44:10,331 --> 02:44:11,164
yet.

3169
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:19,080
Ewan was profoundly affected by Freud.
Jung was profoundly affected by nature

3170
02:44:19,081 --> 02:44:21,990
and by Freud.
Those were his two main intellectual

3171
02:44:23,130 --> 02:44:26,220
influences.
I don't think one more than the other.

3172
02:44:29,130 --> 02:44:31,080
He split with Freud on the religious
issue.

3173
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:34,290
That was what caused the disruption in
their relationship,

3174
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:37,920
and I think it's an extremely
interesting historical occurrence.

3175
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:43,590
It might be a profound significance.
Freud believed that the fundamental myth

3176
02:44:43,681 --> 02:44:46,230
of the human being was the Eda Pole
Myth,

3177
02:44:46,770 --> 02:44:51,720
and the myth from a broader perspective
is a failed hero's story.

3178
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:57,410
So the eatable myth is the myth of a man
who develops who grows up but then

3179
02:44:58,140 --> 02:45:01,620
accidentally becomes too close to his
mother,

3180
02:45:01,650 --> 02:45:04,050
sleeps with her.
He doesn't know who she is,

3181
02:45:04,051 --> 02:45:07,620
and as a consequence blinds himself and
there's a,

3182
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:11,220
there's a,
there's a warning about human

3183
02:45:11,221 --> 02:45:15,240
development going wrong in that story.
And I think that Freud put his finger on

3184
02:45:15,241 --> 02:45:19,680
it extraordinarily well because human
beings have a very long period of

3185
02:45:19,681 --> 02:45:20,514
dependency.

3186
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:25,470
And one of the things that you do see in
clinical practice is that many people's

3187
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:30,500
problems are associated with their
inability to break free of their family,

3188
02:45:31,410 --> 02:45:33,840
like they're consumed by the family
drama,

3189
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:36,090
right?
They can't get beyond what happened to

3190
02:45:36,091 --> 02:45:38,940
them in their family.
They're stuck in the past.

3191
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:40,193
It's.
And that's,

3192
02:45:40,680 --> 02:45:44,910
that's equivalent symbolically speaking,
you might say to the idea of being too

3193
02:45:44,911 --> 02:45:46,290
close to your mother of,
of,

3194
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:49,810
of the boundaries being improperly
specified.

3195
02:45:49,811 --> 02:45:52,770
And that happens far more often than
anyone would like to think.

3196
02:45:54,270 --> 02:45:54,941
As I said,
Freud,

3197
02:45:54,941 --> 02:45:59,700
I thought it was a universal,
but you see,

3198
02:45:59,701 --> 02:46:02,880
he had a different idea.
And his idea was that it wasn't the

3199
02:46:02,881 --> 02:46:05,610
failed hero story.
That was the universal human myth.

3200
02:46:05,850 --> 02:46:09,950
It was the successful hero's story.
And that's a difference.

3201
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:15,310
I could seriously a big difference
because the successful hero's story is

3202
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:18,020
remembering sleeping beauty.

3203
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:20,570
You may remember this in the Disney
movie,

3204
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:24,440
the evil queen traps the prince in a
dungeon and she's not going to let them

3205
02:46:24,441 --> 02:46:26,000
out till he's old.
Right?

3206
02:46:26,030 --> 02:46:29,420
And so there's this comical scene where
she's down in the dungeon,

3207
02:46:29,421 --> 02:46:31,580
he's all in chains and she's laughing at
him,

3208
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:34,160
telling him what his future is going to
be like.

3209
02:46:34,210 --> 02:46:37,130
She's quite evil and you know,
she,

3210
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:40,970
she paints this wonderful picture of him
being freed in like 80 years and

3211
02:46:40,971 --> 02:46:44,110
hobbling out of the castle on his horse
that's so old,

3212
02:46:44,111 --> 02:46:46,170
he can barely stand up in him with gray
hair.

3213
02:46:46,171 --> 02:46:47,270
And,
and you know,

3214
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:52,560
she recites the story of his eventual
triumphant departure from the castle as

3215
02:46:53,031 --> 02:46:56,540
a old and decrepit man.
And she has a great laugh about it.

3216
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:58,100
And it's nice,
you know,

3217
02:46:58,101 --> 02:47:00,830
it's a real punchy story.
It's really something wonderful for

3218
02:47:00,831 --> 02:47:03,530
children.
That story and

3219
02:47:05,030 --> 02:47:10,030
he gets free of the,
of the shackles and the things that free

3220
02:47:11,251 --> 02:47:11,340
him.

3221
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:14,810
Our three little female fairies.
It's the positive aspect of the feminine

3222
02:47:14,811 --> 02:47:16,800
that frees him from the dungeon.
It's so.

3223
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:20,300
It's very interesting and very accurate
from a psychological perspective.

3224
02:47:20,301 --> 02:47:23,660
It's the negative element of the
feminine that encapsulates him in the

3225
02:47:23,661 --> 02:47:25,160
dungeon.
And it's the positive element of the

3226
02:47:25,161 --> 02:47:27,970
feminine that frees him.
And then he,

3227
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:31,490
he has a queen.
The Evil Queen is not very happy when he

3228
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:33,680
escapes.
You may remember that she stands on top

3229
02:47:33,681 --> 02:47:38,240
of her castle tower and starts to spin
off cosmic sparks.

3230
02:47:38,241 --> 02:47:40,610
I mean,
she's quite the creature enveloped in

3231
02:47:40,611 --> 02:47:44,810
flame and then she turns into a dragon
and she then the prince has to fight

3232
02:47:44,811 --> 02:47:49,811
with her in order to make contact with
sleeping beauty and an awakened her from

3233
02:47:51,621 --> 02:47:56,621
her comatose existence as her
unconscious existence and

3234
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:03,690
wants a brilliant.
It's a brilliant representation of a

3235
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:05,660
successful hero myth.
He,

3236
02:48:07,010 --> 02:48:12,010
he doesn't end up staying in an unholy
relationship with his mother.

3237
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:18,280
Let's say he escapes and then conquers
the worst thing that can be imagined and

3238
02:48:21,411 --> 02:48:23,540
is ennobled by that and that as a
consequence,

3239
02:48:23,541 --> 02:48:28,541
he's able to wake the slumbering
feminine from its coma and that's a

3240
02:48:30,021 --> 02:48:33,620
union story and that's the story that he
juxtaposed against Freud.

3241
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:39,140
Freud thought of religious phenomena as
part of an occult tide.

3242
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:42,590
That would be,
that would drown rationale rationality.

3243
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:47,720
That's why Freud was so valiantly
antireligious and you thought,

3244
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:50,210
no,
it's not the case.

3245
02:48:50,270 --> 02:48:52,040
You're throwing the baby out with the
bathwater.

3246
02:48:52,310 --> 02:48:56,480
There's something profound and central
to the hero.

3247
02:48:56,481 --> 02:49:01,481
Myth and union clinical work is
essentially the awakening of the hero

3248
02:49:03,051 --> 02:49:07,800
myth in the in the analysis and in the
client or the patient

3249
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:13,340
to conceptualize yourself as that which
can confront chaos and triumph and that

3250
02:49:13,861 --> 02:49:18,300
that's associated with an ennobling of
the Sea of consciousness and the

3251
02:49:18,301 --> 02:49:23,070
establishment of proper positive
relationships between male and female.

3252
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:26,610
And you know,
I'm a skeptical person.

3253
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:31,410
I'm a very,
very skeptical person and I've tried

3254
02:49:31,411 --> 02:49:35,920
with every trick.
I have to put a lever underneath young

3255
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:39,680
story and lifted up and disrupt it and
I,

3256
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:43,080
I can't do it.
I think he was right in that Freud was

3257
02:49:43,081 --> 02:49:43,711
wrong.
I mean,

3258
02:49:43,711 --> 02:49:46,800
I have great respect for Freud.
I think he got the progam problem

3259
02:49:46,801 --> 02:49:50,370
diagnosed very,
very nicely and in my clinical work,

3260
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:54,150
I see the phenomena that Freud described
emerge continually,

3261
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:57,450
constantly the best.
If you're interested in that,

3262
02:49:57,810 --> 02:50:00,420
there's a documentary you should watch.
I may have mentioned it before.

3263
02:50:00,510 --> 02:50:02,400
I think it's the best documentary ever
made.

3264
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:03,900
Certainly the best one I've ever seen.

3265
02:50:04,110 --> 02:50:08,040
It's called crumb and it's about a
underground cartoonists.

3266
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:11,670
Robert Crumb who who is part of the
hippie movement in,

3267
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:15,310
although he hated hippies,
he was part of the hippie movement in

3268
02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:17,970
the sixties in San Francisco,
and started the entire underground

3269
02:50:17,971 --> 02:50:22,350
comic,
what culture that that manifested itself

3270
02:50:22,351 --> 02:50:27,351
eventually in graphic novels who's quite
a significant figure from the

3271
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:33,060
perspective of popular art and a very,
very intelligent man and also I would

3272
02:50:33,061 --> 02:50:36,270
say a hero,
although a very bent and depraved and

3273
02:50:36,271 --> 02:50:39,720
warped one,
someone very acutely aware of his own

3274
02:50:39,721 --> 02:50:44,721
shadow and the documentary outlines his
attempts to escape from his absolutely

3275
02:50:46,591 --> 02:50:51,570
dreadful mother and the failure of his
two brothers to do the same thing.

3276
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:55,680
One of whom ended up as a street beggar
in San Francisco and the other who drank

3277
02:50:55,681 --> 02:50:58,830
furniture Polish and died six months
after the documentary was produced.

3278
02:50:59,010 --> 02:51:01,740
It's an unbelievably shocking
documentary.

3279
02:51:01,950 --> 02:51:06,950
It's the only piece of film that I've
ever seen that captures Friday and

3280
02:51:08,791 --> 02:51:09,624
pathology.

3281
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:12,480
I've never seen anything because he
can't see it generally,

3282
02:51:12,481 --> 02:51:16,290
unless you're in a clinical situation,
unless you know the details of someone's

3283
02:51:16,291 --> 02:51:18,180
lives,
the personal intimate details,

3284
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:23,040
you cannot communicate it.
But the documentary as who made the film

3285
02:51:23,330 --> 02:51:25,320
was Robert Zweig off,
if I remember correctly,

3286
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:29,430
was a friend of the crumbs and so he got
access in a way that no one else would

3287
02:51:29,431 --> 02:51:31,320
have,
and they're also very forthright and

3288
02:51:31,321 --> 02:51:33,870
forthcoming about their situation in
general.

3289
02:51:34,150 --> 02:51:36,930
I would highly recommend that it's.
It's a real punch.

3290
02:51:37,050 --> 02:51:42,050
If you want to know how a rapist thinks,
like if you actually want to know,

3291
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:44,370
because maybe you don't want to know.
In fact,

3292
02:51:44,371 --> 02:51:46,740
you probably don't want to know,
right?

3293
02:51:46,741 --> 02:51:50,310
Because do you really want to know that?
Because to understand that means to put

3294
02:51:50,311 --> 02:51:52,230
yourself in that position and to
understand it.

3295
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:57,440
If you really want to know how a serial
sexual Predator thinks and why.

3296
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:02,960
If you watch crum and you pay attention,
you'll know and that's only a tiny bit

3297
02:52:03,841 --> 02:52:06,040
of what the film has to offer.
It's really

3298
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:09,250
quite remarkable.
Anyways,

3299
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:18,180
young split with Freud on the issue of
the Interpol story as the fundamental

3300
02:52:20,021 --> 02:52:25,021
myth of humankind and on the issue of
the validity of the religious viewpoint

3301
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:30,940
and young came down heavily on the side
of the validity of the religious

3302
02:52:30,941 --> 02:52:33,310
viewpoint.
And he established that in a book called

3303
02:52:33,311 --> 02:52:36,610
symbols of transformation,
which was written in 1914,

3304
02:52:36,850 --> 02:52:40,390
and that's the book that broke,
that produced the break permanent split

3305
02:52:40,391 --> 02:52:44,620
with Freud and that book,
I would say that books actually been

3306
02:52:44,621 --> 02:52:48,970
written three times.
It was written as symbols of trip four

3307
02:52:48,971 --> 02:52:50,650
times written as symbols of
transformation,

3308
02:52:50,651 --> 02:52:52,780
which young extensively revised when he
was old,

3309
02:52:52,990 --> 02:52:57,940
and then it was rewritten in is in a
sense by a student of young's called

3310
02:52:57,941 --> 02:53:01,090
Eric Norman,
who is also something someone I would

3311
02:53:01,091 --> 02:53:02,530
really recommend.
Eric Norman,

3312
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:07,210
I think is [inaudible] greatest student.
And he wrote two books.

3313
02:53:07,211 --> 02:53:09,670
He wrote one called the origins and
history of consciousness,

3314
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:13,090
which is a description of the
development of consciousness out of

3315
02:53:13,091 --> 02:53:16,360
unconsciousness,
using the hero myth as a,

3316
02:53:16,810 --> 02:53:17,810
as an,
as a,

3317
02:53:18,140 --> 02:53:18,973
as a,
as a,

3318
02:53:19,030 --> 02:53:21,700
what would you say as a,
as an interpretive skeleton.

3319
02:53:21,700 --> 02:53:26,700
So we Newman viewed the hero myth as the
dramatized story of the emergence of

3320
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:31,990
human consciousness out of the
surrounding unconsciousness in which it

3321
02:53:31,991 --> 02:53:34,360
was embedded.
The struggle for consciousness,

3322
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:37,030
the struggle of consciousness upward
towards the light,

3323
02:53:37,031 --> 02:53:41,670
like a lotus flower struggles up through
the muck and they and the water to to

3324
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:45,790
lay itself on the surface of the water
and and bloom and reveal the Buddha,

3325
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,340
which is of course what the lotus flower
does from a symbolic perspective and

3326
02:53:49,650 --> 02:53:50,980
for,
for for Norman.

3327
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:54,080
The hero's story was the story of the
development,

3328
02:53:54,081 --> 02:53:56,800
the successful development of
consciousness and the origins of

3329
02:53:56,801 --> 02:53:59,500
consciousness.
The origins and history of consciousness

3330
02:53:59,501 --> 02:54:02,170
is a great book.
Interestingly,

3331
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:07,510
Camille Paglia row read the origins and
history of consciousness.

3332
02:54:07,511 --> 02:54:12,220
She's one of the few mainstream
intellectuals that I've ever encountered

3333
02:54:12,221 --> 02:54:16,390
who read that in commented on it,
and she believed that it would be

3334
02:54:16,391 --> 02:54:21,391
sufficient antidote to postmodern
denigration of literature.

3335
02:54:22,330 --> 02:54:26,920
She thought it was that powerful a work,
and I believe that.

3336
02:54:26,921 --> 02:54:31,330
I think it's a remarkable book.
Carl Jung wrote the foreword to that

3337
02:54:31,331 --> 02:54:34,890
book and he said in the forward that it
was the book that he wished he would

3338
02:54:34,891 --> 02:54:36,850
have written,
so sort of like young.

3339
02:54:36,851 --> 02:54:38,920
He wrote,
I don't remember how many volumes,

3340
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:43,270
dozens of very thick,
difficult volumes.

3341
02:54:43,510 --> 02:54:48,510
It was like Norman was able to
distill those into a single volume

3342
02:54:51,161 --> 02:54:52,750
statement,
and so I would also say if you're

3343
02:54:52,751 --> 02:54:55,930
interested in young,
the best book to read is the origins and

3344
02:54:55,931 --> 02:54:59,950
history of consciousness.
It's the best intro into into the union

3345
02:54:59,951 --> 02:55:00,790
world,
so you.

3346
02:55:00,791 --> 02:55:04,460
It's very difficult to,
very difficult to understand.

3347
02:55:04,490 --> 02:55:08,600
It requires a real shift of perspective
in order to understand what he's talking

3348
02:55:08,601 --> 02:55:11,630
about,
and Norman wrote another book called the

3349
02:55:11,631 --> 02:55:15,530
great mother,
which is a little bit more specialized

3350
02:55:15,531 --> 02:55:17,570
in some sense,
but it's also extremely interesting

3351
02:55:17,571 --> 02:55:22,571
because it flushes out the archetype of
chaos and its representation as feminine

3352
02:55:23,810 --> 02:55:26,910
and it's a brilliant book as well and
highly worth,

3353
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:28,700
highly worth reading both those books.

3354
02:55:30,440 --> 02:55:34,520
Anyways,
young was a very strange person and a

3355
02:55:34,521 --> 02:55:39,521
visionary and and so that's kept them
outside of the academic realm almost

3356
02:55:40,821 --> 02:55:41,654
entirely.
I mean,

3357
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:44,570
I was constantly warned as an
undergraduate and then a graduate

3358
02:55:44,571 --> 02:55:49,571
student and then a professor against
ever talking about young in any way

3359
02:55:50,301 --> 02:55:52,940
whatsoever.
When I went on the job market,

3360
02:55:52,941 --> 02:55:55,640
when I was at mcgill,
when I had graduated from mcgill,

3361
02:55:55,820 --> 02:55:58,280
I had done my scientific research in
Anelka,

3362
02:55:58,281 --> 02:56:00,200
holism,
and I had a fairly lengthy publication

3363
02:56:00,201 --> 02:56:05,201
record that was pure empirical research
and really neuro physiological research

3364
02:56:06,770 --> 02:56:11,770
into the pharmacology of alcoholism and
I established a reasonably solid dossier

3365
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:16,940
publications,
but at the same time I was writing this

3366
02:56:16,941 --> 02:56:20,450
book that became maps of meaning and so
I split my time in graduate student

3367
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:25,510
school between these two endeavors.
One very specifically neurological and

3368
02:56:25,611 --> 02:56:30,611
pharmacological and really biologically
based on the other very abstract,

3369
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:32,450
religious,
symbolic,

3370
02:56:32,451 --> 02:56:35,210
psychoanalytic,
the complete opposite,

3371
02:56:35,211 --> 02:56:39,020
but I could see that the two things
overlapped really nicely and there was a

3372
02:56:39,021 --> 02:56:43,970
number of scientists at the time that
we're also drawing the same conclusions.

3373
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:47,830
The same relationship between the
biology and the psychoanalysis.

3374
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:50,690
Jaak Panksepp,
who wrote a book called an affective

3375
02:56:50,691 --> 02:56:52,670
neuroscience,
which is a great classic,

3376
02:56:53,060 --> 02:56:58,060
is one of those people who who saw the
relationship between the neurobiology of

3377
02:56:58,311 --> 02:57:02,810
emotion and motivation and the
psychoanalytic insights never became a

3378
02:57:02,811 --> 02:57:04,850
mainstream view.
But I think it's too complex.

3379
02:57:04,851 --> 02:57:09,710
I think that bridging the gap between
the biology and the and the symbolic is

3380
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:11,830
too much for people generally speaking,
you know,

3381
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:15,530
it was certainly virtually too much for
me because I got quite ill when I was a

3382
02:57:15,531 --> 02:57:18,290
graduate student.
I think for a variety of reasons.

3383
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:21,500
I also would go out and party three
nights a week and so that probably had

3384
02:57:21,501 --> 02:57:22,460
something to do with it,
but,

3385
02:57:24,830 --> 02:57:28,100
but working on those two things
simultaneously was also rather

3386
02:57:28,101 --> 02:57:29,450
exhausting.
Now,

3387
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:34,940
you was a tremendously insightful
clinician and he was a strange person.

3388
02:57:34,970 --> 02:57:36,110
Introverted,
visionary,

3389
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:38,210
high and introversion.
Very,

3390
02:57:38,211 --> 02:57:38,871
very,
very,

3391
02:57:38,871 --> 02:57:40,400
very,
very high in openness.

3392
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:44,180
Like off the charts and also God only
knows what his Iq was.

3393
02:57:44,181 --> 02:57:46,370
I mean,
every time I read it's like reading

3394
02:57:46,371 --> 02:57:48,500
Nietzsche.
It's terrifying because you know,

3395
02:57:48,501 --> 02:57:51,500
he's,
he's so damn smart that he can think up

3396
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:53,510
answers to questions that you don't
even.

3397
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:55,700
It's not like you don't understand the
answers is the,

3398
02:57:55,710 --> 02:57:58,070
you never conceptualized the damn
questions.

3399
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:00,320
It's really something to read.
Someone like that,

3400
02:58:00,321 --> 02:58:01,350
right?
Who says,

3401
02:58:01,351 --> 02:58:02,520
well,
here's a mystery and you think,

3402
02:58:02,521 --> 02:58:04,350
wow,
I never thought of that is a mystery,

3403
02:58:04,351 --> 02:58:06,330
and here's the solution.
It's like,

3404
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:07,560
okay,
that's.

3405
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:10,140
That's,
that's something you know,

3406
02:58:10,141 --> 02:58:12,240
and he could read Greek and he could
read.

3407
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:17,430
He read all the ancient.
He read a very large variety of ancient

3408
02:58:17,431 --> 02:58:22,431
languages and was very familiar with the
entire corpus of of astrological thought

3409
02:58:22,921 --> 02:58:27,921
and of l chemical thought and of classic
literature and Biblical stories and been

3410
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:35,000
educated in a way that no one is
educated now and so he's very daunting

3411
02:58:35,881 --> 02:58:40,080
person to encounter and terrifying,
absolutely terrifying.

3412
02:58:40,081 --> 02:58:45,081
His Book Ion,
which is the second volume of the second

3413
02:58:45,211 --> 02:58:47,220
volume of volume nine,
which is the archetypes of the

3414
02:58:47,221 --> 02:58:50,070
collective unconscious.
That damn book is just absolutely

3415
02:58:50,071 --> 02:58:52,920
terrifying because young,
he's one of these visionaries who can

3416
02:58:52,921 --> 02:58:57,510
see way underneath the social structures
and look at patterns that are developing

3417
02:58:57,511 --> 02:59:02,070
across for you in young's case across
thousands of years and lays them out and

3418
02:59:02,071 --> 02:59:05,580
so that's a really.
That's really something to to encounter.

3419
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:07,170
Ion is a terrifying book.

3420
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:11,910
Anyways,
one question might be,

3421
02:59:11,911 --> 02:59:13,120
well,
because I read the organ,

3422
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:14,790
I think,
how the hell did he know these things?

3423
02:59:14,791 --> 02:59:18,210
How could he figure these things out?
I can't understand how he could possibly

3424
02:59:18,211 --> 02:59:20,550
know these things.
Well,

3425
02:59:20,551 --> 02:59:25,551
here's a partial answer.
Young was a visionary,

3426
02:59:26,310 --> 02:59:31,310
and so what that means as far as I can
tell and like we could do a little quick

3427
02:59:31,590 --> 02:59:34,560
survey here.
How many of you think you think in words

3428
02:59:35,360 --> 02:59:37,350
can put up your hands,
do you think in words?

3429
02:59:39,170 --> 02:59:40,190
Okay,
so it looks like.

3430
02:59:40,610 --> 02:59:42,620
What about pictures?
How many of you think in pictures?

3431
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:45,240
Okay,
so that's interesting.

3432
02:59:45,241 --> 02:59:47,370
How many of you think that's about half
and half by the way?

3433
02:59:47,490 --> 02:59:50,550
Probably a fewer on the word side.
How many of you think in pictures and

3434
02:59:50,551 --> 02:59:51,384
words?

3435
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:54,030
Okay,
so all right,

3436
02:59:54,031 --> 02:59:56,310
so it was roughly a third in each
category,

3437
02:59:56,311 --> 03:00:01,311
but that's also something that I really
haven't encountered any research on from

3438
03:00:01,801 --> 03:00:03,810
the neuropsychological perspective.
It's like,

3439
03:00:04,650 --> 03:00:08,130
well do you think in pictures or do you
think ad words and and is that actually

3440
03:00:08,131 --> 03:00:12,270
a reliable distinction?
I think I think in words most of the

3441
03:00:12,271 --> 03:00:14,820
time,
but I can think in pictures like if I'm

3442
03:00:14,821 --> 03:00:17,850
trying to build something that I can
think in pictures very almost

3443
03:00:17,851 --> 03:00:20,040
instantaneously,
but it isn't my natural mode of

3444
03:00:20,041 --> 03:00:22,920
thinking.
I'm hyperverbal and so my natural mode

3445
03:00:22,921 --> 03:00:24,930
of thinking is to think everything
through in words,

3446
03:00:25,380 --> 03:00:28,740
but I know my wife doesn't like that.
She thinks in images and then it has to

3447
03:00:28,741 --> 03:00:32,490
translate them into words and so
anyways,

3448
03:00:32,491 --> 03:00:35,250
young was very literate and he could
really think in words,

3449
03:00:35,251 --> 03:00:38,940
but he could really think in images.
Also talking to my wife quite

3450
03:00:38,941 --> 03:00:43,440
extensively like her,
the intensity of her visualization

3451
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:45,120
vastly exceeds mine.

3452
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:47,340
So for example,
if I close my eyes and then try to

3453
03:00:47,341 --> 03:00:52,341
imagine the crowd in front of me,
it's pretty low resolution and vague and

3454
03:00:52,711 --> 03:00:55,260
not brilliantly colored and vivid.
You know,

3455
03:00:55,290 --> 03:00:56,123
it's,
it's,

3456
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:58,650
it's like I'm seeing through a glass
darkly,

3457
03:00:58,651 --> 03:01:01,180
let's.
I can't bring images to mind with that

3458
03:01:01,210 --> 03:01:04,520
with spectacular clarity,
but my wife is very good at that and you

3459
03:01:04,570 --> 03:01:09,460
seem to be absolutely
a genius at that kind of thinking.

3460
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:12,580
And he had a lot of visionaries in his
family history as well,

3461
03:01:12,581 --> 03:01:16,180
so I don't know to what degree there is
a hereditary component of that and I

3462
03:01:16,181 --> 03:01:19,840
don't know to what degree that's
actually a neurological specialization,

3463
03:01:19,841 --> 03:01:23,710
I presume it would be associated with
the trade.

3464
03:01:23,711 --> 03:01:27,880
Openness distinguishes itself,
differentiates itself into interest in

3465
03:01:27,881 --> 03:01:32,080
ideas and interest in aesthetics.
And my suspicion is that the people who

3466
03:01:32,081 --> 03:01:34,600
are more interested in aesthetics are
the visionary types.

3467
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:38,500
The ones that think in images anyways,
young could really think in images and

3468
03:01:38,501 --> 03:01:43,501
he could imagine beings.
And I had a client once who was a lucid

3469
03:01:44,651 --> 03:01:48,610
dreamer and how many of you have had a
lucid dream so you know you're dreaming

3470
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:53,800
while you're many that that phenomena
wasn't really even even identified as a

3471
03:01:54,551 --> 03:01:57,910
phenomena until the end of the 19th
century.

3472
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,240
There was a book written about it that
Freud tried to get his hands on but

3473
03:02:01,241 --> 03:02:03,250
couldn't because it was a very rare
book.

3474
03:02:03,430 --> 03:02:07,750
And then there was a researcher about 30
years ago who started to study lucid

3475
03:02:07,751 --> 03:02:09,010
dreams.
But anyways,

3476
03:02:09,011 --> 03:02:13,120
I had a client who was a lucid dreamer
and one of the things she could do was

3477
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:18,970
ask her dream characters what
information they were trying to convey

3478
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:22,600
and they would tell her.
So that was very interesting.

3479
03:02:22,930 --> 03:02:27,820
And one of the consequences of that was,
I don't have the story completely right

3480
03:02:27,821 --> 03:02:29,260
in my memory,
but it's close enough.

3481
03:02:30,190 --> 03:02:32,830
She was afraid of a very large number of
things.

3482
03:02:33,310 --> 03:02:37,300
And in her dream,
I think it was a gypsy standing by a

3483
03:02:37,301 --> 03:02:41,830
wagon,
told her that if she was going to be

3484
03:02:41,831 --> 03:02:46,090
successful in university,
that she would have to visit a

3485
03:02:46,091 --> 03:02:49,390
slaughterhouse.
And that was something that was way

3486
03:02:49,391 --> 03:02:52,900
beyond her capacity to tolerate.
She was a vegetarian,

3487
03:02:52,901 --> 03:02:54,910
she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat
even.

3488
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:58,780
And so,
and she was very oppressed and depressed

3489
03:02:58,781 --> 03:03:02,530
and anxious because of the slaughter
house nature of existence.

3490
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:04,870
And so her dream focused on that.
And

3491
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:09,850
one of the consequences of that,
because the slaughter house was out of

3492
03:03:09,851 --> 03:03:12,670
the question as a clinical intervention,
um,

3493
03:03:13,540 --> 03:03:16,960
I took her to an embalming,
right?

3494
03:03:16,961 --> 03:03:19,000
Because cause I asked her,
I asked her what,

3495
03:03:19,060 --> 03:03:22,060
what,
what might be equivalent to that,

3496
03:03:22,090 --> 03:03:24,960
and so she suggested that,
and you know,

3497
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:27,700
exposure therapy is a hallmark of
clinical psychology,

3498
03:03:27,701 --> 03:03:28,390
right?

3499
03:03:28,390 --> 03:03:32,020
One of the things you do with people as
a clinician is you find out what they're

3500
03:03:32,021 --> 03:03:37,021
afraid of and you gradually and
voluntarily expose them to that and that

3501
03:03:37,031 --> 03:03:39,280
cures them.
And that's associated with the hero

3502
03:03:39,281 --> 03:03:39,701
myth,
right?

3503
03:03:39,701 --> 03:03:42,550
It's exactly the same thing.
It's like there's a dragon.

3504
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:45,220
It's stopping you because there's lots
of dragons.

3505
03:03:45,221 --> 03:03:47,320
Most of them aren't stopping you.
You can ignore them.

3506
03:03:47,380 --> 03:03:48,910
You don't have to just go,
you know,

3507
03:03:49,420 --> 03:03:52,450
slash away at randomly.
You're not supposed to be fighting

3508
03:03:52,451 --> 03:03:55,240
dragons that aren't in your way,
but if they are in your way,

3509
03:03:55,241 --> 03:03:57,650
you can't ignore them.
And then you decompose them into sub

3510
03:03:57,651 --> 03:04:02,450
dragons and you have people take them on
and as they take them on,

3511
03:04:02,870 --> 03:04:05,620
they dispense with the dragon and they
gained the power of the drag.

3512
03:04:05,621 --> 03:04:09,200
It's like a video game.
A video game is like that.

3513
03:04:09,230 --> 03:04:10,820
That's why people like the video games.

3514
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:11,621
Well,
that's right,

3515
03:04:11,621 --> 03:04:14,450
right?
There's a reason that you absorb power

3516
03:04:14,451 --> 03:04:16,700
when you overcome things,
when you play a video game.

3517
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:20,090
It's not like that's intrinsic to the
video game structure.

3518
03:04:20,091 --> 03:04:22,490
That's an archetypal idea.
Anyways,

3519
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:27,170
we went and saw an embalming,
which was a very interesting experience

3520
03:04:27,190 --> 03:04:32,190
and,
and quite quite useful for her because

3521
03:04:32,601 --> 03:04:35,780
she knew what she could tolerate after
that and it was a hell of a lot more

3522
03:04:35,781 --> 03:04:38,960
than she thought she could tolerate and
so that's very useful to know.

3523
03:04:40,910 --> 03:04:45,260
Back to you.
He's a visionary thinker now.

3524
03:04:45,530 --> 03:04:48,560
My client,
I said she could lose a dream and she

3525
03:04:48,561 --> 03:04:53,561
could ask her dream characters what they
wanted and what they were trying to

3526
03:04:54,470 --> 03:04:56,690
communicate to her.
So that was pretty interesting.

3527
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:59,510
That happened spontaneously.
Had nothing to do with me.

3528
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:01,430
You know,
I'm interested in dreams and one of my

3529
03:05:01,431 --> 03:05:04,790
clients are great dreamers,
especially the creative ones because I

3530
03:05:04,791 --> 03:05:07,910
think it's a hallmark of creativity to
have vivid dreams and to be able to

3531
03:05:07,911 --> 03:05:08,744
remember them.

3532
03:05:09,260 --> 03:05:13,220
But that was a faculty that was natural
to her

3533
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:18,650
young.
How did this other client at one time,

3534
03:05:18,651 --> 03:05:21,770
at one point,
she had a variety of fears and she had

3535
03:05:21,771 --> 03:05:26,771
this dream that she told me she was
walking down a beach and on the side of

3536
03:05:27,591 --> 03:05:29,630
the beach up a dune,
small Dune.

3537
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:32,750
There was this old man with a snake,
a big python,

3538
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:35,380
and there's a crowd around him.
And uh,

3539
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:40,670
she was walking by the snake handler and
the snake and the crowd and she didn't

3540
03:05:40,671 --> 03:05:43,490
want to have anything to do with them.
He was sort of showing people the snake.

3541
03:05:43,491 --> 03:05:46,340
And she told me that dream and I
thought,

3542
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:47,100
well,
you know,

3543
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:52,100
you probably need to go see that snake.
And so I relaxed or quasi hypnotic

3544
03:05:53,331 --> 03:05:55,190
technique.
It's very straightforward.

3545
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:59,810
Hypnosis is generally nothing but
pronounced relaxation low.

3546
03:05:59,811 --> 03:06:03,320
You have to be susceptible to hypnosis
to actually fall into a hypnotic trance

3547
03:06:03,350 --> 03:06:06,290
as a consequence of being relaxed or
just relaxed her.

3548
03:06:06,830 --> 03:06:10,280
I had her breathe deeply and pay
attention to different parts of her body

3549
03:06:10,281 --> 03:06:13,580
and just relax their muscles one by one
essentially so that she could

3550
03:06:13,581 --> 03:06:15,470
concentrate.
And then I told her,

3551
03:06:15,471 --> 03:06:19,190
we play with the dream a little bit and
say union technique.

3552
03:06:19,670 --> 03:06:20,151
I said,
well,

3553
03:06:20,151 --> 03:06:23,090
so called the dream image to mind,
which she could do quite well.

3554
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:23,841
Said,
okay,

3555
03:06:23,841 --> 03:06:25,610
so let's,
let's explore it.

3556
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:28,640
So like pretend it's like pretend play
in.

3557
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:30,740
You know,
if you're a kid in your pretend playing,

3558
03:06:30,890 --> 03:06:33,560
you don't exactly direct the game,
right you,

3559
03:06:33,561 --> 03:06:35,270
you,
you play the game.

3560
03:06:35,690 --> 03:06:39,140
So it's partly your direction obviously
because you're the player.

3561
03:06:39,141 --> 03:06:42,590
But the thing also happened
spontaneously of its own accord.

3562
03:06:42,890 --> 03:06:45,770
And you can think about that as a
dialogue between the conscious mind and

3563
03:06:45,771 --> 03:06:47,360
the unconscious mind.
In some sense,

3564
03:06:47,361 --> 03:06:51,280
it's developmental dialogue.
It's not a fun game if you just direct

3565
03:06:51,281 --> 03:06:51,410
it.

3566
03:06:51,410 --> 03:06:55,860
It's only a fun game if you're inviting
and something is welling up as a

3567
03:06:55,861 --> 03:06:57,570
consequence.
It's the same thing that happens when

3568
03:06:57,571 --> 03:07:00,510
you're,
you're engaged in some kind of artistic

3569
03:07:00,511 --> 03:07:03,450
or literary production.
If it's all top down,

3570
03:07:03,770 --> 03:07:05,130
you know,
if you're forcing it,

3571
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:07,170
then it's propaganda,
it's empty.

3572
03:07:07,470 --> 03:07:10,550
What do you want to sort of put yourself
in a receptive state of mind in an

3573
03:07:10,551 --> 03:07:14,160
imaginative state of mind?
And it's sort of half you and half

3574
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:18,300
nature itself,
manifesting itself in your creative

3575
03:07:18,301 --> 03:07:21,110
imagination.
And that was the sort of state that we

3576
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:23,100
were striving for.
And she,

3577
03:07:24,540 --> 03:07:26,850
I asked her when she was in relaxed,
I said,

3578
03:07:26,851 --> 03:07:28,080
well,
what do you think about the snake

3579
03:07:28,081 --> 03:07:28,891
handler?
And she said,

3580
03:07:28,891 --> 03:07:31,110
well,
he's probably a charlatan and he's just

3581
03:07:31,111 --> 03:07:32,880
there trying to impress the crowd and to
show off.

3582
03:07:32,881 --> 03:07:35,730
And she was afraid to go up there
because she thought people would push

3583
03:07:35,731 --> 03:07:37,530
her towards the snake and she'd have to
touch it.

3584
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:40,140
And so there was a fear of the crowd
issue going on there too.

3585
03:07:40,141 --> 03:07:41,790
And I said,
well just look,

3586
03:07:42,030 --> 03:07:45,600
go up there,
but do it under these conditions is

3587
03:07:45,601 --> 03:07:46,434
that,
you know,

3588
03:07:46,670 --> 03:07:47,850
if,
if people get pushy,

3589
03:07:47,851 --> 03:07:50,310
what are you going to tell them?
And so we figured out something,

3590
03:07:50,311 --> 03:07:51,144
he said,
look,

3591
03:07:51,530 --> 03:07:55,920
just tell them that you know,
you want to look at the snake at your

3592
03:07:55,921 --> 03:07:58,290
own pace and that you don't need any
encouragement or help.

3593
03:07:58,291 --> 03:08:01,230
And it would be good if you were just
left alone.

3594
03:08:01,231 --> 03:08:04,680
So that enabled her to defend herself.
So she was afraid that the crowd would

3595
03:08:04,681 --> 03:08:07,200
push her to do something that she didn't
want to do.

3596
03:08:07,470 --> 03:08:09,870
That was part of the theme of the dream.
So anyways,

3597
03:08:09,871 --> 03:08:13,710
she eventually climbed the Dune in her
imagination and went into the crowd and

3598
03:08:13,711 --> 03:08:16,710
the crowd turned out to be quite
welcoming and not hostile and not pushy,

3599
03:08:17,010 --> 03:08:18,420
which isn't what you'd expect,
right?

3600
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:22,200
Because the,
you'd think the crowd would have reacted

3601
03:08:22,201 --> 03:08:24,870
in accordance with their fears since it
was her fantasy.

3602
03:08:25,140 --> 03:08:28,230
But that's the thing about fantasies.
They have this autonomous quality,

3603
03:08:28,710 --> 03:08:32,220
but the crowd was welcoming and not
hostile and it turned out that the snake

3604
03:08:32,221 --> 03:08:35,630
handler wasn't a charlatan.
He was just an old guy who had this

3605
03:08:35,631 --> 03:08:39,690
snake and he was out there just showing
it to people because he thought it was a

3606
03:08:39,691 --> 03:08:41,180
cool thing and,
and,

3607
03:08:41,410 --> 03:08:44,100
and that maybe it was good for people to
come and look at a snake.

3608
03:08:44,101 --> 03:08:46,890
And so she got close enough to the snake
to touch it.

3609
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,890
And so.
So I'm telling you that because I want

3610
03:08:49,891 --> 03:08:52,470
you to understand a bit more about what
union was trying to do.

3611
03:08:52,860 --> 03:08:57,860
And so he wrote these books,
notebooks that haven't been published

3612
03:08:58,291 --> 03:08:59,490
yet,
called the block books,

3613
03:09:00,210 --> 03:09:04,020
and the black books are the
documentation of his experiments with

3614
03:09:04,021 --> 03:09:08,670
his imagination
and what he would do is Adrian,

3615
03:09:08,850 --> 03:09:10,560
like,
like a child daydreams.

3616
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:13,350
He regained that faculty,
although I think with you.

3617
03:09:13,351 --> 03:09:18,270
And it was a faculty that has never
really disappeared and he had figures of

3618
03:09:18,271 --> 03:09:22,020
imagination that came to him that he
could speak with.

3619
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:26,760
And he spoke with these figures of
imagination and documented that over a

3620
03:09:26,761 --> 03:09:29,490
very long period of time.
And that was originally,

3621
03:09:29,580 --> 03:09:34,580
that was eventually
distilled into a book called the Red

3622
03:09:36,240 --> 03:09:38,130
Book,
which was published about three or four

3623
03:09:38,131 --> 03:09:41,550
years ago.
And it was a book that young regarded as

3624
03:09:41,551 --> 03:09:45,960
the
central source from which all his

3625
03:09:45,961 --> 03:09:50,961
inspiration emerged.
There was sort of the way it looks to me

3626
03:09:51,991 --> 03:09:54,280
is that we embody

3627
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:56,560
a lot of information in our action,
right?

3628
03:09:57,100 --> 03:10:01,960
And our action has developed as a
consequence of imitating other people.

3629
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:05,080
And not only the people or the people
around us,

3630
03:10:05,081 --> 03:10:07,780
but of course the people around us
imitated the people who came before

3631
03:10:07,781 --> 03:10:09,850
them.
And those people in mutated the people

3632
03:10:09,851 --> 03:10:14,500
who came before them and so on so far
back that it's as far back as you can

3633
03:10:14,501 --> 03:10:17,140
go,
and so you embody these patterns of

3634
03:10:17,141 --> 03:10:20,860
behavior that are extremely informative,
that you don't understand,

3635
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:24,100
that are a consequence of collective
imitation across the centuries and

3636
03:10:24,101 --> 03:10:27,550
throw.
Then those patterns can become manifest

3637
03:10:27,551 --> 03:10:32,551
as figures of the imagination and those
failures of imagination are the

3638
03:10:32,621 --> 03:10:37,621
distillations of patterns of behavior
and so as the distillations of patterns

3639
03:10:39,401 --> 03:10:42,430
of behavior,
they have content and it's not you that

3640
03:10:42,431 --> 03:10:44,770
content.
It's you could even think about it as

3641
03:10:44,771 --> 03:10:46,150
content that's evolved.

3642
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:50,140
Although it's culturally transmitted,
it's content that's evolved and so these

3643
03:10:50,141 --> 03:10:54,730
figures of the imagination can reveal
the structure of reality to you.

3644
03:10:55,480 --> 03:10:58,210
And that's what happened with young and
that's what he described in the red

3645
03:10:58,211 --> 03:11:00,490
book.
And that was what permeated his

3646
03:11:00,700 --> 03:11:03,130
psychology.
Psychology.

3647
03:11:03,131 --> 03:11:07,420
That was based on the presupposition
that the fundamental architectural

3648
03:11:07,421 --> 03:11:12,010
structures of religious belief.
We're not pathological,

3649
03:11:12,310 --> 03:11:16,750
not deceitful,
not protective in some delusional sense

3650
03:11:16,751 --> 03:11:19,690
against the fear of death,
but quite the contrary,

3651
03:11:20,170 --> 03:11:25,170
the very stories that enabled us to move
forward as confident human beings in the

3652
03:11:27,281 --> 03:11:31,510
face of chaos itself and it's
conceivable,

3653
03:11:31,570 --> 03:11:36,570
I think perhaps probable that nothing
more important conceptually happened in

3654
03:11:39,191 --> 03:11:44,191
the 20th century than that because it
was the first time post enlightenment

3655
03:11:46,600 --> 03:11:51,600
that Ab reproachment between the
intellect and the underlying religious

3656
03:11:51,941 --> 03:11:56,941
archetipal substructure occurred.
You have in the capacious intellect of

3657
03:11:57,461 --> 03:12:00,610
young and the same thing happened to
some degree with piaget.

3658
03:12:01,360 --> 03:12:06,360
The religious domain and the factual
domain were brought back together and

3659
03:12:06,790 --> 03:12:11,470
the fact of young's enduring and
increasing popularity and influence,

3660
03:12:11,471 --> 03:12:13,870
I would say is a direct consequence of
that.

3661
03:12:14,500 --> 03:12:15,333
Now.

3662
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:23,160
Some of his work was spun off into the
new age and and the new age is a very

3663
03:12:23,321 --> 03:12:27,640
optimistic and naive movement is
predicated on the idea that you can do

3664
03:12:27,641 --> 03:12:30,610
nothing say,
but follow your bliss and that will take

3665
03:12:30,611 --> 03:12:35,611
you ever hire to enlightenment.
And that's not the union idea at all.

3666
03:12:37,450 --> 03:12:42,450
The union idea is that what you most
need will be found where you least want

3667
03:12:43,001 --> 03:12:45,750
to look.
So there's this story.

3668
03:12:45,760 --> 03:12:47,620
King Arthur,
there's this story of King Arthur,

3669
03:12:47,621 --> 03:12:49,240
the.
They're all in a round table,

3670
03:12:49,241 --> 03:12:50,890
right?
King Arthur and his knights,

3671
03:12:50,910 --> 03:12:52,340
they're equals.
They're all

3672
03:12:52,480 --> 03:12:54,860
super ordinary,
but they're all equals and they go off

3673
03:12:54,861 --> 03:12:59,630
to look for the holy Grail,
for the holy grail is the container of

3674
03:12:59,631 --> 03:13:04,631
the redemptive substance,
whatever that is might be the cop of the

3675
03:13:05,571 --> 03:13:09,890
Christ used at the last supper,
might be jealous that was used to

3676
03:13:09,891 --> 03:13:13,430
capture his blood on the cross,
right when he was pierced by a sword.

3677
03:13:13,610 --> 03:13:16,310
The stories differ,
but that's the holy grail and the holy

3678
03:13:16,311 --> 03:13:18,920
grail is lost.
That's the redemptive substance and the

3679
03:13:18,921 --> 03:13:23,180
knights of King Arthur go off to search
for the holy grail and but they don't

3680
03:13:23,181 --> 03:13:26,300
know where to look.
So where do you look when you don't know

3681
03:13:26,301 --> 03:13:29,840
where to look for something you need
desperately,

3682
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:32,990
but I've lost.
Well,

3683
03:13:32,991 --> 03:13:36,560
each of the nights goes into the forest
at the point that looks darkest to him,

3684
03:13:37,970 --> 03:13:40,670
and that's union psychoanalysis in a
nutshell.

3685
03:13:41,510 --> 03:13:45,680
It's like that which you fear and avoid
that which you hold in contempt,

3686
03:13:45,681 --> 03:13:48,680
that which disgusts you and that you
avoid.

3687
03:13:49,160 --> 03:13:51,380
That's the gateway to what you need to
know.

3688
03:13:52,580 --> 03:13:55,400
There's nothing new agey about that.
That's for sure.

3689
03:13:57,350 --> 03:13:57,891
Now,
young,

3690
03:13:57,891 --> 03:14:01,160
when he started this endeavor,
he started with this.

3691
03:14:01,161 --> 03:14:03,200
This is part of the notebooks from the
black book.

3692
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:04,453
He said,

3693
03:14:06,430 --> 03:14:09,430
he wrote my soul,
my soul.

3694
03:14:09,670 --> 03:14:10,960
Where are you?
Do you hear me?

3695
03:14:10,961 --> 03:14:12,730
I speak.
I call you.

3696
03:14:13,210 --> 03:14:15,820
Are you there?
I've returned.

3697
03:14:16,870 --> 03:14:19,990
I'm here again.
I've shaken the dust of all the lands

3698
03:14:19,991 --> 03:14:23,290
from my feet and I've come to you.
I'm with you.

3699
03:14:24,130 --> 03:14:26,770
After long years of long wandering,
I have come to you again

3700
03:14:30,120 --> 03:14:33,870
for the unions.
The Hero's journey is a journey within

3701
03:14:34,400 --> 03:14:39,400
and I think that that's probably the
bias of introverts to believe that the

3702
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:43,380
hero's journey isn't only an inward
journey.

3703
03:14:43,470 --> 03:14:46,890
I think that it can be an outward
journey too because I don't think it

3704
03:14:46,891 --> 03:14:51,510
matters where you confront the unknown,
whether it's within or without.

3705
03:14:51,780 --> 03:14:54,690
What matters is whether or not you
confront the unknown.

3706
03:14:54,810 --> 03:14:55,830
That's what matters,

3707
03:15:01,710 --> 03:15:06,710
but he found that what he had ignored
was an undiscovered part of themselves,

3708
03:15:07,081 --> 03:15:12,000
so that might be something that was
equivalent to Huxley's notion that there

3709
03:15:12,001 --> 03:15:15,210
were tremendous.
There's tremendous potential breadth in

3710
03:15:15,211 --> 03:15:17,120
the realm of human conscious
experiences.

3711
03:15:17,370 --> 03:15:22,110
Huxley was influenced to some degree by
Yung now Yung knew of Huxley's

3712
03:15:22,111 --> 03:15:26,880
experiments and had commented on
psychedelic use and he said something

3713
03:15:26,940 --> 03:15:29,760
like,
beware of wisdom you did not earn.

3714
03:15:31,220 --> 03:15:34,560
And Don was very good.
It's at stating things very profoundly,

3715
03:15:34,561 --> 03:15:36,930
very simply,
and that's a very intelligent piece of

3716
03:15:36,931 --> 03:15:39,690
advice.
Beware of wisdom you did not earn.

3717
03:15:39,691 --> 03:15:43,350
He wrote a paper if you're interested in
this sort of thing.

3718
03:15:43,710 --> 03:15:47,850
He wrote a paper called the relations
between the ego and the unconscious,

3719
03:15:48,240 --> 03:15:52,000
which is an absolute work but completely
incomprehensible unless you know what

3720
03:15:52,001 --> 03:15:54,930
it,
unless you know what it's about and what

3721
03:15:54,931 --> 03:15:58,560
it's about is the danger of what he
called ego inflation.

3722
03:15:58,560 --> 03:16:01,560
And so one of the things that can happen
as a consequence of a revelatory

3723
03:16:01,561 --> 03:16:06,561
experience is that the division between
the individual ego and and the and what

3724
03:16:09,901 --> 03:16:12,780
would you call it?
So hard to come up with a word that

3725
03:16:12,781 --> 03:16:17,781
isn't somehow naive or or or cliched,
to erase the relationship,

3726
03:16:20,490 --> 03:16:24,660
the boundary between the specific
consciousness of the ego and the more

3727
03:16:24,661 --> 03:16:29,661
generalized consciousness and more
generalized consciousness as such is a

3728
03:16:31,681 --> 03:16:36,240
dangerous thing to do because you can
start to equate yourself,

3729
03:16:36,241 --> 03:16:41,160
your specific self with that more
generalized consciousness as such and

3730
03:16:41,190 --> 03:16:44,190
you thought about that,
is it something akin to a psychotic

3731
03:16:44,191 --> 03:16:49,191
inflation and the paper relations
between the ego and the unconscious is a

3732
03:16:50,131 --> 03:16:52,560
document that tells you how to avoid
that.

3733
03:16:53,130 --> 03:16:58,130
If you're
playing in this kind of realm and one of

3734
03:17:00,451 --> 03:17:03,900
the injunctions is to keep your feet on
the ground.

3735
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:09,360
He thought that was partly what happened
to Nisha was that Nisha wasn't grounded

3736
03:17:09,361 --> 03:17:12,180
enough in life.
He wasn't grounded enough in day to day

3737
03:17:12,181 --> 03:17:17,181
rituals and routines and the mundane.
Now you can debate whether or not that's

3738
03:17:17,250 --> 03:17:19,020
the case.
Whether or not that's a reasonable

3739
03:17:19,021 --> 03:17:21,570
argument,
but that was still what you unbelieved.

3740
03:17:23,070 --> 03:17:24,990
Okay,
so why am I telling you all this?

3741
03:17:27,400 --> 03:17:30,480
I'll finish with this from December 19,
13 onward.

3742
03:17:30,510 --> 03:17:32,340
Young carrier going in the same
procedure,

3743
03:17:32,760 --> 03:17:36,330
deliberately evoking a fantasy in a
waking state and then entering into it

3744
03:17:36,331 --> 03:17:39,060
as a drama.
These fantasies may be understood as a

3745
03:17:39,061 --> 03:17:41,580
type of dramatized thinking in pictorial
form.

3746
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:44,670
In retrospect,
he recalled that his scientific question

3747
03:17:44,671 --> 03:17:47,820
was to see what took place when he
switched off consciousness.

3748
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:52,680
The example of dreams indicated the
existence of background activity and he

3749
03:17:52,681 --> 03:17:56,220
wanted to give this a possibility of
emerging just as one does when taking

3750
03:17:56,221 --> 03:17:59,280
masculine.
These journals are contemporary

3751
03:17:59,281 --> 03:18:02,850
contemporaneous clinical ledger to his
most difficult experiment or what he

3752
03:18:02,851 --> 03:18:07,680
later describes as a voyage of discovery
to the other pole of the world.

3753
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:10,260
You don't believe that we were dreaming
all the time,

3754
03:18:11,250 --> 03:18:15,300
but that during waking life,
that pressure of external images was

3755
03:18:15,301 --> 03:18:20,301
such that the unconscious fantasy
imagery was or that the fantasy imagery

3756
03:18:22,201 --> 03:18:24,540
was of insufficient magnitude to be
conscious,

3757
03:18:24,541 --> 03:18:28,320
but that we were always situated in a
dream in relationship to the world.

3758
03:18:29,220 --> 03:18:32,160
If you're hungry,
it's not a deterministic drive.

3759
03:18:32,980 --> 03:18:37,080
It's a sub personality that has a goal
and that it has a bunch of action

3760
03:18:37,081 --> 03:18:39,660
patterns that are going to work in
reference to that goal.

3761
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:44,580
It has a bunch of perceptions that that
suit that goal and it organizes your

3762
03:18:44,581 --> 03:18:47,980
emotional responses around that goal.
And so to think about it as a

3763
03:18:47,981 --> 03:18:51,670
personality is a much.
It's a much more intelligent way to look

3764
03:18:51,671 --> 03:18:54,190
at it.
One of the thing about skinner's rats,

3765
03:18:54,191 --> 03:18:55,990
you know,
skinner could get rats to do almost

3766
03:18:55,991 --> 03:19:00,220
everything and he would reward them with
food and so he had a simple rat model,

3767
03:19:00,221 --> 03:19:03,730
but his rats were starved down to 75
percent of their normal body weight.

3768
03:19:04,570 --> 03:19:07,500
So not only were they not social
gregarious rats,

3769
03:19:07,670 --> 03:19:12,670
rats are because they were isolated.
They were genetically altered from wild

3770
03:19:12,671 --> 03:19:14,950
rats,
but they also weren't as complex as a

3771
03:19:14,951 --> 03:19:16,360
real route because they were starving.

3772
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:18,400
And so,
but you know,

3773
03:19:18,440 --> 03:19:20,740
starving rat is a pretty good model of a
rat.

3774
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:22,990
And a rat has a pretty good model of a
person,

3775
03:19:23,110 --> 03:19:26,620
but are a lot of our models have simple
behavioral learning were based on

3776
03:19:26,621 --> 03:19:30,070
starving isolated rats.
So anyways,

3777
03:19:31,990 --> 03:19:35,020
how to think about motivation will think
about it from the hypothalamic

3778
03:19:35,021 --> 03:19:36,820
perspective.
So we could say one thing that

3779
03:19:36,821 --> 03:19:41,290
motivation does is set goals and we
could say that emotions track progress

3780
03:19:41,291 --> 03:19:44,170
towards goals,
and I'm going to use that Schema even

3781
03:19:44,171 --> 03:19:45,970
though it's not exactly right.
So you say,

3782
03:19:45,971 --> 03:19:48,160
well,
motivation determines where you're going

3783
03:19:48,161 --> 03:19:49,360
to aim.
So if you're hungry,

3784
03:19:49,361 --> 03:19:53,110
you're going to aim at something to eat
and then that will organize your

3785
03:19:53,111 --> 03:19:56,500
perceptions so that you zero out
everything that isn't relevant to that

3786
03:19:56,501 --> 03:19:58,330
task,
which is almost everything.

3787
03:19:58,780 --> 03:20:02,020
You concentrate on those few things that
are going to facilitate your movement

3788
03:20:02,021 --> 03:20:02,800
forward.

3789
03:20:02,800 --> 03:20:05,560
When you encounter those things that
produces positive emotion,

3790
03:20:05,950 --> 03:20:09,610
as you move through the world towards
your goal and you see that things are

3791
03:20:09,611 --> 03:20:12,610
laying themselves out that facilitate
your movement forward,

3792
03:20:12,820 --> 03:20:16,540
those things caused positive emotion and
if you encounter anything that gets in

3793
03:20:16,541 --> 03:20:19,060
the way,
then that produces negative emotion and

3794
03:20:19,061 --> 03:20:22,630
it can be like threat because you're not
supposed to encounter something that

3795
03:20:22,631 --> 03:20:25,000
gets in the way.
It can be anger so that you move it

3796
03:20:25,001 --> 03:20:26,410
away.
It can be frustration,

3797
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:28,000
disappointment,
grief.

3798
03:20:28,180 --> 03:20:31,300
Those would,
if you had a response that serious to an

3799
03:20:31,301 --> 03:20:33,760
obstacle,
it would probably punish the little

3800
03:20:33,761 --> 03:20:36,150
motivated frame right out of existence,
you know,

3801
03:20:36,250 --> 03:20:40,670
so you walked downstairs and I dunno,
they're contracting company instead of

3802
03:20:40,690 --> 03:20:43,540
wrecking ball through your kitchen,
it's like that's going to be

3803
03:20:43,541 --> 03:20:45,670
disappointing.
You're not going to keep eating the

3804
03:20:45,671 --> 03:20:48,670
peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,
that little frame is going to get

3805
03:20:48,671 --> 03:20:52,630
punished out of existence and some new
goal is going to pop up and its stead

3806
03:20:53,110 --> 03:20:54,940
and you know,
one of the things we're going to try to

3807
03:20:54,941 --> 03:20:59,170
sort out is how do you decide when
you've encountered an obstacle that's so

3808
03:20:59,171 --> 03:21:02,440
big that you should just quit and go do
something else because that's not

3809
03:21:02,441 --> 03:21:04,050
obvious,
you know,

3810
03:21:04,051 --> 03:21:07,300
and you can,
you can get into counter productive

3811
03:21:07,301 --> 03:21:08,860
persistence pretty easily.

3812
03:21:08,920 --> 03:21:12,010
So we don't know how people solve that
problem and it's a really complicated

3813
03:21:12,011 --> 03:21:13,060
one.
So anyways,

3814
03:21:13,061 --> 03:21:18,040
we're gonna work on that scenario.
Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals

3815
03:21:18,041 --> 03:21:22,570
that are directly relevant to biological
survival that produces a frame of

3816
03:21:22,571 --> 03:21:24,670
reference.
So it's not a goal,

3817
03:21:24,740 --> 03:21:27,850
it's not a drive and it's not a
collection of behaviors.

3818
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:31,340
It's a little personality and the
personality has a viewpoint.

3819
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:35,140
It has thoughts that go along with it.
It has perceptions,

3820
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:37,300
it has action tendencies,
all of that.

3821
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:40,690
You can see this in addiction most
particularly,

3822
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:45,290
so one of the things that you find often
with people who are alcoholic is they

3823
03:21:45,291 --> 03:21:50,291
lie all the time and that's because when
they're built a little alcohol dependent

3824
03:21:51,171 --> 03:21:53,960
personality inside of themselves or a
big one might.

3825
03:21:53,961 --> 03:21:57,350
Maybe it's 90 percent of their
personality and one of that.

3826
03:21:57,500 --> 03:22:01,970
One of the things that component
consists of is all the rationalizations

3827
03:22:01,971 --> 03:22:05,720
that they've used over the years to
justify their addiction to themselves

3828
03:22:05,721 --> 03:22:06,650
and to other people.

3829
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:10,730
And so the addiction has a personality,
you know,

3830
03:22:10,731 --> 03:22:14,180
and so when the person is off or maybe
they're addicted to meth or something

3831
03:22:14,181 --> 03:22:16,070
like that,
where we know the addiction is more.

3832
03:22:17,910 --> 03:22:20,510
It's more short term powerful than I
would say,

3833
03:22:20,511 --> 03:22:23,960
than an alcohol addiction and they'll
say anything and the the,

3834
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:28,520
the words are just tools used to get
towards the goal and if they happened to

3835
03:22:28,521 --> 03:22:29,690
be deceptive,
whatever,

3836
03:22:29,691 --> 03:22:32,000
it doesn't matter.
They're just practical tools to get

3837
03:22:32,001 --> 03:22:34,850
towards the goal.
And then when you get towards the goal

3838
03:22:34,851 --> 03:22:36,920
and you take a nice shot of meth or
something like that,

3839
03:22:37,340 --> 03:22:41,420
you reinforce all those rationales that
you use to get the drug and then the

3840
03:22:41,421 --> 03:22:43,760
next time you're even a better deceiver
and liar.

3841
03:22:44,570 --> 03:22:47,120
So okay,
so we're going to say motivations one

3842
03:22:47,121 --> 03:22:50,060
way of thinking about as they set goals,
but it's not the right way of thinking

3843
03:22:50,061 --> 03:22:50,720
about it.

3844
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:53,030
They produce a whole framework of
interpretation.

3845
03:22:53,300 --> 03:22:56,360
And so we're going to think about that
framework of interpretation and then

3846
03:22:56,361 --> 03:22:59,840
emotions emerging side of that.
So that's it.

3847
03:22:59,900 --> 03:23:01,850
So the world is framed.
Motivations,

3848
03:23:01,851 --> 03:23:03,590
set goals.
You could say the world has to be

3849
03:23:03,591 --> 03:23:06,350
framed.
So motivation sets that frame,

3850
03:23:06,560 --> 03:23:07,760
cruise goals,
emotions,

3851
03:23:07,761 --> 03:23:10,640
perceptions and actions and inactions
track progress.

3852
03:23:10,641 --> 03:23:15,380
So positive emotion says you're moving
forward properly towards your goal.

3853
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:17,900
And if you encounter something you don't
expect,

3854
03:23:17,901 --> 03:23:20,030
you stop that anxiety.
It's like,

3855
03:23:20,090 --> 03:23:21,680
oh,
we're not where we thought we were.

3856
03:23:22,100 --> 03:23:25,280
And so we don't know what to do,
so we should stop because we don't know

3857
03:23:25,281 --> 03:23:26,390
where we are,
what we're doing.

3858
03:23:26,540 --> 03:23:30,920
Stop frozen.
And then the more powerful negative

3859
03:23:30,921 --> 03:23:33,530
emotions like pain they might make you
get out of there.

3860
03:23:34,190 --> 03:23:36,920
So motions forward,
stop,

3861
03:23:36,980 --> 03:23:39,710
reverse.
That's your emotions within that

3862
03:23:39,711 --> 03:23:41,690
motivated frame.
So,

3863
03:23:42,650 --> 03:23:45,680
and that's another example of how your
mind is embedded in your body.

3864
03:23:45,710 --> 03:23:49,700
Your emotions are in like their,
their offshoots of action tendencies.

3865
03:23:49,701 --> 03:23:51,260
That's,
that's the right way to think about it

3866
03:23:51,590 --> 03:23:53,630
because action has everything
fundamentally.

3867
03:23:55,460 --> 03:23:59,090
So what are some basic motivations are
most of these are regulated by the

3868
03:23:59,091 --> 03:24:00,140
Hypothalamus,
by the way,

3869
03:24:00,200 --> 03:24:02,870
that that tells you just how important
to control system it is.

3870
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:05,840
The other thing that's useful to know
about the hypothalamus is that it has

3871
03:24:05,841 --> 03:24:09,890
projections going up from it that are
like tree trunks and inhibitory

3872
03:24:10,730 --> 03:24:13,460
projections coming down there.
They're like grape vines.

3873
03:24:14,060 --> 03:24:17,210
So you can kind of control your
hypothalamus as long as it's not on too

3874
03:24:17,211 --> 03:24:20,270
much,
but if it's on in any serious way,

3875
03:24:20,390 --> 03:24:22,370
it's like it.
It winds.

3876
03:24:22,970 --> 03:24:27,860
So partly what you do to stop yourself
from falling under the dominion of your

3877
03:24:27,861 --> 03:24:31,250
hypothalamus is to never,
ever be anywhere where it's action is

3878
03:24:31,251 --> 03:24:33,110
necessary.
Right?

3879
03:24:33,140 --> 03:24:37,250
You don't want to go into a biker bar
because you might find yourself in a

3880
03:24:37,251 --> 03:24:38,600
situation where panicked.

3881
03:24:38,600 --> 03:24:41,240
Defensive aggression is immediately
necessary.

3882
03:24:41,510 --> 03:24:44,220
You probably don't want that.
You don't want to panic.

3883
03:24:44,221 --> 03:24:47,280
You don't want the terror.
You don't want the frenzied fight.

3884
03:24:47,310 --> 03:24:49,530
You don't want any of that.
You don't want to have to run away in

3885
03:24:49,531 --> 03:24:51,990
absolute panic,
so you just don't go there.

3886
03:24:52,590 --> 03:24:56,190
And then a huge,
a huge part of how we regulate our

3887
03:24:56,191 --> 03:25:00,900
emotions is just by never going anywhere
where we have to experience them and so

3888
03:25:00,901 --> 03:25:04,470
that has very little to do with internal
inhibitory control and everything to do

3889
03:25:04,471 --> 03:25:09,390
with staying where you belong.
So okay,

3890
03:25:10,230 --> 03:25:12,120
so basic motivations,
hunger,

3891
03:25:12,121 --> 03:25:13,020
thirst,
pain,

3892
03:25:13,110 --> 03:25:15,150
pain is not regulated by the
hypothalamus.

3893
03:25:15,151 --> 03:25:17,700
That's a different circuit.
Anger slash aggression,

3894
03:25:17,720 --> 03:25:20,640
thermo regulation,
panic and escape,

3895
03:25:21,390 --> 03:25:23,550
affiliation and care,
sexual desire,

3896
03:25:23,551 --> 03:25:27,000
exploration play,
and you can kind of break those in.

3897
03:25:27,390 --> 03:25:32,390
You can kind of break those into the
classic Darwinian categories to and say,

3898
03:25:32,911 --> 03:25:34,500
well,
there's a set of motivations that go

3899
03:25:34,501 --> 03:25:37,380
along with self maintenance.
That'd be your survival,

3900
03:25:37,710 --> 03:25:39,540
ingestive and defensive.
See,

3901
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:44,560
I've sort of coded them there.
So the self maintenance,

3902
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:49,930
there's an adjustive set of basic
motivations that go with self

3903
03:25:49,931 --> 03:25:51,170
maintenance.
You'd say that's hunger,

3904
03:25:51,171 --> 03:25:54,260
thirst.
There's a set of defensive motivations,

3905
03:25:54,320 --> 03:25:55,140
pain,
anger,

3906
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:58,430
thermoregulation paddock and escape.
And then there's,

3907
03:25:58,650 --> 03:26:01,190
there's motivations that are associated
with reproduction,

3908
03:26:01,470 --> 03:26:06,470
affiliation care and sexual desire.
And then I put exploration in place sort

3909
03:26:06,651 --> 03:26:08,170
of outside of that.
Uh,

3910
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:13,550
I would say because those two things
serve both of these approximately

3911
03:26:13,551 --> 03:26:14,384
equally,

3912
03:26:17,810 --> 03:26:22,810
I think the postmodern objection to
meaning is actually wrong.

3913
03:26:23,151 --> 03:26:26,150
While we talked about this earlier,
I do believe that there's a transcendent

3914
03:26:26,151 --> 03:26:29,630
ethic and I do believe that it touches
on the metaphysical.

3915
03:26:29,690 --> 03:26:33,470
I believe it people experienced that
because people are perfectly capable of

3916
03:26:33,471 --> 03:26:38,471
having unalterably profound religious
experiences and the naturalistic

3917
03:26:38,841 --> 03:26:40,700
materialists don't know what the hell to
do with that.

3918
03:26:40,760 --> 03:26:43,220
They have no idea what to do with that.
Say,

3919
03:26:43,221 --> 03:26:44,180
well,
it's delusional.

3920
03:26:44,240 --> 03:26:44,721
It's like,
well,

3921
03:26:44,721 --> 03:26:47,570
hang on a sec.
People who have those experiences appear

3922
03:26:47,571 --> 03:26:51,680
to be more successful and healthier.
So when exactly in what manner is that

3923
03:26:51,681 --> 03:26:54,110
delusion,
and if you induce it in the lab with

3924
03:26:54,111 --> 03:26:55,400
Psilocybin,
for example,

3925
03:26:55,580 --> 03:26:59,210
among people who are dying of cancer,
their fear of death goes away.

3926
03:26:59,530 --> 03:27:02,660
It's like that's you're going to just
lay of the lay that out there as

3927
03:27:02,661 --> 03:27:06,440
delusional or yo the quit smoking,
85 percent success rate with one

3928
03:27:06,441 --> 03:27:10,750
mystical experience on suicide,
but produces 85 percent cessation rate

3929
03:27:10,751 --> 03:27:15,260
and smoking completely and with a Mtma
ecstasy.

3930
03:27:15,830 --> 03:27:19,190
The three treatments with Mtma,
that's what the current research

3931
03:27:19,191 --> 03:27:24,191
indicates,
produces a 72 percent cure rate for

3932
03:27:24,381 --> 03:27:26,420
intractable posttraumatic stress
disorder.

3933
03:27:26,630 --> 03:27:29,090
It's like those are miracle cures and no
one,

3934
03:27:29,150 --> 03:27:31,460
and they have to be accompanied by the
mystical experience.

3935
03:27:31,461 --> 03:27:35,280
No one knows how to counsel them.
And so there is a transcender yeah.

3936
03:27:35,540 --> 03:27:39,680
So it's a very physical thing.
I mean in the case or any of these

3937
03:27:39,681 --> 03:27:40,550
things,
right?

3938
03:27:41,440 --> 03:27:41,980
You're eating

3939
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:43,620
something,
you're ingesting saying smoking it,

3940
03:27:43,630 --> 03:27:45,610
whatever it is,
it's physical,

3941
03:27:45,611 --> 03:27:48,450
it's here and now.
But the experience is metaphysical is

3942
03:27:48,460 --> 03:27:49,150
metaphor.
Sure.

3943
03:27:49,150 --> 03:27:52,660
That's a place where the biological and
the transcendent touch and we don't know

3944
03:27:52,661 --> 03:27:53,790
what to make of that.
Well,

3945
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:58,390
that's why psychedelics through our
culture into such a such a flip this

3946
03:27:58,391 --> 03:28:00,490
upside down,
no one knew what to do with them.

3947
03:28:01,050 --> 03:28:02,910
No,
I mean the Indians retarded psilocybin

3948
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:06,580
as food of the gods for a reason,
and when people have encountered

3949
03:28:06,581 --> 03:28:09,070
psychedelic substances throughout human
history,

3950
03:28:09,370 --> 03:28:11,450
that's always how they've been
characterized.

3951
03:28:11,590 --> 03:28:12,760
Right.
Food of the gods.

3952
03:28:12,820 --> 03:28:16,390
It's like be aware of them,
but there they opened the door to the

3953
03:28:16,391 --> 03:28:21,391
transcendent and well,
I think the evidence that they are doing

3954
03:28:21,971 --> 03:28:25,360
something that's psychedelic substances
are doing something that we seriously

3955
03:28:25,361 --> 03:28:28,960
don't understand at all.
Not a bit is overwhelming.

3956
03:28:29,110 --> 03:28:33,610
Rick strassman wrote a book on his
experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch

3957
03:28:33,611 --> 03:28:34,444
of people down in.

3958
03:28:34,600 --> 03:28:37,210
He was at in Austin.
I think it's stress.

3959
03:28:37,240 --> 03:28:40,260
One's a pretty straight scientists,
you know,

3960
03:28:40,270 --> 03:28:43,210
he was interested in measuring
psychophysiological responses to the

3961
03:28:43,211 --> 03:28:45,700
drugs.
He gives people dmt and they all came

3962
03:28:45,701 --> 03:28:48,970
back with the same story.
I was blasted out of my consciousness.

3963
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:52,210
I went,
I met a whole bunch of alien beings.

3964
03:28:52,510 --> 03:28:55,960
They were really surprised.
I was there and then I came back and it

3965
03:28:55,961 --> 03:28:58,120
was the most real thing that's ever
happened to me,

3966
03:28:58,330 --> 03:28:59,590
and straussman would say,
well,

3967
03:28:59,591 --> 03:29:01,320
you know,
you had a union architectural

3968
03:29:01,330 --> 03:29:03,580
experience,
or it was a dream and they'd say,

3969
03:29:03,910 --> 03:29:08,890
you don't understand,
and he got so distraught because of

3970
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:11,800
these continual reports that he had
stopped doing the research.

3971
03:29:11,801 --> 03:29:14,440
Yeah.
I'm not making a claim for him for

3972
03:29:14,441 --> 03:29:17,380
anything metaphysical here,
but I'm definitely pointing out that

3973
03:29:17,381 --> 03:29:22,381
there are undeniable realms of human
experience that involve religious

3974
03:29:24,970 --> 03:29:29,970
experience and a sense of the infinite
transcendent that looked like they're

3975
03:29:30,971 --> 03:29:33,670
healthy and that you cannot deny.

3976
03:29:44,380 --> 03:29:48,050
So you see on the left hand side there
you see horace,

3977
03:29:48,140 --> 03:29:51,040
who is the bird headed god of Egypt,
who I told you about,

3978
03:29:51,041 --> 03:29:53,470
who represents the capacity to pay
attention.

3979
03:29:53,830 --> 03:29:58,150
Very important concept because the
Egyptians realized in really it's

3980
03:29:58,151 --> 03:30:00,130
brilliant.
There's something modern people do not

3981
03:30:00,131 --> 03:30:03,520
understand because we tend to make
rationality the highest God.

3982
03:30:04,030 --> 03:30:07,570
That's not a good thing.
That's a pathway to totalitarianism.

3983
03:30:07,810 --> 03:30:11,380
What the Egyptians knew,
but they only knew it in symbolic form

3984
03:30:11,590 --> 03:30:15,790
was it was the capacity to attend to
things that in some sense was the

3985
03:30:15,791 --> 03:30:19,480
highest psychological function because
it's the capacity to pay attention that

3986
03:30:19,481 --> 03:30:24,481
actually moves you beyond what you only
know and rationality tends to make you

3987
03:30:24,611 --> 03:30:26,650
know,
integral systems that are coherent,

3988
03:30:26,920 --> 03:30:30,280
that are box like and then claim that
they're absolutely right.

3989
03:30:30,281 --> 03:30:34,990
Whereas attention is always looking
beyond what you know and and attention

3990
03:30:34,991 --> 03:30:37,960
is an unbelievably powerful force.
You know,

3991
03:30:38,440 --> 03:30:40,010
that's why advertisers pay for

3992
03:30:40,010 --> 03:30:41,900
it.
That's why people demand it.

3993
03:30:42,110 --> 03:30:43,790
That's why children can't live without
it.

3994
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:46,460
That's why it's what you want from your
friends and your family.

3995
03:30:46,670 --> 03:30:50,780
You want them to pay attention to you.
It's an unbelievably valuable resource.

3996
03:30:51,110 --> 03:30:53,630
And so one of the things I always tell
my clients,

3997
03:30:53,631 --> 03:30:55,430
for example,
if they're socially anxious,

3998
03:30:55,431 --> 03:30:56,264
I say,
look,

3999
03:30:57,740 --> 03:31:00,170
pay more attention to the person you're
talking to.

4000
03:31:00,590 --> 03:31:03,260
If you pay,
if you really pay close attention to

4001
03:31:03,261 --> 03:31:06,530
them than the thoughts that are making
you anxious will be suppressed.

4002
03:31:06,740 --> 03:31:08,810
And because you're paying close
attention to them,

4003
03:31:09,020 --> 03:31:12,950
you'll match your movements to theirs
and you'll match your conversation to

4004
03:31:12,951 --> 03:31:16,070
them and then there's no reason for you
to be socially anxious because socially

4005
03:31:16,071 --> 03:31:18,110
anxious people will go like this when
they're talking,

4006
03:31:18,320 --> 03:31:19,490
you know,
they don't want to look at you.

4007
03:31:19,820 --> 03:31:22,460
Of course,
how the hell can you engage anyone if

4008
03:31:22,700 --> 03:31:24,890
you're not in a little dance with them,
you know,

4009
03:31:24,891 --> 03:31:26,920
you can't.
And a lot of it's nonverbal,

4010
03:31:26,960 --> 03:31:30,620
it's physical and it's embodied and
without paying attention.

4011
03:31:30,890 --> 03:31:34,190
Then you lose people and you see this
with speakers all the time.

4012
03:31:34,191 --> 03:31:37,190
Cue there in front of audiences.
They have their paper and they're going

4013
03:31:37,191 --> 03:31:39,740
like this.
And usually they're talking like this

4014
03:31:39,741 --> 03:31:40,660
too.
And you know,

4015
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:42,830
the logical thing to do in that case is
like,

4016
03:31:42,831 --> 03:31:46,220
look at facebook or get the hell out of
there something.

4017
03:31:46,580 --> 03:31:48,950
But they're not paying attention to the
audience.

4018
03:31:49,130 --> 03:31:52,610
And so there's no power in the.
There's no power in the dynamic

4019
03:31:52,611 --> 03:31:53,870
conversation at all.

4020
03:31:55,120 --> 03:32:00,120
One of the experiences that I had
when I was a 1985 or thereabouts when I

4021
03:32:03,251 --> 03:32:08,251
was working on the first draft of my
book maps of meaning where I was

4022
03:32:08,531 --> 03:32:13,531
outlining this idea that the path of the
hero who voluntarily confronts

4023
03:32:14,260 --> 03:32:17,770
uncertainty and stands on the border
between chaos and order,

4024
03:32:17,980 --> 03:32:20,410
the appropriate target for human
development.

4025
03:32:20,411 --> 03:32:23,020
It's,
it's an alternative to the chaos of

4026
03:32:23,021 --> 03:32:26,530
nihilism and totalitarianism of rigid
belief.

4027
03:32:26,560 --> 03:32:28,210
Yes.
So,

4028
03:32:28,300 --> 03:32:31,600
and that's the bearing of responsibility
for being.

4029
03:32:31,930 --> 03:32:35,260
I was working all of that out.
It's actually announced it to the post

4030
03:32:35,261 --> 03:32:37,570
modern conundrum as far as I can tell as
well.

4031
03:32:37,571 --> 03:32:39,640
But,
but anyways,

4032
03:32:40,510 --> 03:32:43,120
at the same time I was making this
sculpture,

4033
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:45,850
which is about a foot thick.
It's made out of layers of,

4034
03:32:46,480 --> 03:32:50,440
of what's called foam core,
which is styrofoam press between two

4035
03:32:50,441 --> 03:32:52,720
pieces of paper.
That's about a quarter of an inch thick.

4036
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:55,420
And so often used for backing on,
on,

4037
03:32:55,480 --> 03:32:57,100
uh,
on prints and so on.

4038
03:32:57,101 --> 03:32:59,830
If you get them framed,
I made this,

4039
03:33:00,220 --> 03:33:04,780
this piece that I called the meaning of
music and it's a Mandela.

4040
03:33:04,810 --> 03:33:08,380
So it's a circle inscribed inside of the
square.

4041
03:33:08,630 --> 03:33:12,460
Although I tried to make it
multidimensional in a complex way that I

4042
03:33:12,461 --> 03:33:17,200
can't really describe at the moment,
but what I was trying to do and I broke

4043
03:33:17,201 --> 03:33:21,070
it into pieces of what I was trying to
do was to produce a visual,

4044
03:33:22,230 --> 03:33:27,230
a object that flickered and changed when
you looked at it because it was too

4045
03:33:28,751 --> 03:33:30,740
complex to process visually.
You know,

4046
03:33:30,741 --> 03:33:33,140
like a necker cube.
That's one of those cubes that reversed

4047
03:33:33,141 --> 03:33:34,980
is when you look at it.
Yeah.

4048
03:33:35,230 --> 03:33:38,310
Well this is like a necker cube on
steroids

4049
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:43,320
because music of course it stays the
same across time,

4050
03:33:43,321 --> 03:33:48,270
but also transform across time and it's
full of layered patterns,

4051
03:33:48,271 --> 03:33:51,510
you know,
and the patterns interact harmoniously

4052
03:33:51,511 --> 03:33:54,540
with one another.
And it had appeared and I was fascinated

4053
03:33:54,541 --> 03:33:58,560
by music because it gives people the
direct intimation of meaning.

4054
03:33:58,860 --> 03:34:03,660
Even if they're nihilistic punk rockers,
they still can't criticize the

4055
03:34:03,661 --> 03:34:06,930
experience of meaning that they,
that they,

4056
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:11,150
that they engage in when they're
listening to their favorite band and it

4057
03:34:11,250 --> 03:34:15,510
helps them transcend the denialism of
rationality.

4058
03:34:16,060 --> 03:34:21,030
And if you can't argue with it,
it's like arguing with dance beyond

4059
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:23,790
argument.
And so I was making this,

4060
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:27,750
this sculpture,
and I spent like four months on it.

4061
03:34:27,751 --> 03:34:32,751
I was thinking about it a lot and I got
it mostly assembled and then I was in my

4062
03:34:33,391 --> 03:34:38,391
living room in Montreal and I was
listening to Mozart Symphony,

4063
03:34:38,881 --> 03:34:41,430
the Jupiter symphony,
and I was really listening to it and

4064
03:34:41,431 --> 03:34:46,431
it's one of these complex Lee multilevel
pattern pattern pieces of auditory

4065
03:34:48,451 --> 03:34:53,451
sculpture that I believe represents
being because what being is is multiple

4066
03:34:53,941 --> 03:34:58,941
levels of patterned transformation
interact and simultaneously and music is

4067
03:35:00,511 --> 03:35:03,300
a representation of that,
which is why people find a meaningful.

4068
03:35:03,330 --> 03:35:05,790
Anyways.
I was listening intently to this

4069
03:35:06,630 --> 03:35:11,040
symphony and at the same time I was
concentrating on the sculpture that I

4070
03:35:11,041 --> 03:35:12,720
have made.
All of a sudden,

4071
03:35:13,860 --> 03:35:16,530
everything I'm about to say is a
metaphor because.

4072
03:35:17,550 --> 03:35:20,460
Because there's no way of encapsulating
it properly in words,

4073
03:35:20,461 --> 03:35:22,980
but it was as if the heavens opened up
above.

4074
03:35:23,500 --> 03:35:25,500
I mean I was still in my living room,
but yes,

4075
03:35:25,860 --> 03:35:29,790
it reminds me.
Experience is best represented by one of

4076
03:35:29,791 --> 03:35:34,791
those early renaissance paintings where
you see God or Christ up in the sky with

4077
03:35:36,241 --> 03:35:40,050
an opening in the sky against the clouds
and against the sun,

4078
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:44,700
so it was like that even though I didn't
really see that,

4079
03:35:44,730 --> 03:35:48,300
but it felt like that and there was some
visuals that were associated with it and

4080
03:35:48,301 --> 03:35:53,301
I felt something descend upon me that it
had a personal nature,

4081
03:35:53,580 --> 03:35:55,860
you know,
something like what you were describing

4082
03:35:55,861 --> 03:36:00,861
as a higher consciousness that was
actually a being of a sort and it failed

4083
03:36:02,371 --> 03:36:07,371
me from the inside out and I had the and
it was.

4084
03:36:08,220 --> 03:36:10,470
It was enrapturing,
let's say,

4085
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:15,780
and it was an incredible feeling.
It was a divine feeling,

4086
03:36:15,781 --> 03:36:17,840
I suppose is the right way of thinking
about it.

4087
03:36:17,910 --> 03:36:19,470
Certainly a religious experience.

4088
03:36:21,780 --> 03:36:26,780
I was an it transform me and turned me
into something far more than I than I

4089
03:36:27,810 --> 03:36:32,370
normally was and maybe you can take them
out that as an intimation of what you

4090
03:36:32,371 --> 03:36:35,040
could become if you worked on it for the
rest of your life.

4091
03:36:35,230 --> 03:36:39,700
Sometimes I think hallucinogens
providing people with an image of who

4092
03:36:39,701 --> 03:36:41,540
they could be a shared goal,
them,

4093
03:36:41,550 --> 03:36:42,940
they're dead wood,
right.

4094
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:46,540
Anyways,
it was as if an offer is being made to

4095
03:36:46,541 --> 03:36:49,930
me that I could be like that from now on
permanently.

4096
03:36:52,900 --> 03:36:54,370
Well,
I don't know how to do that.

4097
03:36:54,371 --> 03:36:57,100
I couldn't walk down the street in this
condition,

4098
03:36:57,101 --> 03:36:59,650
in this elevated condition.

4099
03:37:00,330 --> 03:37:02,600
I wouldn't belong in the world anymore.
I,

4100
03:37:02,930 --> 03:37:06,150
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't know how to function.

4101
03:37:06,470 --> 03:37:11,470
I don't know how I could do it and stole
the experience.

4102
03:37:12,780 --> 03:37:17,780
This thing say that was communicating
with me was accepted that as an answer,

4103
03:37:19,771 --> 03:37:24,120
although I would say with some sort of
it.

4104
03:37:24,570 --> 03:37:29,280
And then I went and talked to my waist
and I told her what had happened and I

4105
03:37:29,281 --> 03:37:34,281
was shaking a lot and like a tremendous
amount and my pupils were completely

4106
03:37:35,911 --> 03:37:37,380
dilated.
Wow.

4107
03:37:37,950 --> 03:37:39,960
Yeah.
And that happened to me one other time

4108
03:37:40,400 --> 03:37:42,630
in a similar manner,
although it's more like an echo.

4109
03:37:42,631 --> 03:37:45,740
It wasn't quite as intense,
but you know,

4110
03:37:45,760 --> 03:37:49,980
I was concentrating very much on trying
to understand the meaning,

4111
03:37:50,310 --> 03:37:54,990
the central meaning of music and of
course this phenomena of meaning itself

4112
03:37:54,991 --> 03:37:59,130
and it seemed like the combination of
that intense concentration and the

4113
03:37:59,131 --> 03:38:03,570
visual stimulation and the music all
culminated to produce this

4114
03:38:03,571 --> 03:38:05,700
transformation of consciousness.
But that was,

4115
03:38:06,090 --> 03:38:07,230
that was its nature.

4116
03:38:11,040 --> 03:38:13,560
I haven't either.
Miscarry mushrooms are often buy,

4117
03:38:13,970 --> 03:38:15,630
buy mushrooms,
like silicide,

4118
03:38:15,631 --> 03:38:19,830
but yes,
those substances are to call them

4119
03:38:19,831 --> 03:38:22,500
strange is barely to scrape the surface.

4120
03:38:22,560 --> 03:38:24,660
Have you,
have you taken psychedelics?

4121
03:38:25,170 --> 03:38:26,060
Yes,
I have.

4122
03:38:27,170 --> 03:38:28,390
Um,
and yeah,

4123
03:38:28,391 --> 03:38:30,630
so it sounds like it because.
Exactly,

4124
03:38:31,450 --> 03:38:32,520
yes.
You're right there.

4125
03:38:32,521 --> 03:38:33,354
It's such a,
it's an,

4126
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:35,730
it's this straight.
It's the strangest of things.

4127
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:38,660
And,
and when it comes to identity in the

4128
03:38:38,661 --> 03:38:43,220
psychedelics affect on human identity,
uh,

4129
03:38:43,540 --> 03:38:48,540
it does create an experience that is
transcendent to the very temporary human

4130
03:38:52,651 --> 03:38:54,180
form that we're currently within.

4131
03:38:54,900 --> 03:38:55,351
Yes.
Well,

4132
03:38:55,351 --> 03:38:57,810
there's a psychiatrist named Rick
Strassman.

4133
03:38:57,990 --> 03:39:00,960
Yes.
Was at the University of Texas and he

4134
03:39:00,961 --> 03:39:04,440
had been giving his experimental
subjects.

4135
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:08,160
He's one of two groups that have got
permission to start experimenting with

4136
03:39:08,161 --> 03:39:09,210
psychedelics.
Again,

4137
03:39:09,211 --> 03:39:13,830
the other one was a group at Johns
Hopkins who have been recording,

4138
03:39:14,160 --> 03:39:18,240
um,
the consequences of giving experimental

4139
03:39:18,241 --> 03:39:20,970
subjects a suicide than yes,
in a,

4140
03:39:21,020 --> 03:39:25,200
in its chemical form they report,
they've reported,

4141
03:39:25,310 --> 03:39:28,890
um,
permanent personality transformations on

4142
03:39:28,891 --> 03:39:31,980
the part of their,
of the people who took the psilocybin

4143
03:39:31,981 --> 03:39:36,230
mushrooms who had a experience.
And so what's happened to them apart

4144
03:39:36,231 --> 03:39:41,231
from the fact that they regarded the
experience as one of the top two or

4145
03:39:41,631 --> 03:39:45,080
three experiences of their life in terms
of transformation,

4146
03:39:45,680 --> 03:39:48,800
is that when you give them personality
tests a year later,

4147
03:39:48,830 --> 03:39:52,970
these are five factor personality tests
and they test extroversion,

4148
03:39:52,971 --> 03:39:54,350
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

4149
03:39:54,351 --> 03:39:58,610
conscientiousness and openness and
openness is a creativity dimension,

4150
03:39:59,210 --> 03:40:01,760
an aesthetic experience,
creativity,

4151
03:40:01,761 --> 03:40:06,761
dimension,
and their scores on openness increased

4152
03:40:07,161 --> 03:40:12,080
substantially approximately the
equivalent from the 50th percentile to

4153
03:40:12,081 --> 03:40:15,800
the 85th percentile,
which is one standard deviation.

4154
03:40:16,170 --> 03:40:20,840
They increase and stay that way up to
one year later.

4155
03:40:21,230 --> 03:40:22,520
So these,
these,

4156
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:26,780
these chemicals,
these strange chemicals produced very

4157
03:40:26,781 --> 03:40:31,370
long lasting effects on people's
perception and they do produce

4158
03:40:31,460 --> 03:40:33,560
intimations of mystical experience.
Now,

4159
03:40:33,780 --> 03:40:37,400
strassman actually got scared away from
his DMT research.

4160
03:40:37,700 --> 03:40:38,930
Um,
he was a pretty,

4161
03:40:39,050 --> 03:40:42,500
I would say,
conservative scientist and was

4162
03:40:43,310 --> 03:40:47,630
administering dmt intravenously because
it has a very short half life if you

4163
03:40:47,631 --> 03:40:52,100
take it any other way.
It only lasts about 10 minutes and his

4164
03:40:52,370 --> 03:40:57,370
people every and who were very carefully
screened to begin with for sanity and so

4165
03:40:57,741 --> 03:40:59,870
forth.
Although they have some experience with

4166
03:40:59,871 --> 03:41:03,870
psychedelic drugs because they didn't
want to introduce naive people to,

4167
03:41:03,970 --> 03:41:07,880
to anything like that.
They all reported being shot out of

4168
03:41:07,881 --> 03:41:10,360
their body and encountering alien
beings,

4169
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:13,700
all of them.
And they,

4170
03:41:13,820 --> 03:41:16,220
you know,
when straussman attempted to explain

4171
03:41:16,221 --> 03:41:17,870
that away as a,
well,

4172
03:41:17,871 --> 03:41:19,400
let's call it a hallucination.

4173
03:41:19,430 --> 03:41:22,820
Although technically if you're
hallucinating,

4174
03:41:22,821 --> 03:41:25,490
you know that you're hallucinating and
you know what's real.

4175
03:41:25,491 --> 03:41:28,250
So these were far deeper than
hallucination,

4176
03:41:28,251 --> 03:41:31,770
right?
Or that they were something like young

4177
03:41:31,771 --> 03:41:36,771
Ian Archetypes,
but his subjects insisted that including

4178
03:41:38,361 --> 03:41:42,950
people who knew quite a bit about
archetipal psychology insisted that that

4179
03:41:42,951 --> 03:41:45,980
was not correct,
that they were in fact shot out of their

4180
03:41:45,981 --> 03:41:50,981
bodies into other spaces and dimensions
and that they encountered beings of all

4181
03:41:51,351 --> 03:41:55,130
sorts of different types.
Some of whom were surprised to see them.

4182
03:41:55,131 --> 03:41:58,580
Some of whom were happy they were there,
some of whom engaged them in

4183
03:41:58,581 --> 03:42:00,080
conversation.
Um,

4184
03:42:01,590 --> 03:42:05,160
I mean it makes very strange reading it
and it,

4185
03:42:05,240 --> 03:42:08,060
it.
There's no straightforward may way of

4186
03:42:08,061 --> 03:42:12,230
making sense of it and there's no
straightforward way of making sense of

4187
03:42:12,231 --> 03:42:15,060
the shamanic experiences to Eliana
thought that,

4188
03:42:15,860 --> 03:42:19,840
that those,
those rituals have been if,

4189
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:23,630
if they were induced by drugs,
that that was a corrupt form of the

4190
03:42:23,631 --> 03:42:27,230
original ritual,
but I think later scholarship is

4191
03:42:27,231 --> 03:42:31,320
indicated that that's profoundly wrong
and that's the basis of these

4192
03:42:31,500 --> 03:42:36,500
experiences is in fact hallucinogenic
experience of the sort say that the

4193
03:42:37,411 --> 03:42:40,380
aztecs induced with siliciden mushrooms
or masculine.

4194
03:42:42,170 --> 03:42:44,210
The first thing I'll do is tell you a
story about

4195
03:42:45,890 --> 03:42:50,060
female neurologist whose name escapes me
at the moment.

4196
03:42:50,061 --> 03:42:51,920
She wrote a book called my stroke of
insight.

4197
03:42:52,850 --> 03:42:57,440
Jill bolty I think is her name and she
was a harvard trained.

4198
03:42:58,870 --> 03:43:00,080
She was,
she had,

4199
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:04,610
she had medical training from Harvard in
neuropsychological function and knew a

4200
03:43:04,611 --> 03:43:08,300
lot about hemispheric specialization.
We talked a little bit about hemispheric

4201
03:43:08,301 --> 03:43:13,301
specialization before and one of the
ways of conceptualizing the difference

4202
03:43:13,341 --> 03:43:16,670
between the two hemispheres is that the
left hemisphere operates in known

4203
03:43:16,671 --> 03:43:19,430
territory and the right hemisphere
operates in unknown territory.

4204
03:43:19,730 --> 03:43:23,780
That's one way of thinking about or the
left hemisphere operates in the orderly

4205
03:43:23,781 --> 03:43:24,950
domain.
In the right hemisphere,

4206
03:43:24,951 --> 03:43:29,660
operates in the chaotic domain or the
left hemisphere operates in the domain

4207
03:43:29,661 --> 03:43:32,450
of detail,
and the right hemisphere operates in the

4208
03:43:32,750 --> 03:43:35,960
domain of the large picture.
It's something like that.

4209
03:43:36,200 --> 03:43:38,450
Now people differ in their neurological
wiring,

4210
03:43:38,451 --> 03:43:41,990
so those are over generalizations,
but that's okay.

4211
03:43:41,991 --> 03:43:43,670
We're.
We'll live with that for the time being.

4212
03:43:43,850 --> 03:43:47,030
It's certainly not an overgeneralization
to point out that you do in fact have

4213
03:43:47,031 --> 03:43:50,420
two hemispheres and that their
structures differ and if the connections

4214
03:43:50,421 --> 03:43:52,010
between the market,
which could happen,

4215
03:43:52,011 --> 03:43:53,960
for example,
if you had surgery for intractable

4216
03:43:53,961 --> 03:43:56,360
epilepsy,
that each hemisphere would be capable of

4217
03:43:56,361 --> 03:44:01,361
housing its own consciousness that's
been well documented by a neuro neuro

4218
03:44:01,850 --> 03:44:06,850
neurologist named Monica who did and
Sperry who did split brain experiments

4219
03:44:07,880 --> 03:44:10,730
must be 30 years ago now.
So,

4220
03:44:11,860 --> 03:44:15,170
and we know that the right and the left
hemisphere are specialized for different

4221
03:44:15,171 --> 03:44:16,280
functions.
The Right Hemisphere,

4222
03:44:16,281 --> 03:44:18,020
for example,
seems to be more involved in

4223
03:44:18,021 --> 03:44:22,190
degeneration of negative emotion and the
left hemisphere more involved in the

4224
03:44:22,191 --> 03:44:24,020
generation of positive emotion and
approach.

4225
03:44:24,021 --> 03:44:26,240
So the right hemisphere stops you in the
left hemisphere,

4226
03:44:26,241 --> 03:44:27,074
moves you forward.

4227
03:44:27,590 --> 03:44:30,770
Anyways,
Jill Bolty,

4228
03:44:31,700 --> 03:44:36,620
I hope I've got that right,
had a stroke and maintained

4229
03:44:36,621 --> 03:44:41,390
consciousness during the stroke and
analyzed it while it was happening and

4230
03:44:41,391 --> 03:44:43,130
she was able.
Well,

4231
03:44:43,131 --> 03:44:47,660
it was happening to hypothesize about
what part of her brain was being

4232
03:44:47,661 --> 03:44:52,661
destroyed and so she had a congenital
blood vessel malformation and had an

4233
03:44:53,790 --> 03:44:58,790
aneurysm and it just about killed her,
but she said that it effected her left

4234
03:45:01,221 --> 03:45:06,221
hemisphere and she said that she
experienced a sense of divine unity as a

4235
03:45:08,061 --> 03:45:12,410
consequence of the stroke because the
left hemisphere function was disrupted

4236
03:45:12,411 --> 03:45:17,411
and destroyed and so she became a right
hemisphere dominant and her experience

4237
03:45:17,901 --> 03:45:21,620
of that was the dissolution of the
specific ego into the,

4238
03:45:22,220 --> 03:45:24,470
into absolute consciousness,
something like that.

4239
03:45:25,220 --> 03:45:29,500
Now that's only a case study and you
don't want to make too much of studies,

4240
03:45:29,501 --> 03:45:34,501
but there is an overwhelming amount of
evidence that those two kinds of

4241
03:45:35,171 --> 03:45:36,520
consciousness exist.

4242
03:45:37,150 --> 03:45:42,150
One being your consciousness of you as a
localized and specified being and the

4243
03:45:44,201 --> 03:45:49,201
other being this capacity to experience
oceanic disillusion and the sense of the

4244
03:45:52,181 --> 03:45:57,181
cosmos being one.
Now why we have those capacities for

4245
03:45:57,941 --> 03:46:02,941
different conscious experiences is very
difficult to understand.

4246
03:46:03,520 --> 03:46:06,640
I mean,
part of me thinks that maybe we have a

4247
03:46:06,641 --> 03:46:11,641
generic human brain that's the brain of
the species and allied with that we have

4248
03:46:13,721 --> 03:46:18,040
a specific individual brain and one is
the left hemisphere and the other is the

4249
03:46:18,041 --> 03:46:19,630
right hemisphere,
the left hemisphere of being the

4250
03:46:19,631 --> 03:46:23,560
specific individual brain and usually
it's on and working because you

4251
03:46:23,561 --> 03:46:27,790
obviously have to take care of yourself
as a specific entity and not as a

4252
03:46:27,791 --> 03:46:32,791
generalized cosmic phenomena.
It's hard to dice salary when you're a

4253
03:46:33,041 --> 03:46:35,680
generalized cosmic phenomena,
right?

4254
03:46:35,681 --> 03:46:37,630
So you have to be more pointed than
that,

4255
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:38,591
but,
but look,

4256
03:46:38,591 --> 03:46:40,060
let's make no mistake about it.

4257
03:46:41,020 --> 03:46:45,520
The fact that those different states of
consciousness exist is not disputable.

4258
03:46:46,060 --> 03:46:49,180
They can be elicited in all sorts of
ways,

4259
03:46:50,020 --> 03:46:54,340
and so I'm going to read you something
that Elvis Huxley wrote about this back,

4260
03:46:54,400 --> 03:46:57,520
I think in 1956.
This was after he

4261
03:47:00,550 --> 03:47:05,110
started his experimentation with
masculine because the psychedelics were

4262
03:47:05,111 --> 03:47:08,290
introduced into Western culture in the
19 fifties and a whole bunch of

4263
03:47:08,291 --> 03:47:10,240
different ways.
So as I've been mushrooms,

4264
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:15,420
LSD was discovered right after the end
of World War II was discovered by

4265
03:47:15,671 --> 03:47:18,460
accident,
actually laboratory sandow was labs.

4266
03:47:18,461 --> 03:47:21,430
The guy who discovered it,
Albert Hoffman had spilled some on his

4267
03:47:21,431 --> 03:47:23,560
hands.
You can absorb it through your skin,

4268
03:47:24,130 --> 03:47:27,610
and he was biking home and had the
world's first LSD trip,

4269
03:47:27,880 --> 03:47:31,930
which was somewhat of a shock to him and
then to the entire world.

4270
03:47:33,190 --> 03:47:35,470
Huxley,
who was a great literary figure,

4271
03:47:35,480 --> 03:47:39,640
a real genius,
experimented with Mescaline in the late

4272
03:47:39,641 --> 03:47:43,090
fifties and he wrote a book called the
doors of perception,

4273
03:47:43,091 --> 03:47:46,120
which had a huge impact on the emerging
psychedelic culture,

4274
03:47:46,390 --> 03:47:51,390
both on the east coast,
it at Harvard and on the West Coast with

4275
03:47:51,490 --> 03:47:53,120
Ken Keasy and is Mary Pranksters.

4276
03:47:53,140 --> 03:47:56,140
The people who popularized lsd.
That's all documented in a book called

4277
03:47:56,141 --> 03:47:59,050
the electric koolaid acid test,
which I would highly recommend.

4278
03:47:59,380 --> 03:48:01,150
It's Tom Wolfe.
It's brilliant book.

4279
03:48:01,550 --> 03:48:03,460
I'm on the east coast.
It was timothy leary.

4280
03:48:03,820 --> 03:48:06,880
I had timothy leary's old job at
Harvard,

4281
03:48:07,510 --> 03:48:08,710
so that was kind of cool,
you know,

4282
03:48:08,920 --> 03:48:12,490
warped way,
so I met people there who knew him,

4283
03:48:13,480 --> 03:48:17,080
who didn't think much of them also,
but who did know him,

4284
03:48:17,081 --> 03:48:22,030
but Huxley had this masculine experience
and it transported him to this

4285
03:48:22,690 --> 03:48:27,100
alternative consciousness and he said
that during his masculine experience,

4286
03:48:27,200 --> 03:48:31,160
the entire world glowed from within.
Like if there was an inner light like a

4287
03:48:31,161 --> 03:48:34,250
paradise inner light,
and then everything was deeply

4288
03:48:34,251 --> 03:48:39,251
meaningful and symbolically suggestive
and overwhelming and beautiful and

4289
03:48:39,441 --> 03:48:42,560
timeless,
so he had an experience of divine

4290
03:48:42,890 --> 03:48:45,770
eternity,
I suppose is the most straightforward

4291
03:48:45,771 --> 03:48:49,190
way to to put that,
and we know perfectly well that the

4292
03:48:49,191 --> 03:48:52,580
psychedelic drugs that all share the
same chemical structure,

4293
03:48:52,820 --> 03:48:55,190
they interact with the brain chemical
called Serotonin,

4294
03:48:55,670 --> 03:48:57,860
which is a very,
very fundamental neurotransmitter.

4295
03:48:58,290 --> 03:49:02,210
They all have approximately the same
range of effects,

4296
03:49:03,170 --> 03:49:06,710
although those effects are very.
There's a very large multitude of

4297
03:49:06,711 --> 03:49:10,010
effects that sort of exist underneath
that umbrella.

4298
03:49:11,930 --> 03:49:16,930
Huxley was
staggered by his masculine experience.

4299
03:49:18,490 --> 03:49:20,480
He,
he didn't really know what to make of it

4300
03:49:20,750 --> 03:49:25,070
and I think that that's the common
experience of people who have

4301
03:49:25,490 --> 03:49:27,980
exceptionally profound psychedelic
experiences,

4302
03:49:28,250 --> 03:49:29,060
and I'll,
I'll,

4303
03:49:29,060 --> 03:49:31,670
I'll tell you some documentation about
that in a moment,

4304
03:49:31,940 --> 03:49:36,500
but he spent quite a long time trying to
come to grips with what this might mean

4305
03:49:36,710 --> 03:49:39,830
from an intellectual perspective and in
Huxley had a great brain.

4306
03:49:39,831 --> 03:49:41,660
I mean,
if someone was going to wrestle with a

4307
03:49:41,661 --> 03:49:43,670
problem like that,
he was a good candidate.

4308
03:49:43,730 --> 03:49:46,670
He must've had a verbal Iq of 180.
I mean he's.

4309
03:49:47,450 --> 03:49:50,350
His books are incredibly literate,
incredible credible,

4310
03:49:50,570 --> 03:49:55,130
mastery of language and complexity of
characterization and intellectual

4311
03:49:55,131 --> 03:49:56,570
discourse.
Really remarkable.

4312
03:49:58,280 --> 03:50:01,580
So this is what Huxley actually had to
say after his masculine experience.

4313
03:50:01,670 --> 03:50:05,660
He talked about heaven and hell and he
talked about that in reference to bad

4314
03:50:05,661 --> 03:50:09,200
trips,
essentially because it was known by that

4315
03:50:09,201 --> 03:50:14,201
point that a psychedelic experience
could transport you to an ecstatic

4316
03:50:14,300 --> 03:50:17,810
domain of divine revelation,
but could take you to the worst

4317
03:50:17,870 --> 03:50:21,710
imaginable place as well,
and Huxley was very interested in why

4318
03:50:21,711 --> 03:50:25,790
you would even have the capacity for
experiences like that and which I think

4319
03:50:25,791 --> 03:50:28,250
is a very good question and it's
completely unanswered question.

4320
03:50:28,520 --> 03:50:30,560
I mean,
we don't know much about consciousness

4321
03:50:30,561 --> 03:50:32,840
and we know even less about
psychedelics.

4322
03:50:32,841 --> 03:50:35,630
I would say they are an absolute
mystery.

4323
03:50:35,930 --> 03:50:38,210
I don't think we understand them in the
least.

4324
03:50:39,410 --> 03:50:43,070
Huxley did a good job of starting to at
least map out the mysteries of the

4325
03:50:43,071 --> 03:50:45,320
terrain.
He said like the earth of 100 years ago,

4326
03:50:45,321 --> 03:50:47,410
our minds still has its darkest
Africa's.

4327
03:50:47,680 --> 03:50:52,370
It's unmapped,
Borneo and Amazonian Basin in relation

4328
03:50:52,371 --> 03:50:55,880
to the fauna of these regions.
We are not yet zoologists.

4329
03:50:56,510 --> 03:50:59,060
We are mere naturalists and collectors
of specimens.

4330
03:50:59,240 --> 03:51:01,850
The fact is unfortunate,
but we have to accept it.

4331
03:51:02,090 --> 03:51:04,820
We have to make the best of it.
However,

4332
03:51:04,821 --> 03:51:08,840
lowly the work of the collector must be
done before we can proceed to the higher

4333
03:51:08,841 --> 03:51:11,210
scientific tasks of classification,
analysis,

4334
03:51:11,211 --> 03:51:14,750
experiment and theory making like the
giraffe and the duck billed.

4335
03:51:14,751 --> 03:51:17,210
Platypus.
The creatures inhabiting these remoter

4336
03:51:17,211 --> 03:51:20,780
regions of the mind are exceedingly
improbable.

4337
03:51:21,050 --> 03:51:22,310
Nevertheless,
they exist.

4338
03:51:22,311 --> 03:51:25,230
They're facts of observation,
and as such,

4339
03:51:25,231 --> 03:51:28,350
they cannot be ignored by anyone who was
honestly trying to understand the world

4340
03:51:28,620 --> 03:51:29,490
in which he lives.

4341
03:51:34,870 --> 03:51:39,870
When psychiatrist started to study lsd
that was mostly in the late fifties and

4342
03:51:40,080 --> 03:51:44,230
running forward from that,
they thought about the drug as a

4343
03:51:44,460 --> 03:51:47,800
psychotomimetic,
which was a chemical substance that

4344
03:51:47,801 --> 03:51:51,520
would induce psychosis,
but that turned out to not be true,

4345
03:51:51,940 --> 03:51:56,940
not with the psychedelics because
schizophrenia were given lsd and the

4346
03:51:58,391 --> 03:52:03,391
schizophrenia reported that while the
experience experience was certainly

4347
03:52:04,210 --> 03:52:08,800
extraordinarily strange,
it wasn't like being schizophrenia and

4348
03:52:08,801 --> 03:52:12,010
then it was found later that if you gave
schizophrenia amphetamines,

4349
03:52:12,280 --> 03:52:13,930
that made them worse.
In fact,

4350
03:52:13,931 --> 03:52:18,931
you can induce a paranoid psychosis in a
normal person by overdosing them with

4351
03:52:19,841 --> 03:52:22,750
amphetamines,
so whatever the hallucinogens or

4352
03:52:22,840 --> 03:52:26,980
psychedelics are doing,
it's not the same thing as mania and

4353
03:52:26,981 --> 03:52:28,630
it's not the same thing as
schizophrenia,

4354
03:52:29,230 --> 03:52:32,890
not at all,
so,

4355
03:52:38,950 --> 03:52:43,950
so you can't just write the experience
off as an induced psychosis,

4356
03:52:45,700 --> 03:52:49,480
whatever it is,
independent of its utility or lack

4357
03:52:49,481 --> 03:52:51,970
thereof.
It's not that

4358
03:52:53,620 --> 03:52:57,940
now it can be induced by drugs can be
induced by deprivation,

4359
03:52:57,941 --> 03:52:59,680
right?
I mean there are accounts throughout

4360
03:52:59,681 --> 03:53:04,681
history of people putting themselves in
extreme physiological situations in

4361
03:53:05,321 --> 03:53:07,570
order to induce transformations of
consciousness.

4362
03:53:07,690 --> 03:53:10,210
Fasting is one of the routes to doing
that.

4363
03:53:10,600 --> 03:53:13,450
Dancing is another root.
Isolation.

4364
03:53:13,451 --> 03:53:15,670
Prolonged periods of isolation will also
do it.

4365
03:53:16,390 --> 03:53:21,390
Now you could say that exposing yourself
to any of those in excess produces a

4366
03:53:22,121 --> 03:53:27,121
state that's in distinguishable from
illness and that there's no reason to

4367
03:53:28,031 --> 03:53:33,031
assume that the phenomena that are
associated with illness have any utility

4368
03:53:33,251 --> 03:53:36,520
whatsoever.
Although it's interesting to me that

4369
03:53:39,700 --> 03:53:43,930
a disrupted consciousness can produce
coherent experiences.

4370
03:53:43,931 --> 03:53:46,150
It's not exactly what you expected was
just an illness.

4371
03:53:46,151 --> 03:53:47,110
You know,
if you develop,

4372
03:53:47,111 --> 03:53:48,610
say,
a high fever,

4373
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:53,560
your experience isn't transcendent and
coherent.

4374
03:53:54,130 --> 03:53:58,660
It's fragmented and pathologized and and
the difference I think is quite

4375
03:53:58,661 --> 03:54:01,510
distinct,
although we don't only have to only

4376
03:54:01,511 --> 03:54:04,420
speculate about that because there's
been enough experimental work done now

4377
03:54:04,421 --> 03:54:09,421
with with hallucinogens psychedelics to
indicate that the notion that what they

4378
03:54:09,671 --> 03:54:14,671
produce is something that's only akin to
pathology is wrong because it's not a

4379
03:54:15,611 --> 03:54:20,200
matter of opinion at this point in the
sequence of scientific and historical

4380
03:54:20,201 --> 03:54:21,280
investigation.
In fact,

4381
03:54:21,281 --> 03:54:24,370
there was a large scale study done 10
years ago,

4382
03:54:24,430 --> 03:54:28,510
five years ago,
of 200,000 people who had experimented

4383
03:54:28,511 --> 03:54:32,560
with psychedelics and they were mentally
and physically healthier than people who

4384
03:54:32,561 --> 03:54:35,590
hadn't on virtually every parameter.
They examined,

4385
03:54:36,070 --> 03:54:40,990
in fact the rate of flashbacks.
You've heard of LSD flashbacks,

4386
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:45,580
that mostly a hypothetical phenomena,
but the rate of self reported flashbacks

4387
03:54:45,581 --> 03:54:49,270
was higher among the non psychedelic
users that among the psychedelic users,

4388
03:54:50,410 --> 03:54:52,480
so that was very interesting.
It was a huge study.

4389
03:54:52,481 --> 03:54:53,314
Now,
it might be,

4390
03:54:53,320 --> 03:54:57,220
you could say that those who had
experimented with psychedelics were

4391
03:54:57,221 --> 03:55:02,221
prone to be healthier to begin with,
but that still contradicts the pathology

4392
03:55:02,920 --> 03:55:04,870
argument,
so it doesn't matter either way.

4393
03:55:05,290 --> 03:55:08,650
The pathology argument is contradicted
now.

4394
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:14,350
Oh,
I did put that in.

4395
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:16,810
It was Dr Jill,
Jill Bolte Taylor.

4396
03:55:17,500 --> 03:55:21,490
This is what she said about her stroke.
I remember that first day of the stroke

4397
03:55:21,491 --> 03:55:23,650
with terrific,
bitter sweetness in the absence of the

4398
03:55:23,651 --> 03:55:26,920
normal functioning of my left
Orientation Association area.

4399
03:55:27,160 --> 03:55:31,060
My perception of my physical boundaries
was no longer limited to where my skin

4400
03:55:31,061 --> 03:55:34,600
met air.
I felt like a genie liberated from its

4401
03:55:34,601 --> 03:55:36,310
bottle.
It's a good metaphor.

4402
03:55:37,960 --> 03:55:41,320
The energy of my spirits seemed to flow
like a great whale gliding through a sea

4403
03:55:41,321 --> 03:55:44,740
of silent euphoria.
The absence of physical boundary was one

4404
03:55:44,741 --> 03:55:49,741
of glorious bliss.
Recently is Dr Roland Griffith.

4405
03:55:55,830 --> 03:56:00,540
I met him once at a conference in San
Francisco.

4406
03:56:00,570 --> 03:56:01,500
Surprise,
surprise,

4407
03:56:03,250 --> 03:56:06,240
a conference on awe,
and this was just when he was embarking

4408
03:56:06,241 --> 03:56:10,110
on his experiments with Psilocybin,
which were the first experiments on

4409
03:56:10,111 --> 03:56:15,111
hallucinogens that were permitted by the
National Institute of Mental Health in

4410
03:56:15,211 --> 03:56:17,100
some three,
four decades.

4411
03:56:17,300 --> 03:56:20,430
He,
he had to be very careful to lay out the

4412
03:56:20,431 --> 03:56:24,750
scientific protocols so that the ethics
committees would approve the experiments

4413
03:56:24,751 --> 03:56:29,190
and so that the federal funding agencies
would also allow the experiments to go

4414
03:56:29,191 --> 03:56:33,030
through.
He started to experiment with psilocybin

4415
03:56:34,140 --> 03:56:39,140
and he's found a number of published,
a number of very interesting results.

4416
03:56:40,170 --> 03:56:45,170
One was that a single siliciden trip and
I specified trip because sometimes when

4417
03:56:50,461 --> 03:56:53,160
people take psilocybin out,
the doses that griffith uses,

4418
03:56:53,430 --> 03:56:55,500
they don't have a psychedelic
experience.

4419
03:56:55,980 --> 03:56:58,620
Most people who take the dose do but not
everyone.

4420
03:56:59,190 --> 03:57:04,190
Those who take the dos and don't have
the mystical experience don't experience

4421
03:57:04,591 --> 03:57:09,150
the consequences of taking the drug and
the consequences can be quite profound.

4422
03:57:09,510 --> 03:57:13,620
So one consequence is that if you have
the mystical experience that's

4423
03:57:13,621 --> 03:57:18,621
associated with suicide and ingestion,
you're liable to represent that to

4424
03:57:19,951 --> 03:57:23,120
others and yourself.
One of the two or three most important

4425
03:57:23,121 --> 03:57:28,121
experiences of your entire life,
so that would be at the same level as

4426
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:30,440
the birth of your child or your
marriage,

4427
03:57:30,560 --> 03:57:33,770
let's say assuming that those were
transcendent experiences,

4428
03:57:33,920 --> 03:57:34,790
but,
but that's.

4429
03:57:36,440 --> 03:57:39,770
But that's how people describe them.
So that's very interesting in and of

4430
03:57:39,771 --> 03:57:40,604
itself.

4431
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:46,640
Then the next thing that griffith,
another thing that Griffith report,

4432
03:57:46,641 --> 03:57:51,641
it was that one year after a silicide
been dose a single psilocybin dose

4433
03:57:53,150 --> 03:57:55,310
profound enough to induce a mystical
experience.

4434
03:57:55,790 --> 03:58:00,790
That trait openness of the participants
had increased one standard deviation,

4435
03:58:01,520 --> 03:58:04,850
which is a tremendous amount,
and so it looked like one dose produced

4436
03:58:04,851 --> 03:58:08,120
a permanent neurological and
psychological transformation.

4437
03:58:08,330 --> 03:58:11,210
Now I'm not saying that that's a good
thing.

4438
03:58:11,820 --> 03:58:16,250
I'm not saying that because I don't
think that openness is a n

4439
03:58:17,810 --> 03:58:21,170
troubled blessing,
but it's certainly a testament to the

4440
03:58:21,171 --> 03:58:24,110
unbelievable potency of the,
of the drugs.

4441
03:58:25,010 --> 03:58:27,440
There's about a 10 percent chance,
by the way,

4442
03:58:27,560 --> 03:58:30,230
with suicide ingestion of a trip to
hell.

4443
03:58:30,500 --> 03:58:34,400
And so that's certainly something very
much worth considering when you're

4444
03:58:34,580 --> 03:58:39,350
thinking about the potential effects of,
of this kind of experience.

4445
03:58:43,310 --> 03:58:47,780
So the mystical experience produced by
Psilocybin is rated by people as the

4446
03:58:47,781 --> 03:58:49,850
most profound,
among the most profound experience of

4447
03:58:49,851 --> 03:58:52,730
their life as life changing.
It produces permanent personality

4448
03:58:52,980 --> 03:58:56,060
transformations.
80 five percent success in smoking

4449
03:58:56,061 --> 03:58:58,970
cessation with a single dose,
right?

4450
03:58:58,971 --> 03:59:01,040
That's another thing that griffiths
demonstrated.

4451
03:59:01,041 --> 03:59:05,930
Now that is mind boggling because there
are chemical treatments for smoking

4452
03:59:05,931 --> 03:59:09,860
cessation.
Buproprion is one.

4453
03:59:10,880 --> 03:59:15,880
It reduces craving to some degree,
but it's success rate is nowhere near 85

4454
03:59:17,961 --> 03:59:21,170
percent,
certainly not with a single dose,

4455
03:59:22,190 --> 03:59:26,660
and so we don't understand how it can be
that that occurs,

4456
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:31,960
but it's nicely documented by Griffith
team in this experiment he gave suicide,

4457
03:59:34,301 --> 03:59:36,020
been to people who are dying of cancer.

4458
03:59:38,630 --> 03:59:42,050
Cancer patients often develop chronic
clinically significant symptoms of

4459
03:59:42,051 --> 03:59:45,840
depression and anxiety.
Previous study suggested Siliciden may

4460
03:59:45,860 --> 03:59:48,410
decrease depression and anxiety and
cancer patients.

4461
03:59:48,730 --> 03:59:51,410
Aldous Huxley took Lsd on his death bed
by the way.

4462
03:59:52,280 --> 03:59:57,280
So the idea that there was something
about psychedelic substances that could

4463
04:00:00,740 --> 04:00:05,740
buffer people against the catastrophes
of mortality is an idea that's as old as

4464
04:00:06,741 --> 04:00:11,540
experimentation with the drug itself.
The effects of Psilocybin were studied

4465
04:00:11,541 --> 04:00:15,680
in 51 cancer patients with life
threatening diagnosis and symptoms of

4466
04:00:15,681 --> 04:00:18,710
depression and slash or anxiety.
Unsurprisingly,

4467
04:00:22,790 --> 04:00:27,330
I don't really know if it's reasonable
to describe the emotional state of

4468
04:00:27,331 --> 04:00:32,331
people diagnosed with cancer of
uncertain prognosis or mortal

4469
04:00:32,760 --> 04:00:35,820
significance as depression.
Precisely.

4470
04:00:36,350 --> 04:00:38,370
You know,
you know what I mean is that if you go

4471
04:00:38,371 --> 04:00:42,360
to the doctor and he tells you that you
have intractable fatal cancer,

4472
04:00:42,960 --> 04:00:47,910
the normative response is to be rather
upset and anxious about that and so it.

4473
04:00:48,540 --> 04:00:51,750
One of the things that bothers me about
clinical psychiatry and clinical

4474
04:00:51,751 --> 04:00:55,380
psychology is the automatic
presupposition that even overwhelming

4475
04:00:55,381 --> 04:00:58,920
states of negative emotion are properly
categorized as depression because I

4476
04:00:58,921 --> 04:01:01,890
don't think you're depressed when you
get a cancer diagnosis.

4477
04:01:02,400 --> 04:01:04,140
I don't think that's the right way to
think about it.

4478
04:01:04,350 --> 04:01:07,950
I think that you have a big problem and
it's not surprising that you're

4479
04:01:07,951 --> 04:01:10,890
overwhelmed by negative emotion and to
think about that as a psychiatric

4480
04:01:10,891 --> 04:01:13,740
malfunction is a major error,
but anyways,

4481
04:01:14,820 --> 04:01:16,980
it's a side issue.
With regards to this study.

4482
04:01:19,530 --> 04:01:22,860
The effects of Psilocybin were studied
in 51 cancer patients with life

4483
04:01:22,861 --> 04:01:26,070
threatening diagnosis and symptoms of
depression and slash or anxiety.

4484
04:01:26,250 --> 04:01:28,980
I cannot imagine how they got this
through an ethics committee.

4485
04:01:29,220 --> 04:01:34,050
It's just we're going to take people who
have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that

4486
04:01:34,051 --> 04:01:36,930
are potentially life threatening and
we're going to give them psychedelics.

4487
04:01:37,230 --> 04:01:39,360
It's like,
but they did it.

4488
04:01:39,390 --> 04:01:43,350
They did it and I think it's a testament
to griffiths stature as a researcher

4489
04:01:43,351 --> 04:01:48,330
that that that was allowable.
This was a randomized double blind

4490
04:01:48,331 --> 04:01:51,240
crossover trial,
very carefully designed clinical

4491
04:01:51,241 --> 04:01:54,660
investigation.
People were assigned to the treatment

4492
04:01:54,661 --> 04:01:59,661
group or the drug group or the non drug
group randomly blindly and investigated

4493
04:02:02,550 --> 04:02:04,470
the effects of the drug also with
different doses,

4494
04:02:04,471 --> 04:02:07,890
which is another hallmark of a well
designed pharmacological study,

4495
04:02:08,400 --> 04:02:12,840
very low placebo like dos one or three
milligrams per 70 kilograms of body

4496
04:02:12,841 --> 04:02:17,841
weight versus a high dose 22 or 30
milligrams per 70 kilograms of of

4497
04:02:18,330 --> 04:02:21,660
psilocybin chemical suicide,
but administered in counterbalance

4498
04:02:21,661 --> 04:02:24,930
sequence with five weeks between
sessions in a six month followup.

4499
04:02:26,250 --> 04:02:31,250
Instruction to participants and staff
minimized the effects of expectancy

4500
04:02:31,470 --> 04:02:32,400
participants,
staff,

4501
04:02:32,401 --> 04:02:35,190
and community observers.
Rated participant moods,

4502
04:02:35,191 --> 04:02:36,930
attitudes and behaviors throughout the
study,

4503
04:02:37,140 --> 04:02:40,860
and it's also the hallmark of a well
designed study because they didn't rely

4504
04:02:40,861 --> 04:02:43,770
on a single source of information for
the outcome data,

4505
04:02:43,771 --> 04:02:45,010
right?
They got self-reports,

4506
04:02:45,090 --> 04:02:47,610
that's fine,
but they had relatively objective

4507
04:02:47,611 --> 04:02:50,220
observers also gather data at the same
time,

4508
04:02:51,300 --> 04:02:55,650
high dose psilocybin produced large
decreases in clinician and self related

4509
04:02:55,651 --> 04:02:59,490
measures of depressed mood and anxiety
along with increases in quality of life,

4510
04:02:59,670 --> 04:03:02,880
life meaning and optimism and decreases
in death,

4511
04:03:02,881 --> 04:03:05,430
anxiety,
and that's an interesting.

4512
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:09,300
It's a subtle and scientifically spar
statement,

4513
04:03:09,301 --> 04:03:13,020
but it's a very interesting one.
It was the.

4514
04:03:13,980 --> 04:03:16,290
There's A.
There's an intimation of a causal

4515
04:03:16,291 --> 04:03:19,120
relationship,
increases in quality of life,

4516
04:03:19,121 --> 04:03:22,030
life meaning and decreases in death,
anxiety.

4517
04:03:25,150 --> 04:03:28,420
I mean the intimation there is that one
of the ways of decreasing your anxiety

4518
04:03:28,421 --> 04:03:33,421
about death is to increase the felt
meaning in your life and the psilocybin

4519
04:03:34,270 --> 04:03:37,570
dose just potentiate that,
but it's a good thing to know in a

4520
04:03:37,571 --> 04:03:40,420
general manner if it happens to be a
generalizable truth,

4521
04:03:40,421 --> 04:03:42,190
right?
If you're terrified of mortality,

4522
04:03:42,730 --> 04:03:47,110
terrified of vulnerability,
there's always the possibility that the

4523
04:03:47,111 --> 04:03:51,550
life path that you're following isn't
rich enough to buffer you against the

4524
04:03:52,210 --> 04:03:57,210
negative element of existence.
It's a reasonable hypothesis and an

4525
04:03:58,481 --> 04:04:01,270
optimistic one.
I think although a difficult one at six

4526
04:04:01,271 --> 04:04:04,750
month followup,
these changes were sustained with about

4527
04:04:04,751 --> 04:04:08,500
80 percent of participants continuing to
show clinically significant decreases in

4528
04:04:08,501 --> 04:04:13,501
depressed mood and anxiety.
Stephen Ross commenting about this,

4529
04:04:14,031 --> 04:04:16,880
he was a co investigator,
said it is simply unprecedented in

4530
04:04:16,881 --> 04:04:19,850
psychiatry that a single dose of a
medicine produces these kinds of

4531
04:04:19,880 --> 04:04:22,490
dramatic and enduring results,
right?

4532
04:04:22,491 --> 04:04:27,080
Which means we have no idea why this
happens.

4533
04:04:29,780 --> 04:04:33,770
Participants in attributed improvements
and attitudes about life slash self,

4534
04:04:33,771 --> 04:04:34,760
mood,
relationships,

4535
04:04:35,060 --> 04:04:39,650
and spirituality to the high dose
experience with more than 80 percent

4536
04:04:39,651 --> 04:04:43,070
endorsing moderately or greater,
increased wellbeing and life

4537
04:04:43,071 --> 04:04:45,950
satisfaction.
Community observers showed corresponding

4538
04:04:45,951 --> 04:04:49,610
changes.
Mystical type Silas psilocybin

4539
04:04:49,670 --> 04:04:54,470
experience on session day mediated the
effect of Psilocybin dose on therapeutic

4540
04:04:54,471 --> 04:04:56,240
outcomes.
What that means is that,

4541
04:04:56,990 --> 04:05:00,230
well,
when researchers were trying to look at

4542
04:05:00,231 --> 04:05:03,320
a causal relationship between drug
ingestion and the positive outcome,

4543
04:05:04,640 --> 04:05:06,740
the causal relationship was drug
ingestion,

4544
04:05:06,741 --> 04:05:08,570
mystical experience,
positive outcome.

4545
04:05:08,720 --> 04:05:11,030
It wasn't drug ingestion,
positive outcome.

4546
04:05:11,031 --> 04:05:15,680
There had to be the experience produced
by the pharmaceutical agent in order for

4547
04:05:15,681 --> 04:05:18,620
the pharmaceutical agent to have had its
effect.

4548
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:20,180
Now we don't.
Again,

4549
04:05:20,181 --> 04:05:23,390
we don't know why that is either.
Maybe some people needed a higher dose.

4550
04:05:23,420 --> 04:05:26,900
Who knows because people vary
tremendously in their sensitivity to

4551
04:05:26,901 --> 04:05:29,000
pharmaceutical substances.
Now,

4552
04:05:29,030 --> 04:05:30,440
why am I telling you all this?

4553
04:05:30,680 --> 04:05:32,960
Well,
I'm telling you for a variety of

4554
04:05:32,961 --> 04:05:36,500
reasons.
One is the first is make no mistake

4555
04:05:36,501 --> 04:05:41,030
about it.
Human beings have the capacity for forms

4556
04:05:41,031 --> 04:05:44,330
of consciousness that are radically
unlike our normative forms of

4557
04:05:44,331 --> 04:05:49,331
consciousness and the evidence that
those alternative forms of consciousness

4558
04:05:49,910 --> 04:05:53,990
are purely pathological,
which is the simplest explanation,

4559
04:05:54,030 --> 04:05:55,510
right?
You perturb the system,

4560
04:05:55,910 --> 04:05:59,570
produces pathology that's negative.
That is the simplest explanation.

4561
04:05:59,780 --> 04:06:04,780
The evidence for that is weak at best,
leaving out the bad trip issue,

4562
04:06:05,151 --> 04:06:10,100
which which is non trivial.
The empirical evidence as it accrues in

4563
04:06:10,101 --> 04:06:13,850
fact seems to suggest that the
consequence of mystical,

4564
04:06:13,880 --> 04:06:18,880
positive mystical associated with
psychedelic intake is overwhelmingly

4565
04:06:18,951 --> 04:06:21,260
positive.
Even in extreme situations and you

4566
04:06:21,261 --> 04:06:25,850
really can't find a more extreme
situation than uncertain cancer

4567
04:06:25,851 --> 04:06:30,050
diagnosis with concomitant time and
depression and anxiety.

4568
04:06:30,051 --> 04:06:31,940
Like.
I mean that's not as bad as it gets,

4569
04:06:31,941 --> 04:06:33,650
but it gets kind of in the ballpark.

4570
04:06:34,010 --> 04:06:36,890
And so the fact that even under
circumstances like that,

4571
04:06:37,280 --> 04:06:41,240
there was the overwhelming probability
that the experience would be positive

4572
04:06:41,241 --> 04:06:42,830
because that's another thing you
wouldn't expect.

4573
04:06:42,831 --> 04:06:45,530
You know,
even from some of the earlier earliest

4574
04:06:45,531 --> 04:06:48,560
discussions about psychedelic use that
were put forth by people,

4575
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:54,040
including Timothy leary describing the
importance of sat right so that the

4576
04:06:54,081 --> 04:06:59,081
early experimenters noted that if you
had a psychedelic experience and you

4577
04:06:59,451 --> 04:07:04,451
were in a bad state or in a bad place,
that that was one of the precursors to a

4578
04:07:04,491 --> 04:07:06,830
bad trip.
That the negative emotion that you

4579
04:07:06,831 --> 04:07:11,831
entered the experience with could be
magnified tremendously by the,

4580
04:07:12,230 --> 04:07:16,760
by the chemical substances.
So that it was necessary to be somewhere

4581
04:07:16,761 --> 04:07:19,880
safe to be around people that you trust,
to be in a familiar environment,

4582
04:07:20,000 --> 04:07:24,860
to get all the variables that you could
control under control,

4583
04:07:25,190 --> 04:07:28,580
but here's the situation where that
isn't what's happening at all because

4584
04:07:28,581 --> 04:07:33,581
people have this cancer diagnosis of
cancer diagnosis of unspecified outcome,

4585
04:07:33,681 --> 04:07:35,870
and they still,
the vast majority of them had a positive

4586
04:07:35,871 --> 04:07:40,550
experience and the positive experience
experience had long lasting positive

4587
04:07:40,551 --> 04:07:41,384
consequences.

4588
04:07:41,990 --> 04:07:46,990
So,
so the case that the transcendent

4589
04:07:47,451 --> 04:07:50,720
experience is not real,
that's wrong.

4590
04:07:52,040 --> 04:07:54,500
It's real.
Now we don't know what that means

4591
04:07:55,160 --> 04:07:58,400
because it actually challenges to some
degree our concepts of what constitutes

4592
04:07:58,401 --> 04:08:01,610
real,
but it's certainly well within the realm

4593
04:08:01,611 --> 04:08:05,360
of normative human experience.
So it's part of the human capacity.

4594
04:08:05,630 --> 04:08:07,250
And you know,
there there's been other neurological

4595
04:08:07,251 --> 04:08:08,240
experiments to.
There's,

4596
04:08:09,170 --> 04:08:10,910
there's a researcher,
Canadian researcher,

4597
04:08:10,911 --> 04:08:12,590
if I remember correctly,
who invented something.

4598
04:08:12,591 --> 04:08:17,591
He called the God helmet and it used
electromagnetic stimulation,

4599
04:08:17,961 --> 04:08:21,500
brain stimulation to induce mystical
experiences.

4600
04:08:21,830 --> 04:08:23,480
Now,
I don't remember what part of the brain

4601
04:08:23,481 --> 04:08:26,300
he was shutting off or activating with
that particular gadget,

4602
04:08:26,720 --> 04:08:29,590
but
and you know there's,

4603
04:08:29,630 --> 04:08:30,360
there's,
there's,

4604
04:08:30,360 --> 04:08:33,560
there's all,
there's all sorts of other indications

4605
04:08:33,561 --> 04:08:38,561
of this sort of thing that have cropped
up in other domains of the neurological

4606
04:08:39,321 --> 04:08:40,460
literature.
For example.

4607
04:08:41,180 --> 04:08:46,180
It's very common for people who are
epileptic to have religious experiences

4608
04:08:46,820 --> 04:08:49,820
as part of the prodromal to the actual
seizure.

4609
04:08:50,000 --> 04:08:52,130
That was the case with Dostoevsky,
for example,

4610
04:08:52,460 --> 04:08:57,460
who had incredibly intense religious
experiences that would culminate in

4611
04:08:57,530 --> 04:09:01,970
epileptic seizure and he said that they
were of sufficient quality that he would

4612
04:09:01,971 --> 04:09:06,971
give up his whole life to have had the.
And the funny thing too is that in my

4613
04:09:07,101 --> 04:09:12,101
reading of Dostoevsky at least is that I
think that epileptic seizures and the

4614
04:09:12,231 --> 04:09:16,860
associated mystical were part of what
made him a transcendently brilliant

4615
04:09:16,861 --> 04:09:18,810
author.
I don't think that he would have broken

4616
04:09:18,811 --> 04:09:23,370
through into the domains of insight that
he possessed without those strange

4617
04:09:23,371 --> 04:09:26,910
neurological experiences.
And it was certainly not the case that

4618
04:09:26,911 --> 04:09:31,860
his epilepsy or the experiences that
were associated with it produced.

4619
04:09:31,920 --> 04:09:35,220
What you might describe as an impairment
in his cognitive function is quite the

4620
04:09:35,221 --> 04:09:37,470
contrary.
At least that's how it looks to me.

4621
04:09:41,660 --> 04:09:44,990
This is a critical issue with regards to
the harmonic transformation,

4622
04:09:44,991 --> 04:09:46,850
is that people go through these
terrible,

4623
04:09:47,210 --> 04:09:50,510
terrible experiences,
often drug induced by the way,

4624
04:09:50,511 --> 04:09:53,480
with regards to the Sharman,
they usually use psychedelic chemicals

4625
04:09:53,481 --> 04:09:55,280
of one form or another,
often mushrooms,

4626
04:09:55,281 --> 04:10:00,050
but what they've come up with some very
strange concoctions like Iowasca down in

4627
04:10:00,080 --> 04:10:02,990
the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing
substance.

4628
04:10:02,991 --> 04:10:07,970
It's made out of the bark of one thing
and another plant whose name I don't

4629
04:10:07,971 --> 04:10:12,110
remember that hardly even grow in the
same place and that has to be cooked

4630
04:10:12,170 --> 04:10:17,170
together in a special way and no one has
any idea how the damn Amazonians figured

4631
04:10:17,571 --> 04:10:19,220
that out.
It looks impossible.

4632
04:10:19,370 --> 04:10:20,510
And if you ask them,
they say,

4633
04:10:20,511 --> 04:10:22,250
well,
the plants told us how to do it,

4634
04:10:22,490 --> 04:10:25,250
which was western people don't find very
helpful,

4635
04:10:25,251 --> 04:10:29,270
but the shamans are perfectly healthy,
happy with that description.

4636
04:10:29,270 --> 04:10:32,820
And IOWASCA takes them apart.
And it does that in part because it

4637
04:10:33,080 --> 04:10:36,500
affects the serotonergic system very,
very powerfully,

4638
04:10:36,501 --> 04:10:41,501
like all psychedelics do and it
transports them to another world and

4639
04:10:41,751 --> 04:10:43,970
that's how they interpreted and,
and,

4640
04:10:44,240 --> 04:10:47,600
and,
and what we know about psychedelics,

4641
04:10:47,601 --> 04:10:50,120
you could put in a thimble and then
throw the thimble away.

4642
04:10:50,240 --> 04:10:54,650
We know nothing about psychedelics.
There's new experiments going on at

4643
04:10:54,651 --> 04:10:56,270
Johns Hopkins,
for example,

4644
04:10:56,450 --> 04:10:59,810
with silicide button,
which is part of this active chemical in

4645
04:10:59,811 --> 04:11:02,930
magic mushrooms.
Same structure basically as LSD and

4646
04:11:02,931 --> 04:11:06,860
masculine and all the real psychedelics
have basically the same structure except

4647
04:11:07,280 --> 04:11:09,500
the one that's derived from am Anita
must scarier,

4648
04:11:09,530 --> 04:11:11,560
which is called muscular acid.
And it's a,

4649
04:11:11,680 --> 04:11:14,480
it's its own weird thing that no one
knows anything about.

4650
04:11:15,110 --> 04:11:17,360
Anyways,
they have profound neurochemical effects

4651
04:11:17,361 --> 04:11:22,361
in very small doses.
And I'm the research group at Johns

4652
04:11:22,400 --> 04:11:24,950
Hopkins has given Psilocybin to research
subjects,

4653
04:11:25,100 --> 04:11:27,560
you know,
purified psilocybin because they started

4654
04:11:27,561 --> 04:11:31,100
the new experimentation with
psychedelics in that's been banned for

4655
04:11:31,101 --> 04:11:35,270
like 40 years because psychedelics were
so terrifying to our culture that we

4656
04:11:35,271 --> 04:11:36,170
just put them away.

4657
04:11:36,170 --> 04:11:37,340
And it's like,
oh no,

4658
04:11:37,341 --> 04:11:41,210
we're not going there.
And so even from a research perspective,

4659
04:11:41,211 --> 04:11:44,990
and even though some of the psychedelics
look very promising for the treatment of

4660
04:11:44,991 --> 04:11:48,650
disorders like alcoholism,
they recently used silicide going to

4661
04:11:48,651 --> 04:11:51,950
help people stop smoking down at Johns
Hopkins and I think they had an 80

4662
04:11:51,951 --> 04:11:54,560
percent success rate,
which is just like,

4663
04:11:54,680 --> 04:11:57,080
that's just absolutely mind boggling and
so.

4664
04:11:57,470 --> 04:12:00,890
But if you give people psilocybin and
they have a mystical experience,

4665
04:12:01,040 --> 04:12:04,340
which is very common among people who
take these sorts of chemicals,

4666
04:12:04,700 --> 04:12:09,700
then their personality transforms
permanently such that one year later

4667
04:12:09,951 --> 04:12:14,740
they're one standard higher in openness
and openness is the creativity

4668
04:12:14,741 --> 04:12:16,990
dimension.
And that seems to be a permanent

4669
04:12:16,991 --> 04:12:19,290
transformation.
And so that's really remarkable.

4670
04:12:19,291 --> 04:12:24,291
And about 80 percent of the people who
undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments

4671
04:12:24,611 --> 04:12:28,120
report that the experience is like one
of the two or three most important

4672
04:12:28,121 --> 04:12:28,954
things they've ever.

4673
04:12:29,360 --> 04:12:32,020
That's never ever happened to them.
And so.

4674
04:12:32,560 --> 04:12:34,270
Well that's,
that's something,

4675
04:12:34,271 --> 04:12:35,140
you know,
it's like.

4676
04:12:35,590 --> 04:12:37,990
And then there's this guy named Rick
strassman down at,

4677
04:12:38,380 --> 04:12:41,830
I think he was at the University of
Texas and he did experimentation with

4678
04:12:41,831 --> 04:12:43,780
DMT,
dmt,

4679
04:12:43,870 --> 04:12:46,810
dimethyltryptamine I remember,
if I remember correctly,

4680
04:12:47,260 --> 04:12:51,450
is the active ingredient in Iowasca and
you produce it in your brain and it's in

4681
04:12:51,451 --> 04:12:53,500
plants.
It's a very common chemical.

4682
04:12:53,770 --> 04:12:58,770
But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because
it has an extraordinary short mechanism

4683
04:12:59,201 --> 04:13:00,250
of action.
It's like,

4684
04:13:00,380 --> 04:13:05,020
and people who take it report that
they're blasted out of their body,

4685
04:13:05,140 --> 04:13:08,650
like out of a cannon.
And then they go out somewhere and

4686
04:13:08,651 --> 04:13:13,651
encounter beings of various sorts.
And then 10 minutes later they're back

4687
04:13:14,201 --> 04:13:17,290
and virtually everyone reports that,
which is really strange.

4688
04:13:17,291 --> 04:13:21,340
And,
and so straussman was giving people dmt

4689
04:13:21,341 --> 04:13:23,950
intravenously so that the trip would
last longer.

4690
04:13:24,070 --> 04:13:25,030
He get,
this was all,

4691
04:13:25,060 --> 04:13:25,870
all,
you know,

4692
04:13:25,870 --> 04:13:27,490
nih funded,
uh,

4693
04:13:27,580 --> 04:13:31,030
experimentation all cleared with the
relevant ethics boards all conducted

4694
04:13:31,031 --> 04:13:32,260
within the last 10 years.

4695
04:13:32,800 --> 04:13:36,420
He basically quit doing it because he
was a pretty straight scientists,

4696
04:13:36,421 --> 04:13:38,500
you know,
he was measuring heart rate and pulse

4697
04:13:38,501 --> 04:13:41,370
and all that sort of thing.
Trying to look at the physiology and

4698
04:13:41,371 --> 04:13:45,520
then the people he was giving these
chemicals to kept coming back and

4699
04:13:45,521 --> 04:13:48,160
telling him these,
these crazy stories.

4700
04:13:49,060 --> 04:13:51,520
And uh,
well I just,

4701
04:13:51,960 --> 04:13:53,290
it was too much for them,
you know,

4702
04:13:53,291 --> 04:13:54,520
and no wonder,
you know,

4703
04:13:54,760 --> 04:13:56,470
because they all said the same thing.
And he'd say,

4704
04:13:56,471 --> 04:13:57,370
well,
that was a dream.

4705
04:13:57,371 --> 04:13:59,470
And they'd say no.
And it was the most real thing that ever

4706
04:13:59,471 --> 04:14:00,310
happened to me.
And he'd say,

4707
04:14:00,311 --> 04:14:00,791
well,
you know,

4708
04:14:00,791 --> 04:14:02,890
it's an archetypal experience.
And they'd say,

4709
04:14:03,220 --> 04:14:04,210
no,
no,

4710
04:14:04,211 --> 04:14:05,860
no,
that was no archetipal experience.

4711
04:14:05,861 --> 04:14:09,670
I went somewhere else and I saw things
and I'm back and I don't care what you

4712
04:14:09,671 --> 04:14:11,740
think and like,
who the hell knows,

4713
04:14:11,741 --> 04:14:13,270
right?
Because it's all subjective.

4714
04:14:13,630 --> 04:14:15,670
But,
but the weird thing about it is that

4715
04:14:15,671 --> 04:14:19,540
everyone's reporting the same thing.
How the hell do you account for that?

4716
04:14:19,720 --> 04:14:20,980
And then the shaman,
you know,

4717
04:14:20,981 --> 04:14:23,170
when they take these psychedelic
chemicals,

4718
04:14:23,171 --> 04:14:25,030
they basically say the same thing.
They say,

4719
04:14:25,031 --> 04:14:27,910
well first of all,
it more or less killed me.

4720
04:14:29,100 --> 04:14:31,660
That's this.
No,

4721
04:14:31,760 --> 04:14:36,070
I dissolved to skeleton.
And then I climbed a tree that Unites

4722
04:14:36,070 --> 04:14:39,460
Heaven and earth and I went into the
realm of the gods and they gave me some

4723
04:14:39,461 --> 04:14:41,620
information and I'm back.
It's like,

4724
04:14:42,010 --> 04:14:42,970
okay,
well,

4725
04:14:43,030 --> 04:14:44,770
you know,
we don't really know what to make of

4726
04:14:44,771 --> 04:14:46,570
that.
And we certainly,

4727
04:14:46,571 --> 04:14:49,990
that's what len describes when he
describes the shamanic is traumatic

4728
04:14:50,170 --> 04:14:53,600
procession,
not the shamanic initiation and you

4729
04:14:53,620 --> 04:14:55,960
know,
there's dissolution to a skeleton first

4730
04:14:55,961 --> 04:14:59,320
and then like a death,
the symbolic death or experienced as an

4731
04:14:59,321 --> 04:15:03,460
actual death and then bang up into the
realm of the gods and then they come

4732
04:15:03,461 --> 04:15:04,294
back.

4733
04:15:05,270 --> 04:15:08,950
It's a very old idea.
And that's a medieval representation.

4734
04:15:09,080 --> 04:15:12,170
The tunnel that people travel through at
the end of their life to,

4735
04:15:12,560 --> 04:15:13,760
you know,
to find the light,

4736
04:15:13,790 --> 04:15:16,430
which is a very common near death
experience report.

4737
04:15:16,460 --> 04:15:20,210
And people don't have any idea what the
hell to do with those reports except

4738
04:15:20,270 --> 04:15:20,721
say,
well,

4739
04:15:20,721 --> 04:15:25,040
it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,
which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot

4740
04:15:25,041 --> 04:15:28,970
more random in my opinion.
And the idea is there's a rebirth after

4741
04:15:28,971 --> 04:15:30,800
that.
And you know,

4742
04:15:31,040 --> 04:15:34,010
here,
this is the Scandinavian representation

4743
04:15:34,011 --> 04:15:36,470
of that tree that unites Earth with
heaven.

4744
04:15:36,860 --> 04:15:39,170
And so there's the Scandinavian
representation.

4745
04:15:39,171 --> 04:15:41,810
It has a snake snakes down here eating
it.

4746
04:15:41,980 --> 04:15:45,440
And then that's the Amazonian
representation.

4747
04:15:45,960 --> 04:15:48,320
It's like,
how the hell do you account for that?

4748
04:15:48,500 --> 04:15:51,530
We know those pictures are so similar
that it's just,

4749
04:15:52,060 --> 04:15:55,040
it's beyond belief.
Well,

4750
04:15:55,041 --> 04:15:56,900
you know,
we lived in trees for a long time,

4751
04:15:57,710 --> 04:15:59,000
a long,
long,

4752
04:15:59,001 --> 04:16:00,410
long,
long time,

4753
04:16:00,830 --> 04:16:04,010
millions of years,
and there were lots of snakes around

4754
04:16:04,011 --> 04:16:04,520
them.

4755
04:16:04,520 --> 04:16:09,100
And so the idea that reality is a tree
that's surrounded by a snake that's in

4756
04:16:09,101 --> 04:16:09,651
us,
man,

4757
04:16:09,651 --> 04:16:11,390
it's down there,
it's deep.

4758
04:16:11,450 --> 04:16:13,580
And there's something about it that's
true,

4759
04:16:14,340 --> 04:16:16,700
not true,
like we normally think of truth,

4760
04:16:16,701 --> 04:16:19,310
but truth true in an entirely different
manner.

4761
04:16:20,120 --> 04:16:24,170
So and all that's pretty damn strange.
We'll stop with this.

4762
04:16:24,171 --> 04:16:26,360
My son drew this when he was seven years
old.

4763
04:16:26,690 --> 04:16:28,070
Blew me away,
man.

4764
04:16:28,071 --> 04:16:30,380
I thought it was so cool.
So I had it laminated.

4765
04:16:30,710 --> 04:16:33,560
And so here is what it is on the right
hand side,

4766
04:16:33,561 --> 04:16:36,350
that's the order.
It's like the Yin Yang thing that's

4767
04:16:36,351 --> 04:16:38,840
order left side chaos,
right?

4768
04:16:39,080 --> 04:16:41,690
And those are all mushroom houses,
which I thought was amazing.

4769
04:16:42,440 --> 04:16:46,130
And then there's this river that runs
right down the middle,

4770
04:16:46,131 --> 04:16:50,690
like the line for order and chaos.
And then there's this tree that goes up

4771
04:16:50,691 --> 04:16:52,430
to heaven and that's having up there.

4772
04:16:52,430 --> 04:16:54,800
It's like their St Peter.
There's the pearly gates,

4773
04:16:54,801 --> 04:16:58,520
there's the cloud.
It's like he never went to church,

4774
04:16:58,521 --> 04:17:00,620
you know,
it's like what the hell?

4775
04:17:00,621 --> 04:17:05,270
And then there's a little bug there that
goes up and down from heaven to earth.

4776
04:17:05,360 --> 04:17:09,290
And that was him.
And I thought he had a very organized

4777
04:17:09,350 --> 04:17:10,280
psyche.
That kid.

4778
04:17:10,281 --> 04:17:11,750
He was very,
very stable kid.

4779
04:17:11,751 --> 04:17:14,270
And still listen who drew that?
And I thought,

4780
04:17:14,690 --> 04:17:17,690
Jesus,
that's just bloody well unbelievable.

4781
04:17:17,840 --> 04:17:19,850
And I still think that when I look at
it,

4782
04:17:19,851 --> 04:17:22,580
and that's a great example of an
archetype.

4783
04:17:23,060 --> 04:17:25,220
And so we'll see you Tuesday.

4784
04:17:28,420 --> 04:17:30,380
Sure.
I'm going to read something wrote

4785
04:17:32,170 --> 04:17:37,170
in the first part beyond good and evil,
which is a section called the prejudices

4786
04:17:37,951 --> 04:17:42,951
of philosophers.
And it's a really good example of the

4787
04:17:43,231 --> 04:17:48,231
density of this book.
One of the ways of conceptualizing

4788
04:17:48,331 --> 04:17:50,960
beyond good and evil.
And I think this is true for most great

4789
04:17:50,970 --> 04:17:54,900
works of
it's true most works is that

4790
04:17:58,270 --> 04:17:59,103
the

4791
04:18:00,260 --> 04:18:05,260
author of the work
collects unconsciously collect patterns

4792
04:18:08,280 --> 04:18:13,280
from his or her interaction with the
world and then gives them initial

4793
04:18:14,371 --> 04:18:15,270
formulation

4794
04:18:18,480 --> 04:18:23,480
and the patterns can be deep and
multilevel and the initial formulation

4795
04:18:26,281 --> 04:18:31,281
translates them into not so much ideas
as into the seeds of future ideas and

4796
04:18:33,540 --> 04:18:38,540
the more poetically arthur happens to be
the more the case that his or her

4797
04:18:40,320 --> 04:18:45,320
ratings contained within it.
The seeds of future ideas and where the

4798
04:18:45,631 --> 04:18:48,720
romantic philosophers are.
Authors and I think Nietzsche and

4799
04:18:48,721 --> 04:18:53,721
Dostoevsky or or in some sense foremost
among them are particularly notable.

4800
04:18:54,560 --> 04:18:59,560
Further ability to do exactly that.
Now in this particular paragraph,

4801
04:19:01,050 --> 04:19:04,050
just particular paragraph not only
serves as an example of that,

4802
04:19:05,070 --> 04:19:10,070
but it also serves as a self conscious
reflection on that because Nietzsche is

4803
04:19:10,171 --> 04:19:15,171
writing a paragraph here that is full of
the seeds of ideas that will actually

4804
04:19:17,430 --> 04:19:20,460
bloom flower to a great degree in the
20th century.

4805
04:19:21,450 --> 04:19:23,810
But while he's simultaneously revealing
these,

4806
04:19:23,870 --> 04:19:26,220
those ideas,
he's also telling you exactly how he's

4807
04:19:26,221 --> 04:19:28,350
doing it and how it is that philosophers
do it.

4808
04:19:28,770 --> 04:19:31,860
So it source.
It's a spectacular accomplishment.

4809
04:19:33,090 --> 04:19:37,530
I'm going to read it,
probably phrase by phrase and then take

4810
04:19:37,531 --> 04:19:40,710
it apart because it's so dance and
beyond good and evil is like that.

4811
04:19:40,740 --> 04:19:41,760
It's neat.
You,

4812
04:19:41,761 --> 04:19:43,470
when Nisha was writing beyond good and
evil,

4813
04:19:44,070 --> 04:19:48,270
he wasn't very well.
And because of that he had to spend a

4814
04:19:48,271 --> 04:19:50,790
lot of time thinking and not very much
time writing.

4815
04:19:50,791 --> 04:19:54,300
And because he was also brilliant beyond
comprehension,

4816
04:19:54,810 --> 04:19:59,810
his ability to distill what he was
thinking into incredibly rich phrases

4817
04:20:02,310 --> 04:20:04,680
this.
And I think at some sense it's beyond

4818
04:20:04,681 --> 04:20:08,910
parallel.
Mean often if I'm reading a book,

4819
04:20:09,690 --> 04:20:14,690
if it has any utility at all market,
usually I fold over the top of the page

4820
04:20:14,821 --> 04:20:17,070
or sometimes put a yellow sticky note I
want to do.

4821
04:20:17,210 --> 04:20:20,630
If I find a place where there's an idea
that's worth returning to,

4822
04:20:20,670 --> 04:20:22,210
that that's,
um,

4823
04:20:23,540 --> 04:20:27,690
that's particularly worth understanding.
And you can't do that with a book like

4824
04:20:27,691 --> 04:20:30,810
beyond good and evil because what ends
up happening is you have to mark every

4825
04:20:30,811 --> 04:20:34,680
sentence and obviously marketing every
sentence isn't any better than not

4826
04:20:34,681 --> 04:20:37,590
marking any sentences at all.
So

4827
04:20:47,850 --> 04:20:51,780
I guess I also might as well tell you
why it is worth bothering with a book

4828
04:20:51,781 --> 04:20:56,781
like this at all because it's a very
difficult book and it's also the sort of

4829
04:20:56,821 --> 04:21:01,821
book that will rattle you up,
so need you is is very interested in the

4830
04:21:01,831 --> 04:21:06,831
problem of my value and the problem of
value is not the problem of what is the

4831
04:21:09,671 --> 04:21:12,730
world made out or even how does the
world function,

4832
04:21:12,731 --> 04:21:17,620
which are more in some sense more
specifically scientific questions,

4833
04:21:17,621 --> 04:21:21,010
but how is it that you should conduct
yourself in the world?

4834
04:21:21,430 --> 04:21:26,430
How should you act?
And people act towards aims in a sense.

4835
04:21:27,790 --> 04:21:31,060
Because we're active creatures and we're
moving from one point to another.

4836
04:21:31,660 --> 04:21:36,660
We're moving towards things that we want
and that means that we're guided by our

4837
04:21:37,541 --> 04:21:42,541
desires and we're not only guided by
desires in so far as we have individual

4838
04:21:42,671 --> 04:21:47,671
desires were guided by the structure
that consists of how those desires are

4839
04:21:50,711 --> 04:21:51,790
related to one another.

4840
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:55,330
So for example,
if you have a room full of people,

4841
04:21:56,800 --> 04:22:01,800
say a room full of children,
they're active and they're each pursuing

4842
04:22:02,471 --> 04:22:05,710
their individual desires,
but at some point they may choose to

4843
04:22:05,711 --> 04:22:10,510
organize themselves into a game and if
they organize themselves into a game,

4844
04:22:10,660 --> 04:22:13,360
what they're doing for all intents and
purposes,

4845
04:22:13,361 --> 04:22:17,710
is producing a little society,
little micro society within that micro

4846
04:22:17,711 --> 04:22:21,220
society.
They're deciding what desires will be

4847
04:22:21,221 --> 04:22:24,850
currently expressed and how they'll
exist in relationship to one another,

4848
04:22:24,851 --> 04:22:29,851
and that means that they can cooperate
without too much conflict and that they

4849
04:22:30,581 --> 04:22:35,581
can jointly moved towards a joint ame
without

4850
04:22:39,520 --> 04:22:42,670
and and,
and gather all the benefits that might

4851
04:22:42,671 --> 04:22:45,850
be associated with that.
And that might be the accomplishment of

4852
04:22:45,851 --> 04:22:46,840
the Ame,
whatever it is,

4853
04:22:46,841 --> 04:22:50,560
but it also might be just the enjoyment
that's to be had in the pursuit of that

4854
04:22:50,561 --> 04:22:53,650
activity.
Now people do that

4855
04:22:57,280 --> 04:23:00,850
socially because we have to do that in
order to get along with other people

4856
04:23:00,851 --> 04:23:03,880
because our desires have to be melded
with those of other people,

4857
04:23:04,180 --> 04:23:09,180
but we also do it psychologically and
those two things exist in a dance

4858
04:23:09,221 --> 04:23:12,070
because as I'm interacting with other
people,

4859
04:23:14,610 --> 04:23:19,610
the demands of the fact that we're
interacting make require each of us to

4860
04:23:20,970 --> 04:23:24,660
arrange our desires in a way that's
acceptable to everyone else,

4861
04:23:25,590 --> 04:23:27,420
but at the same time,
while we're doing that,

4862
04:23:27,450 --> 04:23:32,220
we're also observing the process by
which those desires are ordered and then

4863
04:23:32,221 --> 04:23:35,730
we internalize that process and use that
to order our own desires.

4864
04:23:36,000 --> 04:23:41,000
And so there's a constant
mutually informative dance between the

4865
04:23:41,581 --> 04:23:45,420
individual and the group and the
culmination of that is the organization

4866
04:23:45,421 --> 04:23:50,421
of society and the simultaneous
organization of the psyche and it's that

4867
04:23:50,581 --> 04:23:55,260
process that Nietzsche is talking about
in these paragraphs.

4868
04:23:55,740 --> 04:23:58,620
Now you might ask yourself,
well,

4869
04:23:58,621 --> 04:24:03,621
what's the utility of articulating such
things and them and understanding them,

4870
04:24:04,821 --> 04:24:09,350
and the answer in some ways is
straightforward.

4871
04:24:11,700 --> 04:24:14,490
If you don't want to run a foul of your
own desires,

4872
04:24:14,491 --> 04:24:18,960
you have to organize them.
Because some of them are short term and

4873
04:24:18,961 --> 04:24:22,980
some of them are medium term and some of
them are long term and some of the main

4874
04:24:23,190 --> 04:24:26,580
this and some of the main that,
and it isn't necessarily the case that

4875
04:24:26,581 --> 04:24:30,780
those desires allow for mutual
fulfillment.

4876
04:24:30,781 --> 04:24:33,810
So for example,
maybe you're very interested in pursuing

4877
04:24:33,811 --> 04:24:37,620
a sexual relationship with someone,
but you're also very interested in

4878
04:24:37,621 --> 04:24:41,820
having a family and some stability in
your life or maybe you're interested in

4879
04:24:41,821 --> 04:24:45,540
pursuing a sexual relationship with a
whole sequence of people,

4880
04:24:45,541 --> 04:24:48,750
but you're also interested in having a
family of stabilizing your life.

4881
04:24:48,780 --> 04:24:53,780
It's not obvious that those desires can
exist in the same universe without

4882
04:24:54,751 --> 04:24:59,220
producing what you might think about as
a war and some of that might be a

4883
04:24:59,221 --> 04:25:02,520
psychological war,
but some of it's also going to be a war

4884
04:25:02,850 --> 04:25:07,050
that actually occurs in existence.
Well,

4885
04:25:07,051 --> 04:25:10,350
you're fighting through the
contradictory consequences of wanting to

4886
04:25:10,351 --> 04:25:14,070
pursue many people and formulate a
stable relationship with one person.

4887
04:25:17,780 --> 04:25:18,980
Now,
part of the reason that you want to

4888
04:25:18,981 --> 04:25:23,150
think about these sorts of things is
because if you think about them and get

4889
04:25:23,151 --> 04:25:28,151
your thoughts and your value system
intelligently and coherently cogently

4890
04:25:32,121 --> 04:25:36,620
laid out,
then when you act out that value system

4891
04:25:36,621 --> 04:25:39,380
in the world,
you're going to run into less conflict

4892
04:25:39,381 --> 04:25:42,650
and less uncertainty and less misery and
you're going to have a higher

4893
04:25:42,950 --> 04:25:45,680
probability of getting what it is that
you want,

4894
04:25:46,400 --> 04:25:49,970
but you're also going to have a higher
probability of getting what you want in

4895
04:25:49,971 --> 04:25:54,971
a way that allows you to cooperate with
other people without entering into too

4896
04:25:55,161 --> 04:26:00,050
much conflict with them.
And so in some sense the purpose that

4897
04:26:00,051 --> 04:26:02,120
you think,
the reason that you think are the

4898
04:26:02,121 --> 04:26:07,121
purpose of thinking is so that you can
sort out how you're going to move

4899
04:26:08,001 --> 04:26:13,001
forward in the world without having to
directly run headlong into all the

4900
04:26:14,481 --> 04:26:15,980
obstacles that you might run into.

4901
04:26:15,980 --> 04:26:19,430
If you were doing such a thing blindly.
And so then you might ask yourself,

4902
04:26:19,431 --> 04:26:23,030
well,
why would you bother reading philosophy

4903
04:26:23,031 --> 04:26:25,940
or the philosophy written by someone
who's great?

4904
04:26:25,941 --> 04:26:29,390
And the answer to that is this.
That they can help you think these

4905
04:26:29,391 --> 04:26:34,391
things through in a manner that you
would not be capable of doing on your

4906
04:26:34,791 --> 04:26:35,810
own.
You know,

4907
04:26:35,811 --> 04:26:38,480
because Nisha,
I mean it's,

4908
04:26:38,540 --> 04:26:41,570
it's difficult to estimate how
intelligent Nietzsche it was,

4909
04:26:41,571 --> 04:26:45,590
but I suspect he was perhaps one in a
billion,

4910
04:26:46,310 --> 04:26:51,310
which would put him far beyond the 99
point nine 99th percentile and there's a

4911
04:26:52,671 --> 04:26:57,671
massive difference between the ability
of people to think as you move farther

4912
04:26:58,581 --> 04:27:03,581
and farther out into the extremes
intelligence and when you have the

4913
04:27:03,991 --> 04:27:07,380
writings of someone who's one in a
billion,

4914
04:27:07,830 --> 04:27:11,760
then you can interact with those
writings in a way that enables you,

4915
04:27:11,761 --> 04:27:16,761
if you'll put the time into
benefit from the spectacular fact of

4916
04:27:17,741 --> 04:27:21,640
that intelligence.
Nisha was a full professor by the time

4917
04:27:21,641 --> 04:27:25,330
he was 24 at a time when he didn't even
have to write a dissertation.

4918
04:27:25,331 --> 04:27:29,140
They just made him a full professor at a
time where that was.

4919
04:27:29,620 --> 04:27:30,580
That never happened.

4920
04:27:37,330 --> 04:27:41,710
So this is what he has to say and the
prejudice is a philosopher is just the

4921
04:27:41,711 --> 04:27:44,410
first chapter of the book.
Beyond good and evil.

4922
04:27:46,790 --> 04:27:51,790
It is gradually become clear to me what
every Greek philosophy up until now has

4923
04:27:52,251 --> 04:27:57,251
consisted of namely the confession of
its originator and the species of

4924
04:27:58,251 --> 04:28:01,310
involuntary and unconscious
autobiography.

4925
04:28:03,390 --> 04:28:05,750
Well,
that's deceptive.

4926
04:28:06,980 --> 04:28:10,130
That's a deceptively simple sentence.
Even though it's not a particularly

4927
04:28:10,131 --> 04:28:13,580
simple sentence because it.
It stands on its head.

4928
04:28:13,581 --> 04:28:17,510
What people generally assume about the
process of thinking.

4929
04:28:20,000 --> 04:28:21,710
You generally think that when you're
thinking,

4930
04:28:21,711 --> 04:28:23,860
you're thinking about,
as I mentioned before,

4931
04:28:23,880 --> 04:28:26,730
the structure of the objective world
need shoes,

4932
04:28:26,810 --> 04:28:31,250
is making an entirely different point
here and what he's fundamentally doing

4933
04:28:31,251 --> 04:28:35,300
is treating the philosopher not as a
rational being,

4934
04:28:35,301 --> 04:28:38,870
but as a living being,
and there's a big difference between

4935
04:28:38,871 --> 04:28:41,660
being a rational being and being a
living being.

4936
04:28:41,930 --> 04:28:45,230
Because if you're living being your
primary goal is to do whatever it is

4937
04:28:45,231 --> 04:28:47,540
that furthers your life and if you're a
rational being,

4938
04:28:47,541 --> 04:28:52,010
then your primary goal is to do whatever
it is that a rational being might do.

4939
04:28:52,400 --> 04:28:56,840
And you could say that a living being
should first and foremost be a rational

4940
04:28:56,841 --> 04:29:01,220
being and in some sense that's the
message of the of the Western

4941
04:29:01,221 --> 04:29:04,550
enlightenment.
But it's by no means self evident that

4942
04:29:04,551 --> 04:29:07,180
that's the case and it's certainly not
something that Nietzsche,

4943
04:29:07,330 --> 04:29:08,810
Nietzsche,
he doesn't believe that people are

4944
04:29:08,811 --> 04:29:11,750
rational beings,
certainly not primarily,

4945
04:29:11,751 --> 04:29:14,990
and more importantly,
he isn't exactly convinced that they

4946
04:29:14,991 --> 04:29:16,850
should be so.
So for example,

4947
04:29:16,851 --> 04:29:20,870
one of niches,
most famous maximums is that truth

4948
04:29:20,871 --> 04:29:25,190
serves life and that's a very difficult
different idea.

4949
04:29:25,191 --> 04:29:29,270
Then the purpose of truth say the
accurate representation of the objective

4950
04:29:29,271 --> 04:29:31,790
world.
Those aren't the same thing at all.

4951
04:29:31,970 --> 04:29:32,990
Now you could ask,
well,

4952
04:29:32,991 --> 04:29:34,970
what does it mean for truth to serve
life?

4953
04:29:34,971 --> 04:29:38,360
And if you construe truth that way,
what would truth look like?

4954
04:29:38,780 --> 04:29:42,890
And you know the mere statement,
the truths should serve life doesn't

4955
04:29:43,220 --> 04:29:45,380
offer you the answers to those
questions,

4956
04:29:45,650 --> 04:29:46,483
but

4957
04:29:48,720 --> 04:29:50,580
but it,
it's the beginning of a different

4958
04:29:50,581 --> 04:29:53,880
metaphysics.
And in some sense of metaphysics,

4959
04:29:53,881 --> 04:29:58,881
which is say the universe within which a
philosopher might operate a metaphysics

4960
04:29:59,350 --> 04:30:04,350
is the initial structure of
presuppositions within which a view of

4961
04:30:05,921 --> 04:30:10,921
the world is organized.
One presupposition might be human beings

4962
04:30:12,861 --> 04:30:17,861
are rational and that we're attempting
to formulate and improve our sense of

4963
04:30:18,701 --> 04:30:21,190
the objective world,
our formulation of the objective world,

4964
04:30:21,191 --> 04:30:25,510
and another would be that you would be.
These aren't rational or irrational and

4965
04:30:25,511 --> 04:30:27,940
that we're.
What we're motivated to do is to live

4966
04:30:28,150 --> 04:30:31,810
whatever that means and that the purpose
of our thinking and our philosophy

4967
04:30:31,811 --> 04:30:35,670
should be to facilitate our living and
that's neat use.

4968
04:30:35,740 --> 04:30:40,740
That's one of the foundation
blocks of niches philosophy.

4969
04:30:43,420 --> 04:30:46,900
So He's a moral philosopher
fundamentally because morality is about

4970
04:30:46,901 --> 04:30:50,560
values and the values essentially values
are

4971
04:30:52,230 --> 04:30:54,060
you could say values are what you aim
for,

4972
04:30:54,061 --> 04:30:58,140
but it's more complicated than that.
Values actually constitute the lens

4973
04:30:58,141 --> 04:31:01,560
through which you view the world.
So it's partly what you're aiming at,

4974
04:31:01,561 --> 04:31:05,370
but it's also partly your conception of
who you are now and where you are.

4975
04:31:05,580 --> 04:31:10,110
And it's also part that your conception
of how you're going to get to where it

4976
04:31:10,111 --> 04:31:15,111
is that you want to be.
And it's also partly the psychological

4977
04:31:16,021 --> 04:31:20,310
system that you use to parse up the
world so that it reveals to you the

4978
04:31:20,311 --> 04:31:23,610
pathway that you could take to get to
what you want to value values,

4979
04:31:23,611 --> 04:31:26,100
all of that,
and then it's more than that because you

4980
04:31:26,101 --> 04:31:30,150
could say that you have added value
which contains all of that,

4981
04:31:30,151 --> 04:31:33,570
but then you can say that you have a set
of values which is the arrangement of

4982
04:31:33,571 --> 04:31:35,580
all about.
And then you can say that you have a set

4983
04:31:35,581 --> 04:31:37,950
of values that's the arrangement of all
that,

4984
04:31:38,130 --> 04:31:42,510
that you have to arrange with other
people and then you could say that you

4985
04:31:42,511 --> 04:31:45,570
have all that and you have to arrange it
with other people and you have to

4986
04:31:45,571 --> 04:31:49,230
arrange it across different spans of
time because what you want today and

4987
04:31:49,231 --> 04:31:52,590
what you want next week and what you
want next month are not necessarily the

4988
04:31:52,591 --> 04:31:55,860
same thing and one does not necessarily
lead into the other.

4989
04:31:56,400 --> 04:32:00,150
So to be a moral philosopher is to
examine how that,

4990
04:32:01,170 --> 04:32:04,140
what that system is and how it operates
and how it came about.

4991
04:32:04,200 --> 04:32:06,730
Now,
one of the things that nature says is it

4992
04:32:06,731 --> 04:32:09,990
has gradually become clear to me what
every Greek philosophy up until now is

4993
04:32:09,991 --> 04:32:14,280
consisted of namely the confession of
its originator and the species of

4994
04:32:14,281 --> 04:32:16,610
involuntary and unconscious
autobiography.

4995
04:32:17,160 --> 04:32:21,390
So his claim fundamentally is that no
matter what the philosopher thinks he's

4996
04:32:21,391 --> 04:32:23,370
doing well,
he's reading philosophy.

4997
04:32:23,550 --> 04:32:28,550
What he's actually doing is revealing
and articulating his being,

4998
04:32:30,990 --> 04:32:31,940
and then you might say,
well,

4999
04:32:31,941 --> 04:32:35,580
where did that be income from?
And the answer to that is,

5000
04:32:35,640 --> 04:32:38,100
well,
partly it's you could consider it a

5001
04:32:38,101 --> 04:32:42,600
biological function in so far as that we
have value structures that are built

5002
04:32:42,601 --> 04:32:45,840
into us that are in the process.
We would say the process of a very long

5003
04:32:45,841 --> 04:32:49,830
evolutionary history,
but because you're also a cultural

5004
04:32:49,860 --> 04:32:54,210
phenomena and because the manner in
which you've arranged your values and

5005
04:32:54,211 --> 04:32:59,211
your desires has been conditioned to the
degree by the process of enculturation

5006
04:33:00,711 --> 04:33:03,290
that you were subjected to when you

5007
04:33:05,740 --> 04:33:10,510
confessed and an autobiographical manner
and articulate that what you're also

5008
04:33:10,511 --> 04:33:15,511
doing is really capitulating the entire
structure of your culture.

5009
04:33:15,730 --> 04:33:17,230
It's in you and you might say,
well,

5010
04:33:17,231 --> 04:33:18,930
where is it in you?
And that,

5011
04:33:19,060 --> 04:33:20,200
and what does it,
you mean,

5012
04:33:20,201 --> 04:33:25,201
part of it means is that you act out a
pattern of behavior and that pattern of

5013
04:33:25,451 --> 04:33:30,451
behavior is like a dance that someone is
manifesting to a symphonic score.

5014
04:33:30,761 --> 04:33:35,761
It's unbelievably complicated and it has
its psychological elements and some of

5015
04:33:36,251 --> 04:33:37,930
those are conscious and some of them
aren't.

5016
04:33:37,960 --> 04:33:40,690
Some of them are just implicit in bedded
in the way you act,

5017
04:33:40,691 --> 04:33:42,940
in the way you perceive.
And what the philosopher is attempting

5018
04:33:42,941 --> 04:33:47,941
to do is to reveal those to himself and
to articulate them so that the entire

5019
04:33:48,791 --> 04:33:51,120
structure can be analyzed.
Well.

5020
04:33:51,130 --> 04:33:54,220
So niches,
first proposition is that when a

5021
04:33:54,400 --> 04:33:58,000
philosopher is thinking that what he's
doing is not thinking,

5022
04:33:58,270 --> 04:34:01,360
it's revealing himself in an
autobiographical sense,

5023
04:34:01,361 --> 04:34:04,600
under the guise of rational thinking.
And so then it becomes something more

5024
04:34:04,601 --> 04:34:05,470
like a story.

5025
04:34:06,380 --> 04:34:07,213
Um,

5026
04:34:08,570 --> 04:34:11,720
well,
any governors all about in the first two

5027
04:34:11,721 --> 04:34:14,630
phrases.
So that gives you some example,

5028
04:34:14,840 --> 04:34:17,060
some indication of what this book is
like,

5029
04:34:19,430 --> 04:34:22,790
a species of involuntary unconscious
autobiography.

5030
04:34:26,360 --> 04:34:28,160
Well,
that's a more complicated idea too

5031
04:34:28,161 --> 04:34:29,150
because you might say,
well,

5032
04:34:29,151 --> 04:34:32,330
why would someone be driven in an
involuntary way,

5033
04:34:32,580 --> 04:34:37,340
in an unconscious way to describe their
autobiography,

5034
04:34:38,250 --> 04:34:39,083
and

5035
04:34:39,330 --> 04:34:43,110
that's a very complicated question.
It might be that one of the reasons that

5036
04:34:43,111 --> 04:34:45,930
people valued one another is because we

5037
04:34:47,860 --> 04:34:52,390
engaged in the process of sharing deeply
autobiographical information.

5038
04:34:53,260 --> 04:34:55,450
You tell me your story and I tell you my
story,

5039
04:34:55,451 --> 04:34:56,650
and you might say,
well,

5040
04:34:56,651 --> 04:34:58,510
why?
Why do we even bother with such things?

5041
04:34:58,511 --> 04:35:02,350
And the answer to that as well.
If you can tell me about the pain and

5042
04:35:02,351 --> 04:35:07,351
tragedy that you've encountered,
then that gives me a better way of that

5043
04:35:07,811 --> 04:35:11,800
gives me a better vision of the dangers
of the world without actually having to

5044
04:35:11,801 --> 04:35:14,590
expose myself to those dangerous except
in simulation.

5045
04:35:14,591 --> 04:35:17,320
I might feel sorry for you.
I might feel bad about your tragic

5046
04:35:17,321 --> 04:35:19,960
experiences,
but I'm not bleeding for them.

5047
04:35:20,470 --> 04:35:23,590
And then there's always the possibility
that you'll also tell me how you solved

5048
04:35:23,591 --> 04:35:26,650
your problem.
In which case I can either avoid that

5049
04:35:26,651 --> 04:35:30,310
problem entirely or if I do encounter a
consultant without having to go through.

5050
04:35:30,460 --> 04:35:34,540
Maybe it took you decades to formulate
your solution to that problem and you

5051
04:35:34,541 --> 04:35:37,120
can tell me your story and then I have
the information,

5052
04:35:37,540 --> 04:35:40,000
and so that's part of what human beings
are always trading.

5053
04:35:40,150 --> 04:35:42,850
That's why we talk to each other.
That's why we can communicate,

5054
04:35:43,300 --> 04:35:44,440
and so Nietzsche would say,
well,

5055
04:35:44,441 --> 04:35:46,600
it's.
It's involuntary unconscious,

5056
04:35:46,960 --> 04:35:51,460
involuntary unconscious.
He's alluding to the fact that that

5057
04:35:51,461 --> 04:35:54,000
proclivity is so deeply embedded in
people.

5058
04:35:54,250 --> 04:35:58,890
The desire to make an autobiographical
recounting that

5059
04:36:02,060 --> 04:36:06,680
it serves as a kind of motivation that
we don't question for doing almost

5060
04:36:06,681 --> 04:36:09,220
everything that we do.
So you know,

5061
04:36:09,240 --> 04:36:12,890
I mean,
people do such things as a 10 movies and

5062
04:36:12,891 --> 04:36:17,530
plays and they usually do that happily,
especially if the movie or the play is a

5063
04:36:17,540 --> 04:36:19,940
high quality.
And the same thing happens when people

5064
04:36:19,941 --> 04:36:20,840
are reading novels.

5065
04:36:23,130 --> 04:36:27,370
They're attracted to such things.
They have a built in value and it's very

5066
04:36:27,371 --> 04:36:30,190
rarely the case that people will ever
question why it is that they're doing

5067
04:36:30,191 --> 04:36:31,300
such things.
In fact,

5068
04:36:31,600 --> 04:36:34,540
you see this quite commonly with
students who were first introduced to

5069
04:36:34,541 --> 04:36:39,541
the study of literature.
The introduction of the idea that you

5070
04:36:39,551 --> 04:36:44,551
should analyze what it is that you're
engaged in when you're reading actually

5071
04:36:47,260 --> 04:36:51,910
comes as unwelcome news to most people
who are inclined towards fiction because

5072
04:36:51,911 --> 04:36:54,670
they don't want to interfere with the
process of engagement,

5073
04:36:54,970 --> 04:36:57,100
you know,
automatic unconscious engagement with

5074
04:36:57,101 --> 04:37:01,360
the material by detaching themselves and
having to think about what they're

5075
04:37:01,361 --> 04:37:04,660
doing.
So that's why it's an involuntary

5076
04:37:04,670 --> 04:37:05,700
unconscious.
It's,

5077
04:37:05,730 --> 04:37:06,610
it's,
it's,

5078
04:37:06,700 --> 04:37:10,690
it's one of the things within which
thoughts operates rather than one of the

5079
04:37:10,691 --> 04:37:15,691
things on which thought operates.
Then he says,

5080
04:37:16,961 --> 04:37:20,830
the moral or immoral purpose in which
every philosophy has constituted.

5081
04:37:21,420 --> 04:37:24,760
Sorry,
the moral or immoral purpose in every

5082
04:37:24,761 --> 04:37:29,761
philosophy has constituted the true
vital germ out of which the entire plant

5083
04:37:30,820 --> 04:37:32,890
has always grown.
Well.

5084
04:37:32,891 --> 04:37:37,000
That's a hell of a thing to say too,
because what niche is alluding to there

5085
04:37:37,001 --> 04:37:38,120
in some senses that

5086
04:37:45,500 --> 04:37:49,640
the philosopher Kant help and that would
be in some sense also the person who was

5087
04:37:49,641 --> 04:37:54,200
recounting their autobiography can't
help but tell you what they're up to.

5088
04:37:55,160 --> 04:37:59,000
Even though they might not know,
and this is something that you own

5089
04:37:59,001 --> 04:38:02,120
because you almost carl,
you'll know the cyclist psychoanalyst

5090
04:38:02,121 --> 04:38:07,121
was a great student of nature and you
came to believe that we all inhabited

5091
04:38:09,650 --> 04:38:12,140
stories.
The stories were stories we didn't have

5092
04:38:12,141 --> 04:38:15,950
in the garage with the structures of
value within which we live and that

5093
04:38:15,951 --> 04:38:20,951
those stories essentially had an ethic
or a moral and then you you can start

5094
04:38:21,531 --> 04:38:24,950
thinking about what the ethics and the
morals might be and you kind of have

5095
04:38:24,951 --> 04:38:28,010
some sense of that because there's.
There's comedic stories and tragic

5096
04:38:28,011 --> 04:38:31,220
stories and there's evil characters in
good and characters and so forth.

5097
04:38:31,221 --> 04:38:34,550
Those are architected characters,
but part of the point that niches

5098
04:38:34,551 --> 04:38:37,550
attempting to make here is that the
philosopher is in fact aiming at

5099
04:38:37,551 --> 04:38:41,120
something with his life,
with all of his actions.

5100
04:38:41,180 --> 04:38:44,750
He might not even know what it is,
but partly what he's doing in his

5101
04:38:44,751 --> 04:38:49,400
attempt to philosophize is to articulate
that in reveal it to himself and to

5102
04:38:49,401 --> 04:38:50,234
other people.

5103
04:38:54,410 --> 04:38:56,150
So then the question becomes,
well,

5104
04:38:56,360 --> 04:38:58,040
what is it that the person is off to
you?

5105
04:38:58,041 --> 04:39:01,440
And I would say in some sense that's the
ultimate question and so neat you here

5106
04:39:01,520 --> 04:39:03,980
in this paragraph,
it is also dealing with the,

5107
04:39:04,550 --> 04:39:09,170
with the ultimate question in life,
which might be well to what is your life

5108
04:39:09,710 --> 04:39:11,270
aimed?
And you might say,

5109
04:39:11,271 --> 04:39:13,820
well it's not entered anything into.
I don't know.

5110
04:39:13,860 --> 04:39:16,040
I don't seem to have any coherent set of
beliefs.

5111
04:39:16,041 --> 04:39:18,380
I don't know what I believe.
I don't believe in anything even.

5112
04:39:18,880 --> 04:39:22,670
But that's not the case because if you
didn't believe in anything you couldn't

5113
04:39:22,671 --> 04:39:26,000
see.
You have to believe in something to be

5114
04:39:26,001 --> 04:39:29,330
able to see because you point your eyes
and things and you can organize your

5115
04:39:29,360 --> 04:39:33,380
vision without having an aim.
And so the very act of interacting with

5116
04:39:33,381 --> 04:39:38,381
the world presupposes an ethic.
And then all those micro ethics that you

5117
04:39:39,110 --> 04:39:43,850
contain within you are organized into
some sort of structure either badly or

5118
04:39:43,851 --> 04:39:44,600
well.

5119
04:39:44,600 --> 04:39:48,890
And that structure roughly has an aim
and you might know it and you might not.

5120
04:39:48,920 --> 04:39:50,370
But that doesn't mean that this
therapist.

5121
04:39:50,371 --> 04:39:52,070
So,
so one other thing that needs he is

5122
04:39:52,071 --> 04:39:56,330
alluding to is that you believe things
whether or not you think you believed

5123
04:39:56,331 --> 04:39:58,070
them,
in fairness,

5124
04:39:58,100 --> 04:39:58,990
believing them,
unknowing,

5125
04:39:59,090 --> 04:40:01,430
you believed them,
aren't even the same thing,

5126
04:40:01,910 --> 04:40:06,170
and so the people believe all sorts of
things that they don't know about and

5127
04:40:06,171 --> 04:40:08,570
that partly what they're doing when
they're doing philosophy is to try and

5128
04:40:08,590 --> 04:40:10,400
figure out what those things are.
When you know,

5129
04:40:10,401 --> 04:40:12,680
when you can also ask yourself,
well where did they come from?

5130
04:40:13,580 --> 04:40:14,840
Well,
they partly came from you,

5131
04:40:14,841 --> 04:40:17,390
but you,
you're an old thing.

5132
04:40:18,440 --> 04:40:22,700
Your physical form is three and a half
billion years old and you're the process

5133
04:40:22,701 --> 04:40:26,270
of all that.
All of the death and struggling that

5134
04:40:26,271 --> 04:40:31,271
went along the entire course of that
three and a half billion years is you

5135
04:40:31,491 --> 04:40:36,491
carry that with you and then on top of
that inside you is the consequence of

5136
04:40:37,251 --> 04:40:40,640
the entire cultural history of complex
life.

5137
04:40:40,820 --> 04:40:43,700
That's all inside youtube.
And then on top of that,

5138
04:40:43,701 --> 04:40:46,730
some of that's articulated more or less,
some it's acted out,

5139
04:40:47,060 --> 04:40:49,550
dramatized,
represented infection and that sort of

5140
04:40:49,551 --> 04:40:51,500
thing.
And then some of it's articulated,

5141
04:40:51,980 --> 04:40:56,980
but there's way more at the bottom.
Then it is fully articulate and so god

5142
04:40:57,321 --> 04:41:00,110
only knows what you're up to.
And then you might say,

5143
04:41:00,111 --> 04:41:00,944
well,
who cares?

5144
04:41:00,960 --> 04:41:03,350
Well,
the problem with that is that you care

5145
04:41:03,351 --> 04:41:05,630
because first of all,
that's the definition of caring and

5146
04:41:05,631 --> 04:41:10,631
second of all that determines the the
way that you'll move through your life

5147
04:41:12,170 --> 04:41:16,340
and everything that happens to you
that's good or evil or good or bad is

5148
04:41:16,341 --> 04:41:19,370
going to be a consequence of the
manifestation of that ethic in the

5149
04:41:19,371 --> 04:41:20,204
world.

5150
04:41:23,700 --> 04:41:25,710
So and now,
Nina is saying something else too.

5151
04:41:25,711 --> 04:41:30,711
When he says the moral or immoral
purpose in whichever in the moral or

5152
04:41:31,291 --> 04:41:36,090
immoral purpose in every philosophy as
constituted the true vital germ out of

5153
04:41:36,091 --> 04:41:38,040
which the entire plant is always
growing.

5154
04:41:39,710 --> 04:41:44,280
He's saying that the philosopher can't
help but reveal his age and his writings

5155
04:41:44,910 --> 04:41:49,650
and then he's saying something else
which is that he might be malevolent and

5156
04:41:50,150 --> 04:41:52,820
you know,
modern people are very comfortable with

5157
04:41:52,821 --> 04:41:57,260
ideas like malevolence because
malevolence is an idea that's related to

5158
04:41:57,261 --> 04:42:02,261
evil and modern people think of
themselves as beyond good and evil to

5159
04:42:02,601 --> 04:42:05,570
some degree.
They don't believe in the reality of

5160
04:42:05,571 --> 04:42:08,630
those concepts.
And of course in this book is also

5161
04:42:08,631 --> 04:42:12,650
questioning our,
at least our a priori presuppositions

5162
04:42:12,651 --> 04:42:16,250
about what do they need the lore,
but that doesn't mean that he doesn't

5163
04:42:16,251 --> 04:42:20,390
believe that they don't exist.
That doesn't mean that he doesn't

5164
04:42:20,391 --> 04:42:22,130
believe that they don't exist.
Yes,

5165
04:42:22,131 --> 04:42:23,660
I guess that's.
I guess that's right.

5166
04:42:27,480 --> 04:42:29,010
You know,
this is one of the things I've thought

5167
04:42:29,011 --> 04:42:32,130
about when I was thinking about when
I've thought about how Hitler guide,

5168
04:42:32,830 --> 04:42:33,930
no,
Hitler died.

5169
04:42:35,730 --> 04:42:39,510
Hitler committed suicide in the bunker
underneath Berlin when Europe was in

5170
04:42:39,511 --> 04:42:40,344
flames.

5171
04:42:41,770 --> 04:42:42,680
And so one

5172
04:42:44,510 --> 04:42:49,510
conclusion that a psychoanalytically
minded historian could derive from that

5173
04:42:49,701 --> 04:42:53,780
is that's what he wanted.
Right?

5174
04:42:54,110 --> 04:42:59,110
And then that opens up an entire vast
nest of snakes because one of the things

5175
04:43:00,591 --> 04:43:01,790
that you might ask is,
well,

5176
04:43:02,390 --> 04:43:04,040
how is it that someone would desire
that?

5177
04:43:04,070 --> 04:43:05,840
First of all,
could that even be desired?

5178
04:43:05,870 --> 04:43:08,110
Is that actually something that anyone
could even desire?

5179
04:43:09,620 --> 04:43:13,010
Then you might ask,
well why is it that someone would design

5180
04:43:13,011 --> 04:43:15,950
that?
And then the next thing you might ask is

5181
04:43:16,130 --> 04:43:20,540
if a human being could desire that and
hit there was a human being then exactly

5182
04:43:20,541 --> 04:43:23,240
what does that say about you?
And you might say,

5183
04:43:23,241 --> 04:43:24,770
well,
I could never desire such a thing,

5184
04:43:25,220 --> 04:43:27,680
but following the long,
the train of the argument that we've

5185
04:43:27,681 --> 04:43:29,780
been laying out,
just like what makes you think you're a

5186
04:43:29,781 --> 04:43:31,790
reliable judge of what it is that you're
up to.

5187
04:43:33,440 --> 04:43:34,700
So,
okay,

5188
04:43:34,701 --> 04:43:39,701
so now we've unpack three sentences and
we'll continue on with the same

5189
04:43:40,880 --> 04:43:45,880
paragraph.
Indeed to understand how the most

5190
04:43:45,981 --> 04:43:50,450
abstract metaphysical assertions of a
philosopher have been arrived at.

5191
04:43:51,550 --> 04:43:55,430
It is always well.
And why is to first ask oneself what

5192
04:43:55,431 --> 04:44:00,431
morality do they or does he aim at?
So what the question is,

5193
04:44:01,790 --> 04:44:02,870
what's the personality?

5194
04:44:04,490 --> 04:44:05,323
Well,

5195
04:44:06,840 --> 04:44:10,170
there's an entire narrative snakes
underneath that sentence,

5196
04:44:10,260 --> 04:44:15,260
that sequence of propositions as well,
and one of them is,

5197
04:44:27,250 --> 04:44:28,900
well,
what does it mean that people are up to

5198
04:44:28,901 --> 04:44:31,590
something?
What does it mean that the rating itself

5199
04:44:37,000 --> 04:44:39,310
accordingly,
I do not believe that an impulse to

5200
04:44:39,311 --> 04:44:43,690
knowledge is the father of philosophy,
but that another impulse here as

5201
04:44:43,691 --> 04:44:48,691
elsewhere has only made use of knowledge
and mistaken knowledge as an

5202
04:44:51,050 --> 04:44:54,410
but whoever considers the fundamental
impulses of man with a view to

5203
04:44:54,411 --> 04:44:57,290
determining how far are be up here after
this inspiring.

5204
04:44:57,320 --> 04:45:00,050
No,
this is partly why this is going to

5205
04:45:00,051 --> 04:45:02,510
require editing so complicated to go
through

5206
04:45:08,400 --> 04:45:10,440
accordingly.
I do not believe that an impulse

5207
04:45:10,450 --> 04:45:12,240
technologist,
the part of philosophy,

5208
04:45:13,440 --> 04:45:15,480
but then another impulse here is
elsewhere,

5209
04:45:15,690 --> 04:45:19,590
has only made use of knowledge and
mistaken knowledge as an instrument.

5210
04:45:19,830 --> 04:45:22,290
All right,
so let's take that apart accordingly.

5211
04:45:22,291 --> 04:45:26,400
I do not believe that an impulse to
knowledge is the father of philosophy.

5212
04:45:27,720 --> 04:45:30,990
So one of the claims,
I suppose this would be an enlightenment

5213
04:45:31,050 --> 04:45:36,050
claim is that people do have a drive to
knowledge and that that drive is in fact

5214
04:45:37,080 --> 04:45:42,080
what underlies the production of such
things as philosophy but need to

5215
04:45:42,270 --> 04:45:46,530
questions that because he's trying to
bring us back to consideration of the

5216
04:45:46,531 --> 04:45:51,531
fact that you can't separate the
philosophers mind from the philosophers

5217
04:45:51,840 --> 04:45:55,050
Ba.
He's first and foremost a living

5218
04:45:55,140 --> 04:45:59,820
creature and that he's up to something
and the question is what is it that he's

5219
04:45:59,821 --> 04:46:03,390
up to?
And so you can see the earliest

5220
04:46:03,391 --> 04:46:07,830
manifestations in a paragraph like this
of what later developed into

5221
04:46:07,831 --> 04:46:12,831
deconstructionist thought and that that
was mostly French continental

5222
04:46:13,470 --> 04:46:18,470
philosophers who pursued that particular
line of reasoning and it.

5223
04:46:19,750 --> 04:46:24,180
It is derived exactly from this kind of
statement by nature.

5224
04:46:24,960 --> 04:46:26,660
So for example,
someone like Garrett,

5225
04:46:26,661 --> 04:46:30,930
I would say
it doesn't matter what the content of

5226
04:46:30,931 --> 04:46:34,050
the text is.
What matters is that the text can be

5227
04:46:34,051 --> 04:46:38,010
used as a tool for power and then
whether the person who wrote the text

5228
04:46:38,011 --> 04:46:40,320
knew it or not,
that's what they were doing and they

5229
04:46:40,321 --> 04:46:44,670
were doing it in a way to privilege
themselves above other people and that's

5230
04:46:44,671 --> 04:46:45,421
really,
I would say,

5231
04:46:45,421 --> 04:46:49,200
the fundamental deconstructionist claim
and it's a powerful claimants and

5232
04:46:49,380 --> 04:46:52,770
utterly corrupt claim,
but it's a really powerful claim and

5233
04:46:52,771 --> 04:46:57,771
it's related directly to the sorts of
things that need you was referring to in

5234
04:46:57,811 --> 04:47:00,450
this paragraph.
What is it that the person is truly up

5235
04:47:00,451 --> 04:47:01,171
to?
Now,

5236
04:47:01,171 --> 04:47:03,160
the problem with the deconstructionist
claim,

5237
04:47:03,161 --> 04:47:03,930
Ms Dot,
it's an.

5238
04:47:03,930 --> 04:47:07,530
It's an open invitation to cynicism to
thoughtless citizens.

5239
04:47:07,590 --> 04:47:11,820
I can just make the presupposition that
whatever it is that you're telling me,

5240
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:15,210
you're you,
you're telling me merely to dominate

5241
04:47:15,660 --> 04:47:18,270
regardless of what it is that you claim
to be doing.

5242
04:47:19,050 --> 04:47:22,710
Well.
The problem with that approach is that

5243
04:47:24,600 --> 04:47:29,280
it's predicated on the implicit
assumption that the only value that

5244
04:47:29,281 --> 04:47:32,850
people actually have is the value to is
the desire to dominate.

5245
04:47:33,300 --> 04:47:36,390
And of course that's a purely like that
could be the case.

5246
04:47:36,391 --> 04:47:41,040
And I also think that it's even
reasonable to posit that to some degree

5247
04:47:41,041 --> 04:47:44,370
that it is the case,
but to take that from a contributing

5248
04:47:44,371 --> 04:47:48,490
factor and to make that the highest God
because that's essentially what the

5249
04:47:48,520 --> 04:47:52,510
deconstructionists are doing.
Those are entirely different things and

5250
04:47:52,750 --> 04:47:57,750
you have to be aware of people who
take a single causal element and

5251
04:47:58,360 --> 04:48:03,360
elevated to the stature of single
comprehensive cause.

5252
04:48:04,600 --> 04:48:07,510
You know,
it's more reasonable to assume that

5253
04:48:07,511 --> 04:48:11,590
people are complex in their motivations
and that many different strands of

5254
04:48:11,860 --> 04:48:15,910
biological and cultural motivation are
in some sense primary.

5255
04:48:15,911 --> 04:48:20,500
And then what happens is that they come
together to weave a tapestry rather than

5256
04:48:20,501 --> 04:48:24,520
to make the automatic assumption that
you can reduce the entire set of human

5257
04:48:24,521 --> 04:48:27,270
motivations to a single principle like
that power.

5258
04:48:27,490 --> 04:48:29,830
Now you know,
I would say niche is also responsible to

5259
04:48:29,831 --> 04:48:32,460
some degree for the deconstructionists
claim,

5260
04:48:32,680 --> 04:48:37,680
that it's power because one of his most
famous other instance was that the

5261
04:48:37,800 --> 04:48:41,410
fundamental motivating force in life is
the will to power.

5262
04:48:42,520 --> 04:48:46,390
But he wasn't so much because nature is
a subtle thinker.

5263
04:48:46,420 --> 04:48:50,830
He wasn't so much attempting to reduce
human motivation to power.

5264
04:48:51,280 --> 04:48:56,020
He was attempting to redefine what it
was that we conceptualized as power,

5265
04:48:56,770 --> 04:48:59,530
whereas that isn't what the
deconstruction certainly get all because

5266
04:48:59,531 --> 04:49:01,990
fundamentally they're Marxists and they
believe that,

5267
04:49:02,310 --> 04:49:04,330
you know,
will they just ensconced themselves

5268
04:49:04,331 --> 04:49:09,331
within an economic viewpoint where
within a philosophical viewpoint where

5269
04:49:09,821 --> 04:49:14,821
economics is paramount and where all
that matters is power construed as

5270
04:49:15,730 --> 04:49:19,280
socioeconomic domination,
fundamental,

5271
04:49:19,930 --> 04:49:23,040
you know,
and that's in turn is embedded in

5272
04:49:23,060 --> 04:49:24,550
metaphysics.
That's even deeper,

5273
04:49:24,551 --> 04:49:27,460
which is the metaphysics of presumed
that people are fundamentally

5274
04:49:27,461 --> 04:49:30,250
materialist and all of those things are
quick.

5275
04:49:30,450 --> 04:49:31,840
You know,
all of those things are highly

5276
04:49:31,841 --> 04:49:36,841
questionable.
So I'm going to skip ahead a little bit

5277
04:49:48,261 --> 04:49:53,261
with the paragraph when it talks about
the motivations of you might consider

5278
04:49:56,351 --> 04:50:00,030
them
people who were working in the middle

5279
04:50:00,031 --> 04:50:03,630
ranks of bureaucracies,
whether they're scientific or otherwise,

5280
04:50:03,930 --> 04:50:07,440
so they're in some sense acting as
columns in a particular machine.

5281
04:50:07,441 --> 04:50:09,720
And so that's what he's describing here.
He says,

5282
04:50:14,450 --> 04:50:18,500
in the case of scholars,
or in the case of really scientific men,

5283
04:50:20,180 --> 04:50:23,870
it may be there may really be such a
thing as an impulse,

5284
04:50:23,871 --> 04:50:27,470
didn't punch some kind of small
independent clockwork,

5285
04:50:27,500 --> 04:50:32,500
which when well wound up works away
industriously to that end without the

5286
04:50:33,171 --> 04:50:38,171
rest of the scholarly impulses taking
any material part there in the actual

5287
04:50:38,691 --> 04:50:41,840
interests of the scholar,
therefore are generally and quite

5288
04:50:41,841 --> 04:50:46,070
another direction.
It is the family or moneymaking or in

5289
04:50:46,071 --> 04:50:49,040
politics.
It is in fact almost indifferent at what

5290
04:50:49,041 --> 04:50:52,750
point of research his little machine is
placed and whether the hopefully you

5291
04:50:52,760 --> 04:50:56,660
don't worker becomes a good fit.
Ologist someone who's studied the origin

5292
04:50:56,661 --> 04:50:59,060
of words,
a mushroom specialist for a chemist.

5293
04:50:59,300 --> 04:51:01,730
He's not characterize becoming this by
this.

5294
04:51:02,150 --> 04:51:04,520
He's not characterized by becoming this
or that

5295
04:51:09,450 --> 04:51:11,940
niches point.
They're fundamentally is that even when

5296
04:51:11,941 --> 04:51:14,280
you do analyze people who in whom

5297
04:51:16,330 --> 04:51:21,330
the will to knowledge might actually be
offered it even though he wouldn't be

5298
04:51:21,461 --> 04:51:25,240
willing to grant it.
The status of highest motivating power

5299
04:51:25,720 --> 04:51:28,960
that even in those people were that
Wilton always does exist.

5300
04:51:28,961 --> 04:51:33,880
The probability that that is in turn
subordinated to some other principle

5301
04:51:34,060 --> 04:51:36,220
that's higher in the value hierarchy is
very,

5302
04:51:36,221 --> 04:51:40,750
very high and it's hard to tell exactly
what that additional principle might be,

5303
04:51:40,751 --> 04:51:44,200
but he points out such things as well.
Maybe they're primarily interested in

5304
04:51:44,201 --> 04:51:46,750
serving the interests of their family or
they're,

5305
04:51:46,890 --> 04:51:50,320
I'm really interested in making money or
maybe they're primarily interested in

5306
04:51:50,321 --> 04:51:53,860
status and maybe they're interested in
status status becomes a because it makes

5307
04:51:53,861 --> 04:51:56,110
them more sexually attractive and that
sort of thing.

5308
04:51:56,830 --> 04:51:57,680
So,
but the,

5309
04:51:58,490 --> 04:51:59,323
the,

5310
04:52:00,430 --> 04:52:05,430
the question of what is it that's
lurking in the background is always

5311
04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:07,870
paramount,
so

5312
04:52:10,010 --> 04:52:11,610
not there.

5313
04:52:15,020 --> 04:52:20,020
Detour in this particular paragraph,
whoever considers the fundamental

5314
04:52:24,461 --> 04:52:29,461
impulses of man with a view to
determining how far they may have here

5315
04:52:29,741 --> 04:52:34,741
acted as inspiring Jenai
or his demons will find that they have

5316
04:52:35,921 --> 04:52:40,240
all practice philosophy at one time or
another and then each of them would have

5317
04:52:40,241 --> 04:52:45,241
been only too glad to look upon itself
as the ultimate end of existence and the

5318
04:52:45,611 --> 04:52:48,550
legitimate lord over all of the other
impulses.

5319
04:52:49,500 --> 04:52:54,500
That's another like the beyond good and
evil to think of it as a book is a

5320
04:52:54,701 --> 04:52:56,080
really foolish

5321
04:53:01,350 --> 04:53:03,480
framework.
You don't [inaudible] this is what a

5322
04:53:03,481 --> 04:53:07,190
book is when people think about a book.
No,

5323
04:53:07,230 --> 04:53:12,230
it's like a material entity say eight
inches high and six inches wide and two

5324
04:53:13,681 --> 04:53:17,490
inches thick and weighs a pound and it's
made of paper and it's between two to

5325
04:53:17,510 --> 04:53:22,440
two covers you and that's a materialist.
That's the eight priority sort of

5326
04:53:22,441 --> 04:53:27,441
axiomatic book niches beyond good and
evil isn't a book at all.

5327
04:53:28,771 --> 04:53:33,771
It's a series of bombs at each sentence
is a ball and each sentence blows things

5328
04:53:35,731 --> 04:53:39,690
up that people don't even know exist.
And so one of the things with this

5329
04:53:39,691 --> 04:53:40,770
sentence,
for example,

5330
04:53:41,550 --> 04:53:46,550
here's how he's conceptualizing being so
the first thing he talks about is that

5331
04:53:47,550 --> 04:53:49,910
the.
There are fundamental impulses that you

5332
04:53:49,920 --> 04:53:51,510
would be.
Okay.

5333
04:53:51,511 --> 04:53:53,800
So that begs the questions.
What?

5334
04:53:53,810 --> 04:53:57,330
What do you mean by impulse and what do
you mean by fundamental?

5335
04:53:58,410 --> 04:54:01,800
And both of those are extraordinarily
complicated problems.

5336
04:54:01,950 --> 04:54:05,190
So an impulse you can take it to the
impulses that drive.

5337
04:54:05,940 --> 04:54:08,040
You can think about it as a biological
instinct.

5338
04:54:09,460 --> 04:54:11,640
He could think about it as an aim or a
goal.

5339
04:54:12,000 --> 04:54:13,890
You can think about it as an act of
will.

5340
04:54:14,190 --> 04:54:18,810
Like there's,
there's endless questions that hang off

5341
04:54:18,811 --> 04:54:21,810
that question,
but we could start with the idea that we

5342
04:54:22,830 --> 04:54:25,860
perhaps can't define it,
but we are willing to go with the

5343
04:54:25,861 --> 04:54:29,640
proposition that people do have the
impulses and I think maybe that's

5344
04:54:29,641 --> 04:54:33,840
manifest to you more.
Most particularly when you're attempting

5345
04:54:33,841 --> 04:54:38,841
to do something voluntarily and
something in voluntarily interferes with

5346
04:54:39,511 --> 04:54:40,261
that.
You know,

5347
04:54:40,261 --> 04:54:45,180
so maybe you're sitting down to to try
to get some work done in the work is not

5348
04:54:45,181 --> 04:54:49,500
of any particular intrinsic interest,
but you regarded it as necessary.

5349
04:54:49,770 --> 04:54:52,170
You know,
necessary element in some higher order

5350
04:54:52,171 --> 04:54:54,780
scheme.
And so you're attempting to organize

5351
04:54:54,781 --> 04:54:59,370
yourself so you will in fact concentrate
on that particular relatively mundane

5352
04:54:59,371 --> 04:55:00,204
activity.

5353
04:55:00,390 --> 04:55:03,960
But what you find when you sit down to
actually engage in that is you can't do

5354
04:55:03,961 --> 04:55:06,960
it.
You have to go do the dishes or you have

5355
04:55:06,961 --> 04:55:11,490
to clean under the bed or you have to
have a sexual fantasy or you or.

5356
04:55:11,550 --> 04:55:14,310
Or there's some other thing that you
could do that's useful.

5357
04:55:14,311 --> 04:55:17,850
But that you wouldn't normally do that
you'll go do instead or that you fall

5358
04:55:17,851 --> 04:55:22,230
asleep or that you get hungry or like
there's an endless number of that's

5359
04:55:22,231 --> 04:55:27,231
called them impulses that might arise to
interfere with your conscious movement

5360
04:55:27,361 --> 04:55:28,370
forward.
Well,

5361
04:55:28,500 --> 04:55:31,280
exactly what are those things?
Well,

5362
04:55:31,320 --> 04:55:36,320
nature certainly conceptualizes the
human being as a place where those

5363
04:55:37,171 --> 04:55:42,060
things live and he does mean live too
because it wouldn't refer to the Ms Dot

5364
04:55:42,060 --> 04:55:47,060
d dot demons or or gs without
introducing the metaphoric conception of

5365
04:55:48,541 --> 04:55:51,450
something that lives.
And so partly what nature reveals in

5366
04:55:51,451 --> 04:55:54,120
those sentences that he conceptualized
as a human being,

5367
04:55:54,121 --> 04:55:58,140
as the dwelling place of spirits.

5368
04:55:59,700 --> 04:56:03,270
And some of them are genie.
Let's say that's the root word of

5369
04:56:03,271 --> 04:56:06,120
genius.
That's the terribly powerful thing that

5370
04:56:06,121 --> 04:56:08,660
exists in the terribly small
compartment,

5371
04:56:08,720 --> 04:56:10,260
right,
that you have to call forth.

5372
04:56:10,440 --> 04:56:14,010
And some of them are demons and demons
are things that have their own

5373
04:56:14,011 --> 04:56:17,250
autonomous will and the generally aren't
aiming for the good.

5374
04:56:18,540 --> 04:56:20,550
So then,
so those are all things need.

5375
04:56:20,551 --> 04:56:23,460
She just lays out as implicit parts of
the sentence.

5376
04:56:23,461 --> 04:56:26,760
So we activates all those ideas,
whether you know it or not,

5377
04:56:26,970 --> 04:56:29,190
in your mind,
to the degree that you processed the

5378
04:56:29,191 --> 04:56:32,460
sentence and those things start to take
on a life of virtue of their own,

5379
04:56:32,461 --> 04:56:35,010
those ideas,
and so

5380
04:56:37,410 --> 04:56:40,920
then he adds another dimension of
complexity to that by saying,

5381
04:56:41,680 --> 04:56:43,500
well,
you're full of demons in

5382
04:56:43,640 --> 04:56:47,130
and and,
and gds and

5383
04:56:48,240 --> 04:56:51,360
they're all doing their own thing,
whatever that happens to be,

5384
04:56:52,140 --> 04:56:55,920
but each of them,
if left to their own devices,

5385
04:56:55,921 --> 04:56:59,430
would attempt to remake the entire world
in there

5386
04:57:01,020 --> 04:57:01,853
form.

5387
04:57:02,820 --> 04:57:04,390
And so I,
I,

5388
04:57:04,440 --> 04:57:09,440
I thought this from a,
from a narrative point of view or from a

5389
04:57:09,750 --> 04:57:11,230
symbolic point of view,
in,

5390
04:57:11,350 --> 04:57:12,150
in,
in,

5391
04:57:12,150 --> 04:57:14,270
in old stories and folktales and
fairytales,

5392
04:57:14,370 --> 04:57:15,510
you often have a

5393
04:57:17,530 --> 04:57:18,460
cyclops

5394
04:57:19,620 --> 04:57:23,580
one I giants,
and there's a sexual connotation to that

5395
04:57:24,930 --> 04:57:27,900
which is,
which is apropos that the psychoanalysts

5396
04:57:27,901 --> 04:57:29,880
would,
would certainly point out.

5397
04:57:29,940 --> 04:57:34,940
But the one idea is that this thing is
gigantic wants one thing.

5398
04:57:36,470 --> 04:57:41,470
And so that's another way that Nietzsche
is conceptualizing the fundamental

5399
04:57:44,800 --> 04:57:49,060
structure of the human psyche.
It's a dwelling place full of one I

5400
04:57:49,130 --> 04:57:51,580
giants.
And they're constantly.

5401
04:57:51,850 --> 04:57:52,600
Well,
one thing,

5402
04:57:52,600 --> 04:57:55,060
one way of looking at is they're
constantly at war.

5403
04:57:55,360 --> 04:57:59,050
One of them wants to be the largest one.
I giant and dominate everything else.

5404
04:57:59,140 --> 04:58:02,530
Then one of the things that so Nietzsche
thinks that argument further and he

5405
04:58:02,531 --> 04:58:05,350
says,
not only is this always happening in

5406
04:58:05,351 --> 04:58:08,230
human beings,
but then if you look at philosophy,

5407
04:58:08,290 --> 04:58:13,290
what it is is it's a continual
revelation of the attempt of some

5408
04:58:13,630 --> 04:58:18,630
singular minded psychic monster
psychological monster to dominate the

5409
04:58:19,811 --> 04:58:24,220
entire psychological structure that are
for the entire cultural structure and

5410
04:58:24,221 --> 04:58:26,080
therefore the entire world,
and then you can.

5411
04:58:26,350 --> 04:58:31,350
You can see in that the entire religious
structure struggle of mankind to take

5412
04:58:33,130 --> 04:58:38,130
this vast polytheistic vision of reality
and to organize it into some sort of

5413
04:58:40,841 --> 04:58:45,070
monotheistic,
an integrated structure which you could

5414
04:58:45,071 --> 04:58:49,780
also consider indistinguishable from the
civilizing.

5415
04:58:50,020 --> 04:58:54,850
The impulse that operates in human
beings to become civilized.

5416
04:58:55,360 --> 04:58:59,170
Because on the one hand it might be a
terrible thing that one,

5417
04:58:59,190 --> 04:59:02,530
one monster emerges to attempt to
dominate all the others.

5418
04:59:02,830 --> 04:59:05,260
But then on the other hand,
there's no difference between that and

5419
04:59:05,261 --> 04:59:07,990
organizing something.
Because to organize something is to

5420
04:59:07,991 --> 04:59:12,991
bring it all into a hierarchical
structure with some sort of singular

5421
04:59:13,121 --> 04:59:16,960
value at the forefront,
and then the question might be,

5422
04:59:16,961 --> 04:59:18,880
well,
what should that singular value be?

5423
04:59:19,450 --> 04:59:23,650
And then niche you would that pis at the
whole argument back into the first

5424
04:59:23,651 --> 04:59:25,780
sentences that he wrote at the beginning
of the paragraph,

5425
04:59:25,781 --> 04:59:27,160
which is,
well,

5426
04:59:27,610 --> 04:59:31,540
what is it that the philosophers up to?
What is the force that he surfing?

5427
04:59:31,930 --> 04:59:34,900
What is the unifying impulse?
That's another way of looking at it.

5428
04:59:34,901 --> 04:59:38,740
If there's a unifying impulse and he's
not only fallen prey to some internal

5429
04:59:38,770 --> 04:59:41,810
demon,
if there's a unifying impulse to bring

5430
04:59:41,811 --> 04:59:45,740
all of this together into some sort of
functional structure,

5431
04:59:45,741 --> 04:59:47,510
what exactly might that look like?

5432
04:59:51,390 --> 04:59:55,290
For every impulse is imperious and as
such attempts to philosophize.

5433
04:59:55,540 --> 05:00:00,540
That's part of that sort of niches,
idea of will to power in its nascent

5434
05:00:02,851 --> 05:00:07,851
form.
All of these unconscious entities that

5435
05:00:08,490 --> 05:00:12,750
inhabit the human psyche are all alive
and they're trying to live.

5436
05:00:12,751 --> 05:00:15,630
They're trying to.
They're trying to climb up the dominance

5437
05:00:15,631 --> 05:00:17,610
hierarchy and dominate because of
course,

5438
05:00:17,611 --> 05:00:21,810
that's partly what life does because
let's say from an evolutionary

5439
05:00:21,811 --> 05:00:25,740
perspective,
and this is probably more true for males

5440
05:00:25,830 --> 05:00:30,830
because they are less
effective in their attempts to replicate

5441
05:00:33,300 --> 05:00:37,110
the distinction between climbing up a
dominance hierarchy.

5442
05:00:37,120 --> 05:00:40,230
Whatever that might happen to be and
success is.

5443
05:00:41,190 --> 05:00:45,450
There may be no distinction at all,
and then you might say,

5444
05:00:45,451 --> 05:00:47,160
well,
that just shows that there's nothing but

5445
05:00:47,161 --> 05:00:47,450
we'll

5446
05:00:47,450 --> 05:00:48,890
power,
but

5447
05:00:50,630 --> 05:00:53,810
that still doesn't answer.
One of the most fundamental questions is

5448
05:00:53,811 --> 05:00:58,811
that power in relationship to what?
Because that's the question.
