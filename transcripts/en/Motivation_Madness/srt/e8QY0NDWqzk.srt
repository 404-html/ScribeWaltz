1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,120
Well,
oftentimes business education today,

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,520
and I see it all the time,
kids come out of college,

3
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,520
the best colleges,
wharton and Harvard and Stanford and

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:18,790
some of the great business schools and
they'll come out and they won't have

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,510
practical experience is too many case
studies that aren't practical.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,371
You know,
we ask,

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,870
uh,
kids that are 16 to 18 years old to make

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,760
$100,000 debt decisions when they go off
to university and they're not prepared

9
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,860
for that.
They don't know what they're getting

10
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:34,030
themselves into.
They just assume,

11
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,890
okay,
I'm going to pay for years of education

12
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,860
to 25,000 a pop and when I come out the
other side,

13
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,220
somehow we'll be able to pay it back.
That's not how life works anymore.

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,970
There's no need even to have a college
degree at all or even high school.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,120
I mean,
if somebody graduated from a great

16
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:55,540
university that maybe in indy,
that may be an indication that they will

17
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,810
be capable of great things,
but it's not necessarily the case.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,970
You know,
if you look at say people like Bill

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,100
Gates or Larry Ellison,
Steve Jobs,

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,270
these guys didn't graduate from college,
but if you had a chance to hire them,

21
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:14,290
of course I would be a good idea.
Um,

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,750
I think having the flexibility to
explore a lot of different things which

23
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,120
you can do when you're in college,
which is one of the amazing things about

24
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:24,020
being in college is you can work on all
these hobbies and encode a lot of stuff

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,110
and try a lot of different things.
It's this amazing flexibility that I

26
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:29,300
think most people take for granted and
once you decide,

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,580
okay,
I'm going to start a company,

28
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,590
I'm going to do it with someone else,
you immediately now need to convince

29
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,660
someone else if you want to change your
mind on something.

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,320
And I think people really undervalue the
option value and flexibility.

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,460
I think explore what you want to do
before committing is really like the key

32
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:48,461
thing and keep yourself flexible and no,
I think that that's agreed.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,720
Yeah.
I mean it's actually kind of funny.

34
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,740
I like if you're like,
what is education?

35
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,210
Like you're basically downloading data
and algorithms into your brain and it's,

36
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,660
it's,
it's actually amazingly bad in

37
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,420
conventional education because like it
shouldn't be like this huge tour

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,100
almost standing up there kind of
lecturing at people and they've done the

39
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:13,510
same lecturer or 20 years in a row and
are very excited about it and in fact I

40
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:15,820
think a lot of things that people learn
it probably there's no point in learning

41
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,960
because they never used them in the
future because a lot of kids are in

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,870
school.
Kind of puzzled as to why they're there.

43
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,290
The people who are doing the work that
we care about are figuring out what to

44
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,540
do next,
not following the person who told them

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,720
what to do next.
And the problem with most colleges is

46
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,120
they are high school,
but with more binge drinking.

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,830
The entire purpose of a university is to
give you a foundation to fail.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,700
Not a foundation to get an a.
and if you graduated from college,

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,950
straight a's,
you have to do some serious soul

50
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,950
searching as to why you chose to spend
your time doing that.

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,250
A student's work for the students.
The C students run the businesses and

52
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,620
that these students dedicate the
buildings.

53
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,250
It's like the newspaper

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,550
industry ripe more printing presses,
more big buildings,

55
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,200
right?
It makes us look grander.

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,370
We have brains that we're putting them
out there.

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,960
There's there's a point of diminishing
returns in terms of what it's worth for

58
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,790
a college education and how much debt
you're willing to saddle yourself with.

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,770
A lot of people fall.
A lot of people have follow is

60
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,571
generally.
If not,

61
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:21,300
we'd have problems.
We have too many entrepreneurs.

62
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,120
We have so many successful people.
Look how many people go into business

63
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,390
classes and everything you needed was in
that actual business class.

64
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,510
In that book,
it'd be too many successful business

65
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,344
people.
Right?

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,510
How many people graduate?
Matter of fact,

67
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:40,160
the professor wouldn't have the time to
sit there and teach you that knows this

68
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,590
book them near verbatim,
page by page.

69
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,250
He knows,
right?

70
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,110
Because he'd be an entrepreneur.
He too busy.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm too.
I'm doing way too much right now because

72
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:52,310
I got the palm trees and then we do it.
We sell it so much stuff that I'm doing

73
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:56,570
that I ain't quite got time to teach
them about class right now because I'm

74
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,070
winning

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,070
and so when you walk into a board room
with a bunch of guys in suits who all

76
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,810
went to college,
you're fine.

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,790
Yeah,
I mean because they read a bunch of

78
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,570
words.
I've lived a bunch of life.

79
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,870
That's true.
They're more degree,

80
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:15,190
doesn't intimidate you.
It kinda evens is out whether they know

81
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,860
it and not get that self esteem from
seriously.

82
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,660
I mean most mom first and foremost,
but then just living life like you know,

83
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,950
being in real situations and happened to
be a person of high integrity and

84
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:30,070
honesty and you know,
you never embarrassed yourself.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,530
Of course not.
You'd ever walked in and said,

86
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,480
hi,
everybody thinks I'm ignorant here.

87
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm stupid.
I don't feel ignorant right now.

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,970
I don't.
I felt like I came up in this situation

89
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,100
or a time,
you know,

90
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,660
where I wasn't afforded certain
opportunities and if afforded

91
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,990
opportunities I could be oprah,
could be a Bill Gates,

92
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,410
I could be Warren Buffet.

93
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,610
In my experience in business,
there is very little difference.

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,150
If any,
between a very high price business

95
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:10,050
education and what's available a lot for
a lot less money.

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,780
I went to the University of Nebraska at
Lincoln.

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,690
I last year in college.
I went to wharton for a couple years

98
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,523
before that.
Uh,

99
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,580
I learned just as much as university
Nebraska as I did at wharton at indeed a

100
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,690
big product in the right direction.
But an awful lot of it is,

101
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,260
is,
is,

102
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,800
is self.
The self taught it isn't necessary to

103
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:33,801
pay 30 or $35,000 a year.
I go to some big name school to get the

104
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,900
education at all.
I mean,

105
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,700
if you're going to learn accounting,
if you're going to,

106
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,490
which is the probably the most important
course you'd taken business,

107
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,220
you're gonna learn to count.
You can learn accounting absolutely as

108
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:46,270
well in my view,
going to you all.

109
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,150
It was going to Harvard.
I mean,

110
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,980
I,
I see,

111
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,130
uh,
I would,

112
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,510
I would,
I bet on that.

113
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,570
And uh,
so I wouldn't run up huge bells

114
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,590
and education is very good at training
people to do the same things that we've

115
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,950
done over and over again.
And I think there's always a question

116
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,350
what the nature of the educational good
is.

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,380
A,
you can say it's a,

118
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,620
it's an investment.
Good.

119
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:15,500
We're investing in the future.
You can say it's a consumption good.

120
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,230
Like college is a four year party,
you know,

121
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:21,950
I think most of the parents and students
think of it actually is an insurance

122
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,060
policy where you're buying this really
ever more expensive insurance so that

123
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,120
the students don't fall through the
really big cracks in our society.

124
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,940
And we should be asking some big
questions why the insurance costs are

125
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,600
going up and up like that.
And if you were the president of Harvard

126
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,700
or Stanford,
if you want it to get,

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,560
um,
a lynch mob of students,

128
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,770
alumni,
faculty to come after you and try to

129
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,890
lynch you,
what you should say is something like

130
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,660
this.
You know,

131
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,440
we,
we live in this much larger,

132
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,830
more global world.
We offer a great education to everybody

133
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,340
and so we're going to double or triple
our enrollment over the next 15 to 20

134
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,350
years.
And people would,

135
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
they'd all be furious because the value
of the degrees comes from this massive

136
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:03,770
exclusion.
Um,

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,240
and,
and what you're really running is

138
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,880
something like a studio 54 nightclub.

139
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,340
I hate it.
I hated school.

140
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,660
I hated school.
I hated school generally,

141
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,720
right?
Because it was this instruction

142
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:20,080
following thing.
Now I bet you it's probably also because

143
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,720
I wasn't good at it and some people are
like,

144
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:26,860
I've got a great conceptual memory and a
terrible rote memory.

145
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,550
So if I have a story I could tell you
year by year kind of what happened,

146
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,250
um,
within a story,

147
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,150
within a context a.
But if I was to go into,

148
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,310
you know,
like a memory based learning,

149
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,620
it's terrible.
I have a terrible rote memory.

150
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,250
Ego Barrier is the worst thing.
And if we were raised differently,

151
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,150
just imagine in the schools at all along
that people will always say everybody

152
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,270
makes mistakes.
Everybody has weaknesses.

153
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,570
The key is really to understand what
your mistakes and weaknesses are so that

154
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,620
you can learn from them.
Right?

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,100
I think punishment is,
is it is a terrible concept.

156
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,210
Punishment means that you made a mistake
and you're being punished.

157
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,840
I think instead of punishment,
every time somebody makes a mistake,

158
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,550
you just say,
the only thing that you need to do to

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,230
get out of your punishment is first
think what kind of mistake was that?

160
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,650
So if I'm in this situation that's like
that again,

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,470
how would I do deal with it differently
not to make that mistake?

162
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,730
So that learning should come from the
mistake,

163
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,390
not punishment,
because you're teaching people not to

164
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,090
make mistakes.
We're,

165
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,100
whereas where the learning comes from,
not the appreciation that if you keep

166
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,100
doing this over and over again,
you're going to keep encountering the

167
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,030
same outcomes.

168
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,200
You know,
it's an extremely,

169
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,290
a corrupt system.
We have at this point,

170
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,770
there is,
we have an education bubble in the US.

171
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,040
We have a trillion dollars of student
debt to a first approximation.

172
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,120
This has gone to pay for a trillion
dollars worth of lies about the value of

173
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,430
the education people have received.
Um,

174
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,650
and um,
and I,

175
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,890
it's not at all obvious yet though,
what's going to,

176
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,700
what's going to replace this or how it's
going to change.

177
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,350
Um,
my um,

178
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,560
you know,
the,

179
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,380
the,
uh,

180
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,213
you know,
the,

181
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,970
and I'm somewhat skeptical that it will
be replaced by any sort of single

182
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,950
unitary system and I have this
fellowship for a young people to start

183
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,850
companies and it's not,
my claim is not that everybody should do

184
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:41,930
this.
I don't think everyone should become an

185
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:42,651
entrepreneur.
And I think,

186
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:45,020
I think there is no one size fits all.

187
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,360
I think so.
I think the future will be much more

188
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,000
heterogeneous,
much more diverse in terms of what

189
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,330
people do.
Um,

190
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,341
and uh,
what's,

191
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,640
what's really anomalous is the sort of
unitary tracking where you have to go to

192
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:58,430
an elite college,
you go to Yale or you go to jail,

193
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,990
there's nothing else you can do,
you know.

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,880
Um,
and so the,

195
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:02,191
the,
uh,

196
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:07,191
I think the universities are perhaps in
perhaps in the same place as the

197
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,500
Catholic Church was in 1,514.
If we go back 500 years where,

198
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:15,200
uh,
you have sort of a monolithic way,

199
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,030
you this universal way of a body of
knowledge of teaching things.

200
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,560
The difference between the Yale and the
Harvard political science faculties are

201
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,830
probably no greater than the differences
between the Dominicans and the

202
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:30,770
Franciscans.
We've all kinds of small debates within

203
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,690
this context.
Um,

204
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,680
uh,
we are,

205
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,480
we have a system of indulgences that's
costing more and more to support this

206
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,060
priestly or professorial class of
people.

207
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,620
We are told that,
uh,

208
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,120
it's the only way to salvation.
You must get a diploma to be saved.

209
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,310
If you do not get a diploma,
then you will go to hell.

210
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,590
Um,
and I think,

211
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,790
um,
and I think the,

212
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,010
uh,
I think the,

213
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,410
the,
the message that I have that's like the

214
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:01,820
16th century reformers,
that's a somewhat troubling message is

215
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:04,670
that you have to work out your salvation
on your own.

216
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,170
You have to save yourself.
And,

217
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:06,861
uh,
and,

218
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:07,694
and that's,
that's,

219
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,960
I think,
I believe that is the truth.

220
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,140
But it's a,
it's,

221
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,600
it's,
it's somewhat uncomfortable with.
