1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,740
Old Chinese proverb.
Most people have heard it or have come

2
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:24,030
across it at some point in the meanings.
Pretty straightforward,

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,600
right?
And advocates.

4
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:30,430
Having the courage to take that step
towards the goal and that's cute and I'm

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,190
making that decision to move forward
towards something you want,

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,250
but it's what happens immediately
following that first step that I'm

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:42,870
interested in.
What happens when the journey's be gone

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,300
and it's you and your goal in all of a
sudden you realize how long that road

9
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:52,350
ahead really is.
Now this is a turning point for a lot of

10
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:56,850
people
and those who can succeed or able to

11
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:01,851
take their daunting,
intimidating goal or journey and see it

12
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:07,380
for what it really is.
Just a bunch of small,

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,440
manageable tasks strung together.
You know,

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,890
when you look at why people quit,
a lot of the time it's because they were

15
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,370
overwhelmed by their goals and
ambitions.

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,550
Let's say you have this wonderful plan
in your head to climb a mountain.

17
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,640
You're thinking about that feeling of
being on top,

18
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,790
looking down with pride.
Every time you think about it,

19
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,490
your heart starts racing,
so you pack your stuff.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,400
You make your way down in the base of
the mountain and then you look up

21
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,030
different ballgame right now,
the entire mountains in front of you and

22
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:50,780
you realize that that's no small feat.
That is when people walk away,

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,760
when they aren't able to see a challenge
as the sum of tiny steps.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,690
They see it as a crazy,
impossible task.

25
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,550
It's like saying you want to be the next
Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall

26
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:11,540
mountain to climb,
like trying to hit a target from a mile

27
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,710
away,
but if you can identify and map out what

28
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:19,190
you need to conquer in order to become a
better basketball player or football

29
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,600
player and begin taking those small
steps improving every day,

30
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,080
that makes dreams real.
That's what gives goals life.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
The ability to see your objective not as
a marathon,

32
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,250
but as a series of little 400 meters
stretches,

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,570
stepping stones.
You know what your objective is today,

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,390
tomorrow,
the end of the week and the end of the

35
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,550
year,
and then completing them day by day.

36
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,580
These little victories,
that's what gives your dream life.

37
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,210
It's what gives you momentum.
You feel good about the process.

38
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,370
And by the way,
when things blow up in your face,

39
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,950
which happens every so often on this
little place call earth,

40
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,510
you'll have that foundation and that
sense of accomplishment to stay focused

41
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,510
because you're approaches tangible and
it's realistic.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,160
This applies with everything.
Losing a job,

43
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,510
a breakup,
failing a test.

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,150
These things that are monumental.
If you allow them to be,

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,670
you know,
they can turn into that unclimbed double

46
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:24,470
mountain
or they can roll the map a new path for

47
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,450
you.
And if you define what you want,

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,910
you define success and begin stepping
towards it one hour,

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,120
one day at a time,
you'll get where you want to be quicker

50
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:35,750
than you thought.
