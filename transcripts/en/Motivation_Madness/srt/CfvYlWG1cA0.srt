1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,300
What I want to say is through growing
up,

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,780
what I've discovered is that this world
is a very vast of a wonderful and

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,910
beautiful one and there's so many things
to discover that the most important

4
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:23,911
journey I think all of us will go
through as the journey in ourselves to

5
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:27,640
find our truth,
to find who we are and what makes us

6
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,040
happy.
And in our culture

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,840
we are told that if we're beautiful,
if we skinny,

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,690
if we're successful,
famous,

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,860
if we fit in,
um,

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,310
if everyone loves us,
that we'll be happy,

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,590
but that's not entirely true.
Um,

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,060
and this is what I want to talk about.
Basically,

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,810
I'm going to start with a poem that I
wrote when I wasn't very happy.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,340
Um,
I actually read this a year ago,

15
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,600
but again,
as if you know,

16
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:02,740
depression,
it comes back,

17
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,800
it's a reoccurring thing that you can't
really sought away anyway.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,540
Who am I?
Who am I trying to be?

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,340
Not Myself,
anyone but myself living in a fantasy to

20
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,420
bury the reality,
making myself the mystery has strong

21
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:22,960
facade disguising the misery empty.
But we,

22
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:26,680
on the point of emptiness full to the
brim of fake confidence,

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,830
a God that will never be broken because
I broke a long time ago.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm hurting,
but don't tell anyone.

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,380
No one needs to know,
don't show or you've failed.

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,520
Always.
Okay.

27
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,230
Always fine.
Always on show.

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,170
The show must go on.
It will never stop.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,630
The show must not go on,
but I know it well.

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,820
I give up,
I give up giving up.

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,640
I am lost.
I don't need to be saved.

32
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:53,641
I need to be found basically.
It's kind of just the same reoccurring

33
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,840
thing of uh,
yeah,

34
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,690
not knowing who you are and,
and feeling I again.

35
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,880
So yeah,
this started when I was about 15 years

36
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,300
old.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,070
I was in school.
Um,

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,550
I really wanted to do well at school to
please my parents,

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,070
to please my family.
I didn't really care that much about

40
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,260
school because I knew I was never going
to be very good at it.

41
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,890
Um,
I think I pushed myself so far.

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,740
Got to the point where I had a bit of a
mental breakdown.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,920
I was one of those people that just like
just did enough work.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,260
Again,
I probably,

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,730
I,
I,

46
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,100
um,
I have very bad learning disabilities,

47
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:29,050
so if you look at my writing,
it's,

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,220
it's not,
it's not,

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,260
it's docketed adults.
Probably like a nine year old boy,

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,300
if you know what that looks like.
Um,

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,650
but I was just pushing past.
Uh,

52
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,110
yeah.
So I got to the point where I went a bit

53
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,360
mad.
I was completely suicidal,

54
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,550
didn't want to live anymore.
I thought that I was completely alone.

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,540
I also realize how lucky I was and what
a wonderful family,

56
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,830
wonderful friends I had,
but that didn't matter.

57
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:57,880
I wanted the wildest swallow me up and
nothing seemed better to me than death,

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,420
which is completely,
so I just got taken out of school.

59
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,540
I went to therapy,
got put on antidepressants,

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,980
kind of clawed my way back to some sort
of rational thought,

61
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,400
which took a while.
But basically I stayed in school until I

62
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,401
was 17 when I still was kind of played
with this depression and I was like,

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,850
I'm done.
I need to leave.

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,120
Which the rather large disagreement from
my parents,

65
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,370
I was,
I did,

66
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,510
I left and I knew I had to do something
because otherwise I would just go crazy.

67
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,590
So I started modeling.
There was elements which were fun cause

68
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,490
it's like this camaraderie of people not
being successful when you can complain

69
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,250
about all the people who are routine,
but it's not,

70
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,610
it wasn't nice.
Eh,

71
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,870
you constantly are told that you're not
pretty enough.

72
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,840
We're not tall enough.
I'm not skinny enough and people are

73
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,190
better.
And when you're young,

74
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,290
you think that means I'm not good
enough.

75
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,860
As a person.
Like that means I'm not living up to who

76
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,710
I should be.
And you kind of get battered and bruised

77
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,660
a lot,
but then you've kind of grown a bit of a

78
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,460
skin.
What would the agencies like?

79
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,530
What was an agency like?

80
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,550
Yeah.
I mean the thing with models is they,

81
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,170
eh,
you get used.

82
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,060
That's the thing I saw a lot of um,
misuse from photographers.

83
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,700
You know,
perverse photographers to young girls.

84
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,030
A lot of street photographers only
really do this because they want to

85
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,040
sleep with young models.
Um,

86
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,143
you know,
bad,

87
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,360
bad kind of experiences in that sense,
not by me,

88
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,090
but to other poor people,
poor girls who don't stand up for

89
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,480
themselves because you feel like you
should be used because that's what

90
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,520
models do.
Um,

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,050
um,
but then,

92
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,370
you know,
about a year into it,

93
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,670
I was discovered.
I did barbary and then everybody wants

94
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,391
you,
you know,

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,670
after so long of being like nobody wants
you suddenly like,

96
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,601
oh my God,
who's that?

97
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,340
I was like,
I've met you five times and it's pretty

98
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,080
useful.
You didn't want me two minutes ago,

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,440
but cool.
I had no concept of saying no to anyone

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,570
ever.

101
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,540
Um,
and this is one of the most important

102
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,300
show business lessons,
actually learning how to say no.

103
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,030
Have you learned yet?
Yes,

104
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,620
I think life.
You should always experience things,

105
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,420
but you should not,
you should say no.

106
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,730
I mean,
it's more about being control and not

107
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,760
being a puppet is what the most
important thing is and not doing

108
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:19,780
anything out and not doing anything for
anyone else apart from yourself.

109
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,940
Because after a while I just started to
get sick and I got this horrible thing

110
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,730
called psoriasis.
You look at yourself like you're an

111
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,020
alien.
You're like,

112
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,690
I'm so disgusting.
It's not good for your,

113
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,590
especially at that time I felt more
disconnected from myself than I think I

114
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,660
ever had,
which I was for a long time,

115
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,500
quite disconnected.
Um,

116
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,850
and as well,
well,

117
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,240
my agency,
we're like,

118
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,100
Ooh.
Because usually you have to take time to

119
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,420
fix internal problems.

120
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,610
Like it's food and stress and,
but you know,

121
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:52,600
they shoved me straight into a doctor
who would inject cortisone into each

122
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,910
spot,
which died them,

123
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,270
but not really in these,
you know,

124
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,400
that kind of thing.
It's like all those problems I had,

125
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:02,150
I feel like I masked with medicine
instead of taking the time to really

126
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,480
solve them.
But at that time I really wanted someone

127
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,400
to stop me.
I wanted someone to go,

128
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,590
you need to take a break.
You need to look after herself.

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,600
And no one did because I was the one who
had it all like I was.

130
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,710
I had what everyone wanted the of nappy.
Yes.

131
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah.
Who say would've.

132
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,170
That's what I wanted.
It was more like the external life.

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
I couldn't be luckier,
more blessed,

134
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,980
but the internal battles that were going
on or just,

135
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,110
I also felt like I never deserved any of
it.

136
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
I was living someone else's dream.
It,

137
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,070
this point is just about like being able
to show,

138
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,760
like pass the mirror at yourself and
really look inside for what you need.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,440
And what happened was I eventually said
no and I eventually took a break.

140
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,670
But yeah,
so I said No.

141
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,870
I went,
I started writing.

142
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,720
Writing was something that really saved
my life again.

143
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:55,460
So that pro per and probably came out.
Then it was like I would write and I

144
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,220
would read what I'd written and it was
like someone else was talking to me.

145
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,030
I was like,
watch this,

146
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,880
how I feel.
It was a very strange experience.

147
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,540
Um,
and then after that I found yoga,

148
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,770
which was a huge thing for me.
I didn't cry a lot.

149
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,650
I thought emotion as a kid was a
weakness.

150
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,860
I thought that if you are emotional that
like,

151
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,010
you know,
that's like a parent,

152
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,860
like just a silly thing to feel.

153
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,200
And when I went to Yoga,
I went,

154
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,970
I started yoga as a superficial thing
cause I was like,

155
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,070
I want to be flexible and fit,
you know,

156
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:30,020
like coop yoga people are,
and I went in to my yoga,

157
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,170
my guru yoga person and,
and um,

158
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,620
he was like,
why you doing this?

159
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,600
And I told him why.
And he sat me down and we just started

160
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,630
chanting and I was like,
we not meant to be doing like whatever.

161
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,800
So I was chanting,
I was so angry with myself,

162
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,980
no god.
And I broke through something and I bust

163
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,290
into tears,
which I hadn't done in years.

164
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,440
And I looked at him and I was like,
what is wrong with you?

165
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,640
How dare you?
You're a monster,

166
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,310
why would you do this?
And he was just laughing at me and I was

167
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,530
like,
sure was crazy man,

168
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:01,100
what is wrong with you?

169
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,540
And he said,
if you add an have cried,

170
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,490
I would have been very worried.
And I was like,

171
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,690
okay.
He was like,

172
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,450
and also you realize that this is the
first time you've actually looked at me

173
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,510
in the eye.
And the reason why is because I knew

174
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,960
when I looked in his eyes that he saw
through me and he knew me and it freaked

175
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,440
me out.
But till this day I've been seeing him a

176
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,060
lot.
It's like finding,

177
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,450
finding people around you who have your
best interest at heart.

178
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,530
I have a lot of people around me who
were just softer more.

179
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,630
I gave them not like,
you know,

180
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:33,620
often looking after you and stuff.
So it's about finding people who care

181
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,040
about you and support.
Um,

182
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,720
and again,
I've now become them being able to be a

183
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,790
support for other people as well.
So in turn,

184
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,410
that kind of goes around.

185
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,990
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to change the world

186
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
because little kids think they're going
to be to Paris,

187
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,190
but I have so many messages in terms of
just young girls and how the mental

188
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,170
illness and depression is not something
to be ashamed of.

189
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,370
And I wish at that time I had realized
that other people go through it,

190
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,740
that I can talk to other people,
that you're not alone,

191
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,470
you're not an alien.
Um,

192
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,300
and you know,
my message has always been to accept

193
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,310
yourself no matter what,
to love yourself,

194
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:11,670
to embrace your flaws.
I think floors are the things that make

195
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,580
us special.
The cracks within us are the beautiful

196
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,330
parts that need to have light shed on
them otherwise that just left.

197
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,410
Um,
and also women are great,

198
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,450
that wonderful,
wonderful creatures.

199
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Women are the bearer of life.
And I think it took an experience of

200
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,940
going to a talk by a woman who dealt
with so much.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,110
Um,
you know,

202
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,750
and like all these women Harris,
so incredible.

203
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,430
Like the last talk,
you know,

204
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,420
I've watched her on Youtube and it made
me cry and we witnessed these extreme

205
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,540
experiences that happen to women
suppression and all these other things.

206
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,230
But really that happens every day.
And we're all used to it in the

207
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:51,090
workplace,
in relationships.

208
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,860
Women are constantly suppressed,
but it takes an extreme circumstance for

209
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:00,150
us to realize it because we're used to
it not always confuses me a lot,

210
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,610
but obviously I think we're changing
that now.

211
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:05,970
Slowly but surely.
But yeah,

212
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:09,360
just the point of like supporting each
other and reaching out and

213
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,700
communicating.
It's the most important thing.

214
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,920
So I want to help basically.
I Dunno how,

215
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,970
if anyone has any suggestions.
When I got my first audition that I

216
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,190
cared about,
I cried my eyes out cause I never

217
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,690
thought I was going to be taken
seriously.

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,350
I never thought I was going to be an
actor at all or a model or anything.

219
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,500
I think as well,
I have so many girls come up to me and

220
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,830
telling me that they want to be models,
which is fine.

221
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,270
It's not a bad thing.
I just think there's so much to do.

222
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,020
I just went to a wonderful talk about
um,

223
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,340
genetic engineering and neuroscience and
this man who was giving the talk

224
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,810
expanded these as like 10,000 kids is
from the age of seven to 13 who are

225
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,450
doing neuroscience.
They do these competitions and one of

226
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,660
the things,
and not doing things in neuroscience,

227
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,520
which haven't been,
which one done by him until he was like

228
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:01,500
30 like how quickly things like that are
changing and but they're not.

229
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,980
There is an awareness sport.
It's cool stuff like that,

230
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,240
that that sounds way cooler to me than
being a model.

231
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,060
But like no one really knows about it.
And I just think there are just so many

232
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,790
things I always say to and just dream.
Just dream bigger.

233
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,040
Go the president.
Just keep going up.

234
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,320
Astronauts that them.
