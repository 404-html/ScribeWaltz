1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,270
Like you don't need to have all of these
things,

2
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,310
but you better have most of them.
Family,

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,270
friends,
career,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,380
educational goals,
plans for old time outside of work.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,170
I attention to your mental and physical
health,

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,650
etc. You know those are,
that's what life is about.

7
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:24,420
10.
If You don't have any of those things,

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,970
well then all you've got left is misery
and suffering.

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,350
So that's,
that's a bad,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,370
that's a bad deal for you.
So,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,330
so once you,
once you set up that goal structure,

12
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,210
let's say,
and that's really in many in many ways,

13
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:41,400
that's what you should be doing at
universities is,

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,120
that's exactly what you should be doing
is trying to figure out who it is that

15
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,820
you're trying to be.
Right?

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,440
And you aim at that and then use
everything you learned as a means of

17
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,630
building that person that you want to
be.

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,060
And,
and I really mean want to be.

19
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:59,010
I don't mean should be even those
things.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,400
Those things are going to overlap.
And it's important to distinguish

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,220
between those because that's partly,
and this is back down to the micro

22
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,690
routine analysis.
So I started saying,

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,770
well,
you're going to try to make yourself

24
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,000
more industrious.
Okay?

25
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,580
Number one,
specify your damn goals because how are

26
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,090
you going to hit something if you don't
know what it is that isn't going to

27
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:16,470
happen?
And often people won't specify their

28
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,620
goals too because they don't like to
specify conditions for failure.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,960
So if you keep yourself all vague and
foggy,

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380
which is real easy because that's just a
matter of not doing as well,

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,350
then you don't know when you fail.
And people might say,

32
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,910
well,
I really don't want to know when I fail

33
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:33,330
because that's painful,
so I'll keep myself blind about when I

34
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,110
fail.

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,000
That's fine,
except you'll fail all the time.

36
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,780
Then you just won't know it until you
failed so badly that you're done.

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,480
And that can easIly happen by the time
you're 40.

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,020
So.
So I would recommend that you don't let

39
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,090
that happen.
So that's willful blindness,

40
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,320
right?
You could have known,

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,360
but you chose not to.
Okay?

42
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,340
So once you get your goal structure set
up,

43
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:53,911
you think,
okay,

44
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,870
if I could have this life looks like
that might be worth living despite the

45
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,320
fact that it's going to be,
you know,

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,550
anxiety provoking and threatening and
there's going to be some suffering and

47
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:07,140
loss involved in all of that.
Obviously the goal is to have a vision

48
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:12,141
for your life such that all things
considered that justifies your effort.

49
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,610
Okay,
so then what do you do?

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,270
Well then then you turn down to the
micro routines like,

51
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,620
okay,
well this is what I'm aiming for.

52
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,920
How does that instantiates itself day to
day,

53
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,240
week to week,
month to month.

54
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,720
And that's where something like a
schedule can be unbelievably useful.

55
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,230
google calendar,
it's like naked damn schedule and stick

56
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,250
to it.
Okay,

57
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,520
so what's the rule with the schedule?
It's not a bloody prison.

58
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,950
That's the first thing that people do
wrong.

59
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,251
He said,
well,

60
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,680
I don't like to follow a schedule.
And it's like,

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,390
well,
what kind of schedule are you setting

62
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,224
up?
Well I,

63
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,120
I have to do this,
then I have to do this,

64
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,600
then I have to do this,
you know?

65
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,560
And then I just go play video games
because who wants to do all these things

66
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,360
that I have to do?
It's like wrong.

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,620
Set the damn schedule up so that you
have the day you want.

68
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,450
That's the trick.
It's like,

69
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,620
okay,
I've got tomorrow.

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,320
If I was going to set it up so it was
the best possible day I could have

71
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,400
practically speaking,
what would it look like?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,430
Well then you schedule that and
obviously there's a bit of

73
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,850
responsibility that's going to go along
with that because if you have any sense,

74
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,630
one of the things that you're gonna
insist upon is that at the end of the

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,640
day,
you're not in worse shape than you were

76
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,770
then at the beginning of the day,
right?

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,130
Because that's a stupid day.
If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,

78
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,110
you just dig,
dig yourself a hole,

79
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,830
and then you bury yourself in.
It's like,

80
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,950
sorry,
that's just not a good strategy.

81
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,300
It's a bad strategy.
So maybe 20 percent of your day has to

82
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,120
be responsibility and obligation,
or maybe it's more than that,

83
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,000
depending on how far behind you are.
But even that you can,

84
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,410
you can ask yourself,
okay,

85
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:45,310
well I've got these responsibilities,
I have to schedule the damn things in.

86
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,880
What's the right ratio of responsibility
to reward?

87
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,210
And you can ask yourself that just like
you'd negotiate with someone who is

88
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:52,840
working for you.

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,321
It'S like,
okay,

90
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,150
you got to work tomorrow.
Okay,

91
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,370
so I want you to work tomorrow.
And you might say,

92
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,050
okay,
well what are you going to do for me

93
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,610
that makes it likely that I'll work for
you while you could ask yourself that,

94
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,950
you know,
maybe you do an hour of,

95
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,130
of responsibility and then you play a
video game for 15 minutes.

96
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:11,140
I don't know,
whatever turns your crank man.

97
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,260
But you know,
you have to negotiate with yourself and

98
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:18,820
not tyrannized yourself like you're
negotiating with someone that you care

99
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,760
for that you would like to be productive
and have a good life.

100
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,740
And,
and that's how you make the schedule.

101
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,240
It's like.
And then you look at the day and you

102
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,571
think,
well,

103
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,130
if I had that day,
that'd be good.

104
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,910
Great.
You know,

105
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,460
and you,
you're useless and horrible.

106
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,340
So you'll probably only hit it with
about 70 percent accuracy,

107
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,520
but that beats the hell out of zero,
right?

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,130
And if you hit it even with 50 percent
accuracy,

109
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,440
another rule is well,
aim for 51 percent the next week or 50

110
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,830
and a half percent for god's sake or
because you're going to hit that

111
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,220
position where things start to loop back
positively in spiral you upward and so,

112
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,850
so that's one way that you can work on
your conscientiousness is a plan a life

113
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:02,851
you'd like to have and and you do that
partly by referring to social norms.

114
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,490
That's more or less rescuing your father
from the belly of the whale,

115
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,790
but the other way you do that is by
having a little conversation with

116
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,930
yourself about as if you don't really
know who you are because you know what

117
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,400
you're like.
You won't do what you're told.

118
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,800
You won't do what you tell yourself to
do.

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,730
You must have noticed that.
It's like you're a bad employee and a

120
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:25,510
worse boss,
and in both of those work for you,

121
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,860
you don't know what you want to do.

122
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,300
And then when you tell yourself what to
do,

123
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,850
you don't do it anyways,
you should fire yourself and find

124
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,250
someone else to be.
But,

125
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,430
but you know what my point is,
is that you have to understand that

126
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,380
you're not your own servant,
so to speak.

127
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,690
you're someone that you have to
negotiate with and that's.

128
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,580
And you're someone that you want to
present the opportunity of having a good

129
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,680
life too.
And that's hard for people because they

130
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,490
don't like themselves very much.
So you know,

131
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,130
they're always like cracking the whip
and then procrastinating and cracking

132
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,900
the whip and then procrastinating.
And it's like,

133
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,030
god,
it's so boring and such a pathetic way

134
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,980
of spending your time.
And you know what that's like because

135
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,810
you probably wasted like six hours a
day.

136
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,050
And I think we did an economic
calculation about that a while back,

137
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,000
right?
Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an

138
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:08,600
hour.

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,890
Something like that.
I mean,

140
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,470
you're not getting paid that now,
but you're young.

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
And so this is investment time and what
you do now is going to multiply its

142
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,350
effects in the future.
So,

143
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,530
so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,
which is perfectly reasonable.

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
So if you waste six hours a day and you
are,

145
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,650
then you're wasting about $2,000 a week
or about $100,000 a year.

146
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,920
So like go ahead.
But that's what it's costing you every

147
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,080
hour and you need to know what your damn
time is worth.

148
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,560
So let's say it's not 50 bucks,
it's 30 whatever.

149
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,750
Maybe it's 100,
it's somewhere in that range.

150
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,770
One of the things you should be asking
yourself is when you spend an hour was

151
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:43,604
that,
well,

152
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,580
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to
have had that hour?

153
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,310
And if the answer is no,
it's like well maybe you should do

154
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,480
something else with your time.

155
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,930
And it depends on whether or not you
think that your time is worthwhile.

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,010
But the funny thing about not assuming
that is if you assume your time isn't

157
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:00,590
worthwhile,
what happens is you don't just sit

158
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:04,760
around sort of randomly in a state of
responsibility list bliss.

159
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,500
What you do is you suffer existentially.
And so that seems like a stupid

160
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,701
solutions.
You know,

161
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,710
if you take people,
and I've told you this,

162
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:16,820
and you expose them voluntarily to
things that they are avoiding and are

163
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,770
afraid of,
you know,

164
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,660
that they know they need to overcome in
order to meet their goals,

165
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,320
their self defined goals.
If you can teach people to stand up in

166
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,850
the face of the things they're afraid
of,

167
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,050
they get stronger and you don't know
what the upper limits to that art

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
because you might ask yourself like if
for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing

169
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,070
what you knew you needed to do by the
deaf,

170
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,330
by your own definitions,
right?

171
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,370
Within the value structure that you've
created,

172
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,550
to the degree that you've done that,
what would you be like?

173
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,400
Well,
you know,

174
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,310
there are remarkable people who come
into the world from time to time and

175
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:54,050
there are people who do find out over
decades long periods what they could be

176
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:59,051
like if they were who they were.
if they said if they spoke their being

177
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:03,890
forward and they get stronger and
stronger and stronger and we don't know

178
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,020
the limits to that.
We do not know the limits to that.

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,280
And so you could say,
well,

180
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:11,360
in part perhaps the reason that you're
suffering unbearably can be left at your

181
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,660
feet because you're not everything you
couldn't be and you know it.

182
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,290
And of course that's a terrible thing to
admit and it's a terrible thing to

183
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,780
consider,
but there's real promise in it,

184
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,040
right?
Because it means that

185
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,420
perhaps there's another way that you
could look at the world and the number

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,790
another way that you could act in the
world.

187
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,520
So what it would reflect back to you,
it'd be much better than what it

188
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:35,030
reflects back to you now.
And then the second part of that is,

189
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,730
well,
imagine that many people did that

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,830
because we've done a lot as human
beings.

191
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,680
We've done a lot of remarkable things.
And I told you alReady,

192
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,630
I think before the today for example,
about 250,000 people will be lifted out

193
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:51,230
of abject poverty.
And about 300,000 people attached to the

194
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,830
electrical power grid we're making.
People were lifting people out of

195
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,260
collectively at a faster rate that's
ever occurred in the history of

196
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,400
humankind by a huge margin.
And that's been going on unbelievably

197
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:07,140
quickly since the year 2000,
the un and plan to have poverty between

198
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,390
2000 and 2015 and it was accomplished by
2030.

199
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,990
So there's inequality developing in many
places and you hear lots of political

200
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,100
agitation about that.

201
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,750
But overall the tide is lifting everyone
up and that's a great thing.

202
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,710
We have no idea how fast we can multiply
that if people got their act together

203
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,930
and really aimed at it.
Because you know,

204
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,930
my,
my experience is with people that were

205
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,200
probably running at about 51 percent of
our capacity.

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,420
Something mean you can think about this
yourselves.

207
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,490
I often ask undergraduates how many
hours a day you waste or how many hours

208
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,310
a week you waste.
The classic answer is something like

209
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,560
four to six hours a day,
you know,

210
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:50,760
inefficient studying,
watching things on youtube that not only

211
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,310
do you not want to watch,
that you don't even care about that make

212
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,740
you feel horrible about watching.
After you're done,

213
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,040
that's probably four hours right there.
Now you think,

214
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,620
well that's 20,
25 hours a week.

215
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,740
It's 100 hours a month,
that's two and a half full work weeks.

216
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,950
It's half a year of work weeks per year,
and if your time is worth $20 an hour,

217
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,530
which is a radical underestimate.
It's probably more like 50.

218
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,960
If you think about it in terms of
deferred wages,

219
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,230
if you're wasting 20 hours a week,
you're wasting $50,000 a year and you

220
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:25,560
are doing that right now and it's
because you're young wasting $50,000 a

221
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:28,860
year as a way bigger catastrophe than it
would be for me to waste it because I'm

222
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,100
not going to last nearly as long and so
if your life isn't everything,

223
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,510
it could be.
You could ask yourself,

224
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,340
well,
what would happen if you just stopped

225
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,070
wasting the opportunities that are in
front of you?

226
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,490
You be who knows how much more
efficient,

227
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,120
10 times more efficient,
20 times more efficient.

228
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,020
ThAt's the prieto distribution.
You have no idea how efficient,

229
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,740
efficient people get.
It's completely off the charts.

230
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,580
Well,
and if we all got our act together

231
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:00,630
collectively and stopped making things
worse because that's another thing

232
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:04,050
people do all the time.
not only do they not do what they should

233
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,930
to make things better,
they actively attempt to make things

234
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:11,931
worse because they're spiteful or
resentful or arrogant or deceitful or

235
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:17,331
homicidal or genocidal or all of those
things all bundled together in an

236
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:21,780
absolutely pathological package.
If people stopped really,

237
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,500
really trying just to make things worse,
we have no idea how much better they

238
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,460
would get just because of that.
So there's this weird dynamic that's

239
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,750
part of the existential system of ideas
between human vulnerability,

240
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,930
social judgment,
both of which are are,

241
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,080
are,
are major causes of suffering and the

242
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,740
failure of individuals to adopt the
responsibility that they know they

243
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:46,350
should adopt.
And that's the thing that's interesting

244
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,050
too,
is that like one of the another thing

245
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,930
I've often asked my undergraduate
classes,

246
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
you know,
there's this idea that,

247
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,510
that people have that people have a
conscience and you know what the

248
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,240
conscience is.

249
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,800
It's,
it's this feeling or voice you have in

250
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,950
your head just before you do something
that you know is stupid,

251
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,490
telling you that probably you shouldn't
do that stupid thing.

252
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,280
You don't have to listen to it strangely
enough,

253
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,420
but you go ahead and do it anyways,
and then of course exactly what the

254
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:19,840
conscience told you was going to happen
inevitably happens so that you feel even

255
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:23,710
stupider about it than you would if it
happened by accident because you know,

256
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,370
I knew this was going to happen.
I got a warning it was going to happen

257
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,550
and I went and did it anyways.
And the funny thing too is that that

258
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,970
conscience operates within people and we
really don't understand what the hell

259
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,760
that is.
So you might say,

260
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,590
well,
what would happen if you abided by your

261
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,930
conscience for five years or for 10
years?

262
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,850
What sort of position might you be in?

263
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,240
What sort of family might you have?
What sort of relationship might you be

264
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,910
able to forge?
And you can be bloody sure that a

265
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,911
relationship that's forged on the basis
of who you actually are is going to be a

266
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,970
lot stronger and more welcome than one
that's forged on the basis of who you

267
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,260
aren't.
Now,

268
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,060
of course,
thAt means that the person you're with

269
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:05,650
has to deal with the full force of you
in all your ability and your

270
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,270
catastrophe,
and that's a very,

271
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:11,290
very dIfficult thing to negotiate,
but if you do negotiate it well,

272
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,100
at least you have something,
you have somewhere solid to stand and

273
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:18,370
you have somewhere to live.
You have a real life and it's a great

274
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,580
basis upon which to bring children into
the world,

275
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,410
for example,
because you can have an actual

276
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,770
relationship with them instead of
torturing them half to death,

277
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:31,771
which is what happens in a tremendous,
a tremendously large minority of cases.

278
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,920
Well,
it's more than that too because,

279
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:38,980
and this is what I'll close with and
this is why I wanted to introduce social

280
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:40,330
nixon's readings to you.
You see,

281
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,550
because It isn't merely that your fate
depends on whether or not you get your

282
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:49,810
act together and to what degree you
decide that you're going to live out

283
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,870
your own genuine being.
It isn't only your fate,

284
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
it's the fate of everyone that you're
networked with.

285
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,130
And so you know,
you think,

286
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:59,440
well,
there's 9 billion,

287
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,830
7 billion people in the world,
we're going to peak at about $9 million

288
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:04,930
by the way,
and then it'll decline rapidly,

289
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,510
but 7 billion people in the world and
who are you?

290
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,720
You're just one little dust mote among
that 7 billion.

291
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,970
And so it really doesn't matter what you
do or don't do,

292
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:17,080
but that's simply not the case.
It's the wrong model because you're at

293
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,710
the center of a network,
you're a node in a network.

294
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,440
Of course that's even more true now that
we have social media,

295
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,260
you'll,
you'll know a thousand people at least

296
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:29,440
over the course of your life and they'll
know a thousand people each and that

297
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:33,760
puts you one person away from a million
and two persons away from a billion.

298
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,240
And so that's how you're connected and
the things you do,

299
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,830
they're like dropping a stone in a pond.
The ripples move outward and they effect

300
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:44,800
things in ways that you can't fully
comprehend.

301
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,490
And it means that the things that you do
and that you don't do are far more

302
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,880
important than you think.
And so if you act that way,

303
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:55,100
of course,
the terror of realizing that is that it

304
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,800
actually starts to matter what you do.
And you might say,

305
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,930
well,
that's better than living a meaningless

306
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,270
existence.
It's better for it to matter.

307
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,020
But I mean if you really asked yourself,
would you be so sure if you had the

308
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,510
choice,
I can live with no responsibility

309
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,344
whatsoever.

310
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,150
The price I pay is that nothing matters
or I can reverse it and everything

311
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,090
matters,
but I have to take the responsibility

312
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,450
that's associated with that.
It's not so obvious to me thAt people

313
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,690
would take the meaningful path.
Now when you say,

314
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,580
well,
nihilists suffer dreadfully because

315
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,500
there's no meaning in their life and
needs still suffer.

316
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,540
Yeah,
but the advantages,

317
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,730
they have no responsibility.
So that's the payoff.

318
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,500
And I actually think that's the
motivation.

319
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:33,831
Say,
well,

320
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,830
I can't help being nihilistic.
All my belief systems have collapsed.

321
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:37,611
It's like,
yeah,

322
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:40,070
maybe.
Maybe you've just allowed them to

323
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,410
collapse because it's a hell of a lot
easier than acting them out.

324
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,810
And the price you pay is a meaningless
suffering,

325
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,840
but you can always whine about that and
people will feel sorry for you and you

326
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,000
have the option of taking the pathway of
the martyr,

327
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,200
so that's a pretty good deal.

328
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,420
All things considered,
especially when they are,

329
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,040
when the alternative is to bear your
burden properly and to live forthrightly

330
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,630
in the world.
Well what units and figured out and so

331
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,240
many people in the 20th century,
it's not just him,

332
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:10,190
even though he's the best example,
is that if you live a pathological life,

333
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,330
you pathologize your society and if
enough people do that,

334
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,950
then it's hell really,
really,

335
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,290
and you can read the gulag archipelago
if you have the fortitude to do that and

336
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:28,100
you'll see exactly what hell is like and
then you can decide if that's a place

337
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,530
you'd like to visit or even more
importantly,

338
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,230
if it's a light,
if it's a place you'd like to visit and

339
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,190
take all your family and friends because
that's what happened in the 20th

340
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:40,580
century.
How to think about motivation will think

341
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,410
about it from the hypothalamic
perspective.

342
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,350
So we could say one thing that
motivation does is set goals.

343
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,010
We can say that emotions track progress
towards goals,

344
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,160
and I'm going to use that schema even
though it's not exactly right.

345
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,120
so you say,
well,

346
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,370
motivation determines where you're going
to aim.

347
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,350
So if you're hungry,
you're going to aim at something to eat

348
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,850
and then that will organize your
perceptions so that you zero out

349
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,800
everything that isn't relevant to that
task,

350
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,340
which is almost everything.
You concentrate on those few things that

351
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,380
are going to facilitate your movement
forward.

352
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,350
When you encounter those things that
produces positive emotion,

353
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,400
as you move through the world towards
your goal and you see that things are

354
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,400
laying themselves out that facilitate
your movement forward,

355
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,330
those things cause positive emotion and
if you encounter anything that gets in

356
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,850
the way,
then that produces negative emotion and

357
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:29,420
it can be like threat because you're not
supposed to encounter something that

358
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,254
gets in the way.

359
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,060
It can be anger so that you move it
away.

360
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,250
It can be frustration,
disappointment,

361
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,450
grief.
Those would,

362
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,120
if,
if you had a response that serious to an

363
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,550
obstacle,
it would probably punish the little

364
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:43,060
motivated frame right out of existence,
you know,

365
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,180
so you walked downstairs and out.
I know they're contracting company

366
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,860
instead of wrecking ball through your
kitchen.

367
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,150
It's like that's going to be
disappointing.

368
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,970
You're not going to keep eating the
peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,

369
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,690
that little frame is going to get
punished out of existence and some new

370
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,480
goal is going to pop up and instead,
and you know,

371
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,260
one of the things we're going to try to
sort out is how do you decide when

372
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,590
you've encountered an obstacle that's so
big that you should just quit and go do

373
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,810
something else because that's not
obvious,

374
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,990
you know,
and you can,

375
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,600
you can get into counter productive
persistence pretty easily.

376
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,850
So we don't know how people solve that
problem.

377
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,860
It's a really complicated one.
So anyways,

378
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:24,861
we're gonna work on that scenario.
Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals

379
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:29,370
that are directly relevant to biological
survival that produces a frame of

380
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,470
reference.
So it's not a goal,

381
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,650
it's not a drive and it's not a
collection of behaviors.

382
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,150
It's a little personality and the
personality has a viewpoint.

383
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,940
It has thoughts that go along with it.
It has perceptions,

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,100
it has action tendencies,
all of that.

385
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,490
You can see this in addiction most
particularly,

386
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,110
so one of the things that you find often
with people who are alcoholic is they

387
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,550
lie all the time and that's because when
they're.

388
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,910
They built a little alcohol dependent
personality inside of themselves or a

389
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,250
big one might.
Maybe it's 90 percent of their

390
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:06,030
personality and one of that.
One of the things that component

391
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,560
consists of is all the rationalizations
that they've used over the years to

392
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:15,240
justify their addiction to themselves
and to other people and so the addiction

393
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,520
has a personality,
you know,

394
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,970
and so when the person is off or maybe
they're addicted to meth or something

395
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:22,860
like that,
where we know the addiction is more.

396
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,330
It's more short term powerful than I
would say,

397
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,880
than an alcohol addiction.
They'll say anything and the the,

398
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,340
the words are just tools used to get
towards the goal and if they happen to

399
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,510
be deceptive,
whatever,

400
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,790
it doesn't matter.
They're just practical tools to get

401
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,640
towards the goal.
And then when you get towards the goal

402
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,710
and you take a nice shot of math or
something like that,

403
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,240
you reinforce all those rationales that
you use to get the drug and then the

404
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,550
next time you're even a better deceiver
and liar.

405
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,340
So okay,
so we're gonna say motivations.

406
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,410
One way of thinking about as they set
goals,

407
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,150
but it's not the right way of thinking
about it.

408
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,820
They produce a whole framework of
interpretation.

409
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,830
And so we're gonna.
Think about that framework of

410
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,440
interpretation.
And then emotions emerged inside of

411
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,640
that.
So that's it.

412
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,100
So the world is framed.

413
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,180
Motivations,
set goals.

414
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,890
You could say the world has to be
framed.

415
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,100
SO motivation sets that frame,
cruise goals,

416
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,470
emotions,
perceptions and actions and inactions

417
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:20,370
track progress.
So positive emotion says you're moving

418
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,270
forward properly towards your goal.
And if you encounter something you don't

419
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,260
expect,
you stop.

420
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,820
That's anxiety.
It's like,

421
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
oh,
we're not where we thought we were.

422
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,070
And so we don't know what to do,
so we should stop because we don't know

423
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:33,180
where we are,
what we're doing.

424
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,710
Stop frozen.
And then the more powerful negative

425
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:40,350
emotions like pain they might make you
get out of there.

426
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,710
So emotions forward,
stop,

427
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,500
reverse.
That's your emotions within that

428
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,520
motivated.
So.

429
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,480
And that's another example of how your
mind is embedded in your body.

430
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,500
Your emotions are in like their
offshoots of action tendencies.

431
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,060
That's,
that's the right way to think about it

432
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,400
because action is everything
fundamentally.

433
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,890
So what are some basic motivations?
Most of these are regulated by the

434
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:06,970
hypothalamus,
by the way,

435
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,670
aNd that that tells you just how
important to control system it is.

436
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,640
The other thing that's useful to know
about the hypothalamus is that it has

437
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,690
projections going up from it that are
like tree trunks and inhibitory

438
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,290
projections coming down there.
They're like grape vines.

439
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,010
So you can kind of control your
hypothalamus as long as it's not on too

440
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,070
much,
but if it's on in any serious way,

441
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,170
it's like it.
It winds.

442
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,660
So partly what you do to stop yourself
from falling under the dominion of your

443
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,050
hypothalamus is to never,
ever be anywhere where it's action is

444
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,910
necessary,
right?

445
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,080
You don't want to go into a biker bar
because you might find yourself in a

446
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:47,350
situation where panicked.
Defensive aggression is immediately

447
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:49,720
necessary.
You probably don't want that.

448
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,030
You don't want the panic.
You don't want the terror,

449
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,970
you don't want the frenzied fight.
You don't want any of that.

450
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,310
You don't want to have to run away in
absolute panic,

451
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,490
so you just don't go there.
And then a huge,

452
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,500
a huge part of how we regulate our
emotions is just by never going anywhere

453
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:09,460
where we have to experience them and so
that has very little to do with internal

454
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,600
inhibitory control and everything to do
with staying where you belong.

455
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,820
The myth of mental illness by thomas sad
as zed,

456
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,020
a s zed,
it's classic.

457
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,690
You should read it if you're interested
in psychology,

458
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,710
read it like it's a class and he
basically said,

459
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,400
most people have problems in living.
They don't have psychological problems.

460
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,100
And so I've experienced,
despite my love for the psychoanalysts,

461
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,620
very frequently what I'm doing as a
therapist is helping people have a life

462
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,610
that would work.

463
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,630
you know,
and you can parameterize that.

464
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:51,450
It's like you need.
How about some friends that you feel

465
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,830
kind of like that?
How about an intimate relationship with

466
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,230
someone that you can trust that maybe
has a future.

467
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,200
That'd be good.
How about a career that puts you in a

468
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:03,580
dominance hierarchy somewhere so at
least you've got some possibility of

469
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,220
rising,
some possibility of stabilizing yourself

470
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,260
and their schedule and a routine because
no one can live without a routine.

471
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,170
You just forget that if you guys don't
have a routine,

472
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,690
I would recommend you get one going
because you cannot be mentally healthy

473
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,570
without a routine.
You need to pick a time to get up

474
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,260
whatever time you want,
but pick one and stick to it because

475
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:31,261
otherwise you disregulate your circadian
rhythms and they regulate your mood and

476
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,120
eat something.
In the morning.

477
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,570
I had lots of clients who have that
anxiety disorders.

478
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,060
I had one client who was literally
starving,

479
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,610
very smart girl.
She.

480
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,470
There's very little that she liked.
She kind of tried to subsist on like

481
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,960
half a cup of rice a day.
She came to me and said,

482
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,970
I have no energy.
I come home.

483
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,640
All I want to do is watch the same movie
over and over.

484
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,500
What?
Like is that weird?

485
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,170
And I thought,
well it depends on how hard you work.

486
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,090
You know,
it's a little weird.

487
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,510
Whatever familiar you're looking for
comfort.

488
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,720
So I did an analysis of her diet.
It's like three quarters of a cup of

489
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,680
rice.
It's like you're starving,

490
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,150
eat something,
you know,

491
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,040
you'll feel better.
So she modified her diet and you're all.

492
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,380
Our anxiety went away and she had some
energy.

493
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,610
It's like,
yeah,

494
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,490
you got to eat.
So schedule.

495
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,220
That's a good thing man.
Your brain will thank you for it.

496
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
It will stabilize your nervous system
with a bit of a plan.

497
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,190
That's a good thing.
You need a career.

498
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:39,590
You need something productive to do with
your time.

499
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,370
You need to regulate your use of drugs
and alcohol.

500
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,880
Most particularly alcohol because that
does even a lot of people

501
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,400
need a family,
like the family,

502
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:55,850
you have your parents and all that.
It'd be nice if you all got along.

503
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:58,350
You can work on that.
That's a good thing to work on it and

504
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,200
you know you probably need children.
at some point,

505
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:03,800
and that's life,
that's what life is,

506
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,300
and if you're missing,
you know,

507
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:10,760
you may have a good reason to not be
operating on one of those dimensions.

508
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,410
It's not mandatory,
but I can tell you that if you're not

509
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:19,070
operating reasonably well on four,
I think I mentioned six,

510
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:22,130
if you're not operating reasonably well
on at least three of them,

511
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,240
there's no way you're going to be
psychologically thriving and that's more

512
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,060
pragmatic in some sense than
psychological,

513
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:32,420
right?

514
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,100
HumAn beings have a nature.
There's things we need and if we have

515
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,950
them well that's good,
and if we don't have them well then we

516
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,680
feel the lack.
So behaviorists,

517
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,520
behavioral psychologists concentrate a
lot more on that sort of thing.

518
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,290
No,
it's practical.

519
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,920
It's strategizing.
Make a career plan,

520
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,260
figuring out how to negotiate because
that's bloody important.

521
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,550
Figuring out how to say what you need to
figure out how to tell the truth.

522
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,600
He figure out how to listen to your
partner in particular because if you

523
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,580
listen to them,
they will actually tell you what they

524
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:11,780
want and sometimes you can give it to
them and maybe they'll return the favor

525
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,360
and if you practice that for like 15
years,

526
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,900
well then maybe you're constantly giving
each other what you want.

527
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,040
Well,
hooray.

528
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,070
That would be good.
And then there's two of you under both

529
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:28,071
circumstances and it's better to have
two brains than one because people think

530
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,860
differently because of their temperament
mostly.

531
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,370
And so the negotiation is where the
wisdom arises and it's part of the

532
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,890
transformation,
a psychological transformation that's

533
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:44,100
attendant on an intimate relationship
and one the fundamental purposes

534
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,050
of a longterm intimate relationship.
