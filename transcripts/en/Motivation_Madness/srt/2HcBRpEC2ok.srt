1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,250
Have you accepted that where you are is
where you're going to be?

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,380
You've already lost,

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,660
but something else bronc inside me,
something brewing inside me.

4
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,810
I wanted it to be different.
I was determined to be unique.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,660
I was driven to think big and dream big.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
We are being raised in a generation of
people that come up with every excuse in

7
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:35,361
the book as to why they are not winning
you.

8
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,350
Other reason,
you are not winning.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,840
It's time you get off to a pity party.
Stop complaining about being out of

10
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,890
shape when you never go to the gym.
I stopped looking at your stomach.

11
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:51,210
When you get out of the shower and your
body and complaining about the way you

12
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,630
look when you're eating everything in
sight and never gone to the gym.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,240
I don't feel sorry for you.
You feel sorry for yourself.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,530
That's the problem

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,820
because he didn't work hard enough.

16
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,380
I never want to do
because it didn't work hard enough.

17
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,500
I always believed leaving no stone
unturned.

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,670
It's necessary to know that everybody
won't see it,

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,920
that everybody won't join you.
It's necessary to know that,

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,880
that a lot of people like to complain,
but they don't want to do anything about

21
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:40,210
their situation that you are an uncommon
breed.

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,980
You know,
you have to know within yourself that I

23
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,560
can do this even if no one else sees it
for me,

24
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,590
I must see it for myself.
It's very important for you to believe

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,940
that you are the one.
