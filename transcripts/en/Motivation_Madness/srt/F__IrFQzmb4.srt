1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,461
Hey,
listen,

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:10,200
when most people think of success or
failure,

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,890
they think of these big giant things,
but failure is not an overnight

4
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,490
experience and neither is success.
Failure was the result of failure to

5
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,890
make the calls.
Failure to follow through.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,900
Failure to say,
I love you.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,100
Failure to give 100% that creates
ultimate failure in life.

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,720
The feelings we want to avoid it almost
all costs and yet successes also one

9
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,850
step at a time.
It's successfully making the call and

10
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:37,320
successfully getting herself up and
following through it successfully.

11
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:41,340
Making sure you make that unique.
Contact it successfully breaking through

12
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,730
the limits that used to stop you.
It's the culmination of all those little

13
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,110
successes over a lifetime that
eventually creates a life that we have

14
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:54,090
total pride and joy knowing is our own,
and I'm here to tell you that anything

15
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,460
you focus on,
on a consistent basis,

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,780
you put 100% of yourself into and you
can try and prove daily on you will

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,340
improve,
you will get better.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,990
The problem is most of us in life do not
control the power of our mental focus.

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,120
In fact,
most of us focused on things like,

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,781
well,
Gosh,

21
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,990
how come my life isn't working?
How come this always happens to me?

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,560
And if you focus on that enough,
that's exactly what you'll experience in

23
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,900
life.
Whatever we focus on consistently,

24
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,530
we tend to manifest in our lives.
Don't you already believe that my

25
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,440
hallucination is you already do or you
wouldn't have picked up a tape program

26
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,260
like this?
The key is getting ourselves to live by

27
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,760
these factors.
You know,

28
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,180
most people in life,
major and minor things that is,

29
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,690
they're focused on how to make a living
instead of how to design their life.

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,980
You may be wondering what drove me to
want to really study success in this

31
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,360
level of depth.
In fact,

32
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,500
a lot of people say to me,
Tony,

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,510
how did you become so successful?

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,710
While I'm complimented by the statement,
but my response usually is the same

35
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,920
thing that drives all of us to succeed.
One of two experiences,

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,000
either inspiration or desperation.
For me,

37
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,210
it was more desperation.
I grew up in an environment I did not

38
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:02,070
like and it started back as far as high
school.

39
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,140
For me.
I remember looking around and being

40
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,730
dissatisfied.
And by the way,

41
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,280
if you're dissatisfied with some area of
your life right now,

42
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,530
instead of being frustrated,
get excited,

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,230
cause I got to tell you something.
Until you get dissatisfied,

44
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,630
you won't do anything to really make
your life at another level.

45
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,960
Dissatisfaction is a gem.
If you're totally satisfied,

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,960
you're going to get comfortable and then
your life begins to deteriorate.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,480
But I found myself dissatisfied with my
environment.

48
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:28,680
I didn't like what I saw growing up.
I saw my father working extremely hard

49
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,810
as a salesman,
40 or 50 hours a week.

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,140
And yet most of the time we were broke
and I didn't understand why.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,450
I remember what that did to them
emotionally.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,050
And that drove a lot enough pain inside
of me that I thought to myself at that

53
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,000
time,
I don't want to ever have my family have

54
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,820
to go through this and I don't wanna
have to go through it myself ever again.

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,230
I thought someday I'm going to master
financial success so I can only help

56
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,700
myself,
but the people around me,

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,550
and that was a driving force for my
success in that area.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,970
I remember going to high school and that
was not a real popular kid,

59
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,610
but I really love people and I being
around them and I wanted everybody to

60
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,430
like me and a lot of people did,
but I wasn't the most popular kid in

61
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,840
school.
But you know,

62
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,720
I thought some day I'm going to meet the
most popular kid in school and I'm going

63
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,250
to find out what makes them so popular.

64
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,370
He's probably one of the nicest,
most warm and genuine people you could

65
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:14,590
ever meet.
I remember the day I met this kid,

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,400
he treated me like I was dirt.
Like how dare I enter his space?

67
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,920
And I thought,
how could somebody who's this rude be

68
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,940
this successful and having people like
him and it made me want to study what

69
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,970
makes people like other people.
I remember looking around at people in

70
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,370
relationships,
people been married five,

71
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,190
10 15 years who are just hanging out
together.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,740
They still have that passion that drive
for each other.

73
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,010
They really loved each other 100% it's
like they were newlyweds.

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,320
I remember one day going to my mother
and saying,

75
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,440
how come this is my fourth father?
I'm just curious,

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,250
and she told me an explanation that they
didn't quite understand at the time,

77
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,500
but I can tell you one thing,
it motivated me to want to make

78
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,580
relationships work.

79
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,600
So out of all of these things,
what happened for me in my mind is I

80
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,434
said,
look,

81
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,870
I don't like the way my life is.
I want to make it better.

82
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,730
And so somewhere in my mind I linked up
that what I should do is study success.

83
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,250
And if you want anything in life,
you've got to make it a study.

84
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,840
If you want to be successful,
you've got to study it,

85
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,120
not leave it to chance.
If you want to be happy,

86
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,940
you've got to study happiness.
If you want to be wealthy,

87
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,980
you've got to study wealth.
If you want to be healthy,

88
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,440
you've got to study health.
You can't just hope that things will

89
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,170
turn out okay.
You can see what hoping does for most

90
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,240
people,
most people don't have what they want

91
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,830
and they just keep hoping it will
change.

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,690
The bottom line for me is I went out and
started studying success like a madman.

93
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,340
I believe that if you will immerse
yourself and focus on anything,

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,200
you're going to get good at it and so I
decided to get good at understanding how

95
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,040
to make my life work and I went out and
read almost 700 books in the area of

96
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,160
human development.
Everything from your basic positive

97
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,070
thinking to your more esoteric forms of
change.

98
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,130
When I find I was so sophisticated,
the point is this,

99
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,200
as they read all this material and I
listened to tapes constantly in my car,

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,720
anytime I could,
I tried to dump some good stuff into my

101
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,910
mind.
I went to seminar after seminar after

102
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,040
seminar.
Many of them were lousy,

103
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,310
but my attitude was half.
I go to a seminar and all I get is one

104
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,590
idea.
It's worth my attending or if I go to a

105
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,230
seminar,
all it does is tell me what I already

106
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,050
know,
but I hear it another time and now maybe

107
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,210
by hearing and again I actually now use
it.

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,090
What a concept.
Then maybe I can make my life work.

109
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,230
And so I went for that strategy.
That repetition is the mother of skill

110
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,250
and I heard enough and I read enough and
I watched enough and I listened to

111
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,730
enough and I poured so much good stuff
in that you can guess.

112
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,650
Eventually good stuff started coming
back out.

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,770
In fact,
within a short period of time,

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,040
I became totally successful.
Now we all have our own definition of

115
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,510
success,
but you can guess what mine was back

116
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,990
then growing up pretty poor financially.
I ain't even know the answer was money.

117
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,531
I figured,
Hey,

118
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:50,410
if you make enough money,
it'll solve all of life's problems.

119
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,630
Is that true?
Of course not.

120
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,020
But if you make enough money,
at least you can arrive at your problems

121
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,420
in style.
You drive up in your limousine to handle

122
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,020
your problem.

123
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,180
It's a whole nother world.
Seriously.

124
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,850
My point is this.
I had really made it.

125
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,860
I thought by the time I was 19 years
old,

126
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,670
I went out and just use massive action.
I read all these books,

127
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,030
I listen to all this material and I went
out and just apply everything I could

128
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,760
and a short period of time I had this
big company.

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,420
I was written up in newspapers and
magazines is this young entrepreneur.

130
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,280
They called me wonderboy.
My Ego was exploding and I had what I

131
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,140
thought success was.
At that time of my life,

132
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,990
I had a lot of money.
I was making about $10,000 a month in

133
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,540
income,
which for a 19 year old kid for anyone

134
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,240
seems like a lot of money.
It seems like a lot of success,

135
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,410
but something interesting happened and
the interesting thing that happened was

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,660
I'd never had that level of success
before.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,870
I had never had that many people liking
me and acknowledging me.

138
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,920
I'd never had that much money.
I'd never had that kind of experience.

139
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,370
It was beyond my comfort zone.
Now,

140
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,790
I'm not talking you about consciously
now see consciously I thought I wanted

141
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,650
more and better and all these other
kinds of things,

142
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,630
but subconsciously I believe that most
of us have a subconscious idea of what

143
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,430
we think we deserve.
I mean,

144
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,220
imagine it as if it's a thermostat
attached to your brain.

145
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
If we have a thermostat in this room and
we set it at 68 degrees and it's not hot

146
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,880
enough in here,
things aren't moving,

147
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:17,690
it's not warm enough and the temperature
drops down to 62 degrees,

148
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,240
what's going to happen?
The heaters kick on.

149
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,550
All of a sudden what happens?
Anxiety.

150
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,361
Your brain says,
Hey,

151
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,410
we got to make it better than this.

152
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,080
This isn't good enough for me.
And sure enough,

153
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,220
all of a sudden you get this push,
this drive to change things and that's

154
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,990
what happens in life when it's not good
enough.

155
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,250
When your life does not represent right
now what you think it should be like.

156
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,150
What's interesting though that most
people don't realize is it happens on

157
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,550
the other side too.
What do I mean?

158
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,970
I mean,
if you set it at 68 degrees and all of a

159
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,470
sudden things start going really well,
hey,

160
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,780
it starts heating up in here.
We start cranking.

161
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,220
If it gets up around 72 73 degrees,
what happens in this room?

162
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,880
The air conditioners kick on and you
begin to sabotage your own success and

163
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:05,180
you drop right back down to where you
subconsciously think you deserve to be

164
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,540
in your relationships and your economics
and your level of acknowledgement.

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,800
Does this make sense to you?

166
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,640
It doesn't make sense intellectually,
but it does make sense when you start

167
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:16,280
studying how human beings behave,
and that's what I did.

168
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,140
I began to sabotage my own success.
How I started not short for key

169
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,720
meetings.
I started treat people harshly who

170
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,640
didn't deserve to be treated harshly at
all.

171
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,940
I started eating like I was going out of
style.

172
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,230
I was never into drugs or alcohol,
but I use food like it was a drug.

173
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,670
If it didn't like how I felt,
well,

174
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:36,590
I just eat something.
I was going to change how I felt,

175
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,080
but then I looked in the mirror and I
was getting fatter and I felt worse so I

176
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,010
ate some more and it just didn't work.
I got caught up in this vicious circle,

177
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,110
so much so that within two and a half
months I gained 38 pounds.

178
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,790
That is not easy to do.

179
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,910
You have to eat tons of food and not
move very much to pull that off,

180
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,160
which I managed to do.
The bottom line is this though,

181
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,100
as I began to sabotage,
it didn't stop with me.

182
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:03,000
It started at affect everyone around me.
I fired almost everyone in my company.

183
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,330
I only had about three employees left
and I fired them too,

184
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,800
but every time I go there,
your fire,

185
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,510
they go,
I know and they just keep on working

186
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,660
thinking sooner or later things would
work out and I become sane.

187
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,340
I went totally broke financially and I
moved into a little 400 square foot

188
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,130
bachelor apartment in Venice,
California,

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
no kitchen,
washing my dishes in the bathtub,

190
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,740
waking up each morning with major goals,
things like what am I going to eat today

191
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,950
and what's going to happen to Luke and
Laura on General Hospital,

192
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,900
my favorite program at the time.

193
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,050
So how do I get to be here with you?
How did my life turn around?

194
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,450
Well,
the answer is it wasn't just buy more

195
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:42,030
information.
It wasn't just buy more technology,

196
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,240
although that made a difference.
What made the big difference for me as a

197
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,950
friend came by someone I hadn't seen it
about two years and the reason he came

198
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,740
by to visit me and how to track me down
and he couldn't call me on the phone

199
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,080
because my phone was disconnected at
this point.

200
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,020
My nickname had gone from wonderboy and
the newspapers to just,

201
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:01,500
boy,
I changed virtually everything in my

202
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,590
life,
from my emotions to my finances,

203
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,230
from my confidence to my physical
health.

204
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,970
How do they do it?
Well,

205
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,550
I use what I call the ultimate success
formula.

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,040
And here's what it is.
It has four steps.

207
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,410
If you want to create the success in
your life,

208
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,030
it always comes back to this.

209
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,090
You can use whatever technology you want
to reprogram yourself,

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,100
but these are the four steps for
success.

211
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Step number one,
you've got to know your outcome in any

212
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,150
situation in life.
You've got to decide right now what I

213
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:34,620
want out of this situation in my life.
The more clear you are on what you want,

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,260
the more you empower your brain to come
up with answers.

215
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,480
There's an old phrase that may have been
overused,

216
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,290
but I think it's pretty accurate.
It says clarity is power.

217
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,300
You must get focused on what you want,
and in this tape program we have a goal

218
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:51,600
setting workshop that's going to help
you to get precisely clear and what you

219
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,070
want in your life,
mentally,

220
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,390
emotionally,
socially,

221
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,740
spiritually,
intellectually,

222
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,250
so that you have something that's a
driving force behind your behavior.

223
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,760
How can you use this first formula to
make a difference in your life right

224
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,450
now?

225
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,760
How could just getting clear and knowing
your outcome help you?

226
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,380
Well,
I believe when you know your outcome,

227
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:08,940
you've empowered yourself.
I mean,

228
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,730
let's say for example,
you're in the middle of an argument and

229
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,580
have you ever gotten caught up in an
argument where you're so caught up in it

230
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,500
that you forgot what you were going to
arguing for,

231
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,770
but you knew you had to win.
I know I've been there.

232
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,560
See if in the middle of that argument
you were to ask the question,

233
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,660
Hey,
what's my outcome in this situation?

234
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,330
You're going to probably find out your
outcome is not to argue.

235
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,730
The outcome you want is to resolve
something.

236
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,580
When you get focused on what you really
want out of a situation,

237
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:36,510
you empower your brain to use its
resources to produce results right now,

238
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,020
so get into that habit.
The habit of asking yourself,

239
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,290
what's my outcome and throughout these
30 days I'm going to constantly ask you

240
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,610
how can you use this?

241
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,610
What I just said?
What's useful about that for your life?

242
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,220
What is your outcome and applying this
in your own life,

243
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,920
it's critical to continually focus on
your target.

244
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,260
Even if you're just going to buy it a
visit with a friend on the way over to

245
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,220
see a friend,
ask yourself,

246
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,380
what's my outcome?
Maybe the answer is well,

247
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:02,680
just to have fun or to make my friend
feel really appreciated and loved.

248
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,080
Now,
if you know that your outcome,

249
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,110
your chances of having more fun or
making your friend feel love,

250
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:12,490
go up 1000% versus if you just go over
and hang out and wonder why your board

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,270
now I'm not saying you have to be so
goal oriented that every minute you're

252
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:19,270
trying to achieve something.
I'm just saying it's useful to let your

253
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,580
brain know the direction that you're
heading and everyone I know who

254
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:26,560
succeeded had to start with getting
clear on exactly what they wanted.

255
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,720
Here's step two of the ultimate success
formula.

256
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,490
By the way,
step one I did.

257
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,370
I decided what I wanted physically,
financially,

258
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,810
emotionally in my business.
I looked at everything spiritually and

259
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:40,930
once I knew I had the first stage and my
personal power.

260
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,290
Step two,
to tapping your power because you've got

261
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,430
to use it.
That is you've got to get yourself to

262
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,460
take action and move towards the
achievement of your goals.

263
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,900
Now,
what most people tell he is,

264
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,380
but I don't know what to do.
I don't know.

265
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,530
I never had.
What if I try and it doesn't work?

266
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,350
How I can say D is this.
If you're trying,

267
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,910
it doesn't work.
You got an education,

268
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,910
you're better off than where you were
before because you now know what doesn't

269
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,250
work and you'll probably make a
distinction or two that will help you

270
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,640
succeed even more.
Most people in life have no idea what

271
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,990
they want,
but worse,

272
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,270
a few people know what they want,
but they don't do anything about it.

273
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,020
They just sit around and hope or say,
someday,

274
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,050
honey,
we'll do this someday is now someday is

275
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,330
here.
I remember hearing a phrase years ago

276
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,060
that said,
the road to someday leads to a town of

277
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,670
nowhere and it's a place you don't want
to end up in,

278
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,620
so you've got to get yourself to take
action.

279
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,660
How do you do that?
You decide.

280
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,640
I hear people all the time saying,
well Gosh,

281
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,330
how do I change my life?
And my answer is decide to make a

282
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,700
decision right now.
You're not willing to settle for

283
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,790
anything less than you can be,
that you're not willing to live the way

284
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,730
you're living right now,
no matter how good it may seem that

285
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,410
you're going to push yourself to the
next level.

286
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,210
Demanding more from yourself than
anybody else could possibly expect is

287
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,090
true power.
And all it takes is deciding.

288
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,290
Remember the word decision and its
original Latin root means to cut off

289
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,950
from when you decide you cut off from
any other possibility.

290
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,510
The biggest trap that keeps people from
taking action is their fear,

291
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,210
their fear of failure.
They're fair success,

292
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,300
their fear of rejection or fear of pain,
their fear of the unknown.

293
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,670
The only way to deal with fear is face
it.

294
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,640
Look at Iti and take action in spite of
it.

295
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm sure you've probably heard of some
of the seminars I deal in which we teach

296
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:25,210
people how to break through their fears
and take action and at the end of the

297
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,630
seminar they get a chance to use what
they've learned to overcome a major fear

298
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,780
and literally walked through fire
between 802,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a

299
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,020
lot of people think it's crazy.
Go.

300
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,810
Why would you do a thing like that?
Well,

301
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,850
not to teach people new picnic skills
and if not mind over matter right now.

302
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,800
You could walk through fire.
I'm not encouraging you to make sure you

303
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,360
hear me,
but you could.

304
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,090
It's absolutely possible you don't need
me to do it.

305
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,000
You could also be up at 6:00 AM with
total passion for living.

306
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,450
You could also have the person of your
dreams be in your life right now.

307
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,430
You could also be earning what you're
worth.

308
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,460
You could also have more influence on
your children than virtually anyone

309
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,800
else,
but few people do.

310
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,010
It's not what we can do in life that
makes the difference.

311
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,430
It's what we will do and we don't follow
through because we don't know what we

312
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,220
want oftentimes,
and when we know we're afraid to take

313
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:14,420
action.
Listen,

314
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,180
fear can service.
Fear isn't all bad.

315
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,850
Say it'll make us pay attention as long
as fear,

316
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:23,750
as a counselor and not a jailer.
Make sure that you listen to your fear,

317
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,380
mixed some more distinctions and to get
yourself to take action in spite of it.

318
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,930
And I gotta tell you,
breaking through fear is like anything

319
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,110
else.

320
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,440
It's like a muscle in the beginning.
If you try and lift to heavyweight boy,

321
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,280
you might say,
Gosh,

322
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:37,550
I can't do this,
but if you start small and you build

323
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:40,910
every single day for like 30 days,
for example,

324
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,570
then what's going to happen is every day
you get a little stronger and pretty

325
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,720
soon it becomes effortless to do what
used to feel like it was impossible.

326
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,190
It's time for you to develop the muscle
of making decisions quickly and easily

327
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,030
and following through on them.
Here's the third key element to the

328
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,570
ultimate success formula.
Once you know what you want and to get

329
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,510
yourself to take action,
do your actions always work?

330
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,290
Of course not.
Most people in life fail much more often

331
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,310
they succeed.
In fact,

332
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:10,610
the most successful people are the most
successful people because they failed

333
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,230
more than anybody else.
I mean,

334
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,064
think about it.

335
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,670
Think about it in baseball and baseball,
a hall of Famer,

336
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,870
someone who's the best in the world at
what they do in the area of baseball,

337
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,380
they fail seven times out of 10.
How'd you like to have a life like that?

338
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,820
Bottom line is to get in the hall of
fame.

339
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,840
They only succeed about 30% of the time.
They failed more than 70% of the time.

340
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,240
And you know what?
That's how life is too.

341
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,580
Hey,
listen and doing this taping with you

342
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,370
and talking to you personally.
I may not sound elegant all the time

343
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,190
cause I don't care.
When I want to do is get across to you,

344
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,140
I want you to get the message in your
gut.

345
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,630
That's what matters to me.
If I say something,

346
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,770
it doesn't work,
I'll just move on to something else.

347
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,110
And I ask you to try the same thing in
life.

348
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,480
Most people in life,
out of their fear of failure,

349
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,790
don't try anything at all.
And that's ultimate failure.

350
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,180
You got to get yourself to take action.
You got to get yourself to follow

351
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:03,050
through and you gotta be willing to
notice whether it's working or not.

352
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:05,750
That's step three.
Notice what you're getting from your

353
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,130
actions.
In other words,

354
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,830
you know what you want.
You got yourself to take action.

355
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,090
Now notice,
is it working?

356
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,760
Am I getting closer to my goal or
further away?

357
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,510
Don't kid yourself or just keep taking
action because after all,

358
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,750
you work so hard to do it this way.
I might as well keep on doing it so you

359
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,460
don't want to get locked in a tunnel
vision.

360
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,400
Remember,
flexibility is power.

361
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,250
What you've got to do though is know
what you're getting.

362
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,830
I mean a standard examples.
Have you ever had somebody come up and

363
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:35,150
talk to them and they're going on and on
and on and you're trying to be very

364
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:36,910
polite and they mistake too.

365
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,250
You're being polite.
There's a way to speed up this formula

366
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,880
and that way is this.
Instead of just knowing what you want

367
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:48,260
and taking random actions,
you can use what I call role modeling to

368
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:52,200
accelerate pace of your success.
What I did is I said,

369
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,130
okay,
what do I want?

370
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm 38 pounds overweight.
I want to lose this weight.

371
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,560
I want to be 38 pounds lighter and I
want to have more energy.

372
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,510
I want to feel more vibrant to my wife.
You can tell by my energy level that I'm

373
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,740
real low energy person now compared to
how it was then.

374
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,770
Seriously,
I decided what I wanted and then what I

375
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:08,551
did is I said,
okay,

376
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,590
I've got to take action,
but what actions should I take?

377
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,920
I didn't know.
I tried dieting a zillion times and you

378
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,754
know what?
It would work.

379
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,730
I would lose weight,
gain it right back again and I lose

380
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,780
weight and gain it back again.

381
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,560
So what I decided to do is instead of
just taking some actions and sooner or

382
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,500
later figuring it out,
I decided to use a role model.

383
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:28,260
I said,
let me find someone who's already

384
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,680
getting the results that I want.
Help me find out what that person is

385
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,681
doing and do the same things that is,
I believe that success leaves clues that

386
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,240
if people succeed,
it's because they're doing certain

387
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:43,800
things over and over and over again.
And if we do the same kinds of things

388
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,590
and we pumped the same kinds of seeds,
we're going to reap the same kinds of

389
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:50,890
rewards regardless of our age or
background or religion or color or

390
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,110
gender.
None of that matters.

391
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,070
What matters is the law works for
everyone and if you apply it,

392
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,900
it'll work.
But you've got to know what to do.

393
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,340
And so this program is the result of me
going out and modeling people that are

394
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,174
successful.

395
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,480
That is instead of reinventing the wheel
and having you and I kept doing trial

396
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,920
and error on everything,
I said,

397
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,060
hey,
let me find some of these already in the

398
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:09,960
results.
Find out what they do.

399
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,370
Do the same things,
get the same results,

400
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,320
speed up time.
You've got to remember,

401
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:17,160
knowledge is not power.
Knowledge is potential power.

402
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,440
I mean,
don't you know someone who knows what

403
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,870
they should do with their life,
knows they should change their life,

404
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,390
knows how they can change their life and
they still don't do it.

405
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,150
You know,
somebody like that maybe intimately,

406
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,740
like maybe you for example,
at times than the bottom line is

407
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,350
knowledge is not enough.
We've got to get ourselves to follow

408
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,720
through.
So what did I do?

409
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,750
I found somebody who had been overweight
like me,

410
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,920
had become thin and stayed.
Then for years I found out what this

411
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,980
person did and I did the same things I'm
going to teach you in this program,

412
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:47,850
what to do to do that.

413
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,830
It wasn't just dieting.
That's not enough.

414
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,220
As a result of following through and
taking the same actions,

415
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,230
I lost 30 pounds in 30 days.
I lost all 38 pounds in about seven

416
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,530
weeks and I haven't gone back.
And the reason is I didn't just change

417
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:05,370
my diet.
I learned to mentally condition myself

418
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,130
to feel differently about certain foods
I was addicted to.

419
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,220
So I no longer had a desire for them.
The things that used to push me over the

420
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:14,010
edge.
I did the same thing in the area of

421
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,070
relationships.
I found a man who had the woman of my

422
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,380
dreams and I talked to him and said,
hey,

423
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,900
how did you attract this woman?
And I talked to her and said,

424
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,070
why do you like this guy?
You know,

425
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:26,370
why are you in a relationship with him?
And I began to find out certain things

426
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,200
he did that made that relationship work.

427
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,560
And I started applying some of the same
things and I did the same thing

428
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,350
financially.
I went from a place where I had no

429
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:38,730
confidence in myself emotionally feeling
depressed to a place of total strength

430
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,520
and financially,
I mean a measurable change to say the

431
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:43,920
least.
I was broke living in my 400 square foot

432
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:47,230
bachelor apartment.
What happened in less than 12 and I

433
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,530
moved to my 1200 square foot apartment
major progress at the time,

434
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:55,270
three times bigger to about four months
later I moved to a 10,000 square foot

435
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:58,580
castle.
Literally a castle built in 1925 with a

436
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:02,170
big three storey turret overlooking the
crashing waves of del Mar,

437
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,750
California.
I don't tell you this to impress you.

438
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,190
I tell it to impress upon you how quick
would you can make changes in your life

439
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,520
if you learn to master this incredible
computer between your ears called your

440
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,354
brain.

441
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,480
That's what we're going to study.
We're going to study in neuro sciences,

442
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,890
the sciences of success conditioning.
That's what this whole program is about

443
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,350
and we're going to do it a little piece
at a time so it's simple.

444
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,410
If you will do that,
the culmination of the 30 days,

445
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,860
you will find that you've gone on a
mental diet that will change your life

446
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:32,800
forever.
If success is really the simple,

447
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,560
if you could go from being where I was
years ago,

448
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,500
broken every sense of the word
emotionally broke,

449
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,500
physically broke,
socially broke,

450
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,600
and financially broke.
Two Alfie in all those areas,

451
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,630
meeting my dreams,
becoming a millionaire in less than 12

452
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,490
months,
if that's really possible.

453
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,210
If it's really as simple as using your
personal power and being flexible in

454
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,670
your approach and modeling all
successful people.

455
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:56,920
If it's really that simple,
how come everybody doesn't do this?

456
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,700
That's a good question.
A lot of things in life are really

457
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,560
simple,
but people don't apply them because they

458
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:05,740
get caught up in day to day stuff like,
well,

459
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,540
you know,
I gotta pay my bills.

460
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,980
They get caught up in making that living
instead of designing the life and they

461
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:14,980
come to the end of their life and find
out they lived only one 10th of it,

462
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,430
not because they weren't intelligent,
simply because they didn't get clear

463
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,590
about what they wanted.
They didn't get themselves to

464
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:25,240
consistently take action and develop
that decision making massive action

465
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:30,190
muscle and their emotional body.
They didn't vary their behaviors and now

466
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,920
they're stuck.
It's not a place I think you want to be.

467
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,410
Otherwise you wouldn't invest in this
program and you wouldn't be taking the

468
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:38,380
time to listen now.
So what I'm asking you to do is break

469
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,760
through those fears that stop you.

470
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,770
And you know,
the biggest one that comes up again and

471
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,420
again and we've already mentioned,
is failure.

472
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,910
I want you to know that failure can be
your best friend.

473
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,223
I mean,
think about it.

474
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,520
The greatest successes in the world are
people who often had so much pain from a

475
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,550
failure that drove them to much greater
success.

476
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,650
Did you know those little three m
stickers,

477
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,110
for example?
Those ones that you see that you can put

478
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,730
there,
I think they're called postit notes.

479
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:02,830
You can write on them and put them on
something and take it right off

480
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,780
instantly.
Do you know that was a result of a

481
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:08,860
massive failure by the chemist?
He was working at the time to create an

482
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,610
adhesive that would last forever.
Something that you could never pry

483
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,470
things apart with.
And as a result,

484
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,300
he came up with the stuff that didn't
work at all,

485
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,100
but he was smart enough to say,
Hey,

486
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:19,090
what can I use this for?

487
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,740
How can I use this suppose supposed
failure?

488
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:23,500
And he turned it into a multimillion
dollar business.

489
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,170
Lee Iacocca,
most people would agree is one of the

490
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,060
most successful role models in our
country.

491
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,610
Now I've got a question for you.
How can we sell successful?

492
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,560
Because he's a wonder kid.
Well,

493
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:33,520
yeah,
you could say that.

494
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,490
He worked for a company called Ford
Motor Company and he worked his way

495
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,010
through the ranks right up to the top,
worked his tail off,

496
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,560
was driven.
What really marked him his ability to

497
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,900
get people to take action,
his personal power.

498
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,730
He developed skill cause he's willing to
try almost anything.

499
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:49,610
He wouldn't accept no for an answer,
but you know what?

500
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,530
He had a little run in with a guy by the
name of Ford and he fired him and it

501
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,230
burned him pretty good.
Now I've got a question for you.

502
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you think when this company named
Chrysler came by and they look like for

503
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,720
sure there was no way they could be
turned around.

504
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,870
Do you think if he hadn't been fired by
Ford that he would have taken it?

505
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,981
He might say,
oh,

506
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,600
of course you would.
That's the way we is.

507
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,530
Wow.
I don't know.

508
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,440
According to his wife.
She said at the time,

509
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,041
he said,
honey,

510
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,840
I don't think anybody could turn this
thing around.

511
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,130
She said,
boy,

512
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,550
I met Mr. Ford.
It'll be real happy to hear that that's

513
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:22,400
all it took.
He was so angry from the pain and

514
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,250
failure of his past,
quote unquote failure that he was going

515
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:28,970
to show him that it wasn't his failure,
that Mr. Ford made the mistake.

516
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,080
Another company into mentioned IBM.
It all started because a guy by the name

517
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:37,190
of Tom Watson who worked for a competing
company called NCR,

518
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:39,140
got fired by the CEO.
They're also,

519
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,970
he got so mad.
He said,

520
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm going to develop a company that will
dwarf yours someday.

521
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,700
See,
welcome frustration.

522
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,890
I got to tell you something.
When I get frustrated,

523
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:51,500
I've learned to get excited.
I learned a literally condition myself,

524
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,750
so that frustration creates excitement.
You know why?

525
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,300
Because I'm frustrated.
I know I'm about to have a breakthrough.

526
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,900
It means my brain is searching.
If I get confused about something,

527
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,610
instead of going,
I'll never learn this.

528
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,650
My response to that is,
Hey,

529
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:07,100
I'm about to learn something because my
brain is searching for a new answer and

530
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,780
if it keeps searching and it's going to
come up with one,

531
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,710
I believe the emotions that many of us
consider negative like frustration and

532
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,000
rejection and pain can be our greatest
friends cause they can drive us to

533
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:17,960
success.
You know what?

534
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,300
I think one of the things that happened
for a lot of people when they get

535
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,660
successful is they get superstitious.
It's like it works so hard for the

536
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,150
success and I now finally have it so all
of a sudden they don't change.

537
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,430
They don't vary their behavior.
They kind of like want to stay the way

538
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:30,980
things are.
They get incredibly conservative and

539
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:34,430
they miss out on the juice of life.
Stay out of the trap.

540
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,350
Listen,
when people succeed,

541
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,480
they tend to party.
When they fail,

542
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,270
they tend to ponder and now the
pondering.

543
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:44,030
Many times we create our greatest
successes in life.

544
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,390
Just remember,
it's impossible to fail.

545
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,190
If you try something and it doesn't
work,

546
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,310
just try something else and learn
something from what you just did.

547
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:54,170
As long as you learn something you've
succeeded.

548
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,580
Something else I want to remind you of
as well and that is sometimes people

549
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,121
say,
well Gosh,

550
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm gonna do these exercises.
I know I'm going to be better physically

551
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:04,730
and emotionally and psychologically you
don't feel more confident but I want to

552
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,280
work on my career.
I want to take my business next level.

553
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,450
I want a business program.
When they tell you what personal power

554
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:13,340
is one of the most powerful business
programs because it deals with the

555
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:15,920
source of all your business,
just you.

556
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,980
When you're in better shape suddenly and
negotiate more effectively.

557
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,960
When you're in better shape,
your creativity flows.

558
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,120
When you're in better shape you're a
better manager of people.

559
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,990
That's why if you saw the infomercial,
which is how I assume you got to this

560
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,600
program,
then you saw people like for example

561
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:33,380
Bill Farley as Farley industries
endorsing this program saying is one of

562
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:35,270
the best business programs they ever
went through.

563
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,670
Well,
that's because bill became a billionaire

564
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:42,110
before the age of 40 all by using these
personal power type of techniques.

565
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,660
So I want you to know is very business
oriented or a Bill Nicholson,

566
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,000
you know,
he's a turnaround expert from major

567
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,470
corporations.
You know,

568
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:53,340
in the early eighties he took on a major
corporation that was losing $1 million a

569
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:58,110
day and turn it around so that within
four years it was doing more than $4

570
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,200
billion in revenue in the highest net
returns of the history of the company.

571
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,290
So I want you to know that bees,
people endorse it because it works if

572
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,660
you're a little bit skeptical,
I understand that.

573
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,640
But understand changing yourself as the
first place to change in your career and

574
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,000
changing your business right now.
As this tape ends,

575
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,370
I want you to do your first assignment
really simple.

576
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,000
Remember I told you the way to build a
muscle so that you're really strong,

577
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:23,580
it start small and build.
So we're going to start with something

578
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,310
really simple.
I want you to think of two actions

579
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,820
you've been putting off.
Two things that you should do.

580
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,340
Two things that you need to do,
but you keep putting it off.

581
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,090
Maybe it's a phone call or two,
maybe it's somebody a you've had some

582
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,010
poor communication with and you need to
clean it up,

583
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,650
but you're not doing it.
Maybe it's just going in the house and

584
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,700
cleaning it up right now.

585
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,340
Maybe it's some kind of report you need
to do.

586
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,030
I don't know what it is,
but right now I want you to think of

587
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,810
what are two actions you've been putting
off that if you were to take them now,

588
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,190
it would increase the quality of your
life.

589
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,310
Either simply were just increase the
quality of your self esteem because you

590
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:57,870
feel good because you actually fall
through,

591
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,310
or maybe even more powerfully.
What are two decisions or two actions

592
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,760
you could take right now that would
immediately change the quality of your

593
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:08,040
life?
Maybe it's the stop smoking.

594
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,560
Maybe it's to eliminate certain kinds of
food.

595
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,410
But if you are going to do something
right now that was going to change your

596
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,120
life,
what are those two actions?

597
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,480
And what I want you to do is decide,
remember to decide,

598
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:21,390
means to cut off and the other
possibility to resolve once and for all.

599
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,870
This is it.
There's tremendous power in that.

600
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,660
Start with something small if you want
and then build.

601
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,660
But right now,
write down two decisions you've made and

602
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:33,060
then take action on them immediately.
I mean,

603
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,490
right now,
I mean even before I finish talking

604
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,360
here,
stop the day,

605
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,550
pick up the phone and make that call
you've been waiting for.

606
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,640
Do not put it off another minute.
I don't care what it takes.

607
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,360
There's power and momentum.
I'm a big believer that once you set a

608
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,710
goal,
once you make a decision,

609
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,060
you should immediately in that moment do
something to start making progress

610
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:53,520
towards it.
That way you can't cop out later on or

611
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:56,940
get caught up or lose your momentum.
So please do it now.

612
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:58,590
And I know not all things can be done
right now.

613
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,300
So maybe it's something you have to do
tomorrow morning,

614
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,720
but whatever you're going to do,
make the decision and then commit to

615
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,670
follow through and then check in
tomorrow.

616
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,060
Cause this is the first step to grabbing
your personal power.

617
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,040
And remember,
there's no way to fail.

618
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:11,971
You might say,
well Gosh,

619
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:14,520
well if I do this and it doesn't work,
what if I tried this and it doesn't

620
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:15,600
happen?
Hey,

621
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,150
what if I screw up?
Then screw up big,

622
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,060
go for it.
Do a big screw up because then you'll

623
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,140
learn something.
Hey,

624
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:25,890
remember success in life as the result
of good judgment,

625
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,790
good judgment.
It's usually the result of experience.

626
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,150
Experience is usually the result of bad
judgment.

627
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,970
So if you've got some bad judgment,
it doesn't work out.

628
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,310
You'll learn something and I'll make you
more successful in the future.

629
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,890
Just go for it.
Don't be afraid.

630
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,190
Make it happen.
And you may say,

631
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:44,050
well,
it's such a little thing to do.

632
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,910
I'll do it later if it's a little than
do it now.

633
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,100
Don't put it off.
Okay,

634
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,900
I'm on your side.
Hey,

635
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,060
what I'm trying to be here for you is a
good coach.

636
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,220
You know,
I don't care how successful you are,

637
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,270
we all need a coach.
