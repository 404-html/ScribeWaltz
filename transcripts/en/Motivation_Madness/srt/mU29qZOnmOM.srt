1
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,190
But I think one of the reasons why these
people have this deep seated anger and

2
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:18,191
resentment is there is a bunch of people
out there that have these lives that are

3
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:23,201
deeply unsatisfying because I think
somehow or another through momentum and

4
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:27,710
just through just things falling into
place the way they are and people trying

5
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,860
to fit their lives around the way these
pieces have fallen into place,

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,390
there are so many people that are
working all day long doing something

7
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:39,770
that is deeply unsatisfying and almost
painful to them.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,330
[inaudible] soul killing,
soul killing.

9
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:45,260
You're stuck in traffic all day and then
they're stuck in a cubicle after that

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,030
they,
they,

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,770
they,
they relish the time to take a shit in

12
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:50,660
the bathroom and look at their phone.
I mean,

13
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,570
they literally do though.
That's a highlight of someone's day.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,570
They get in traffic on the way home.
They get home after that they're

15
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,760
watching television and they're fucked.

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,700
They have deep debt.
This is not like there's this soul

17
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,190
killing thing is not giving them any
free.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,410
That's huge.
And you know what?

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,980
You just sit there and go and you look
at what people make and you sit there

20
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:10,200
and go,
you can make quite a lot of money by

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,430
average Joe Standards and still not be
in good shape.

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,830
So I know people turn around and make
good living,

23
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,770
really good living and turn around go,
I'm just holding my head above water.

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,120
And so you go,
okay,

25
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:24,350
if you're holding your head just barely,
what's a person making a third or a

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,940
quarter of what you're making doing?
I mean,

27
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:28,670
this is really,
when you talk about revolutions

28
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,520
happening in [inaudible] and things
going down in weird,

29
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,960
unpredictable,
negative ways.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,610
You and we've talked about this before,
you let enough of your society fall into

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,740
the loser class for lack of a better
word,

32
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,090
winners and losers in society.

33
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,700
If you,
every society can suck up a certain

34
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:47,540
amount of people not able to to make it,
but if that number gets large enough,

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,700
revolutions happen.
I think so too,

36
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,310
but I think the revolution doesn't
necessarily have to be violent.

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,820
I think the revolution can be a
revolution of action and ideas and I

38
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,520
think that there's a ton of people out
there that are probably listening to

39
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:01,280
this that would like to be able to do
something else.

40
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,200
Whether it's make furniture,
well,

41
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:05,450
they don't want a revolution.
They want to do something that's not

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,580
solved.
If you make furniture,

43
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:11,540
you make furniture for a living and you,
you feel a great satisfaction out of

44
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,840
that and you sell that furniture.
Look man for making furniture feels

45
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,250
good.
If you can do that,

46
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,380
you could,
you could cut those corners perfectly

47
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,650
and sand everything down nice and stain
it and then it's done and you get

48
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,680
dissatisfied and you sell it to someone
and that pays your bills.

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,300
That is infinitely more satisfying than
being stuck in some fucking cubicle

50
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,130
working for someone that you don't want
to work for.

51
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,530
Having to have these stupid fucking
office meetings,

52
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,940
talking to people in human resources,
sitting down with your supervisor where

53
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:41,330
they evaluate your job performance and
you know you're not really,

54
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,731
you know,
you,

55
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,810
you really need to be enthusiastic about
this company,

56
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,570
this company is your future.
This kind of art do you like fuck,

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,010
kill me now.
You know,

58
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,860
there's a lot of people out there that
would way rather do something else.

59
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,650
And I hope they understand that they
can.

60
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,980
And that's what's funny about that cause
we were in yet because we've been

61
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,980
talking about us and podcasting a new

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
medium liver,
but,

63
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,920
but really,
and I tell,

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,880
I give,
I rarely like to give advice because you

65
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,641
know,
you don't want to,

66
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:07,360
you want to be responsible for people
acting on it and having it not turn out

67
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,190
well.
But what I tell people is two things.

68
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,660
Right now,
the United States of America,

69
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:15,661
the way it's built is built to help
industry and corporations and companies.

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,450
But that doesn't necessarily mean it has
to be Microsoft.

71
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,400
It can be you right now you can have
your own brand and the,

72
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,610
let's talk about the furniture builder.
Once upon a time.

73
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,360
There are huge things in your way,
including needing to get loans and all

74
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,980
these other things to just start a
business.

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,560
So you're behind the eight ball right
away and the pressures on,

76
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,670
because if it doesn't work,
you're in debt.

77
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,100
Whereas I mean,
we started these podcasts,

78
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,120
there's no brick or mortar.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,620
I mean now you've got just the,
the,

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
the Rogan Tower.
It's a little bit different,

81
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,570
but once upon a time it's like in the
back of your bedroom and you've got a

82
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,580
company and it's got a show and people
are listening.

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,550
If you make your furniture and you don't
have to have a brick and mortar store,

84
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,250
but you can put a website up,
uh,

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,500
make it with squarespace or one of those
other things and all of a sudden you

86
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,920
have a business out of your house.
The freedom,

87
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,800
the satisfaction,
the ability to set your own hours.

88
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,920
And here's the best part,
the fact that if you start making a lot

89
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:06,550
of money somehow you're not going to
have your boss cut your commissions.

90
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,680
When I,
new sales guys who made so much money

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,530
that their bosses cut their commissions,
cause you can't make more than your

92
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,150
bosses.
Well listen,

93
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,250
when you have your own small business,
the sky's the limit.

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,770
If you make $10 million,
you make $10 million.

95
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,520
So I always tell people that if you can,
and it's not always something they can

96
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,020
do,
maybe you do it on the side when you've

97
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,740
got your regular job.
Starting a small business now in this

98
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,890
climate that we have right now is not
only possible,

99
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,910
it's not that much of a gamble because
if worst comes to worst,

100
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,750
you didn't invest $100,000 you didn't
have starting at all the time,

101
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:39,820
right?
I mean at website didn't cost you that

102
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,654
much.
You know the,

103
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,940
the investment for the tools you may
have had already.

104
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,270
Podcasting is a perfect example.
We make business like my buddy says,

105
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,330
we sell Zeros and ones.
That's what we do.

106
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Well,
it's never been easier to have a website

107
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,130
either.
Or with companies like squarespace,

108
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,450
you can develop a website,
you could literally build amazing

109
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,580
website and sell your furniture and you
have a free online store with it and you

110
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,780
put the,
they have these drag and drop user

111
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,380
interfaces.

112
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,140
You use photos,
you drag them on their sides and in

113
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:05,974
place,
boom.

114
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,420
Next thing you know,
you've got a website,

115
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,910
so your furniture.
So whatever the fuck you make,

116
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:13,240
whether you make clothes or you're
designing backpacks or there's,

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,320
there's a lot of people out there that
have interests and they've never pursued

118
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,900
those interests because they're fucking
tired from doing some tired warring soul

119
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,550
suck.
It's hard to go to work and put your

120
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,010
effort into that and then come home and
then work for yourself.

121
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,420
It's very hard.
But I'll tell you what,

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,680
there's,
there's a part,

123
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,380
like you said,
there's a part of it that once you start

124
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,440
making stuff for yourself,
that self motivating,

125
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,670
right?
Like I told somebody to start a podcast

126
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,370
and I said,
the first time you get some feedback

127
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,270
email that will kick you in the rear end
to keep doing the pipe.

128
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,570
It becomes,
it becomes,

129
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:44,200
um,
you know,

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,000
life is a verb,
I always say,

131
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:50,500
and you have to actually act,
but by acting you change everything in

132
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,730
your future.
Um,

133
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,050
another guy said to me,
it's a great line.

134
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,210
He said with podcasts,
it's not always how many people are

135
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:57,100
listening.
Sometimes it's who they are,

136
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,160
right?
So

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,830
my grandmother's philosophy was always
that you should keep walking and

138
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,090
talking.
But in her era,

139
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,460
walking and talking Mitt going and
shaking people's hands.

140
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:08,540
And now you can network like through the
Internet and you never really shaking

141
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,770
people's hands.
But you may have a podcast with only a

142
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,560
hundred listeners,
but if one of those listeners,

143
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,780
just some guy somewhere else who says,
oh my God,

144
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,150
this guy's furniture is great,
or whatever I'm to,

145
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm gonna,
maybe you can come and start giving a

146
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,570
pottery barn.
You know what I mean?

147
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:24,260
Things open up in ways that you can't
predict because you started doing

148
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,820
something and because you have
legitimate passion for what you can and

149
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,110
that resonates us feel experienced that.
Yeah.

150
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,070
Yeah.
If they see,

151
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,260
I mean,
I can't tell you how many artists that

152
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:37,100
have discovered online just through
instagram or through twitter,

153
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,260
like this isn't sent me to creative
revolution.

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,121
Yes.
In a,

155
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,110
in an amazing way.
And I hope,

156
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,680
and I think there's way more creative
people out there than we realize.

157
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,640
Oh yes,
absolutely.

158
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,550
And I think they would love to have some
sort of an opportunity to do something

159
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,840
like that.
And especially like an artist,

160
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,250
somebody who is an artist,
man,

161
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,880
there's never been a better time to be
an artist because you could showcase

162
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,750
your work and look if you send me
something cool and you know,

163
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,900
he sent it to me on twitter and I'll
probably retweet.

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,380
Do we treat things all the time?
And all that takes is someone else has

165
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,220
to see that and say,
wow,

166
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,590
that's amazing.
And then took it to do to do it just

167
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,980
propagates to all these different
people's instagram feeds and all these

168
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:16,070
people twitter feeds and next thing you
know you've got a business and you're up

169
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:18,680
and running and it's not going to be
easy and it's not going to be quick.

170
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,980
But the job you're doing now,
eight easier.

171
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,580
Cricket,
the soul killing one eight easier

172
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,430
quickie that people think like,
oh how long is it going to take?

173
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,440
Oh,
but you know when you start out doing a

174
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,390
podcast,
when we got turned downloads,

175
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,930
well that's how it works.
We all were there while I was there.

176
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,520
Once too,
when we first did it,

177
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,060
when we,
we,

178
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,490
when Brian and I were first doing this
podcast and we were doing it on like

179
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,700
Ustream,
we would have 200 viewers and I wasn't

180
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,310
doing it for money.
I was at,

181
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,420
I was literally doing it because my,
my wife had gotten pregnant.

182
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:54,890
We had to move from Colorado back to La
and I was bummed out and I was like,

183
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,420
fuck,
I thought I escaped.

184
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,690
I thought I got out of La,
I was living in the mountains.

185
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,680
I was like,
this is what I want.

186
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,180
I want to be in nature.
I was like,

187
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,980
I don't want to be back in this fucking
hell hole.

188
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,851
I'm like,
all right,

189
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,670
let's do something.
And so we started doing podcasts just

190
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:11,180
for a goof cause I was doing stand up.
That was all well and good and how it

191
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:14,690
tied into your standup so well.
But it started,

192
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:18,470
my point is it didn't start out.
I didn't start out thinking this is

193
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:21,080
going to replace my income.
This is going to be,

194
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,110
I just did it as a passion project and I
think if people have a regular day job,

195
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,690
if you could just find some one thing
that you do as a passion project and

196
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:33,470
just keep building on it,
just keep at Tepe watering it.

197
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,080
Keep adding fertilizer,
keep giving it attention,

198
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,970
keep giving it focus and you can escape.
You can escape and you can be self

199
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,150
serving.
You could be okay.

200
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,280
You're going to be okay.
I always ask people when they want to

201
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,290
start it like a podcast.
I'll say something like,

202
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,070
how many listeners would you have to
have for you to care what's,

203
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,650
and that's a magic number that's
different for everybody,

204
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:52,484
right?
But,

205
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,260
but what,
what's great about what we do that's

206
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,940
different from broadcasting

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,710
is that there is a giant pie of people.
Let's pretend it's a billion,

208
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,170
and if you're going to do a podcast on
science fiction comic books from the

209
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,840
1950 [inaudible] or something that has
such a narrow audience,

210
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,430
they'd never put it on television
because it's,

211
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,500
it's too narrow.
You will be able,

212
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:17,280
if you even get 0.001% of that billion
pie,

213
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,030
it's not only going to be a decent
number of people in terms of what you

214
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,960
would think is successful,
but they're going to be so enthusiastic

215
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,790
because this is an outlet that they
don't have.

216
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,100
It's like I always tell somebody,
if you're into Harry Potter,

217
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,050
one of the TV networks given you,
but there's multiple hair,

218
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,430
potter

219
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,820
podcasts,
listen to that.

220
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:36,900
You want to hear something crazy.
Time magazine just had some top 50

221
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:40,320
podcast thing and a buddy of mine who
was angry that he wasn't on,

222
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,200
sent me some stuff about it and uh,
one of the things he said,

223
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,000
dude,
there's a fucking podcasts on there

224
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,410
called the Gilmore boys.
That's guys two guys sitting around

225
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,380
talking about the Gilmore Girls
Television show.

226
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,400
There's another one called something
about Richard Simmons where there is

227
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,440
finding Richard [inaudible],
Richard Simmons,

228
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,770
where they're trying to figure out why
Richard Simmons went into hiding.

229
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,810
What's so great about that idea though
and again,

230
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,380
and you at home can learn this too.
What's so great about that idea is that

231
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:12,381
they instantly tied their podcast to
somebody who already had tons of fans,

232
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,370
right?
So you sit there and go,

233
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,720
I don't know who these guys are with
this,

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,280
but I'm a huge Richard Simmons Fan.

235
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,560
So I'll listen.
And that's like instant audience.

236
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,210
And there's another podcast called guys,
we fucked these girls cramp came up with

237
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,100
this podcast.
And this is one that I was using as

238
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,220
example because these who were the girls
from God's,

239
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,450
we fucked.
You see it,

240
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,740
find the names.
Um,

241
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,760
these,
uh,

242
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,830
comedians from New York,
they came and they actually going to be

243
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,890
on the podcast Monday.
Oh,

244
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,520
that was a clever tie in.
I didn't mean to,

245
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,850
but I used them as an example because,
cause we just did booked this earlier

246
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,560
today.
Christina Hutchinson and Corrine,

247
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,580
she's me Crenn Fisher.
And they came up with this clever idea

248
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:54,900
for the title and it became huge.
I mean it's always top 10.

249
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,790
It's like one of the top 10 comedy
podcasts.

250
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,780
And people say,
Oh,

251
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:58,800
well too,
it's a traded.

252
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,730
No,
it's not stupid.

253
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,110
You just,
just to do something.

254
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:01,470
That's good.

255
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,210
Stop saying it's saturated.
If you're good,

256
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,300
it'll stand out.
This idea that Liverpool juicy for you

257
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:08,910
to,
everybody's got these stupid barriers

258
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:11,550
they put in their own head.
You've got to resist those goddamn

259
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,030
things cause they don't do you any good.
And they certainly defined the potential

260
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,960
for your future in a negative way that's
not self serving and it's not even real.

261
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,591
You know,
you've,

262
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:19,981
you've,
you've,

263
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:24,060
you've put this artificial ceiling on
the potential for what you're doing.

264
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
If you hit a wall,
okay,

265
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,140
that just means you need to regroup and
rethink.

266
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,990
It doesn't mean that wall's there.
Especially when it comes to something

267
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,360
like social media or like a,
a podcast,

268
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,910
something where you're just,
you're putting out a piece of art,

269
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,630
you're putting out something that you've
created this no wall as far as like how

270
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,910
many people are gonna enjoy it or how
far it's going to go.

271
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,860
It's just,
it is what it is.

272
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,140
And if people don't like it,
make it better.

273
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,010
If they like it less fixed that,
figure out a way to do it,

274
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,410
you can do that.
And this,

275
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,420
this idea that there's no to get past
the starting block today is just

276
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:58,570
ludicrous.
It's crazy and it's just this,

277
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,760
this poor thinking and people that are
trapped in bad situations.

278
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,540
One of the problems is you feel like
this is your future.

279
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,580
You feel like you're fucked and you
can't get out of that.

280
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,530
There's no hope.
There's no light at the end of the

281
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,760
tunnel.
There's no rainbow,

282
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,530
and if you feel like that,
that alone can be incredibly defining

283
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,540
and limiting.
But if you can look at,

284
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,700
if you look at yourself objectively and
say,

285
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,590
okay,
I Connie am fucked here.

286
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,530
I'm in credit card debt.
I'm working in a shitty job.

287
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,580
I don't like what I'm doing,
but I have some ideas.

288
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,980
I need to feed those fucking ideas and
have fee.

289
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,150
I need to feed them and water them and I
need to set aside a certain amount of

290
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,450
time every day to just try to make those
things happen.

291
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,040
You can do that.
I have a v

292
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,360
I like visual images.
You use that in the hardcore history a

293
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:45,780
lot.
These young,

294
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,080
what's it like to find an elephant with
a spear and things like that?

295
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,940
I liked it,
but the image to die,

296
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,010
that's what the image I have though for
what you're talking about.

297
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,550
I've always thought it's a little like
I'm a running back in football who takes

298
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:59,370
the ball and who goes forward and
there's no hole,

299
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,930
right?
All you run into is the back of your

300
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:03,060
offensive linemen.
But if you keep hitting,

301
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,400
if a hole is going to open up,
boom,

302
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,300
you'll squirt through.
Now,

303
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,370
there's no guarantee in life.
The whole will be there.

304
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,430
But there is a guarantee that if you're
not continually smacking at it,

305
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,100
then when it opens up,
you won't be ready.

306
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,880
Right.
Right.

307
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,360
And so I don't know about you,
Joe.

308
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,590
You've had a charmed life,
I think,

309
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,030
and how well you've done,
but I mean,

310
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,440
some of us have failed many times.

311
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,400
I failed at a bunch of shit.
But I guess what I'm saying is I

312
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,710
remember being a TV reporter at a small
station,

313
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,301
uh,
and,

314
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,370
and I would get out of work at like
midnight and the Sh and the story that I

315
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:31,740
just spent all day on aired and it was
awful.

316
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,170
And I would get out and I would
literally,

317
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,850
this is when I still had quite a bit of
hair.

318
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:38,220
I would sit there and like you like pull
your hair out and you go,

319
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:39,470
what am I doing?
Right,

320
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,710
right.
This is horrible.

321
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,200
And I look back on those now and I
think,

322
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,080
you know,
what if you had just given up then,

323
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,900
right,
or the podcast,

324
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,980
I mean,
do you know how my wife did a great

325
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:50,814
thing for me?
Uh,

326
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,620
we,
we'd had that company that I just told

327
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:54,750
you about what we were trying to do,
the new media thing and it just fell

328
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,260
apart and like everybody's companies
were starting to do and I wasted a lot

329
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,060
of time and a lot of money in my life
doing that.

330
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,520
And she would have been totally
justified in saying,

331
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,650
that's it.
You know you're going to Indianapolis,

332
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:06,630
get a talk radio show job wherever there
are higher.

333
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,110
But she did and she said,
you know what,

334
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,850
each tried to try this next thing you
can do it and here we are.

335
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,040
And I think you know,
if you hadn't tried,

336
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,340
it's that weird thing of,
and folks I tried being a TV report on

337
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,560
try B,
you try all those things and either

338
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,870
they're not successful or they're
moderately successful or they're

339
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:25,650
successful but not enough for you.
You got life is a verb.

340
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,430
You have to,
you know the thing that people that

341
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,890
makes people the most sad in life.
And I already have a couple of friends

342
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,680
my own age who are there is the regrets,
right?

343
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:35,514
They don't,
they don't,

344
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,290
they're not sorry.
They failed.

345
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,540
They're sorry they didn't try.
And the funny thing is there,

346
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,090
some of them are only 50 and they think,
okay,

347
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,400
my my,
my window to try is already gone.

348
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,470
And which is wrong too.
But folks,

349
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,180
you will be so happy.
There's so many things that have

350
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,000
happened in my life because I,
I mean I got my first talk radio show

351
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,770
job.
I was,

352
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:51,980
I was

353
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,480
a reporter.
I covered this story.

354
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,910
There was some big guy showing up at the
local radio station.

355
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,940
As I was leaving,
I wrote a letter to the program director

356
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,680
just say thanks for having us to,
and I thought,

357
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,570
do I may have this,
do I not mail it?

358
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,540
Do I mainly do it and just,
you know,

359
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,700
I closed my eyes and a male.
He called me two days later.

360
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:09,680
So you want a job?
What if you didn't send that letter?

361
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,110
It's a stupid,
the little things that your life can

362
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,670
hinge on but if you don't do them,
you don't give fate and opportunity to

363
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,250
intervene.
I think here's an important thing to

364
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,020
failure is important.
It is important.

365
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,320
I think failure teaches you things that
you don't learn from success.

366
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,190
I think failure gives you an opportunity
for self examination and also gives you

367
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:32,570
a feeling that is very uncomfortable and
that very uncomfortable feeling helps

368
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:35,570
you grow that when you feel like shit
and you screw something up.

369
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,480
Like when I've had bad podcasts,
my podcast is always gotten better

370
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,310
afterwards.
When I have that bad stand up sets,

371
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,670
I've always gotten better after that
because those bad sets motivate you.

372
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,680
They get,
they give you a perspective like,

373
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,260
Hey,
here's some clear examples of where you

374
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,730
fucked up.
Know what not to do.

375
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:53,060
Yeah,
don't and don't look at these failures

376
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:57,170
as like proof that you suck.
Look at them as opportunities for

377
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,360
growth.
Look at them as opportunities to be

378
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,330
motivated to do better.
And Winston Churchill had a line about

379
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:07,331
reading quotes about how inspirational
reading famous quotes were and he says

380
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,710
they motivate you for a number of
different ways,

381
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,980
including the idea that you know,
you think it's just you or you think

382
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:16,520
that these people who did so well,
we're so incredibly gifted or privileged

383
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,470
from the get go.
And when you realize none of them,

384
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,350
they're more like me than I think that
becomes inspirational,

385
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:21,800
right?

386
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
You telling your audience,
this is inspirational.

387
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,170
You don't want to hear,
go back to school,

388
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,880
go to this word note,
but if you hate your job,

389
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:32,690
that is like nature telling you to try
something different and it's motivating

390
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,840
because the motivation is you might not
have to do that soul killing job

391
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:36,381
anymore.
Well,

392
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:38,300
if you look at someone who's doing
really well,

393
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,900
I'd say if you focus on like Kevin Hart
or something like that is some very

394
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:46,901
famous and successful comedian.
All you see is him now flying around on

395
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:50,300
private jets wearing a new pair of
sneakers every day driving around in

396
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,130
bentleys.
You just see that.

397
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,910
You don't see him being a young kid in
Philadelphia,

398
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:59,480
going to open mic nights,
scratching and clawing Mc Hammer selling

399
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,100
the the tapes out of the hatchback.
Yeah,

400
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,180
all that stuff,
man.

401
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,050
There's a path and we,
we think of people like you see an old

402
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,520
person walking down the street,
you go,

403
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,020
oh,
that person's always been an old person.

404
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,320
Now that was a baby.
That was a baby that became a 90 year

405
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,190
old man.
There's a,

406
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:15,920
there's a progression that you are not
witnessed too.

407
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,900
You don't see it and that,
that,

408
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,260
that takes place in everything.
It takes place in author as it takes

409
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,860
place in comedians and musicians,
there is a starting point.

410
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,980
And then with time and focus and as long
as you reevaluate and reassess and

411
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:34,130
constantly objectively look at what
you're doing and then pursue it with

412
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,620
passion and focus,
you get better at things.

413
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,920
And you know what,
doing all those things ends up q,

414
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,441
you know,
it's funny,

415
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,820
but your life experiences create who you
are and all those things actually make

416
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,900
you a more,
for me,

417
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,820
I know I'm speaking to the choir here,
but,

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,950
but all those things make you a more
formidable person

419
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,010
so that eventually that next endeavor
is,

420
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:56,280
is you're more prepared for and you're
more formidable and,

421
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,211
and so,
you know,

422
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,110
you turn around and say,
what was I like as a 23 year old intern

423
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,380
compared to what I'm like now?
And I'm basically a different person.
