1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,090
Some decisions or major decisions and
also there are a lot of small decisions

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,850
that we don't make that they tax our
minds.

3
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:14,410
They drain our energy.
They create a lot of anxiety and

4
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:19,411
nervousness and mental torment because
we don't take care of it.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,390
We decide not to decide which is the
decision.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,420
Deciding to decide to act
is a major,

7
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:35,740
major challenge for all of us at
different points in different areas of

8
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:40,741
our lives and there are things that
happened to us along the way.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,350
Experiences that we have that prevent us
from working through the mental block of

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,640
acting,
of doing those things that we know we

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,670
ought to do.
And so what I want you to think about is

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,510
what is there that you know you need to
do that you want to do this,

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,230
but for some reason or another,
you've been holding back for some reason

14
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,960
or another.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,430
You just have not been able to gather
your nerves or be able to work through

16
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:17,140
all the procrastinating or putting it
off or justifying or blaming some reason

17
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,210
or another.
You just haven't done it

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,260
and you know you ought to do this.
You really want to do this,

19
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:24,970
but you don't know why you haven't done
it.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,980
Anybody know what I'm talking about?
Raise your hand.

21
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,620
Believes okay,
then I've got company here this evening.

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,650
I'm not talking to myself now.
First,

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,680
all we know that this is not easy
because in order to begin to reinvent

24
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,930
your life,
you've got to make a conscious,

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
deliberate,
determined effort.

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,373
Sure.

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,990
That you really have got to put all of
yourself into it.

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,740
It's very challenging to add to do those
things that at times when you're looking

29
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,124
at him,
you say,

30
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,880
I know I need to do this,
but I don't feel like it.

31
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,380
I don't want to do it.
I know I need to do it yet.

32
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,910
Leave me alone.
No,

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,630
I don't want to do it.
So what do we do?

34
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,360
What are those things that cause us to
do like that?

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,950
I think that among the things that
prevent us from acting,

36
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:20,780
it's the fear of failure and if you've
already failed,

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,060
you don't want to fail again.
The pain of that,

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,380
the disappointment,
the fear of loss is another thing

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,210
because many times when we do those
things that we know we need to do,

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
we feel that we might lose somebody that
we love very much and care about.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,950
We don't want to hurt anybody.
Many of us don't act because we want

42
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:46,970
other people's approval.
We want everybody to like us and to

43
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,760
accept us.
And that's not possible.

44
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,010
Many of us don't do the things that we
want to do and don't act because of lack

45
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:58,400
of self confidence.
We don't believe enough in ourselves.

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,830
I have friend who's been working on a
job where she's miserable,

47
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,960
talented,
want to go to another place that she can

48
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,560
do what she wants to do and make the
kind of money that she would like to

49
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,561
make and have had some offers.
But because of her fear and how the lack

50
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,650
of self confidence,
uh,

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,730
things might not work out,
she won't take a chance on yourself.

52
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,870
So there she is spending eight hours a
day,

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,300
five days a week,
and she's miserable.

54
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:33,400
She hates to go to work.
They're not paying on what she's

55
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,980
watching knows it,
but yet instill,

56
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,210
she won't do that,
which she knows she much to do and it's

57
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:45,211
wearing out that a lot of people that
their jobs are making them sick because

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,930
they want to act.
You check out the absenteeism and the

59
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,700
people that are depressed.
You see,

60
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm coming to work angry.
How you doing?

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,703
No,

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,950
just leave me alone.
It's not even 9:00 yet.

63
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:04,951
You're talking about good morning.
That days you got to work.

64
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,180
You want to just keep driving past a
job.

65
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:14,181
You know you don't want to stop because
it's not in sync with who you are,

66
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,760
but you haven't acted.
Have another friend.

67
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,240
He's got brilliant.
He's a business consultant.

68
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,020
He helped a lot of people get their
business started and people come to him

69
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:29,190
because they know he's knowledgeable,
but this guy wants to start his own

70
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:32,100
business now.
He's very smart.

71
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,410
He can do it.
Everybody believes in it except him and

72
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,780
he's so smart.
He's talked himself out of the well,

73
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,190
the numbers aren't right,

74
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,590
so there are many reasons why we don't
act.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,270
There are other things though that
affect us is that not wanting to take

76
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:55,320
personal responsibility.
We want somebody else to do it,

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,940
and we,
many times we pick up our inability to

78
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,790
do certain things from people that we
love,

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,540
people that we admire,
we identify with them and we live in the

80
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:14,451
context of their ideas,
their opinions and their life patterns.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,770
We buy into it unconsciously.
My mother is a pack rat.

82
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,340
She keeps everything.
She doesn't throw anything away and I

83
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:30,570
have unconsciously picked that up.
Now my mother never said,

84
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:33,810
let me show you how to keep everything
less than just clutter things.

85
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,290
I unconsciously picked that up many
times.

86
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,190
Unconsciously.
We tried to honor the people we love by

87
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,610
being like them.
By the same token,

88
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:49,350
I realized something about myself when I
had some major decisions to make and I

89
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:53,550
find myself acting like my mother.
My mother mother's the kind of person

90
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:58,340
that when she has a problem with one of
the other foster that she adopted,

91
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,000
she won't confront them.
She will call me last.

92
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,230
Why don't you tell lender to move?
She's lazy.

93
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,900
She won't go to work.
She runs the street all day and then she

94
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,040
comes home and wants to sleep all day
and I think she's doing droughts.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,690
I said,
but Mama,

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,770
why don't you tell Linda that I bought
the house for you.

97
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,970
I told you when she wanted to come home,
don't let a grown person come there and

98
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,150
take care of them.
You let her in will after all she is my

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,270
Mama.
Then you handle that.

100
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,520
When I tell her to leave,
she say,

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,340
mama say I can say Mama,
can I say and you tell her yes,

102
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:39,680
and then you call me and say she's still
here.

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Why worry me with this?
So Mama hasn't developed the courage to

104
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,790
act on that.
Some people won't act until there's a

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,750
crisis situation.
When Linda stopped stealing from Mama

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,010
and took us social security check to get
some drugs,

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,530
mama got some cars to say get outta here

108
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,820
would ever come back,
but she wouldn't do it until then and

109
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:14,680
say,
we don't have to wait until a crisis

110
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,830
situation.
I have a friend that had been having a

111
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:20,710
challenge with losing weight.
Both of us had been dealing with that

112
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:25,711
challenge and for the past 40 years is
always seemed like weighed over 235

113
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,110
pounds and so he said,
man,

114
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:31,300
I just can't lose weight.
I'm big boned it.

115
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,380
I say,
I've never seen any fat skeleton.

116
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,600
No,
you need to act on your health.

117
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,610
You can change this.
Well,

118
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,990
you don't have to go to your grave fat.
We're all digging early grades without

119
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,870
teeth.
We don't have to do this.

120
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,110
They need to have a support group around
m and m peanuts.

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,250
You want a support group on something
and throw snickers in there too.

122
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,820
I can tell you about the help we need
with that.

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,410
So what happened with bud though,
he became ill a few weeks ago,

124
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,040
so he bought in the last few weeks,
has lost more weight than is ever lost.

125
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,870
Even when we were competing with each
other,

126
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,490
betting a lot of money.
But what happened was bob became

127
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,700
diabetic.
He went into an insulin shock.

128
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,500
He didn't know that he was diabetic,
his blood sugar became high and the

129
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,840
doctor said to him,
you are diabetic.

130
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,710
You're going to have to have insulin
shots every day.

131
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,400
You're gonna have to change your diet
and let me tell you what's going to

132
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,580
happen if you don't do what we tell you
to do.

133
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,220
Number one,
there's a possibility that you can

134
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,400
become an amputee.
Number two,

135
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,770
you can go blind.
Three,

136
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:52,290
you can become impotent bugs.
They help me

137
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,890
when?
When,

138
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,700
when,
when bro got to jail and guys say,

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,920
can I do to be saved?
You want one my peanut butter and jelly

140
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,060
sandwiches?
No,

141
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,030
I said,
but I can't believe you're eating

142
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,180
vegetables.
You're exercising,

143
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,560
jogging in place.
Now,

144
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,310
he had the ability to do,

145
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,670
do it before,
but there are some people.

146
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,330
It takes that kind of crises to bring
them into reality in order for them to

147
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:38,040
act in their own best interests.
Some people have to hit rock bottom in

148
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,030
order to ride.
I don't know why you want to begin to

149
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,480
look out on your life and what you want
for you,

150
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,410
and I think that when we began to focus
in the area of what does it take for us

151
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,170
to act,
I think we can say events can inspire us

152
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:02,601
to act at that particular event in his
life circumstances.

153
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,460
Friend of mine,
he wanted to do something and he just

154
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:11,820
did not have the motivation and the
drive and the confidence within himself,

155
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,970
but as circumstances change overnight
through an acquisition of a company that

156
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,490
he worked for,
he lost his job.

157
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,440
Through the inspiration of desperation,
he had to act

158
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,700
the life also of things that can inspire
us,

159
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,860
that see,
we don't have the courage,

160
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,240
and that's what it takes.
Courage.

161
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,990
It takes guts to do that.
What you know you need to do.

162
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,670
If you don't have the courage to act
live,

163
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,690
many times we'll move on you and make
you at live will whoop your butt so bad.

164
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,900
You will be so miserable.
You will get so much how you say,

165
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,900
yes,
I will do it.

166
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,180
What do you want me to do?
Take me

167
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,940
friend of mine say,
I can't stop smoking.

168
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,730
I can't stop smoking.
Dr Said Sam Axelrod,

169
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:12,540
you have emphysema.
Sam never picked up another cigarette

170
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,820
and said,
look of stupid people smoking.

171
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,190
Sam,
you did it for 35 years.

172
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,450
How can you talk about people?
While I was different,

173
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm trying to help them.

174
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,380
They don't

175
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,900
do the same thing I did,
but be compassionate now.

176
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,550
Isn't an interesting how quickly we
forget,

177
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,430
so I'm saying that look at something in
your life.

178
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,450
It might be just writing a letter to
somebody to say thank you.

179
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,270
It might be just to apologize to
somebody.

180
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,840
I had a confrontation and the penobscot
building with the security guard there.

181
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,910
He responded to me what I perceived as a
negative way and he and I engaged in an

182
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,710
argument.
I did not like the way I handled that.

183
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,700
I avoided going through the front door
for a long time because I didn't want to

184
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:01,450
face it.
Finally I decided to act and I went up

185
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:05,140
to him and said,
I want to apologize to you for the way

186
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,810
in which I handled this argument we had.
The other day.

187
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,020
I was wrong.
I hope you accept my apology.

188
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,423
He said I do.

189
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,800
And I said,
thank you very much.

190
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,860
I felt relieved.
Now when you decide to act,

191
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:21,520
it's not always going to be like that.
A friend of mine did some work for me.

192
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,090
It was below par to say the least.
I knew that this guy was capable of

193
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:32,581
doing better work.
I knew that he also had a fragile ego,

194
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,210
so I was trying to think of what is the
most sensitive way in which I can share

195
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,130
this information with him because I
wanted him to do my work over.

196
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,980
I was going to pay him for what he did,
but I needed my work done right.

197
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,390
But I was afraid that I would hurt his
feelings.

198
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,980
So I was very,
very meticulous and how I approached him

199
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,630
and I said,
let me share this with you.

200
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:55,930
You know,
I care about you and that you are very

201
00:12:55,931 --> 00:13:00,931
talented and gifted person and you and I
both know that what you have given me is

202
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,900
not a true reflection of your talents
and abilities.

203
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,690
And I'm saying,
let's go back in the studio and do this

204
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,670
again.
And he said to me,

205
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,580
I'm going to forget you ever said that.

206
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,790
I was wiped out.
He never spoke to me again.

207
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,140
Now when you decide to act,
you're going to have some people like

208
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,990
that.
We're no longer friends.

209
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,450
I lost sleep over that.
Ladies and gentlemen,

210
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,030
I said,
I can't believe that.

211
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,880
I remember setting up one night looking
at the phone.

212
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,350
I said,
I got call him.

213
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,000
Said,
no,

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,610
that's it.
No,

215
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,100
forget that.
I see men looking.

216
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,700
We've been knowing each other too long
to allow this to come between us.

217
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,440
He said,
don't call me anymore.

218
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:55,340
And Hung Up.
And then I wanted to think about how,

219
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,490
what can I do to make it up to him?
And then something came to me less.

220
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,430
What do you have to prove?
So many things.

221
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:06,170
We don't do it because in fact,
we want people to like us.

222
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,540
That's unnecessary losses in life.
When you decide acting in your best

223
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,430
interest,
you're going to lose some friends.

224
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
Everybody's not going to approve of you.
There are some people that work like

225
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,320
you.
Who Do you think you are?

226
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,690
You are arrogant.
What do you think you can do?

227
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,620
You think you'd get away with that?
You're selfish.

228
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,240
Thanks,
I got that.

229
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,460
It's my life,
and so what I'm saying to you is that as

230
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:37,190
you begin to look out on your life,
this is challenging.

231
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,060
This is not easy acting,
so one of the things that we can begin

232
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:43,820
to do to harness our will,
number one,

233
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,700
you've got to bring it out and look at
it.

234
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,580
You got to take the power out of it.
You've got to it to the truth,

235
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,150
and the truth is that it has no power
over you,

236
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,030
so write down something you want to act
on,

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,240
but for some reason that you've been
holding back and look at it.

238
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,650
The next thing is ask yourself the
question,

239
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,230
is it helping you to continue to put it
off?

240
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,070
If it's an asset for you to continue to
procrastinate,

241
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,760
then continue to do that,
but if it's a liability for you,

242
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,840
if it's causing you some mental and some
emotional challenges or perhaps a

243
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,940
financial problem,
look at that.

244
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,140
Examine that for what it is.
Next step.

245
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Ask Yourself,
what's blocking you?

246
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,490
What's preventing you from acting?
Why don't you have the courage to handle

247
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,640
that?
Why won't you face that?

248
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,710
What are you running away from?
What kind of avoidance behavior are you

249
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,760
engaged in?

250
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,580
Next is what is the worst thing that can
happen when you take action?

251
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,600
So I looked at that and I said,
what's the worst thing can happen when I

252
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,070
tell him this?
He can say,

253
00:15:56,071 --> 00:16:01,071
I don't like you any did.
Now what happened?

254
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,510
I experienced that.
I looked at that,

255
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,950
I saw that.
And guess what?

256
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,260
Ladies and gentlemen,
I didn't dye

257
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,890
my feelings were hurt a little bit.
I lost some sleep about it and sometimes

258
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,200
I think about it when I drive past his
house,

259
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,250
but I'm still here.
It's uncomfortable,

260
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,790
but it's okay.
It doesn't bother me anymore.

261
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,960
I've gotten used to it now.
So what is the worst thing that can

262
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,810
happen?
I want you to visualize that experience,

263
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:33,630
that feel,
the nervousness and the discomfort and

264
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:36,900
the more you run into in your mind the
less power that it will have.

265
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,280
Next is how will you feel after taking
this action?

266
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,710
I felt a sense of personal achievement

267
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,060
when I faced somebody that has been my
mentor for years and for years that was

268
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:59,520
something I wanted to tell him and I
didn't have the courage to tell him

269
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,320
because it was always I was a student.
He wants to teach her.

270
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,980
It was always.
I looked up to him and admired him and

271
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:12,981
held him in high esteem and I was always
grateful and thankful for the impact

272
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,740
that he had on my life.
And I loved him so much.

273
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,280
I didn't have the courage to say to him,
please stop drinking so much you an

274
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,260
alcoholic,
you need help.

275
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,330
I didn't have the courage because I was
afraid that he might not like me.

276
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,110
I was afraid that he might be hurt and
crushed,

277
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,460
that we would no longer be friends.
I didn't want to jeopardize what we had.

278
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,520
I loved him a great deal and I didn't.
I didn't know how this would affect our

279
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:48,521
relationship and I didn't even want him
to know that I knew that he was an

280
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:53,561
alcoholic and so I was a cow,
spineless and the name of law.

281
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,110
I did it to justify to myself to stop
from helping somebody that I loved from

282
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,150
dying.
I said,

283
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,950
I love him so much.
I just can't tell him this.

284
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,830
I don't even know how he would handle
it.

285
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,950
To know that I know that he's an
alcoholic,

286
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,580
and finally after years I developed the
courage to face my teacher,

287
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,230
my mentor who has molded me,
who looks at me now and wanted to do

288
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:27,450
what I'm doing now and did not do.
It.

289
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:32,451
Came at a different time and it wasn't
time for what he brought and he's living

290
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,410
through me and I had to face this man
who's been like a father to me.

291
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,270
It's,
I got to tell you something.

292
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,920
You've got a problem.
I love you very much.

293
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,520
Please stop drinking.
You're killing yourself.

294
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,390
It's not just social.
You do it every day.

295
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,800
You need help and whatever.
I can do to support you in that.

296
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,801
I will please stop,
and he looked at me and I had no idea

297
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,810
what,
how he was going to handle that at first

298
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,880
that was like,
I dare you,

299
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,310
and we just looked at each other
and then I reached out to embrace him

300
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,000
and we never ever embrace man.
Macho never hugged me.

301
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,690
I hugged him and he just stood there
with his arms straight.

302
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,960
He couldn't raise his arms to hug me
back and he was shocked and after he got

303
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:35,190
over the initial shock when you could
bring him stuff to speak,

304
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,780
to maintain his composure because he
could never afford to let me,

305
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,920
his students see him vulnerable or admit
that I was right.

306
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,930
He said,
I'll be seeing you.

307
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,623
I said,
yes sir.

308
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,720
I said,
tell you why.

309
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,180
Be by the house to see the car before I
leave.

310
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,780
And when he walked away,
at first I was very depressed about it

311
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:00,661
and I said,
well,

312
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,550
maybe it wasn't my place to do this and
that.

313
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,680
You know,
when you act,

314
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,940
you're going to have some second
thoughts.

315
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,080
And then I said,
no,

316
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,973
no,
no.

317
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,200
I did what I felt I did it because I
feel very strongly about this

318
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,910
and fortunately he called me back a few
weeks later and left word with the

319
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:25,770
answering service les,
Les Brown.

320
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,560
I just want to say thank you

321
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,083
and hung up.

322
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,550
I was a good feeling.
When we look out on our lives,

323
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,030
you asked the question,
what are you going to do?

324
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,950
Look at as you think about this that you
know need to handle,

325
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,050
what are you going to do?
And then write down three strong reasons

326
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,620
on why you know you must take action
and being explicit and descriptive in

327
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:03,150
your reasons because your reasons have
power.

328
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,860
Your reasons will drive you when you
have doubt,

329
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,090
when your faith becomes weak,
your reasons will fortify your faith.

330
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,420
When you have an inner conversation,
say no,

331
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,960
don't do that.
Your reasons will become your rod and

332
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:22,140
your staff to convert you,
to take you through those challenging

333
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:22,974
moments,

334
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,090
so write down your reasons and what you
will find,

335
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,370
but when you decide to act,
when you decided to take life on,

336
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,210
and let me warn you,
it can be painful.

337
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,440
It will be uncomfortable and that's
where the growth is.

338
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,860
When you're uncomfortable,
when you're stretching up,

339
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,230
when you're taking a life bother collar,
you're going to get thrown to the ground

340
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:54,970
again and again and again,
but when you had the termination and you

341
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:58,360
know that what you're doing is right,
it gives you your life.

342
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,730
It gives us special meeting and power to
you.

343
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,810
You will have some power from on high.
You will discover some things about

344
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:07,330
yourself.
Then we'll begin to electrify your

345
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:10,240
personality.
You'll begin to discover some things

346
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,400
about you,
but you don't know you've got.

347
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,350
When you put yourself in that type of
challenging situation,

348
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,980
repeat after me please.
I can go into action

349
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,600
on anything in my life.
Nothing is stopping me but me.

350
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,650
No challenge in my life
has any power over me.

351
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,280
Here's something that Howard Thurman
wrote on the decision to act.

352
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,150
He said it's a wondrous thing,
that a decision to act releases energy

353
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:52,190
and the personality for days on end,
a person may drift along without much

354
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:55,400
energy,
having no particular sense of direction

355
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,820
and having no will to change.
Then something happens to alter the

356
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,970
pattern.
It may be something very simple and

357
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:08,420
inconsequential in itself,
but it stabs awake.

358
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,190
It alarms,
it disturbs in a flash.

359
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:17,330
One gets a vivid picture of one self and
it passes.

360
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,650
The result is decision,
Sharp,

361
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,270
definitive decision and the wake of the
decision,

362
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,690
yes.
Even as a part of the decision itself,

363
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,960
energy is released.
The act of decision sweeps all before it

364
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,580
and the life of the individual maybe
changed.

365
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,180
When did you decide to make decisions to
act?

366
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,670
You began to access power within you
that will increase your self esteem,

367
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,360
that will increase and enhance your
personal power,

368
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,280
but that puts you in charge of life and
life has a whole new meaning for you as

369
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
a sense of personal freedom.
Doesn't mean you're not gonna.

370
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,690
Have any struggles,
doesn't mean that you're not gonna have

371
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:17,390
any challenges.
Doesn't mean that you're not going to

372
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,430
suffer any defeat.
No,

373
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,241
no,
no.

374
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:24,220
It doesn't mean bad,
but what it does mean that you're

375
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,470
putting yourself in the position to
grow.

376
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,310
You're putting yourself in line with
your higher calling and your highest

377
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,144
self,

378
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,793
and

379
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,450
that's what life is about.

380
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Thank
you.

381
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,650
This affirmation,
please everybody stand please.

382
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,870
I'm standing up to live

383
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,280
and the challenges in my life.
I'm going to use all of me,

384
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,200
all of my courage,
my faith,

385
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,570
determination,
and any help and support that I can give

386
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
anyone
to realize that greatness

387
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,490
together we can shake somebody's hand on
your right and left and say,

388
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:31,630
you got what it takes.
