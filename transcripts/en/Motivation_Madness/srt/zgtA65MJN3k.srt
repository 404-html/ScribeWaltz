1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,740
Conquer,
representing mankind's ability to

2
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,780
overcome
this is the means to fight your fears,

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,380
to begin your journey,
the journey into the unknown,

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,040
the journey to reach this bold word,
the journey that'll get you lost along

5
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,710
the way.
You will find yourself in the dark,

6
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:40,490
struggling alone,
but these are the tests that the

7
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:45,170
universe will place in front of you to
see how strong your desire really is.

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,160
Their destiny will never be reached if
you don't depart,

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,930
you must never stopped.
Understand the work.

10
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,020
Concrete does not voluntarily admit the
obstacles that are to come,

11
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,590
but simply allows you to chance to greet
them yourself.

12
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,260
You will feel as though you are blindly
running through life,

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,430
but asked you to close your eyes and
trust your mind.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,000
Trust your body,
trust her spirit,

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,950
trust you.
Your future is simply a vision of the

16
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,300
paradise you have created in your mind.
You must venture into the unknown with

17
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,370
the acceptance that everything you go
through,

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,290
we'll have a purpose.
Purpose,

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,340
to learn,
purpose,

20
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,600
to change,
a purpose,

21
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,250
to create.
You see,

22
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,560
we're all here on this planet for a
specific reason.

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,720
We must find it.
Define it and never stopped believing in

24
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,640
our destiny because life has no meaning
until you create it.

25
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,610
It is the obstacle that we overcome that
grant us the true beauty and life,

26
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,480
the beauty that confirms that everything
that you have ever struggled for,

27
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:58,160
it was worth it.
If you find trust in your faith and what

28
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:01,660
the universe has for you,
you will find what you have always been

29
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:06,040
looking for
because life is not about the

30
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,860
destination.
It's about the journey.
