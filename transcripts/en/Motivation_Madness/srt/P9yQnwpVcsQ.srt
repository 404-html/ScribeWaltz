1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,330
Well,
I think the one thing that disciplined

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
definitely does help you with is it
helps you get things done and when you

3
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,500
get things done,
when you,

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,740
you actually do things,
you,

5
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:22,574
you,
you,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,250
you have more success.
If you have more success and sometimes a

7
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,640
big part of success is just not being
fucking lazy and just doing it,

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,890
just get.
That's like 90 percent of it is just

9
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,290
showing up,
get there and start working.

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,660
Like you're not going to feel perfect
every day.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,480
If I felt,
if I only worked out when I felt good,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,170
I'd be a fat fuck because there's a lot
of days I don't want to do it.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,480
I've,
it's pretty much the same with everybody

14
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:49,510
that if that actually gets good at
something that you get,

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,360
there's got to be those days you pushed
through and they're the,

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,410
they're probably going to be more
numerous than the days you don't.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,610
And so the benefit of discipline in my
eyes has always been that through

18
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:02,220
discipline I get things done.
I always tell them,

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,240
I always say that I'm like the most lazy
disciplined person I know because I

20
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,320
don't want to do it.
Yeah,

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,410
but I always do.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,680
One of the big problems is sitting down
and doing the work and you,

23
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:21,681
you gotta an pressfield talks about that
in the most concise and beautiful way

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,550
and he labels it like an enemy.
He calls it resistance,

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,620
you know,
and that you have to sit down and you

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,460
have to overcome resistance and that the
pro goes to work and it doesn't matter

27
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,500
if you're sick.
It doesn't matter if you have kids.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,230
It doesn't matter what you,
you're a pro and you go to work and that

29
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:43,231
and that just it puts it in your head
that this is what I do and this is when

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,130
you have pride in that and then when you
are in front of that keyboard and

31
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,681
you're,
you're,

32
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:49,320
you got,
you look down the count,

33
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,300
it says,
I fuck a thousand words today.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,780
I put a thousand words and you and you,
you,

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,920
you're doing the work and out of that
work,

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,510
gems,
blossom,

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,320
little things.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,140
But you might have a day where you just
write nothing but dog shit.

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,600
So what?
Show up again tomorrow and tomorrow out

40
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,550
of that dark,
she had a flower emerge.

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,940
You never know.
And that's the only way to develop real,

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,120
like to,
to really develop your potential 100

43
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,570
percent in anything,
whether it's as an author or even as a

44
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,300
martial artist,
there's a lot of creativity in martial

45
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,310
arts.
To be a great striker,

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,010
you have to be creative because you have
to,

47
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,380
you have to develop patterns or execute
patterns that are,

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,590
aren't going to be perceived.
This idea that life is hard,

49
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,450
something you're supposed to shield from
them.

50
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,310
It's so silly.
And you know,

51
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,320
I've had this conversation with my
friends because,

52
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,570
uh,
everybody that I know that's interesting

53
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,160
how to fucked up life.
But,

54
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,730
but now we have kids and the last thing
we want is our kids to have a fucked up

55
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,270
life.

56
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,040
So we put our kids in these good
schools.

57
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,880
We live in these nice neighborhoods.
Everybody eats healthy and there's no

58
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,110
fucking domestic violence.
And everybody seems it's so different

59
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,300
than all of our lives.
And we were talking about it,

60
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,950
me and Brian Calendar actually talking
about it,

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,770
like,
look,

62
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,650
we all had fucked up childhoods and
everybody we know had fucked up

63
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,550
childhoods and they're all interesting,
but I don't want my kids to be boring,

64
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,310
but I also want them to be safe.
So it's like,

65
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,840
how do you,
how do you approach that?

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,140
I think you get involved is what I've
chosen to do is get my kids involved in

67
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,200
martial arts and,
and,

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,650
and,
and give them the opportunity to pursue

69
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,790
difficult things and understanding that
through pursuing these difficult things,

70
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,330
like in accomplishing stuff like you,
you learn something about yourself,

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,970
you learn that you have this ability
inside of you to overcome,

72
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,110
get obsessed with life improvement,
find things that you enjoy doing.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,910
They're difficult.
Do them and get better.

74
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,870
It seems so simplistic.
It seems like a ridiculous idealistic

75
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,700
point of view,
but it's effective.

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,400
Well,
you need some form,

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,660
some amount of pride and some amount of
ego to get good at things in the first

78
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:51,040
place because it's such a
counterintuitive notion because you have

79
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,630
to have a belief in yourself.
You have to be able,

80
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,150
like when you,
when you first,

81
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,980
when you start out at Jujitsu,
your white belt,

82
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,240
like I remember being a white belt and
being like,

83
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,420
oh my God,
I am fucking never going to get good at

84
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,860
this.
I'm going to suck forever.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,190
But to,
to,

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,220
to,
to look at people who are better than

87
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,310
you and no,
they had to have sucked at one point in

88
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:09,851
time.
Okay,

89
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,470
this guy be somewhere along the end of
this tunnel.

90
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,330
There's got to be a light.
I just got to keep going.

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,830
Yeah,

92
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,830
and that takes ego.
Ego drives,

93
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,170
you know you to be successful.
Me To be successful.

94
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,370
Egos.
What's driving you?

95
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,640
The problem is when you let it go too
far and you know everything,

96
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:30,350
you know,
everything takes balance.

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,340
There's a dichotomy and everything.
Every part of you has a dichotomy.

98
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,250
You know,
you can get so into the physical aspects

99
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:40,730
of things that you end up like doing a
bunch of steroids and going crazy and

100
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,070
ruining your health.
That's not good.

101
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,380
The other end of the spectrum,
you know,

102
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,840
you can sit around and play video games
and turned into a

103
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,000
bodybuilding is a great example of that
because when you start lifting weights

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,541
like,
God,

105
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,000
I'd like to be stronger and you start
getting a little bit bigger.

106
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:56,751
You're like,
oh look at that,

107
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,950
I got a muscle,
Ooh,

108
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,110
this is cool,
and then you keep going and then you

109
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:03,530
keep going.
But some guys get so fucking crazy they

110
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:07,820
won't stop until they have 22 inch arms
and they want to have thighs that are so

111
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,290
big.
They have to walk like they're,

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
they've got a barrel in between their
legs and you know,

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,850
and they,
they just can't help but they just take

114
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,610
it to some completely unhealthy place.
Yeah,

115
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,740
that's rough.
Yeah.

116
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,160
Well,
it's,

117
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,400
it's just the nature of trying to get
good at something.

118
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,450
You've got to recognize what's good and
what is just fucking insane.

119
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,630
For some people especially,
they're just experiencing way too much

120
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:34,010
pressure and that pressure.
A lot of times it's just a,

121
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,500
an imbalanced and perspective and some
of it's in like a,

122
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,180
I was talking to this,
mom wants,

123
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,780
her daughter does gymnastics with my
daughter and we were talking about um,

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,200
kids killing themselves where she used
to live.

125
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,820
She still live in,
um,

126
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,080
one of the really wealthy tech areas
outside of San Francisco and a bunch of

127
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:55,230
kids that went to school with her
daughter that were like 15,

128
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,290
16.
We're jumping off bridges and shit.

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,530
Like it was a,
like an epidemic and they were trying to

130
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:03,740
figure out what the fuck is going on.
And they're literally calling it

131
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Affluenza.
That these affluent kids and their

132
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,650
families are literally worth a billion
dollars.

133
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,240
You know,
I mean,

134
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,240
everybody's super rich and they're
having this insane pressure like before

135
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,950
high school and in high school to be an
Ivy League schools and to get four

136
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,784
point,
oh,

137
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,340
and they're fucking,
they're not having any fun and they're

138
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,190
not experienced in life and they don't
have any hope.

139
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,620
And their parents are all on fucking
pills and they're just killing

140
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,800
themselves for some people out there
that aren't feeling good.

141
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,100
Man,
if you just fucking struggled more,

142
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,960
you get over that struggle,
you feel better.

143
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,020
It sounds so simplistic,
but I swear by it,

144
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,010
I felt shitty myself and then force
myself to work out.

145
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,150
Then after I get out of there,
I'm like,

146
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,670
Whoa,
100 percent guarantee.

147
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,750
It's hard for people to break momentum
to momentum.

148
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,120
That's good.
Momentum or momentum.

149
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,470
Momentum is bad.
Momentum.

150
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,480
When I get a,
like when I get on a good groove of

151
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,310
working out all the time,
I feel like after I'm done working out,

152
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm like,
I can't wait to get in there again.

153
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,520
I can't wait to work out again.
That's the good momentum,

154
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,640
but then there's that bad momentum,
like you get injured or something like

155
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,850
that and you can't do anything for a
couple of weeks and then to try to get

156
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,580
that kickstart,
that meant motor up again.

157
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,410
It's,
it's hard to get momentum.

158
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,130
There's a lot of people that are eating
shit food and then by the end of the day

159
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,670
your body's in a crisis.
You're body's just processing all this

160
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:27,671
bullshit and if you're eating a big like
bullshit lunch filled with nonsense,

161
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,220
like your body's got to process all that
stuff,

162
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,390
and so at the end of the day,
yeah,

163
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,820
you're going to lose your willpower.
So like when 5:00,

164
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,530
6:00 rolls around,
you're going to be tired,

165
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,240
but if you have a healthy lunch and you
know you're,

166
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:44,390
you're properly fueled and then you also
have positive people in your life,

167
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,220
everyone's motivated by the end of the
day,

168
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,040
you're going to feel good.
Whatever the fuck you thing is,

169
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,870
just go and do it.
Just force yourself to do it.

170
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,120
And if you feel like shit because you
ate lunch,

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,430
then your lunch was filled with
bullshit.

172
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,140
Well then,
hey dummy,

173
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,330
don't eat shitty lunch tomorrow,
tomorrow.

174
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,110
Try a nice salad,
a salad with some salmon and see how you

175
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:03,801
feel.
Then you're like,

176
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:06,390
hey,
I feel way better today at 6:00 dot.

177
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,450
Yeah.
Now your decision making will be better

178
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,150
like that.
People don't understand how significant

179
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:12,920
it is,
like all these little decisions,

180
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,160
they,
those are the.

181
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,850
That's the path for the rest of your
existence on earth,

182
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,310
and if you decide to go to fucking
cheetos,

183
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,240
chocolate chip cookie route,
you're.

184
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,130
If you're just making a shit path,
you're carving and your fucking path

185
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,280
through broken rocks and glass and it's
not the way to go.

186
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,190
You know what else doesn't exist in a
day to day life,

187
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,130
a place where it's okay to be a man.
It's actually okay to be a man.

188
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,280
It's okay to have man thoughts like
everybody is so,

189
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,940
so toned down and neutered.
It's like human resources and corporate

190
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:50,570
life has watered down people's natural
behavior to the point where people are

191
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,750
just dying on the inside,
sitting in these fucking cubicles

192
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,160
rotting,
just freaking the fuck out.

193
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,310
Having all these thoughts,
they can entertain having to pretend to

194
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,340
be someone there.
They are not all day long putting on

195
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,580
this bullshit way of talking,
this fake way of thinking.

196
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,270
Everybody's got a subscribe to whatever
fucking ridiculous policies their

197
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,930
company wants to enforce and you're just
a robot and you get out of there and you

198
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:17,880
just want to scream.
It's this fear of discomfort.

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
People have this extreme feeling in
their mind when it comes to their

200
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,960
associations with exercise.
They want to avoid discomfort.

201
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,990
They feel like anytime exercise is just
like something to be avoided,

202
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,960
that's not for me.
Fuck that.

203
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,520
I don't want to sweat.
I don't want to strain,

204
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,380
and a lot of times this association that
they have is about the beginnings of

205
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,990
getting in shape.
It's not about once you're actually fit

206
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,840
because once you're actually fit,
exercise is something you look forward

207
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:47,020
to.

208
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,670
It's an alleviation of stress.
It's.

209
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,790
It feels great.
Like if I can't get a workout in,

210
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,140
I look at my schedule,
I go,

211
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,090
ah Shit.
I don't have any time for a workout,

212
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,340
which means I'm not going to get that
good feeling,

213
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,320
and so instead of looking at it like,
oh,

214
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:03,730
I've got to go grant and sweat,
I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good.

215
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm not going to feel relaxed.
I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm

216
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:10,660
not going to feel even appreciative.
Like my appreciation of things.

217
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,370
It gets enhanced greatly after exercise.
I just feel better.

218
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:18,760
I feel like I can take things in for
what they are rather than,

219
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,560
you know,
whatever the weather was,

220
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:25,240
sensory data that I'm getting from any
event is just one more distraction that

221
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,510
gets in my way.
And,

222
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,920
and know that that's a lot of times how
I look at things if I'm overstressed or

223
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,910
if I'm working too much like our bodies
for whatever reason,

224
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,500
uh,
most people,

225
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,280
their associations are to avoid anything
that's uncomfortable.

226
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,490
But it's so illogical because when you
look at comfort and you look at success

227
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:50,581
and progress and the eventual,
the feelings of accomplishment and of

228
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,240
getting past certain hurdles and in
terms of like how you feel about life,

229
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,880
a lot of those are connected to
discomfort.

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Discomfort is your friend.
It really is like discomfort and,

231
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,450
and not being happy and content with
certain situations in life or certain

232
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:10,030
feelings in life.
There are massive,

233
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,230
massive motivators and they're,
they're amazing at,

234
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,670
at facilitating change.
And yet our instinct is to avoid those

235
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:24,200
and just sit on the couch and watch some
fucking reality show about dudes who

236
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:29,201
make moonshine with our jaw open bazaar.
And for me,

237
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,480
at least,
when I get,

238
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,170
when I get like really disciplined and
really,

239
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,960
um,
I get really consistent with my

240
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:40,120
workouts.
One of the things that I feel,

241
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,220
I almost feel momentum.

242
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,800
I feel like there's like a push behind
me.

243
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,441
Like,
all right,

244
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:45,881
we're,
you know,

245
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:47,920
like after I get out of the gym,
I have a really good workout.

246
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:48,581
I'm like,
yeah,

247
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,590
now I'm doing it.
I'm doing it all the time now.

248
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,420
And I'm looking forward to the next
time.

249
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:57,421
And it makes resistance much weaker and
it makes my motivation and my discipline

250
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,660
much stronger.
I think a lot of it is based on just the

251
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,040
consistency,
you know,

252
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,110
it's one of the things that I talked
about recently on the podcast.

253
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:06,000
I said,
you know,

254
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,010
like blowing something off.
It's not just not like blowing off a of

255
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,510
an exercise that you planned is not just
bad for you physically.

256
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,070
It's also bad mentally because then that
option is now available.

257
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,420
The option to fuck off is available and
you did it before and you're probably

258
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,790
going to do it again and you'll get
mediocre results.

259
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,420
Not just in that aspect of your life,
but maybe in all aspects of your life

260
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,690
because I think that option to fuck off
when you embrace it,

261
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:39,040
that is a pathway that you might choose
when it comes to dealing with conflict

262
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,380
in your personal life,
dealing with business decisions,

263
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,980
dealing with career decisions,
like an uncomfortable decision that you

264
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,981
might be faced with when you maybe you
need to make a change as far as what

265
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:53,980
your pathway is in life,
but you don't do it instead you fuck off

266
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,310
and that the inclination to fuck off.
I think that gathers momentum as well.

267
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,090
The inclination to be disciplined.
That comes with momentum too and I think

268
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,550
both things like you did,
you take a path,

269
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,050
the path of the healthy person or the
path of the fuck off like this is not

270
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,490
like your body is like a race car that
you can juice up yourself.

271
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,960
Like you can add the fat tires,
you can add the improve suspension.

272
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,120
You can beef up the horsepower in the
engine.

273
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:26,380
You could do all that yourself or you
could just choose to have this shitty

274
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:30,070
body that's always falling apart on you
because we're essentially ecosystems,

275
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,120
you know,
and we're,

276
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,360
we're in charge.
This weird consciousness that has all

277
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:38,590
this resistance and has all this
inclination towards comfort and fucking

278
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:43,591
off and blowing things off is what is in
charge of making all these things happen

279
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,120
that keep this ecosystem healthy.
It's almost like if earth itself had

280
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,340
like a shitty manager,
you know,

281
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:55,450
if there was a manager of a natural
manager of earth that was like,

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,780
Oh God,
who cares if it rains?

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,760
Oh God,
you know,

284
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,210
like,
let's let you know I'm,

285
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,990
I'm going to stop growing things.
I don't give a shit anymore.

286
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,910
It's all stupid anyway.
I mean,

287
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,710
it's literally like the,
the,

288
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,230
just blow it up.
Fuck it.

289
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,440
Let's just kill all the life will do.
It's all going to die eventually.

290
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,770
I mean,
the sun only lasts 7 billion years.

291
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,550
You see?
That is the perspective a lot of people

292
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,750
take with Adrian where it's like,
well,

293
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,150
if you're going to die,
you're going to age.

294
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,860
You can't stop aging.
And it's like,

295
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:25,850
yes,
you're right,

296
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,660
but that's not the point.
The point is to age better.

297
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,660
Like that's the point.
The point is to increase your health

298
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:33,530
span,
you know?

299
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:36,160
And that is,
we know is possible like that can.

300
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,780
There's some,
there's some of these like centenarians

301
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,950
and Supercentenarians I've seen that are
like,

302
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,610
you know,
over 100 years old and they're like

303
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:48,230
riding bikes and racing and it's like
they're old,

304
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,100
they're very old,
they're experiencing got a

305
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,160
very good quality of and experiencing a
quality of life that these other people

306
00:14:55,191 --> 00:15:00,191
that don't exercise feel they physically
feel their own body diminishing and they

307
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,850
just feel it's inevitable.
It's just,

308
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,710
it is what it is.
You're wasting your time.

309
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,340
You're out there running around.
But no we're not because this experience

310
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,590
right now,
it's not like no one's under the

311
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:14,591
illusion that you're gonna live forever,
but you are enhancing the experience

312
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:18,050
that you're currently involved in right
now and you are alive.

313
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,180
You are alive.
You do experience this life.

314
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,460
But do you experience this life
optimally?

315
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,100
Is it,
is it as enjoyable as it can be?

316
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,980
And we all know that there's a spectrum
for that enjoyability,

317
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,820
like we've all had times in our life
where it's not been so great and then

318
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,910
times in a life where everything came
together like what a fucking great day,

319
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,670
Woo.
Like make more of those.

320
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,310
Like you could make more of those and
then the whole things better.

321
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,770
And I think when that whole thing is
better,

322
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,370
it affects everybody.
You touch everybody that's around you,

323
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:49,190
everybody you come in contact with and
that in turn,

324
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,080
I mean it sounds so grandiose,
but in,

325
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
in turn can affect the entire race of
human beings.

326
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,080
I've always wondered if the depression
that people see in mass today,

327
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,830
there's so much depression that people.
I mean there's a ca.

328
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a common trait.
Like it's a common condition.

329
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,490
Oh,
he suffers from depression.

330
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,250
Oh,
she suffers from depression.

331
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,851
Like,
oh,

332
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,040
he's got herpes.
You know?

333
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,830
You know what I mean?
It's like,

334
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,210
it's a,
it's a common thing.

335
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,080
I've always wondered or I've been
wondering more and more recently,

336
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,940
it really hit me when have you ever seen
a Heimos Arctic adventure?

337
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,090
This guy lives in this incredibly remote
area of the Arctic National Wildlife

338
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,170
Refuge in the Alaskan interior and he.
He lives in this really small log cabin

339
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,950
and he hunts and gathers and that's all
he does and he's very smart.

340
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,410
Like he's not a dummy at all and he's
been up there.

341
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,810
He lives with his wife and his.
He raised children up there and it's

342
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,700
really,
really.

343
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,270
There's some dark moments and there
because they lived like this from the

344
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,940
time,
like when they had children up there and

345
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:04,270
they lost their two year old baby in a
fucking canoe.

346
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,100
Like they tipped over in a,
in a canoe and lost their kid and it's

347
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:13,660
like it's really intense when they
revisit the site and leave flowers and

348
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:16,480
it was like 30 years ago and they had
several children since then.

349
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:20,050
But this moment is still like this
intense moment of loss for them where

350
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:25,051
they lost their baby.
But this fucking guy is very happy and

351
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:28,840
very,
very smart and very connected and very

352
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:33,250
articulate.
And he firmly believes that human

353
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:38,251
beings.
When we evolved and developed and were

354
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,590
hunter gatherers that there's a set of
rewards,

355
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,620
there's reward systems that are set up
inside the human body,

356
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:45,320
inside the,
the,

357
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,320
the very being that we embody that don't
get met in today's society and it's one

358
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,290
of the things that's causing depression.

359
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,040
One of the things that's causing this
funk that people are in is that we're

360
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,870
living our lives.
Many of us,

361
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:02,790
at least in these very unfulfilling ways
where you're going to this office with

362
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,880
artificial light and you're doing
something you don't want to do all day

363
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:09,540
long and then you get home and you're
tired and on top of that you're eating

364
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,730
shit.
You're eating potato chips and you're

365
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:14,070
drinking soda and your body is just
like,

366
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,670
what in the fuck is this?
We're supposed to be out in the fields

367
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,450
were supposed to be walking up hills.
We're supposed to be looking for animals

368
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,570
or gathering vegetables.
We're supposed to be doing all these

369
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:28,320
things that our body's designed to do.
We're supposed to be in nature and

370
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:33,090
nature is like a medicine.
Like it literally is a medicine to you,

371
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,860
like people.
People that go,

372
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,380
you don't have to go hunting,
you don't have to go fishing,

373
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,910
just go fucking hike,
man.

374
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,970
Just go hike up to the top of a mountain
and look out,

375
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,940
you know,
there's a reward that you get from that

376
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:49,710
that is intensely like soul filling.
Just like something about like when I

377
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:54,420
was in Colorado and there was this,
this area of boulder where you drive up

378
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,720
one of these roads and there's this area
where you could park and it was this

379
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,490
incredible view,
man.

380
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,000
These people just park and just go out
there and just look,

381
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,770
but you get there and you park and you
go,

382
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,790
fuck [inaudible].
You would see you.

383
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,040
You literally seen the continental
divide.

384
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,490
These snow capped mountains in July,
July.

385
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:16,460
It's covered with snow because those
mountains don't give a perspective.

386
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,130
Oh,
just this whole new perspective on it

387
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:23,030
and I think nature,
I think the ease of suffering is always

388
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:23,860
in present.
This,

389
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,820
you know,
when you're in president is truly locked

390
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,440
in in presidents.
There is no suffering.

391
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,120
There can be pain,
but no suffering.

392
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:32,360
Suffering isn't.
It's something created by our own minds

393
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,510
and I think nature is one of the great
ways to do this because humans,

394
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,250
we,
we learned,

395
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:39,560
we take cues from our environment and
nature,

396
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,750
as I was saying earlier,
is always in the present.

397
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,970
You know,
there's this natural presidents of all

398
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,410
the animals,
everything around you.

399
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,530
Whereas if you get around a bunch of
people watching housewives and stressed

400
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,800
about this and popping pills,
you're going to take on that energy too

401
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:54,950
and you're going to lose your president
is because of your surroundings.

402
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,930
So it's like this ultimate regrounding
tool where we get back to a present

403
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,360
moment,
you know,

404
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,670
and that's such a fucking key element to
human happiness.

405
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,300
And I think the other key element is
having something where we're fighting

406
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:09,051
for,
you know,

407
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:12,730
having them mission.
I think we're all forces and that forest

408
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:15,910
needs to have an effect,
needs to have a reason that it's moving

409
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,700
in a certain direction.
And I think with all of our meats and

410
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,700
all of our needs met,
you know,

411
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,870
where we don't have to hunt for food,
we don't have to acquire everything.

412
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:26,050
Everything's relatively easy and it's
all about advancement and all this.

413
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,650
We've lost a lot of the basic mission,
which was the mission to survive and

414
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,880
procreate,
you know,

415
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,650
so.
And we haven't replaced it with any

416
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:36,490
other universal mission,
which is I think one of the big allures

417
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:39,610
of these things like wars and these
things like creating an enemy.

418
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,550
Well at least then you have a mission
and when you have a mission,

419
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,530
human beings are happy.
You know,

420
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:48,730
like a birch and Russell talked about he
but conquest of happiness and he had his

421
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,680
own fucked up attributes.
Every time I bring them up,

422
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,850
people talk about is fucked up.
And as he thought he was into phrenology

423
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,390
and he might've been racist,
whatever,

424
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,550
but he was a good philosopher.
Smoked constantly.

425
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,901
But.
But anyways,

426
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:00,670
he talked about the happiest person he
knew.

427
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,560
The happiest person he could find was a
groundskeeper on a manner who every day

428
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,630
woke up and was at war with the rabbits.
Have the guy.

429
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,160
He just declared that the rabbits were
the fucking enemy.

430
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,130
And he would go out with his gun and he
would hunt as many as possible.

431
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,940
And he'd go morning till till night and
he would kill as many rabbits as he

432
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,880
could because it was the rabbits were
the ones eating the hedges and the

433
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,720
flowers and whatever.

434
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,530
So he basically made the rabbits as
enemy and struck out every single day to

435
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,870
kill as many rabbits as possible.
And that dude,

436
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,420
according to Bertrand Russell,
was happy as fuck.

437
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,980
He had a task,
he had a task,

438
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,420
he had a purpose,
you know,

439
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,540
you had a mission.
My mission is to destroy the rabbits.

440
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,350
I just have a dog like that.
Yeah.

441
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,100
I had the happiest dog ever.
His name was Frank Sinatra.

442
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,790
And uh,
he was a pit bull that all he lived for

443
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,510
was killing lizards and my house,
my old house,

444
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,690
not the house of it now,
but my old house had this one,

445
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,230
um,
it's like a on a hill and there's this

446
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,350
one wall where these lizards would run
up the wall.

447
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,020
And so frank,
I would literally let him out in the

448
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,100
morning and he fucking bolt out that
door,

449
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,050
like time to go to war.

450
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,080
And he would run and go look for these
lizards.

451
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,500
And he would stand there like Eddie
Bravo would just watch it and marvel.

452
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,520
He be like,
fuck man,

453
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,620
this dog does this every day there's doc
does this.

454
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,330
Every day I go,
this is what he loves to do.

455
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,390
And he would go there and he would have
his paws on the wall.

456
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,170
Are you
crazy?

457
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,480
He would jump up and try to grab a
lizard and occasionally he would get one

458
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,190
and he'd be like,
fuck yeah.

459
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,140
And he would get one.
They would go looking for another one.

460
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,590
He would go and he was a pretty big yard
so he would go wandering around the yard

461
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,440
looking for anything else at fucked up.
Anything else that was slipping?

462
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,290
It was constantly,
unfortunately twice.

463
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,860
I had to take him to the hospital
because he got bit by rattlesnakes

464
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,880
because rattlesnakes are slipping to.

465
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,050
Apparently he killed the rattlesnakes,
but the rattlesnakes fucked him up here.

466
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
Like a water balloon.
Go the other side of his head.

467
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,210
Both of my dogs.
By the way.

468
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:55,930
That's a real problem.
If you don't have the money to pay for

469
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,180
the serum,
it's super expensive.

470
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,650
It was several thousand dollars to treat
them for this rattlesnake venom.

471
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,610
Antivenom.
Shit.

472
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,270
It's like,
I was like,

473
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,440
man,
what if I was poor?

474
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,910
What if a.
that's a whole fucked up system like

475
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,200
you.
They inject horses with the Venom and

476
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,960
they'd get the antibodies from the
horses.

477
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,720
It's this archaic system.
I think my friend Donald Schultz is

478
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,700
working on.
He's a big snake handler guy.

479
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,820
He's working on ways to innovate around
that because it's kind of like a real

480
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:24,940
backwards system that they have.
How you get antivenom?

481
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,500
Well,
a horse will survive,

482
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,620
so let's just fucking sorta put the
venom in there and then we'll get the

483
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,830
antibodies from the horse and then you
know,

484
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,650
it's,
it's a weird.

485
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,330
It's a weird thing how they do it.
Yeah.

486
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,390
Well that's a real problem with people
that are vegans.

487
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,740
If you're a Vegan,
you don't use any animal products.

488
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,110
He a bit by a rattlesnake.
You got two choices.

489
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,350
Compromise your morals or that's a wrap,
you know,

490
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,030
but this dog was so goddamn happy.
He had missions,

491
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,920
you know,
he would go out of that yard.

492
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,030
He wasn't bored.
He was pleased to me for a walk.

493
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,470
Come on man.
He was like,

494
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:59,180
see a dude,
don't open that door with God.

495
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,310
He's just had his little mission and I
think you can see that in the people who

496
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,680
are the most unhappy.
They seem aimless.

497
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,150
Like,
what am I here for?

498
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:09,520
Why am I doing this?
Nothing makes sense.

499
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,590
You know,
and I've even felt it in my own life

500
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:12,540
when,
you know,

501
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,870
I know what my mission here is for my
mission is to expand human consciousness

502
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,070
to help people be happy.

503
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,420
That's really what I find my greatest
purpose in.

504
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,530
But every once in a while I'll get this
kind of like,

505
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:26,200
fuck people attitude.
Maybe someone said some fucked up shit

506
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:26,711
and I'm like,
man,

507
00:24:26,711 --> 00:24:30,370
people fucking suck for people.
And then at that moment that's when I'm

508
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,830
actually impressed because I've lost my
mission.

509
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,190
Instead of having a mission like yes,
my mission is human consciousness,

510
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,350
all of a sudden it's like fuck people,
fuck that mission.

511
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,680
They'll figure it out and then I'm
depressed because I've lost my purpose.

512
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,280
It's very hard to rise above like
literally when something like that

513
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:46,660
happens and realize like,
Oh,

514
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:47,500
you've just,
you're,

515
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:50,110
you're encountering one diseased
individual.

516
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:52,450
You've got to look at the mass of
humanity.

517
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,780
Like when you encounter one diseased
individual,

518
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,920
it's so like this guy who shot up that
nightclub in Orlando,

519
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,310
you're,
you're looking at one disease individual

520
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,401
and if you say,
man,

521
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,270
people fucking suck.

522
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,940
Look what they did.
We'll look at how many people that are

523
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:10,720
responding with rainbows on their
twitter pages and love and,

524
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,020
and all the best wishes to those folks
that got killed and other.

525
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,150
I mean it was looking at this guy's
paid.

526
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:21,100
She was an animal lover who is
organizing people to go to the homes of

527
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:23,210
the victims and see if they have pets or
travel.

528
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,420
You know,
there's this beautiful people out there.

529
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,590
Yeah,
there's a lot.

530
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,090
There's more beautiful pete.
This,

531
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,860
this is what that is out a doubt.
Not just the safest.

532
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:35,420
The easiest is the happiest time in
terms of like being able to like reach

533
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:36,650
out and,
and,

534
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,730
and send love to people and have people
send love to you,

535
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,630
but it's just occasionally you run into
concert in the concert itself,

536
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,230
but the beauty is out there too.
It's just not as dramatic and it doesn't

537
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:50,490
impose upon us as forcefully,
but we,

538
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,880
if we just look,
it's around all the time.

539
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,840
We run into good people all the time,
but you just make eye contact with that

540
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,770
person or that kid is just looking at
you and just create that little smile

541
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:01,940
and you're like,
oh yeah,

542
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,620
the good of humanity.
The fact that,

543
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,180
you know,
we really are love,

544
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,720
you know,
being expressed outwardly all the time

545
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,420
and it's just these other delusions that
get in the way of that.

546
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,880
Well,
we're oddly attracted to negativity to.

547
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,910
It's almost like we look at negativity
online or that you run into is like

548
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,200
possibility of war.
Like,

549
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,640
yeah,
I feel like I'll just fucking drums

550
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,930
beating.
Goddammit.

551
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,760
There's an army on the background.
They're coming,

552
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,780
they're coming,
but you know,

553
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:30,740
it's like there's this real impulse to
sort of batten down the hatches on

554
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:34,460
really it's just some fucking 36 year
old losers sitting in his parents

555
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:35,271
basement,
you know,

556
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:38,510
farting and smelling his own farts and
angry online.

557
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,490
I mean,
that's really what a lot of you're

558
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,010
dealing with.
You're dealing with really sick people,

559
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:47,160
like people that have just,
for whatever reason,

560
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,310
they've not found their path.
They've not found any happiness.

561
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,780
They have found any fulfillment.
They don't.

562
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,730
They haven't found any growth there just
stifled or rotten and some sort of a

563
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,040
weird way.
It just hasn't really worked for them

564
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,290
and so they're,
they're lashing out,

565
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,390
lashing out at the world and you run
into one of those people suck and that's

566
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,460
the initial response and then the more
conscious response is to look at and be

567
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,570
and have compassion for that person.
That is hard to do and our system isn't

568
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,760
based upon that.
And even if you look at the US penal

569
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,560
system,
it's very much about punishment.

570
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,430
Whereas you watched that documentary
that Michael Morton who to invade nest

571
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,060
where they go to Norway,
they have a whole different idea of what

572
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,230
the penal system is for.

573
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,670
It's about restoring human dignity and
cultivating a change.

574
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,610
Really making change in the person.
It's not about punishment.

575
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,800
It's about.
It's about actually changing that

576
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,860
individual so he doesn't do it again,
and then you look at the recidivism

577
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:44,820
rates between our prisons and Norway's
prisons and they're just dramatically

578
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:47,490
different.
That impulse to punish immediately,

579
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,920
you know,
is not the healthiest impulse.

580
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:52,500
That's just gonna create more issues
down the road.

581
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,670
You're not rehabilitating anybody.
You're just taking even more broken

582
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:59,010
people and putting them out in the world
and hoping they're not going to do the

583
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,360
broken thing.
Well,

584
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,510
it's not going to fucking work.
You know the right impulse is always

585
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:07,320
that compassion and looking to see as if
that was you.

586
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,020
How all of these fucked up elements of
the world and choices.

587
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm not overriding the fact that they
had choices and all this.

588
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,170
They're not free of guilt,
but look at,

589
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,720
look at that like this is the person
that just made some bad choices and had

590
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:21,280
some tough shit to deal with and
couldn't overcome it.

591
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,770
The resistance in the video game was
higher than his skillset and he wasn't

592
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:29,010
able to,
to choose to work and choose to the

593
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,260
positive elements that would allow them
to overcome it,

594
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,203
you know?
Yeah.

595
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,130
It's,
it's also Norway's dealing with far

596
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,730
fewer people,
you know,

597
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,460
and that's,
that's a good thing for them.

598
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,590
And it's also they don't have that
conquers mentality that we have.

599
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,250
So we're so wrapped up in success and
also in punishment.

600
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,490
I mean that,
that is a big aspect of our culture,

601
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
like punishment.
And I mean like when anyone does

602
00:28:56,881 --> 00:29:00,000
anything wrong online,
the amount of people that feel like it's

603
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:04,530
their job to shame that person and
embarrass that person and an insult,

604
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,840
that person,
it's pretty crazy to watch when

605
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:07,830
something goes down.

606
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,140
It's also,
it's also counterproductive,

607
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,670
you know?
And,

608
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,040
and I see that in the people shaming
people for appropriation,

609
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,990
right?
So let's say for example,

610
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,810
someone wears a head dress at a fucking
festival,

611
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,220
right?
They're probably mildly.

612
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,170
They're not doing it to mock the native
Americans,

613
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:23,440
most likely,
probably like a,

614
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,700
a mild appreciation and interest.
I think this looks cool.

615
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,270
I'm in a place and you know,
and then all of a sudden they get all

616
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:34,620
this intense hate and shame and putting
all of this stuff,

617
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:37,140
all of these intentions on them that
weren't true.

618
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,940
Again,
going back to my point about morality,

619
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:41,600
it's not about the act,
it's about the intentions of the eye,

620
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,630
but right now we make it all about the
act.

621
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:44,510
Oh,
you wore this headdress.

622
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:47,230
That means you're insulting thousands of
years of native Americans.

623
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,000
You're oppressing,
you're appropriating like,

624
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,260
no,
I fucking wasn't.

625
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,030
I was wearing a fucking Harris'
headdress.

626
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,530
But then all of a sudden that imprint
will create trauma and that trauma will

627
00:29:56,531 --> 00:30:00,460
have a poisonous impact that will make
them feel weird and make them want to do

628
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:03,730
that to other people.
So it's like you're in injecting someone

629
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,040
with a,
like a heat virus,

630
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,230
you know,
that they're going to then pass on to

631
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,330
other people rather than doing the
opposite,

632
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,590
you know,
spreading the love.

633
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:15,190
Herpes were contagious positivity that
goes the other way.

634
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,950
And we have those choices with how to
deal with people.

635
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:21,580
But more often than not,
we come with this thing to punish and

636
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:25,120
create more trauma which triggers their
own self judge and their own self hate,

637
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
lowers their own self love.
And then they're going to pass that off

638
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,710
to kids,
family members,

639
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:30,890
people around them.
You know,

640
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,020
there's just two sets of dominoes that
we can choose to take to take either

641
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:35,320
path.
