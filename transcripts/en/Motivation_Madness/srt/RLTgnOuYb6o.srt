1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,660
The three things that I want to leave
with you,

2
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:13,450
just these three.
I could do 10 I could do a whole life

3
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:18,451
class,
but just these three things will carry

4
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:23,020
you if you let them.
First and foremost,

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,890
knowing who you are,
knowing who you are,

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,450
being able to answer this question,
who am I and what do I want?

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,050
You know,
many times when I go out of the country,

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,850
I am baffled by that question to explain
what is your occupation?

9
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,340
I've I've stood there for 10 minutes.
Well,

10
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,510
am I talk show hosts?
Well,

11
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:51,940
I'm more than a talk show hosts and my
business woman,

12
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm business woman more than a business
woman.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,640
Am I an entrepreneur more than do her,
so I just leave it blank or self

14
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,474
employed.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,440
So I'm not asking for the roles that you
play as daughters.

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:10,441
I'm not asking that question.
What are the roles that you play as a

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,560
daughter,
as a friend,

18
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,660
as a sister?
You're going to be a lawyer,

19
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:16,330
you're going to teach,
you're going to be a pharmacist.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,870
I'm asking the bigger question of who am
I?

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,990
Who am I really?
My answer is I am God's child.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I am.
I am that which is born of all that is I

23
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,480
am as shot and said,
a spiritual being,

24
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:45,481
having a human experience come trailing
the breadth of the ancestors yet,

25
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,470
but trailing the breadth of the angels
and understanding that because I am

26
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,741
connected to the source of all that is
all that is possible is possible for me.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,720
That's who I am and what do I want.
I don't want to just be successful in

28
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,344
the world.

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,740
I don't want to just make a mark or have
a legacy.

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,660
The answer to that question for me is I
want to fulfill the highest,

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,290
truest expression of myself as a human
being.

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,740
I want to fulfill the promise that the
creator dreamed when he dreamed the

33
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,000
cells that made up me.
What do I want?

34
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,990
You must have some kind of vision for
your life.

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,370
Even if you don't know the plan,
you have to have a direction in which

36
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:01,960
you choose to go.
I never was the kind of woman who liked

37
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,820
to get in a car and just go for a ride.
I had a boyfriend would say,

38
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,740
let's just go for a ride.
I want to know where we go.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,750
We
do we have a destination.

40
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,570
Is there a plan or we just ride.
What I've learned is that to great

41
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:27,740
metaphor for life,
you want to be in the driver's seat of

42
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,250
your own life because if you're not,
life will drive you.

43
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,373
So

44
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,530
knowing who you really are in this space
in time that we embody,

45
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,470
that's number one.
What do you want?

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,890
Who are you?
Number two,

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,750
you must find a way to serve.
Martin Luther King said that not

48
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,990
everybody can be famous,
but everybody can be great because

49
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,991
greatness is determined by service.
Now we live in a world where everybody

50
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:15,361
wants to be famous and where we admire
people for just being famous,

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,440
we think being known brings us value.
The truth is all of that will fade in

52
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,760
time in three years.
You won't be able to name the housewives

53
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,803
of Atlanta.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,880
The real truth is that service and
significance service and the

55
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,800
significance that you bring to your
service is that which is lasting.

56
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,490
So to be able to whatever your
occupation or job or talent or gift is.

57
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,700
Our honorees today,
getting doctorate degrees too,

58
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,550
apparently opposite fields,
HIV and aids and the spoken word,

59
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,060
but what they have in common is service
using the spoken word in service to

60
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:17,361
community and the world using your
knowledge and information about HIV and

61
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:23,250
AIDS and medicine in service to the
world and if you look at all the most

62
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:27,360
successful people in the world,
whether they know it or not,

63
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,630
they have that paradigm of service.
Everybody's talking about Mark

64
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,870
Zuckerberg and IPO
service,

65
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,860
Jay z rapid service through the word to
people through song.

66
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,240
For many years I was really just happy
to be on TV and people would stop and

67
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:51,571
say,
Oh,

68
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:52,540
you on tv?
Yeah,

69
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm on TV.
I like being on TV.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,040
It's a nice job
and was about the time that I received

71
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:06,221
my honorary doctorate from spelman
around 1993 so I don't know if that had

72
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,920
something to do with it.
I thought of myself as Doctor Winfrey.

73
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,620
Then I went back and I took a long look
at what it was I was doing on on TV and

74
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:23,740
made a decision that I was no longer
going to just be on tv,

75
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,250
but I was going to use TV as a platform,
as a force for good and not be used by

76
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:35,290
TV.
And I will tell you

77
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,370
my decision to make that significant
change in the way I operated on

78
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:51,961
television using television as a service
changed my career exponentially service

79
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,960
through medicine.
So service through art,

80
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,860
using whatever it is you produce your
product as a way of giving back to the

81
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,170
world.
When you shift the paradigm of whatever

82
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:15,880
it is you choose to do to service and
you bring significance to that,

83
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,210
success will,
I promise you,

84
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,390
follow you.
Service and significance equals success.

85
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,880
That's number two.
Number three.

86
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,940
It's so simple but so hard to do.
Always do the right thing.

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,633
Always

88
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,780
be excellent.
People notice,

89
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,180
think of how you notice.
You go to Taco Bell,

90
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,490
somebody gives you extra napkin and some
sauce.

91
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,050
You notice you want to go back to that
person.

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,570
Cause even at Taco bell excellence shows
itself.

93
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,170
Be Excellent.
Let excellence be your brand.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,000
Everybody talks about building a brand.
I never even knew what that was.

95
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,610
When people would say,
you are a brand,

96
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,020
I would say no,
I'm just oprah.

97
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,430
What I recognize now is that my choice
to it every way in every example,

98
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,060
in every experience to do the right
thing.

99
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,200
And the excellent thing is what has
created the brand.

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,590
Years ago I did an ad for Revlon for uh,
for uh,

101
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,590
an ad,
uh,

102
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,490
they were doing called unforgettable
women.

103
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,990
And what I know is that when you are
excellent,

104
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,280
you become unforgettable.
People remember you,

105
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,100
you stand out.
We got us of what it is.

106
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,400
You become an unforgettable woman.
And that is what we all want.

107
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,880
We want to be unforgettable and not
forgettable.

108
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,660
So doing the right thing,
even when nobody knows you're doing the

109
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,570
right thing,
we'll always bring the right thing to

110
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,670
you.
I promise you that.

111
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,670
Why?
Because the third law of motion is

112
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,550
always at work.
For every action there's an equal and

113
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:31,320
opposite reaction.
That is so true in all of our lives.

114
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,910
That's what Newton said,
Celia and the color purple said it.

115
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,700
Everything you even try to do that

116
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,320
all ready done to you
Britt

117
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,830
thing you even tried to do to me already
done to you so you don't have to worry

118
00:09:57,351 --> 00:10:01,580
about revenge or getting back at
somebody,

119
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,690
making sure they pay.
You just have to do the right thing and

120
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,900
the right thing.
We'll follow you even when people don't

121
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:16,270
support it.
I remember many times on my shelf,

122
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,140
there are many shows y'all never saw and
the reason you didn't see them is

123
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:26,141
because I got the last boat and I
remember 2010 my team,

124
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:34,130
hardest working team in television had
done this interview with a woman who

125
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,290
turns out she was a Sunday school
teacher by day and a sex addict ignite.

126
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,160
Ooh.
They were like,

127
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,980
you won't believe in.
We got her going out.

128
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,450
We got her with the men and we get to
show her and she was willing to show us

129
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,460
if ref Fang.

130
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I sat down with a woman for an interview
that was taped and during the process of

131
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:05,600
the interview I said,
why are you doing this?

132
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,771
And she said,
oh,

133
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,440
I want to help people.
I want to tell my story and I want to

134
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,760
help people.
I said,

135
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:12,080
do you have children?
She says,

136
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:13,910
yes,
I have a 10 year old son.

137
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,930
I knew right then this is never going to
see the light of day.

138
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
So we got off the air and I said to the
lady,

139
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,400
we are not going to air that show.
And she said,

140
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,950
why?
My producer said,

141
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:32,951
why she knew she was being filmed.
She knew what she was saying.

142
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:38,381
She knows what I said because her son
will never get over it.

143
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Her son will never get over it and it's
not worth a rating point to me,

144
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,030
not worth the rating point to me to know
that there's a 10 year old boy who's

145
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:56,650
destroyed because his mother went on the
Oprah Winfrey show and told all her

146
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:01,651
business,
you do the right thing even when other

147
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:06,310
people think it may not be.
And oftentimes when you make a decision

148
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,700
to do the right thing,
immediately you're faced with doubt.

149
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,280
Was that the right thing?
Was that the right decision?

150
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,930
I don't know.
Was that the right thing?

151
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,880
You always know it's the right thing.
When in the end there is peace.

152
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,690
You are rewarded by peace and knowing
that you did the right thing.

153
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,070
The most important thing I have come to
know in doing the right thing and making

154
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:38,981
the right choices is understanding
what we talked about yesterday.

155
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,550
All of you leaving here have the
potential for enormous success.

156
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,150
There's a price that comes with that.
People don't always like you

157
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,570
and they're not always happy for you,
and if you surround yourself with people

158
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,140
who are not accustomed to your success,
they become fearful.

159
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
They become scared because you are
reflecting back something to them,

160
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,420
but they don't recognize.
Now they're not going to say,

161
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,930
you know,
I'm very fearful,

162
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,673
okay,

163
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,350
because you were reflecting back to me
something I don't recognize.

164
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,920
They're going to say,
you know what they're going to say.

165
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,670
They're going to say who she thinks she
is,

166
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,900
who she thinks she is.
That only happens when you are around

167
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:47,031
people who do not mean and want and
aspire to the best for you people who

168
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:53,670
want the best for you.
I want you to be your best.

169
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,120
So my greatest advice to you is to
surround yourself with people who are

170
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:04,650
going to fill your cup until your cup
runneth over.

171
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,830
So when people say you're so full of
yourself,

172
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,610
you can say,

173
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,610
yeah,
yes,

174
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,410
Oh,
I'm so full,

175
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:24,411
my cup runneth over.
And to know that once you're a cup

176
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:32,151
runneth over,
you cannot spend your life with your

177
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:37,941
gallon size offerings offering them to
pint size people.

178
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,820
You have got to surround yourself with
size people who can hang in the same

179
00:14:55,161 --> 00:15:00,161
company with you so that you're not
offering your gallons to those little

180
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:05,390
pipes out there who can't hold it
anyway,

181
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,620
choice to change the world.
I love that song.

182
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,700
I love hearing you all sing that song
and what I know for sure is that the

183
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:20,701
biggest choices begin and in with you,
your internal big questions.

184
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Who do I want to be in the world?
My relationship to source energy to all

185
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:34,090
that is God.
I'm not talking about what you believe

186
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,780
in God.
I'm talking about your experience of

187
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:42,130
that which is all life,
which is divine and universal.

188
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,430
I'm talking about the big deal,
being connected and aligned with that.

189
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,130
When you are tuned in and charged into
that,

190
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:57,780
whenever you feel empty,
you go inside yourself and you connect

191
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:02,781
to the source and you know that all
things are possible

192
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,360
to know that
and to choose to do the right thing in

193
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:15,830
service and significance.
I promise you,

194
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,560
you will create a vessel of service for
yourself first because you have to honor

195
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,250
yourself first.
You have to give to yourself first.

196
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Otherwise you have nothing to give away.
You will create a vessel for yourself or

197
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:38,050
your family,
your community and the world and those

198
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,290
three things will not only lead you to a
blessed life.

199
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,340
I stand as a witness.
My life is so blessed I can't even take

200
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,720
it in.
Sometimes

201
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,030
it will leave you not just to a a gifted
life and a rewarding life that fills you

202
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,160
up,
but a sweet life.

203
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,740
That's what you want.
You want the sweetness.

204
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,560
You want it to be so sweet so that even
when the storms come and they will,

205
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,820
you'll know this too shall pass.
This too shall pass.

206
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,360
The storm is passing over and you shall
not be moved because you know who you

207
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,890
are.
When you can do that,

208
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,160
grace will follow you,
grace and glory,

209
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,700
and when they see you coming,
it Oughta make them proud.

210
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,880
They say it's the click of your heels.
It's the bender yo hair.

211
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,600
It's the palm of your hand.
It's the need for your care because you

212
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:49,390
are a woman.
You a Spelman,

213
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,070
phenomenally phenomenal class of 2012
thank you.
