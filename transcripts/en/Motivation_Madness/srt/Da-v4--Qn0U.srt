1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,890
To me,
the mentality is a really simple one and

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,310
an assistant.
The confidence comes from preparation,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,950
you know?
So when the game's on the line,

4
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,950
I'm not asking myself to do something
that I haven't done it thousands of

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,840
times before.
Right.

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,870
So what are prepare?
I know what I'm capable of doing.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,160
I know what I'm comfortable doing and I
know what I'm not comfortable doing it.

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,970
Right.
And so in those moments,

9
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:33,240
if it looks like um,
ice cold or not nervous,

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,030
it's because I've done it thousands of
times before.

11
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,350
So what's one more time.
Okay.

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,040
So that leads me to talk about,
and a lot of,

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,620
uh,
this colby toward this year in Asia is

14
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,980
we reiterate the Mamba mentality,
you know?

15
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,940
Can you talk a little bit about what the
Mamba mentality is because that's

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,890
something that's been developing over,
not,

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,050
I don't want to say 20 years.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,620
It's been developing for 35 years since
you were a little kid.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,950
That Mamba mentality because you didn't
start working when you got the damn.

20
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,570
Yeah.
You started working when you were at

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,130
lower merion,
when you were in Italy,

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,290
when you were five.
When you're playing NERF nerf

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,390
basketball.
So talking to house,

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,090
talk about the development of the Mamba
mentality.

25
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,320
Uh,
the pillars,

26
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,180
the five pillars of this Mamba
mentality,

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,990
and then we'll kind of break it down.
Well,

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,150
I mean,
overall,

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,100
you know,
the idea is a very simple one.

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,000
And you know,
the Mamba mentality simply means trying

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,080
to be the best version of yourself.
That's what the mentality means.

32
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,800
It means every day you're trying to
become better.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,950
And it's a constant quest.
It's an infinite quest.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,100
So starting at the age of two,
when I first started playing the game

35
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,040
and on and on and on,
I always ask questions.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,140
Always tried to get better every single
day.

37
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,940
Learn more than you're asking questions
at two.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,940
Oh Dude,
I was time.

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,140
You'd be surprised.
Like some people,

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,360
like my kids at two could do a lot of
things.

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,360
At two.
I could dribble a basketball,

42
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,110
I can shoot a basketball and a nerve.
We got the house and I would go to

43
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,720
practice with my father.
I would observe my father.

44
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,090
Um,
I sit and watch games with him.

45
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,400
Is He your first coach?
Um,

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,761
yeah.
Man,

47
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,070
I guess you could say that,
you know,

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,830
a lot of things I learned by being just
being around the game.

49
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,460
Right.
So by the age of six,

50
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,420
I was already strategizing versus other
six year olds.

51
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,090
You know,
they just six I figured out six year

52
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,590
olds couldn't dribble with their left
hand.

53
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,330
So I said,
okay,

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,790
a lot of a lot of 12 year olds can't
dribble with their [inaudible] would

55
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,570
imagine six.

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,580
So like I was playing in the six year
old kids,

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,220
I would make them dribble with their
left because I knew they couldn't.

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,460
And so the dribble off the rear foot,
I'd pick it up,

59
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,380
lay it up,
do it again,

60
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,750
drove off it,
pick it up later.

61
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,610
So at six years old it had 63 points
and,

62
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,420
and uh,
I remember my,

63
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,700
so your six year old,
six year old self could beat,

64
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,130
you're a 38 year old selfies.
You only scored 16 the last game.

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,701
Yeah,
no,

66
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,680
but I could do it with my left toe.
So that's a problem.

67
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,320
But um,
but yeah,

68
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:52,921
I mean it's,
listen,

69
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,520
I just constantly looked for things to
learn from.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,890
And you know,
very observant.

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,860
When you,
when you talk about this love,

72
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,150
when does it develop what you,
did you like it when you were five or is

73
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,190
it something that kind of gradually not
to,

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,550
it was born.

75
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,790
I was born to play basketball,
you know what I mean?

76
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,060
And I played a lot of different sports.
Um,

77
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,040
but nothing brought me the sense of,
of,

78
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,390
of peace and of escape.
You know,

79
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,450
that the game of basketball,
is it an escape when you get on the

80
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,010
court?
Is that your zen time?

81
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:27,844
You're,
you're,

82
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,990
you're solid two times,
even though it's a team working.

83
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,330
Yeah.
When I need that escape,

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,440
it's there for me.
Right.

85
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,240
When I need a friend,
it's there for me.

86
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,450
You know what?
I need to vent and don't dog in the Mama

87
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,380
comes to stare,
you know?

88
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,960
So yeah,
the game is absolutely everything.

89
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,330
When,
when you,

90
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,810
when we talk about trying to get kids to
be passionate,

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,290
I don't think every kid,
I don't think your situation is the

92
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,270
norm.
Not every kid is,

93
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,700
knows they're passionate too,
and we're fine.

94
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,370
Right.
How do kids find that passion then?

95
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,300
Well,
I,

96
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,440
you know,
I think that's because you,

97
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,120
you embraced it right away.
I think experience,

98
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,610
we try to put them in different things,
try to expose them to as many things as

99
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:10,030
possible and then see if there's one
thing that connects with them,

100
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,530
you know?
Because if it does,

101
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,430
you don't have to tell them to do it,
you know,

102
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,570
whether it's writing or painting or
drawing,

103
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,520
you know,
if they have that passion,

104
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,720
you don't have to tell them they're go
off and do it because it's just fun.

105
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,040
He'd rather do that than anything else.
So,

106
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,260
but as parents,
it's our job to just expose them to as

107
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,770
many things as possible and see which
one they gravitate to the most.

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,200
It's interesting because you,
you talked about kits,

109
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,810
right?
Originally we were talking about you and

110
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,890
now you're talking about your kids and
their passions.

111
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,050
Do you,
do you kind of feel that passion for

112
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,280
them and then say,
hey,

113
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,700
let's go play some basketball or
volleyball or let's go swimming.

114
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,720
We expose them to all kinds of,
I mean,

115
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,320
they play a lot of different sports.
They do a lot of things creatively,

116
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,850
you know,
in writing and things like that and

117
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,450
designing and um,
you just sit back and you just watch

118
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:56,230
which one they moved to and then it's
our responsibility as parents to try to

119
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:58,510
set them up for success as much as we
possibly can.

120
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,320
Do you want them to play basketball?
I want them to find whatever it is that

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,330
they're passionate about.
Like whenever they feel like their

122
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,040
purposes,
then that's what I want them to do.

123
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,020
Do they love basketball then?
My youngest one she does.

124
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,640
She wants to,
she wants to play.

125
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,320
She wants me to teach you how to play
this summer.

126
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,870
And our eldest is really into
volleyball,

127
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,820
so,
and um,

128
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,700
but we'll see.
You know,

129
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,210
passions tend to change.
So you're going to get into volleyball

130
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,500
now?
Well,

131
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,530
yeah.
I mean my sister was a great volleyball

132
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,570
player,
so we have a teacher in a family.

133
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,870
Is there,
is there one moment where you can say it

134
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,200
defined your passion for basketball?
Is there a story or moment when you said

135
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,490
Dan that was,
that was it,

136
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,410
that was like when I felt really
passionate.

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,990
No,
it doesn't,

138
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,510
it never leaves.
You never leaves,

139
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,270
you know,
the game was just a part of me.

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,250
Um,
so it never leaves.

141
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,160
Even now that I'm retired,
you know,

142
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,700
I,
everything that I've learned from the

143
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,890
game of basketball I've carried over
into life,

144
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,380
you know,
like basketball has helped me be a

145
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,560
better person,
a better friend,

146
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:01,510
a better well because there's life
lessons that are within the game,

147
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,430
like communication,
like unselfishness,

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,690
like attention to detail and um,
empathy and compassion.

149
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,570
Like all those things are in the game.
And,

150
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,740
uh,
as an athlete,

151
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,741
if we are aware of those things,
it helps us become better human human

152
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:21,530
beings.
And you can apply that toward your

153
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,710
posts,
posts,

154
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,730
basketball days,
retirement into your business world.

155
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,900
Sure.
Future ventures.

156
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,890
Sure.
I mean you can apply,

157
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,060
you know,
I was applying that,

158
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,240
um,
even while I was playing just in life

159
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,080
outside of the game and even more so now
you know,

160
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:39,260
and building a business and all these
things kind of culture you want to have,

161
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,460
um,
you know,

162
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:45,461
all those things are or directly learn
from the game of basketball.

163
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,410
A next step is the next pillar.
Be Obsessive,

164
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,410
obsessive.
That's I think a,

165
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,120
I think a lot of people equate that with
you.

166
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,030
You know,
colby is obsessive in a lot of things.

167
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,480
We've been doing this for what,
eight years now?

168
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,400
Asia tour,
you know,

169
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,810
I've been with you for a long way.
I,

170
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,660
the one moment that stands out out of,
we've done,

171
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,180
I don't know how many dumb,
we've done 800 events.

172
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,510
The one time was 4:00 AM we went up to
practice at 4:00 AM and that was your

173
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,220
idea to do it.
But you know,

174
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,570
all these Nike people are like,
no,

175
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:19,811
no,
no,

176
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,050
no,
no,

177
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,070
that's not,
that's not do that.

178
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,960
And then you're like,
let's do it at 4:00 AM.

179
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,850
So you've got security,
you've got brand marketing,

180
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:25,720
sports marketing going,
no,

181
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:25,961
no,
no,

182
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:26,201
no,
no,

183
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:26,501
no,
no,

184
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,191
that's not good.
You're like,

185
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:30,940
let's do it because that's your
assessment is right to me.

186
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,340
It just makes complete sense and not to
us.

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,340
Oh boy.
I don't want to like

188
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,670
see we all right.
Usually I'm sleeping at 4:00 AM you're,

189
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,640
you're working out.
So talk about that.

190
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,970
Okay?
So if,

191
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,030
if,
if your job is to try to be the best

192
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,640
basketball player you can be,
to do that,

193
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,930
you have to practice,
you have to train,

194
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,270
right?
You want to train as much as you can,

195
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,230
as often as you can.
So if you get up at 10 in the morning,

196
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,350
train at 11,
right?

197
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,480
12 say 12 and Trina,
12 train for two hours,

198
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,314
12 to,
to,

199
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,180
um,
you have to let your body recover.

200
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
So you eat,
recovered,

201
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,430
whatever.
You get back out,

202
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,430
you train,
start training and at six train from six

203
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,600
to eight,
right?

204
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,640
And now you go home,
shower,

205
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,810
eat dinner,
and you go to bed.

206
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,910
You wake up and do it again,
right?

207
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,280
Those are two sessions right now.
Imagine you wake up at three you train

208
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,460
at four 46 come home,
breakfast,

209
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,091
relaxed.
So,

210
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:27,620
so now you're back at it again,
nine to 11 right,

211
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,090
relax.

212
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,540
And now all of a sudden you're back at
it again.

213
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,090
Two to four and now you're back at it
again,

214
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,650
you know,
seven to nine.

215
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,670
Look how much more training I have done
by simply starting at four.

216
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,880
All right.
And so now you do that and as the years

217
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,390
go on,
the separation that you have with your

218
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,350
competitors and your peers just grows
larger and larger and larger and larger

219
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,660
and larger.
And by year five or six,

220
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,510
it doesn't matter what kind of work
they're doing in summer,

221
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,000
they're never going to catch up cause
they're five years behind.

222
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,150
Right.
So it makes sense to get up and start

223
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,220
your day early because you can get more
work in.

224
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,560
Is that genetic or is that something
you,

225
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,420
you ingrained in trained yourself?
No,

226
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,670
it was just you that for me it was just,
it was just common sense.

227
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,230
Like I can,
I can,

228
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,020
if I start earlier,
I can train more hours and I know the

229
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,720
other guys aren't doing it because I
know what their training schedule is.

230
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,170
Right.
So I know if I do this consistently over

231
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:22,080
time,
it's the gaps just going to widen and

232
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,200
widen and widen and widen and widen and
they won't be able to get that bag.

233
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,510
So it,
to me it was just common sense.

234
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm like thinking,
how can I get an advantage?

235
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,300
Oh,
start earlier.

236
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,260
Yeah,
let's do that.

237
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,130
When did you start doing that?

238
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,700
Man?
High School.

239
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,770
High School.
And we started,

240
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,890
my first class in high school is seven
at seven 45.

241
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,891
I usually get to the gym around 5:00 AM
and I'd played before school and then

242
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,410
school starts and then with you at 5:00
AM my coach and my coach was show up and

243
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,320
we'd do all these basketball drills.
Right.

244
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,120
So just you and your coach?
Just me and my coach.

245
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:57,300
And sometimes it would just be me and
the janitor who's still there today.

246
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,120
And um,
and um,

247
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,860
and then I play at lunchtime.
You get a medal.

248
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I hooked him up with a few things,
but I played during lunch and then

249
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:12,840
practice after and then go home,
do my schoolwork and then watch a bunch

250
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:17,190
of game film and Games on TV and study,
study film.

251
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,470
Was that the only thing you've been
assessed about basketball?

252
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,630
Well,
until recently?

253
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah,
until recently.

254
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,180
Yeah.
Basketball dominated,

255
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,411
you know,
my,

256
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:29,540
uh,
my entire life more than 30 years when,

257
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,270
uh,
when I,

258
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,750
when I brought it up like what are you,
is it genetic or you just learned it?

259
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,000
I mean,
how,

260
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,150
how did that idea even come up?
Because that's obviously a pillar of

261
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,880
Mamba mentality.
The obsessiveness is just like you said,

262
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm going to get up at four,
everybody's get up at six.

263
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,760
If everybody's going to get up at four,
I'm going to get him in too.

264
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,843
Right,
right.

265
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,550
How do you,
how do you develop that or what do you,

266
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,680
what do you learn that from?
Well,

267
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,860
I think it's just,
it's just a matter of what's important

268
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:58,950
to you,
what's important to you for whatever

269
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,350
reason.
You know,

270
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
I felt like,
um,

271
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I didn't feel good about myself.
If I wasn't doing everything I could to

272
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,480
be the best version of myself.

273
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,120
If I felt like I left anything on the
table,

274
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,760
um,
it would eat away at me.

275
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,530
I wouldn't be able to look myself in the
mirror,

276
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,410
right?
So the reason why I can retire now and

277
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,400
be completely comfortable about it
because I know that I've done everything

278
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,470
I could to be the best basketball player
I could be.

279
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,990
Um,
and so that's where it comes from for

280
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,690
me.
You can't leave any stone unturned,

281
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,270
but the important thing to understand is
you can't,

282
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,410
you can't short change yourself.
Like you're,

283
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,100
you're not cheating anybody but
yourself.

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,570
I mean,
you're tired.

285
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:41,520
You're literally this far away from the
line.

286
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,460
Why would you not go that extra to touch
the line?

287
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,440
Right?
So if I let them get away with that,

288
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,500
right?
All of a sudden he starts maybe a cheat,

289
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,770
something over here,
right?

290
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,980
And not give his best over here and I
give his best over.

291
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,620
Then as years go on,
he's going to be extremely,

292
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,440
it's not going to reach his full
potential because he's been taking these

293
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,420
little shortcuts that just add up.
Adam,

294
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,790
Adam,
Adam add up and you can't let that

295
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,530
happen.
Our job as teachers,

296
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,540
as mentors,
as inspires,

297
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,350
it's our responsibility to hold them
accountable to those things.

298
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,220
The funny part is we were were just
talking about this kid,

299
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,900
we in the back and coke.
He's like,

300
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,730
I bet you that kid will never,
ever missed the line again.

301
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,590
You're not going to happen
because of that wasn't no way that

302
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,120
that's you being obsessive,
but teaching obsessiveness because

303
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,440
that's,
that's what you got to be.

304
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,510
Right.
Do you have to be obsessive to get to

305
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,870
that level and everything you do,
details don't waste time.

306
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,680
Do it.
Right.

307
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,740
Perfection.
Yeah.

308
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,210
I mean it's really simple.
It was like whatever you're doing at

309
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,880
that moment is what you're doing at that
moment.

310
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,240
You know?
It's like that's where the obsessiveness

311
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,370
is.
Having the attention to detail for this

312
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,960
action that you are performing at the
time you're performing it.

313
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,850
And if you can have that kind of focus,
you can't help but to have a certain

314
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:00,910
level of obsession or attention to
detail.

315
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,750
Moving on to the third pillar is a to be
realm relentless that we know you for.

316
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,720
You know,
we see you on TV being relentless,

317
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,070
first quarter,
second quarter,

318
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,440
third quarter,
fourth quarter attack,

319
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,520
attack,
attack,

320
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,300
never letting your teammates slack off,
attack,

321
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,134
attack,
attack.

322
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,180
How do you get that?
Talk about what is,

323
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,280
what is the meaning of relentlessness to
you?

324
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,250
Well,
this is to never to be unyielding.

325
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,560
Never give an inch to anything like
you're always going after it.

326
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,330
Always going after all he's going after
it.

327
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,910
And if there's a challenge that ensues,
oh good.

328
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,450
I want to see how I stack up to that.
So you'd go after and go after it and

329
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,284
it's just,
um,

330
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,660
it's fun.
It's like you get a chance to compete

331
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:48,661
against opponents and you get a chance
to see where you stack up against them.

332
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,500
I was like,
I want to see it.

333
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,200
Maybe I'm not good enough today with
that.

334
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,850
That's fine.
I'll be good enough the next time I see

335
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:55,900
you though,
you know,

336
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,470
and you get a chance to always measure
yourself and um,

337
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,960
it's,
it's just fun to do that.

338
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,910
So I guess that's where relentlessness
comes from.

339
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
Is it something that's also learned or
ingrained or is it something you kind of

340
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,430
learned over time?
Um,

341
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,700
because these things that we talk about
in a Mama and tality,

342
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,661
uh,
you know,

343
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,210
for you,
it's second nature.

344
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,990
It's not for a lot of people,
right?

345
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,690
A lot of it is,
is trained or it's not God given know

346
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,753
Aye.
Aye.

347
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,030
I mean,
it as well though,

348
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,000
because I mean,
I had a year of playing,

349
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,600
like when I played basketball in Italy,
I was taller than everybody else and

350
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,580
faster,
um,

351
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,670
like the age of 11,
I came back to America to play

352
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,730
basketball and it was not the same thing
because kids were bigger,

353
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:43,110
stronger.
And so I went through a summer of

354
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,650
playing basketball in America.
Why didn't score one point,

355
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,310
it was one league.
I didn't score one point and it was

356
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,050
devastating.
Um,

357
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,100
but I had to,
no,

358
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,210
I'm not giving up.
It's not what to happen.

359
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,730
So you bounced back and you keep
playing.

360
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:57,350
You keep practicing,
keep practicing.

361
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,080
But I mean it wasn't handed to me.
You didn't score one point,

362
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,000
not one.
I mean not even a free flow.

363
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,670
And you are zero.
You are held 11,

364
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
11.
Well you were playing against 25 year

365
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:06,831
olds.
No,

366
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:09,990
I was playing against 11 grade.
I was playing against.

367
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,630
It's hard to believe why.
I know,

368
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,040
I know.
But I was playing against 11 year olds

369
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,470
and I didn't score one point.
And then what was that?

370
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,590
Did that uh,
it,

371
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,050
it hurt you or you?
Yeah,

372
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,450
it was very embarrassing because,
you know,

373
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,930
my father was a Philadelphia basketball
legend.

374
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,510
My uncle was in Philadelphia,
basketball legend.

375
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,190
And now here I am,
this kid,

376
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,860
like he's really big knee pads and I'm
walking around and I can't score it

377
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,660
anything.
So it was like really embarrassing.

378
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,030
That drove you.
Of course it did.

379
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,250
Of course it didn't.
I vowed to be much,

380
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,440
much better.
So you live for those moments where

381
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,690
you're embarrassed when you're down.
People kick,

382
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,710
you don't let you score.

383
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,450
Those are the moments that drive you.
Well,

384
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,370
I mean those are the moments that occur,
right?

385
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,050
So whatever moments occur,
good,

386
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,860
bad or indifferent,
I can use those moments to propel me

387
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,410
forward,
use those as fuel to,

388
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,910
um,
help me be a better player.

389
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,940
Is there a moment in your Mba career
where you felt like you didn't hit that

390
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,750
mark and that was a huge transition for
you?

391
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,050
Yeah,
I always felt like I missed the marks,

392
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,060
um,
in the league.

393
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,550
Um,
what were some of the down moments for

394
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,040
you in basketball?
Losing to the Celtics in the finance in

395
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,851
2008.
I mean,

396
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,810
that was tough and that hurt me too.
Yeah.

397
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,240
I mean it was,
it was brutal at night in the hotel room

398
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,190
after we lost,
just thinking to myself,

399
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,360
I may never win another championship.
Like I might've just like,

400
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:29,900
this is it.

401
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,260
It's too hard to get back here.
Maybe it's not in the car is to win

402
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:35,960
another one.
And so I go through that night or being

403
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,940
mad.
Then the next morning I wake up and they

404
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,340
start thinking,
Nah,

405
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,920
I gotta fix this.
So where did it go wrong?

406
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,370
Why did we lose or we weren't tough
enough.

407
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,390
Okay.
Weren't tough enough.

408
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,100
Whose responsibility is that to make the
team?

409
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,720
It's mine.
All right.

410
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:54,590
So now I have to start figuring out how
I'm going to lead this team differently

411
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,830
to make sure that when we get to the
finals the next time we were tough and

412
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:01,080
ready for this challenge.
And um,

413
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,950
that's,
that's how you bounce back from those

414
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:07,370
moments.
That was 2008 2008 2008 against the

415
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,720
Celtics.
I mean,

416
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,050
all of Laker nation was hurt because
especially because it was against the

417
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,190
Celtics,
right?

418
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,810
Kid was paint,
Celtics.

419
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,880
He can't lose celtics.
Come on,

420
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,210
God.
Sounds like,

421
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,063
well,
you know,

422
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,750
because also that was there.
That was their like 17th right.

423
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,610
For their,
for their organization.

424
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,050
And only talk about that.
I'll talk about that.

425
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,970
And then you bounced back the next year
against a Orlando,

426
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,020
Orlando or [inaudible] got her revenge
against the Celtics in 2010.

427
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,620
The beating the Celtics feel better than
beating Orlando?

428
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,780
Oh yeah,
yeah,

429
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,010
yes.
Yeah,

430
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,843
yeah.
Oh yeah.

431
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,760
I mean,
I grew up such a lakers fan and so like

432
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,890
the Lakers and Celtics rivalries Hatim
everything hate him.

433
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,740
We can't,
there's just no way I can be on a team

434
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,770
when a Lakers team that loses to the
Celtics twice.

435
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,383
No.

436
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,690
You know,
it's a funny,

437
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,920
in in Asia,
me being here in Asia to a lot of,

438
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,130
a lot of fans are fans of a player and
they,

439
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:10,060
they loved that player and subsequently
late,

440
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,280
they loved that team that,
that player plays for.

441
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,820
But growing up in the states,
if you grew up in Philly,

442
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,770
you are a sixers fan.
Right?

443
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,320
And then if you grew up in La,
you were a lakers fan.

444
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,010
You are also a dodgers fan.
And at the time you are a rams fan.

445
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,020
You are affiliated with your city and
then the city that you hate,

446
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:31,660
it was your arch enemy.
So if you a Laker fan,

447
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,480
you just hate the Celtics and you hate
every team,

448
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,050
every team that loses you root for every
team against the Celtics.

449
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:39,940
No question.
Yeah,

450
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,210
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
You just want to see them do bed.

451
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,130
Yeah,
just do batch.

452
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,940
If you,
if you were a dodger fan,

453
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:47,360
you just want to see the giants lose.
Right.

454
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,010
So it's not necessarily good Karma,
but yeah.

455
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,710
But when you lost to the Celtics,
then you beat him again.

456
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,100
That moment that that's relentless
because you come get them back,

457
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,500
coming back,
coming back and you had to come back and

458
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:02,530
beat the case on their court.
Can't give up and then it was there.

459
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,110
It was that,
was that a big moment for you beating,

460
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,670
beating the Celtics?
It was used,

461
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,813
you know,
because,

462
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,560
you know,
we seen,

463
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,740
I've seen us as a team grow so much from
2008 POW Lamar,

464
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,520
you know,
all our guys,

465
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:20,750
like how much we have grown since the
last time you faced this team.

466
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,100
And uh,
I couldn't be any more proud of them.

467
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,780
You know,
it wasn't even about me.

468
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:30,500
It was about sitting back and watching
us as a group and we just accomplished

469
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,680
this amazing thing.
And uh,

470
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,340
now we can all enjoy it together.
So

471
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,460
moving on to the next pillar is to be
resilient.

472
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,730
Um,
I remember this time last year you came

473
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,870
and,
uh,

474
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,580
we did a premier for a,
a movie you did moves and a big,

475
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,990
a big part of that movie was talking
about your injury and coming back to be

476
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,490
resilient.
Uh,

477
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,830
take us back to that day against a
Phoenix,

478
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:56,440
right.

479
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,550
Your Gear Achilles is golden state.
It was,

480
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,000
it was,
it was hard,

481
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:03,870
man,
because the Achilles injury is the worst

482
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,150
injury for an athlete.
It's like the word.

483
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:10,410
So it's like the kiss of death.
And when I ruptured my Achilles,

484
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,190
I knew what happened.
I knew the severity of the injury and I

485
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:15,720
didn't know if I was going to come back
from it.

486
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,790
Yeah.
In the locker room you were crying.

487
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,490
Yeah.
I mean,

488
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,480
I didn't like this.
Is it like my career could be over right

489
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,950
now.
So how do you get back from that?

490
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,860
Because you know,
when you talk about injuries,

491
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,390
you know,
people spraying their ankles,

492
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,770
dislocate your fingers,
but a Kaylee's yeah.

493
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,070
People don't come back from that.
Well please don't come back from that to

494
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,860
the level they were before.
I mean,

495
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,703
how,
how is,

496
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,560
how do you get that resilience?
How do you fight that?

497
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,320
Well,
what I did is I went home and I was just

498
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:46,950
really angry and I'm angry.
I was angry,

499
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,853
was mad,
I was angry.

500
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,370
I worked so hard for us to get to the
playoffs and to have a chance to win

501
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,960
another championship.
And then this happened.

502
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,070
So I had a lot of anger and a then from
the anger and then I was sad.

503
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,090
And then you start feeling bad for
yourself and then you say,

504
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,913
all right,
okay,

505
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm done being a baby.
Okay,

506
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,650
what am I going to do now?
Because I can't sit here and give up.

507
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,660
That's not an option.
So now what,

508
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,850
how long was the cycle from this anger?
One night.

509
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,300
One night.
One night.

510
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,850
It was because you started writing in
the middle,

511
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,630
right?
You wrote that,

512
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:20,161
uh,
you,

513
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,940
you,
you wrote that and then it was,

514
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,774
okay,
what are you going to do?

515
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:24,971
So it was,
yeah,

516
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,040
it was one night.
Um,

517
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,860
but then,
you know,

518
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,840
then you start,
it's a process.

519
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,850
You look at process,
what am I going to do?

520
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,000
What can I control surgery.
We'll do the surgery,

521
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,800
come out of the surgery,
recover from their physical therapy.

522
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,560
Okay.
Physical therapy piece by piece,

523
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,251
by piece,
by piece,

524
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,560
by piece,
start running back when a court.

525
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,620
And so I broke things down into sections
and said,

526
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,900
okay,
I'm going to focus on resting right now.

527
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,770
This is it.
I'm going to focus on moving my toes and

528
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,040
then walking.
And then you look at every challenge at

529
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:01,300
every step.
And that's how you're able to be

530
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:03,010
resilient and come back from these
things.

531
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,473
Because,
uh,

532
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,710
you know,
for your field in a,

533
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,600
in sports injuries often happen,
right?

534
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,820
And to come back.
But you know,

535
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,680
for,
for most everyday people,

536
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,110
it's,
it's something that they can't fathom

537
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,660
because they don't,
they don't have that type of resilience

538
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,910
resistance that they have to face.
Right.

539
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,280
So how do they,
how do they come back from it?

540
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,120
Because sometimes people fail in their
fields and their jobs or at school,

541
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:28,960
young kids,
you know,

542
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,510
you don't have a good test score,
you don't make the basketball team or

543
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,950
you know,
they have these disappointments.

544
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,320
How do they,
what is your advice to young kids to,

545
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,783
you know,
to,

546
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,620
to face the face,
this adversity.

547
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,950
How do you persevere?
Like if you,

548
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,010
because you,
you have that chemical makeup to fight

549
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,990
through it.
Not all kids do,

550
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,020
but,

551
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,820
but you,
you every kid,

552
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:53,030
every person has the ability to put one
foot in front of the other one step at a

553
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:53,571
time.
Right?

554
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,160
So like if you're saying,
okay,

555
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm going to climb Mount Everest is at
the bottom of the mountain and you look

556
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,830
up and you go in and I'm not going to
climb Mount Everest,

557
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
right?
But if you break it down into sections

558
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,490
and you just one foot in front of the
other one step at a time,

559
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,500
next thing you know you're at the top of
the mountain.

560
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,990
So the the,
the map,

561
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,960
the,
the plan is to set short term goals and

562
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,470
to get there eight to be,

563
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,150
let's see it coming back from my
Achilles.

564
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,170
I came back from the Achilles and I was
fine and then the next year I fractured

565
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,630
my knee.
Right.

566
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,810
Sorry.
Here we go again.

567
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,240
Come back from that next year.
Tear my shoulder.

568
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,490
Here we go again.
Right.

569
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,800
But if I looked at those things in
totality,

570
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,060
it'd be depressing.
But if I look at it as just the facts,

571
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,100
this is,
this is it happened,

572
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,570
can't do anything about it.
It happened.

573
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,040
Now what are you going to do?
One step at a time,

574
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,040
a Keeley's knee,
shoulder.

575
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,800
Any step of the way you said screw it.
Forget it.

576
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,950
Done no more.
No,

577
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,080
never.
No one know your why.

578
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,520
Right?
Because you know,

579
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,830
as time goes on,
I'm sitting there,

580
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,890
I'm 78 years old and I'm going to be
wondering if I could have come back from

581
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,210
this injury.
I don't want to wonder.

582
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,170
I want to find out.
We got to get to that second point.

583
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,331
I want to see you,
man.

584
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:14,600
We want to get to that game.
The critics are out there saying he's

585
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:15,890
done.
He'll never come back.

586
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,750
Well,
maybe you're right.

587
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,940
Maybe you're not,
but let's find out.

588
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,150
We got to get there.
We got to get there.

589
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,210
Last one to be fearless.
You know,

590
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:26,770
that's,
that's something that,

591
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,900
uh,
I think every young adult,

592
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,570
young kids,
they face their fears,

593
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,440
right?
What is,

594
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,150
what does that mean to be,
to be fearless?

595
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:37,180
Why is that such an important part of
the Mamba mentality?

596
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,910
Well,
it makes,

597
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,290
I think the greatest fear that we face
is ourselves.

598
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,300
Actually.
I think it's,

599
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:45,720
um,
it's not anything that's external or

600
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:48,160
anything that's superficial.
I think the greatest fear you face is

601
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:50,070
yourself.
Because you know,

602
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,160
we all have dreams and it's very scary
sometimes to accept the dream that you

603
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:57,600
have and it's secure.
You're still to say,

604
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:59,010
okay,
I want that.

605
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,230
It's scary because you're afraid that if
you put your heart and soul into it and

606
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,480
you fail,
then how are you going to feel about

607
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,830
yourself?
Right?

608
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,860
So being fearless means putting yourself
out there and going forward no matter

609
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,310
what,
go for it.

610
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,360
Not for anybody else,
but for yourself,

611
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,240
when you,
when you,

612
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,950
when you got to the league,
you were 18,

613
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,090
did you have any fears before getting
there or when you got that right away?

614
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,261
Yeah,
I mean,

615
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:28,720
you know,
I had fears that everybody was going to

616
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,910
be right.
I made a poor choice,

617
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,260
poor decision.
I wasn't too,

618
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,390
I wasn't going to amount to anything.
So that was always in the back of my

619
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:40,000
mind for sure.
And then,

620
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,360
so out of these five pillars,
which one do you think comes first?

621
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,680
Be Passionate,
be fearless,

622
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,760
relentless,
resilient or,

623
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,070
or,
or they just come together.

624
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,760
I'll know it's this funny thing is like
we created the separate pillars,

625
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,420
but the reality is it's all one thing,
you know,

626
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,520
cause it all comes from within.
It comes from within us.

627
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:03,190
We all experienced these things at
different stages in different points,

628
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:05,020
different times.
Um,

629
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,470
the key I feel it's just to be aware of
those moments as they occur.

630
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,140
Right?
You're aware of a certain fear or um,

631
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,740
a certain obstacle or challenge,
right?

632
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,500
You're just aware of those things.
And then from there you can navigate

633
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,890
through them.
Um,

634
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,610
but I look at more,
I look at them all as one,

635
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,940
one connecting,
um,

636
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,360
thing because I think pink

637
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,090
being fearless,
this last one sticks out in my mind a

638
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,590
lot because,
uh,

639
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,620
you know,
being an Asia Asian kits,

640
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,230
a lot of times they're little bit more
boxed in,

641
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,850
in,
in thought and mentality as opposed to

642
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,980
western kits,
western kits,

643
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,900
the lot of the family,
the environment.

644
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,150
You know,
ever since a young age in school,

645
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,560
it's,
it's preaching independence.

646
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,360
Speak your thoughts,
be creative,

647
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,530
independent,
you know,

648
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,640
a lot of that,
you know,

649
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:54,361
it's in,
it's in,

650
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,490
it's,
it's also reiterated by teachers,

651
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,870
principals,
um,

652
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,200
mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles
and coaches is to bring name to yourself

653
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,640
and to be independent,
to be out there and go on your own.

654
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,140
But in,
in eastern,

655
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,210
in Asia,
a lot of the cultures,

656
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,010
whether it's Chinese,
Japanese,

657
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:11,850
Korean,
it's,

658
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,490
you know,
don't go out there and do crazy things.

659
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,380
Don't go out of your comfort zone.
Bring,

660
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,600
make your family proud.
You know,

661
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,370
don't,
don't bring other people attention.

662
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,690
Just do your thing.
Do it well,

663
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,670
but don't bring attention.
You know,

664
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:26,760
it's,
and I think a lot of kids are fearful of

665
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:29,400
going out of this box,
right?

666
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,880
Is there a vice for these kids?
Because a lot of times it's a cultural

667
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,730
difference.
Sure.

668
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,070
Right?
You know how,

669
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:35,640
how,
how did,

670
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,140
how did they put themselves out there
when,

671
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,490
listen,
it's very,

672
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:43,200
so you have to dance beautifully in the
box that you are comfortable dancing.

673
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,910
Right?
So like everybody's box is different.

674
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,930
My box was to be extremely ambitious
within the sport of basketball.

675
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,000
You're box,
it's different than mine,

676
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,100
right?
Every kid here has her own box.

677
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,950
But it doesn't mean that your box isn't
as beautiful as mine.

678
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,010
Right?
Everybody has their own.

679
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,540
It's your job to try to perfect it and
make it as beautiful of a canvas as you

680
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,490
can make it.
And if you have done that,

681
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,640
then you have lived a successful life.
You have lived with Mamba mentality.

682
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,630
So it doesn't mean you have to go out
here and do all of these crazy things.

683
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,430
I'll have to be like this person or that
person.

684
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,230
No.
What are you comfortable being?

685
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,630
What it is that,
what is it that you want to do with your

686
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:23,280
life?
And once you have that,

687
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,110
then you're trying to live it to the
best of your ability.

688
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,110
So,
you know,

689
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,800
uh,
growing up in Italy and then moving on

690
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:34,250
to Philadelphia and then to La,
you know,

691
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:35,990
obviously you talk about this box,
right?

692
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,470
So is,
is that box constantly changing?

693
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Are you trying to get out of your
comfort zone even when you were first

694
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:47,960
year of the Mba and then 10th year in
the NBA and then even this year,

695
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,720
there's that box that this metaphorical
box you talk about.

696
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:51,620
Does that change?
No,

697
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,330
I never tried.
I never looked at it as like,

698
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,520
I'm just going to,
you know,

699
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,680
try something completely crazy or like
just,

700
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,340
just go out of my box where thing,
I just looked at it as

701
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,120
I want to be one of the best basketball
players who have ever played.

702
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,060
That's the end goal.
Okay,

703
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,590
how do I get there?
How do I get there?

704
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:15,591
And every decision I made in my life was
centered around the process of helping

705
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,280
me eventually get there.

706
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,270
You know what I'm saying?
So I had that purpose and once I had

707
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,880
that purpose,
every decision that I made was centered.

708
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,040
Yeah.

709
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,400
Around that purpose.
You think you got there looking back

710
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:29,070
upon it now,
two decades of Mba,

711
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,870
you know,
high school,

712
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,490
uh,
Italy to high school in Philadelphia to

713
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:36,630
the Mba.
You spent your whole career with one

714
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:38,070
organization.
To me,

715
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,710
is that your biggest accomplishment?
To be one team.

716
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,260
Thank you.
Um,

717
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,710
you look back upon it now,
when you had your goals as a kid,

718
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,380
you're five years old,
you wanted to be in the NBA and then

719
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,650
when you're at lower Merion and
Philadelphia and those dreams started to

720
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,580
become,
Eh,

721
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm going to get there.
Right,

722
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:56,890
right.
And then you're in the NBA,

723
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,490
you set goals for yourself.
You talk about all the time when you're

724
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,110
young in the NBA,
you set personal achievement goals.

725
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,180
I'm going to win a game and win and win
a championship.

726
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,670
I'm going to win the MVP,
I'm going to win this,

727
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,450
I'm going to win back.

728
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,490
And then later on you changed because
you said,

729
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,710
I'm just going to get better.
And when I,

730
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,470
if I'm going to get a better left hand,
I'm going to have better three point,

731
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,110
I'm going to have a better free throw.
Those other personal achievements come

732
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,020
naturally.
Now you're done played your final game,

733
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,730
60 points.
You dropped it on Utah,

734
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,950
Mamba Out,
right?

735
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,990
Yeah.
You look back upon it now.

736
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,150
Where do you see yourself?
Did you,

737
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,480
did you do everything you wanted to do?
Did you become the best,

738
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,320
best bass player you can ever become?
Did you become the best?

739
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,310
It's weird like the,
my vision of what my goal is changed

740
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:44,260
drastically.
As I got older,

741
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,750
I like as a kid I said I want to be the
best ever.

742
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,840
Right?
And now you go through your life and

743
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,580
everything you do is try to be the best.
How would be the best?

744
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,780
That would be the best ever.
And as you get older you start

745
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:56,620
understanding that those things are very
superficial things and everybody has a

746
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,330
different opinion about it.
No matter what you do,

747
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:01,600
I can win 20 championships.
There's always an opinion on who's the

748
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,160
best.
Everybody has different opinions.

749
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,330
And so I started really kind of
understanding,

750
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,030
maybe that's not the important thing.
Maybe important thing is to know how do

751
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:14,950
we as a team grow,
how do I help my teammates be better?

752
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,150
So that was the first change for me.
And then as I got older,

753
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:22,510
still it became more about,
um,

754
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,350
how are you inspiring others to find
themselves?

755
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,610
That is the ultimate championship.
So won five championships,

756
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:32,620
that's great.
Another team won a championship this

757
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,360
year,
teams going to championship next year.

758
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:38,320
Those things come and they go.
But with stays is how do you use your

759
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:43,321
passion and use that to inspire somebody
else to create their passion and then

760
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,520
how can they pass that on to the next
person?

761
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,760
That is true success.
Um,

762
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,300
so my goals have changed drastically
from the time I was six years old to the

763
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:56,050
time I was 17 at the time I was 25 and
now sitting here at 37.

764
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,450
So now you left the game of basketball.
We're here in Shanghai.

765
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,550
Uh,
we're going to end our talk today

766
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,443
because,
uh,

767
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,750
we've gone a little bit past our limit,
but I think everybody is very happy to

768
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,430
be here.
And I think they learned a lot about the

769
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:11,770
member Mamba mentality,
right?

770
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,180
Um,
what's,

771
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,070
what's next for you?

772
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,870
It's,
it's always teaching the game,

773
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,480
teaching the game through various ways.
You know,

774
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,430
it's,
we do camps and clinics,

775
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:25,250
we do those things and,
but also through storytelling,

776
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,570
right?
How can you,

777
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,130
how can you share stories with the rest
of the world that challenges them to

778
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:35,210
look internally and,
and to learn things like process and

779
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,180
learn how to navigate the sense of self
and all these things.

780
00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:42,980
How can you infuse into entertainment
and in a way that pushes our culture and

781
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,470
our society forward?
You know,

782
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,000
those are the questions that I'm really,
really intrigued by and that's what

783
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,950
we'll focus on.
Ladies and gentlemen.

784
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:50,980
One of the greatest of all time.
Koby Bryant.
