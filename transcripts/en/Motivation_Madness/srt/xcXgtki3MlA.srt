1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,240
If you're hungry,
it's not a deterministic drive fits a

2
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:16,380
some personality that has a goal and
then it has a bunch of action patterns

3
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,480
that are going to work in reference to
that goal.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,430
It has a bunch of perceptions that that
suit that goal and it organizes your

5
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:26,820
emotional responses around that goal.
And so to think about it as a

6
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,540
personality is a much,
it's a much more intelligent way to look

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,030
at it.
One of the thing about skinner's rats,

8
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,830
you know,
skinner could get rats to do almost

9
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,840
everything and he would reward them with
food.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,700
And so he had a simple model but his
rats were starved down to 75% of their

11
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,330
normal body weight.
So not only were they not social

12
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,030
gregarious routes like rats are cause
they were isolated,

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,960
they're genetically altered from wild
routes,

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,200
but they also weren't as complex as a
real route because they were starving.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,210
And so,
but you know,

16
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,610
a starving rat is a pretty good model of
a rat.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,830
And a rat has a pretty good model of a
person.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,880
But are a lot of our models have simple
behavior learning were based on starving

19
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,910
isolated rats.
So anyways,

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,140
how to think about motivation.
We'll think about it from the

21
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,660
hypothalamic perspective.
So we could say one thing that

22
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,130
motivation does is set goals and we
could say that emotions track progress

23
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,850
towards goals and I'm going to use that
Schema even though it's not exactly

24
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,810
right.
So you say,

25
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,420
well motivation determines where you're
going to aim.

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,320
So if you're hungry you're going to name
it something to eat and then that will

27
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,040
organize your perceptions so that you
zero out everything that isn't relevant

28
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,770
to that task,
which is almost everything you

29
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:40,860
concentrate on those few things that are
going to facilitate your movement

30
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,640
forward.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
When you encounter those things that
produces positive emotion,

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,450
as you move through the world towards
your goal and you see that things are

33
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,450
laying themselves out that facilitate
your movement forward,

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,380
those things cause positive emotion and
if you encounter anything that gets in

35
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,900
the way,
then that produces negative emotion and

36
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,470
it can be like threat because you're not
supposed to encounter something that

37
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,870
gets in the way.
It can be anger so that you move it

38
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,250
away.
It can be frustration,

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,840
disappointment,
grief.

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,120
Those would,
if,

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,680
if you had a response that serious to an
obstacle,

42
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,520
it would probably punish the little
motivated frame right out of existence.

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,380
You know,
so you walked downstairs and I dunno,

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,910
they're contracting company has had a
wrecking ball through your kitchen.

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,190
It's like that's going to be
disappointed.

46
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,040
You're not going to keep eating the
peanut butter sandwich and the rubble,

47
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,700
that little frame is going to get
punished out of existence and some new

48
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,500
goal is going to pop up and it's
instead,

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,780
and you know,
one of the things we're going to try to

50
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:38,010
sort out is how do you decide when
you've encountered an obstacle that's so

51
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,410
big that you should just quit and go do
something else?

52
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,870
Because that's not obvious.
You know,

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,970
and you can,
you can get into counterproductive

54
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,620
persistence pretty easily.
So we don't know how people solve that

55
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,060
problem.
It's a really complicated one.

56
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,250
So anyways,
we're going to work on that scenario.

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,170
Your hypothalamus pops up.
Micro goals that are directly relevant

58
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,140
to biological now produces a frame of
reference.

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,410
So it's not a goal.
It's not a drive and it's not a

60
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,800
collection of behaviors.
It's a little personality and the

61
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:12,010
personality has a viewpoint.
It has thoughts that go along with it.

62
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,430
It has perceptions,
it has action tendencies,

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,910
all of that.
You can see this in addiction most

64
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,780
particularly.
So one of the things that you find often

65
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,910
with people who are alcoholic is they
lie all the time.

66
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,010
And that's because when they're,
they built a little alcohol dependent

67
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,470
personality inside of themselves or a
big one,

68
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,960
it might,
maybe it's 90% of their personality.

69
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,830
And one of that,
one of the things that compose consists

70
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,270
of is all the rationalizations that
they've used over the years to justify

71
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,490
their addiction to themselves and to
other people.

72
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,570
And so the addiction has a personality,
you know,

73
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:52,690
and so when the person is off,
maybe they are addicted to meth or

74
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,910
something like that where we know the
addiction is more,

75
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,990
it's,
it's more short term powerful than I

76
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,490
would say,
than an alcohol addiction.

77
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,550
They'll say anything.
And the,

78
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,384
the,
the,

79
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,550
the words are just tools used to get
towards the goal.

80
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,530
And if they happen to be deceptive,
whatever,

81
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,840
it doesn't matter.
They're just practical tools to get

82
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,690
towards the goal.
And then when you get towards the goal

83
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,760
and you take a nice shot of math or
something like that,

84
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,260
you reinforce all those rationales that
you use to get the drug and then the

85
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,630
next time you're even a better deceiver
and liar.

86
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,951
So,
okay,

87
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,070
so we're going to say motivations,
one way of thinking about as they set

88
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,900
goals,
but it's not the right way of thinking

89
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,030
about it.
They produce a whole framework of

90
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,370
interpretation.
And so we're going to think about that

91
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,730
framework of interpretation and then
emotions emerging side of that.

92
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,120
So that's a,
so the world is framed.

93
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,200
Motivations,
set goals.

94
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,910
You could say the world has to be
framed.

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,700
So motivation sets that frame,
crews,

96
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,600
goals,
emotions,

97
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,480
perceptions and actions and inactions
track progress.

98
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:54,250
So positive emotion says you're moving
forward properly towards your goal.

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,740
And if you encounter something you don't
expect,

100
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,510
you stop.
That's anxiety.

101
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,350
It's like,
oh,

102
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,140
we're not where we thought we were.
And so we don't know what to do.

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,620
So we should stop because we don't know
where we are,

104
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,460
what we're doing.
Stop frozen.

105
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,680
And then the more powerful negative
emotions like pain they might make you

106
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,514
get out of there.

107
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,790
So emotions forward,
stop,

108
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,550
reverse.
That's your emotions within that

109
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,550
motivated frame.
So,

110
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,520
and that's another example of how your
mind is embedded in your body.

111
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,540
Your emotions are like their,
their offshoots of action tendencies.

112
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,100
That's,
that's the right way to think about it.

113
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,440
Cause action has everything
fundamentally.

114
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,460
So what are some basic motivations?
Uh,

115
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,010
most of these are regulated by the
hypothalamus by the way.

116
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,690
And that,
that tells you just how important the

117
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,090
control system it is.
The other thing that's useful to know

118
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,210
about the hypothalamus is that it has
projections going up from it that are

119
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:50,650
like tree trunks and inhibitory
projections coming down there.

120
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,190
They're like grape vines.
So you can kind of control your

121
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:56,410
hypothalamus as long as it's not on too
much.

122
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:00,380
But if on in any serious way it's like
it,

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,970
it winds.
So partly what you do to stop yourself

124
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,600
from falling under the dominion of your
hypothalamus is to never ever be

125
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,960
anywhere where it's action is necessary,
right?

126
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,100
You don't want to go into a biker bar
because you might find yourself in a

127
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,370
situation where panicked.
Defensive aggression is immediately

128
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,770
necessary.
You probably don't want that.

129
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,080
You don't want the panic,
you don't want the terror,

130
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,020
you don't want the frenzied fight,
you don't want any of that.

131
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,360
You don't want to have to run away in
absolute panic.

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,510
So you just don't go there.
And then a huge,

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,520
a huge part of how we regulate our
emotions is just by never going anywhere

134
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:41,060
where we have to experience them.
And so that has very little to do with

135
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,990
internal inhibitory control and
everything to do with staying where you

136
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,730
belong.
So,

137
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,600
okay,
so basic motivations,

138
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,351
hunger,
thirst,

139
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,360
pain,
pain is not regulated by the

140
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,890
hypothalamus.
That's a different circuit.

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,480
Anger slash aggression,
thermoregulation panic and escape,

142
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,360
affiliation and care,
sexual desire,

143
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:05,840
exploration play.
And you can kind of break those in.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,200
You can kind of break those into the
classic Darwinian categories too and

145
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,230
say,
well there's a set of motivations that

146
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:17,220
go along with self maintenance.
That'd be your survival ingestive and

147
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:20,970
defensive.
See I've sort of coded them there.

148
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,050
So the,
the self maintenance,

149
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,930
there's an adjustive set of basic
motivations that go with self

150
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,480
maintenance.
You'd say that's hunger thirst,

151
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,570
there's a set of defensive motivations,
pain,

152
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,010
anger,
thermal regulation,

153
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,260
paddock and escape.
And then there's,

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,050
there's motivations that are associated
with reproduction,

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
affiliation care and sexual desire.
And then I put exploration in play sort

156
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,160
of outside of that.
Uh,

157
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,410
well I would say because those two
things serve both of these approximately

158
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:55,200
equally.
When I went to Harvard,

159
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,070
I came from the Gill and I had spent a
lot of time with my advisor there and,

160
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,780
and a research team that he had trying
to understand the genesis of antisocial

161
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,260
behavior and

162
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,810
among adolescents mostly so well as kids
as well.

163
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,810
Anti social behavior is very persistent.
So if you have a child whose conduct

164
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:23,160
disordered at the age of four,
the probability that they will be

165
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,790
criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is
extremely high.

166
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,690
It's unbelievably stable.
It's a very dismal literature because

167
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,990
you see these early onset aggressive
kids and and it's persistent and then

168
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:41,130
you look at the intervention literature
and you throw up your hands because no

169
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,960
interventions work.
And believe me,

170
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:46,590
psychologists have tried everything you
could possibly imagine and a bunch of

171
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,320
things that you can't in order to
ameliorate that.

172
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,440
So we are really interested in trying to
understand,

173
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:56,100
for example,
if you're antisocial by age of four,

174
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,100
then there isn't an intervention that
seems to be effective.

175
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,080
So,
and the,

176
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,190
the standard peanut logical theory is
really quite horrifying in this regard

177
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:09,000
because what you see is that male
aggression peaks around the age of 15

178
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,710
and then it declines fairly
precipitously and,

179
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,430
and,
and sort of re normalizes again by the

180
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:18,930
age of 27 and standard peanut logical
theory essentially is this cold hearted.

181
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,200
It's like if you have a multi,
if you have someone who's a multiple

182
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,700
offender,
you just throw him in prison til they're

183
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:28,410
27 and then the age out of it.
And that's all there is to it.

184
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,330
That's,
that's what we've got.

185
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,520
Now.
There's some downside to that because

186
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,490
there's a corollary literature that
suggests that the worst thing that you

187
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,010
can do with antisocial people is to
group them together,

188
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,580
which is what we do in prisons.
So that's a whole mess.

189
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,370
Anyways,
one of the things we were doing was

190
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,060
trying to see if there might be
cognitive predictors of antisocial

191
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,610
behavior.
And so we use this battery of

192
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,150
neuropsychological tests that was put
together at the Montreal neurological

193
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:57,030
institute.
Took about 11 hours to administer and

194
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,680
hypothetically assess prefrontal
cortical function and we computerized

195
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,870
out and reduced it to about 90 minutes
and then,

196
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,650
um,
assessed antisocial adolescents in,

197
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,540
in Montreal and found out that they did
show deficits in,

198
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,770
in problem solving ability that we were
associated with,

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,630
uh,
with prefrontal ability.

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,930
Um,
when I got to Harvard,

201
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:19,411
I thought,
well,

202
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,400
that's interesting.
We could use the neuro psych battery to

203
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,900
predict negative behavior.
Perhaps we could use it to predict

204
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,580
positive behavior.
So I thought,

205
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,800
well,
what if we turn the neuro psych battery

206
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,320
and over and thought,
well,

207
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,630
can we predict grades for example?
Cause you know,

208
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,780
that's a decent thing to predict.
So we ran a study,

209
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,780
we ran a study that looked at Harvard
kids,

210
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:47,520
University of Toronto kids,
line workers at a Milwaukee factory and

211
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,920
managers and executives at the same
factory.

212
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:54,921
And what we found was that the average
score across these neuropsychological

213
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,180
tests,
they were kind of like games.

214
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,440
They were game like,
you know.

215
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,110
So in one,
in one test you had,

216
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,460
there were five lights in the middle of
the screen and a box was associated with

217
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,710
each light and you had to learn by trial
and error,

218
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,110
which box was associated with,
with each light.

219
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,340
That was one of the tests.
Um,

220
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,990
so we took people's average score across
the tests because they seem to clump

221
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,630
together into a single structure.
You can do it,

222
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,040
you can find that out.
Statistically,

223
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,220
if you take a bunch of tests,
you can find out how they clump together

224
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,650
statistically by looking at their
patterns of correlations.

225
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:31,860
And you might get multiple clumps,
which is what happens with personality

226
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,950
research where you get five or you might
get a singular clump,

227
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,380
which is what happens in cognitive
research.

228
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,030
And we got a single clump essentially.
And then we were trying to figure out if

229
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,770
at the same time I was reading the
literature on performance prediction and

230
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,260
there's an extensive literature on
performance prediction.

231
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,060
A lot of it generated by the armed
forces,

232
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,410
by the way,
um,

233
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,110
indicating Iq is a very good predictor
of longterm life success.

234
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,470
And so here's the,
here's the general rule.

235
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,290
If your job is simple,
which means you do the same thing every

236
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,980
day,
then Iq predicts how fast you'll learn

237
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,960
the job,
but not how well you you do it.

238
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,010
But if your job is complex,
which means that the demands change on

239
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,710
an ongoing basis,
then the best predictor of success is

240
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,990
general cognitive ability.
And,

241
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,810
uh,
and I learned that the general cognitive

242
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,570
ability tests clump together into a
single factor that's fluid intelligence

243
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:24,490
or,
or Iq.

244
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,140
And then we didn't know if the factor
that we had found was the same factor as

245
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,080
Iq and it,
and we still haven't really figured out

246
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:34,750
whether or not that was the case because
it kind of depends on how you do the

247
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,000
analysis.
But anyway,

248
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:39,970
so I got deeply into the performance
prediction literature and I found out,

249
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,530
well,
if you want it to predict people's

250
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,730
performance in life,
there's,

251
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,500
there's a couple of things you need to
know.

252
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,360
You need to know their general cognitive
ability.

253
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,900
If they're going to do a complex job,
you need to know their trait

254
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,870
conscientiousness.
Some of you might've heard that

255
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,410
rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act
by the way,

256
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,010
because it's a good predictor of
longterm life success,

257
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,510
freedom from negative emotion.
Low neuroticism is another predictor,

258
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:08,650
but it's sort of third on the hierarchy.
And then openness to experience,

259
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,810
which is a personality trait,
is associated with,

260
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,940
with expertise in creative domains.
The evidence that now I should tell you

261
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,840
it's such a complicated question.
I should tell you how to make an Iq test

262
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,020
because they're actually really easy.
And you need to know this to actually

263
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,880
understand what Iq is.
So imagine that you generated a a set of

264
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,110
10,000 questions.
Okay?

265
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,920
About anything.
It could be math problems,

266
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:35,110
they could be general knowledge,
they could be vocabulary,

267
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:36,160
they could be multiple choice.

268
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,800
It really doesn't matter what they're
about as long as they require

269
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:42,640
abstraction to solve.
So they'd be formulated linguistically,

270
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,140
but mathematically would also apply.
And then you have those 10,000

271
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:50,050
questions.
Now you take a random set of a hundred

272
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:54,520
of those questions and you give them to
a thousand people and all you do is sum

273
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:57,670
up the answers right from.
So some people are going to get most of

274
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,950
them right and some of some of them are
going to get most of them wrong.

275
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,650
You just rank ordered the people in
terms of their score,

276
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,570
correct that for age and you have Iq.
That's all there is to it.

277
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,860
And what you'll find is that no matter
which random set of 100 questions you

278
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,740
take,
the people at the top of one random set

279
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,650
will be at the top of all the others.
And,

280
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,400
and with very,
very,

281
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,750
very high consistency.

282
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,960
So one thing you need to know is that if
any social science claims whatsoever are

283
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:30,331
correct,
then the Iq claims are correct because

284
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:35,260
the Iq claims are more psychometrically
rigorous than any other phenomena

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,200
phenomenon that's been discovered by
social scientists.

286
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,020
Now the ICU literature is a dismal
literature.

287
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,030
No one likes it.
Here's why.

288
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:45,190
Here's an example.
So here's our little,

289
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,200
here's a fun little fact for you,
for Liberals and conservatives alike,

290
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,200
because conservatives think there's a
job for everyone.

291
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,770
If people just get off their asses and
get to work and liberals think while you

292
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,630
can train anyone to do anything,
it's like,

293
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,870
no,
there isn't a job for everyone and no,

294
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,960
you can't train everyone to do
everything that's wrong.

295
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,420
And here's one of the consequences of
that.

296
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,870
So as I mentioned,
the Armed Forces has done a lot of work

297
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:13,310
on Iq and they started back in 1919 and
the reason they did that was because,

298
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,020
well,
for obvious reasons,

299
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:20,021
say let's say there's a war and you want
to get qualified people into the officer

300
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,940
positions as rapidly as possible or
you'll lose.

301
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,610
So that's a reason.
Now,

302
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:30,611
the armed forces has experimented with
Iq tests since 1919 and in the last 20

303
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,900
years I'm a law was passed as a
consequence of that analysis,

304
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,650
which was that it was illegal to induct
anyone into the armed forces who had an

305
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:44,000
Iq of less than 83 now,
the question is why?

306
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,860
And the answer was all of that effort
put in by the armed forces indicated

307
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,130
that if you had an Iq of 83 or less,
there wasn't anything that you could be

308
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:55,340
trained to do in the military that
wasn't positively counterproductive.

309
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,840
Now you gotta think about that a,
because the military is chronically

310
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,910
desperate for people,
right?

311
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,700
There's not like they're,
it's not like people are lining up to be

312
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:05,990
inducted,
right?

313
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,330
They have to go out and recruit.
And it's not easy.

314
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,810
And so they're desperate to get their
hands on every body they can possibly

315
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,644
manage.

316
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,780
And then,
especially in wartime,

317
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:17,330
but also in peacetime.
But then there was another reason too,

318
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,030
which was the armed forces,
was also set up from a policy

319
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:23,390
perspective to take people in the
underclass,

320
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,850
let's say,
and train them and moved them up at

321
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,030
least into the working class or maybe
the middleclass.

322
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,640
So there's a policy element to it too.
And so even from that perspective,

323
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:34,790
you could see that the military is
desperate to bring people in.

324
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,600
But with an Iq of 83 or less,
it's not happening.

325
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,900
Okay,
so how many people have an Iq of 83 or

326
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,734
less?

327
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,690
10%

328
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,320
now,
if that doesn't,

329
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,900
if that doesn't hurt you to hear,
then you didn't hear it properly.

330
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,180
Because what it implies is that in a
complex society like ours and one that's

331
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:04,590
becoming increasingly complex,
there isn't anything for 10% of the

332
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,620
population to do.
All right,

333
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:08,401
well,
what are we going to do?

334
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,250
We're going to ignore that.
We're going to run away from that.

335
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,530
And believe me,
we have every reason to,

336
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,700
or we going to contend with the fact
that we need to figure out how it is,

337
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,920
how it is,
how it might be possible to find a place

338
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:27,090
for people on the lower end of the
general cognitive distribution to take

339
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:30,540
their productive and worthwhile place in
society.

340
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,680
And that isn't just going to be a matter
of dumping money down the hierarchy

341
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:38,340
because giving people who have nothing
to do money isn't helpful.

342
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,100
It doesn't work.
It's not that simple.

343
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,730
Well,
so that's kind of an answer to the

344
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,810
question of whether or not we should
deal with the,

345
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,110
with Iq forthrightly.
It's like

346
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,490
if you can find a flaw in that logic,
like just go right ahead.

347
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:57,180
It's not like I was thrilled to death to
discover all of this by knows by no

348
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,400
stretch of the imagination was that the
case.

349
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,490
So,
so what?

350
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:06,660
So Iq is reliable and valid.
That's the first thing.

351
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:10,830
It's more reliable and valid than any
other psychometric test ever designed by

352
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:14,310
social scientists by a factor of about
three.

353
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,350
That's fact number one.
Fact number two is it predicts longterm

354
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:24,351
life outcome at about 0.3 0.4 which
leaves about 85% 70 to 85% of the story

355
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,190
unexplained.
But it's still the best thing that we

356
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,540
have.
Well,

357
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,270
it's also the case that in places like
Great Britain,

358
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,410
when Iq tests were first introduced,
they were actually used by the

359
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:42,411
socialists and they were used to
identify poor people who had potential

360
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,490
cognitive potential and to move them
into higher into institutes of higher

361
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:48,324
education.

362
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,160
So there's an upside,
you know,

363
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,360
social upside as well.
This is something you can't say anything

364
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:57,660
about without,
without immediately being killed.

365
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,970
So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,
but I'll tell you one thing that I did

366
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,950
in the last week that's relevant to
this.

367
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,980
So the,
and this just shows you how complex the

368
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,330
problem is.
First of all,

369
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:12,720
we should point out that race is a very
difficult thing to define because racial

370
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,760
boundaries aren't tight,
right?

371
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,100
So,
and so when you talk about racial

372
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,430
differences in Iq,
you,

373
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,120
you're faced with a thorny problem of
defining race.

374
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,520
And that's a big problem from a
scientific perspective.

375
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:27,870
But we'll leave that aside.
And I wrote an article this week.

376
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,730
Somebody stood up at one point,
one of my talks and vice,

377
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,920
bless their hearts,
took this particular question and used

378
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:41,430
it as an indication of the quality of
the people who are my so called

379
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,030
followers.

380
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,760
And by the way,
the quality of my so called followers is

381
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,450
pretty damn high.
And you can find that out quite rapidly

382
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,400
just by going looking at the youtube
comments,

383
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:54,450
which are head and shoulders above what
the standard set of youtube comments.

384
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:58,120
I can tell you that.
So someone asked me that,

385
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,150
both the Jewish question,
right?

386
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,520
And the,
the implication,

387
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,310
it was actually someone Jewish and the
implication was that,

388
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,460
um,
Jews are overrepresented in positions of

389
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:11,060
authority and power.
And,

390
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,240
and I was,
had just spoken for like an hour and a

391
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,340
half and you know,
this guy had an ax to grind.

392
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,590
And I thought,
there's No God damn way I'm getting into

393
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,380
this at the moment.
And so I,

394
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,070
I said,
I said,

395
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:26,160
I can't answer that question,
but that's not a very good answer.

396
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,350
So I wrote a blog post this week and I
said,

397
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,130
look,
here's the,

398
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,270
here's the situation.

399
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,320
All right,
Jews are overrepresented in positions of

400
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:37,530
power and authority,
but then let's open our eyes a little

401
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:38,160
bit,
hey,

402
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,380
and think for like two or three seconds
and think,

403
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,363
hey,
guess what?

404
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,210
They're also overrepresented in
positions of competence and it's not

405
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,580
like we have more geniuses.
We know what to do with,

406
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,100
and if the Jews happened to be producing
more of them,

407
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,450
which they are,
by the way,

408
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,090
then that's a pretty good thing for the
rest of us.

409
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,090
So let's not confuse competence with
power and authority,

410
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,620
even though that's a favorite trick of
the radical leftists who always failed

411
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:03,490
to make that distinction.
Well,

412
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,700
why does this overrepresentation occur?
Because it does it also.

413
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,160
There's also overrepresentation in
political movements,

414
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,950
including radical political movements.
Okay?

415
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,850
Why?
Well,

416
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:19,240
answer one Jewish conspiracy.
Okay,

417
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,640
that's not a very good answer.
We've had,

418
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,500
we've used that answer before.

419
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,713
All right,
but,

420
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,740
but do we have an alternative?
Well,

421
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,540
here's an alternative.
The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere

422
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:36,220
between one 10 in one 15 which is about
one standard deviation above the

423
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:39,010
population average.
And so what that means is that the

424
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,130
average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has
an Iq that's higher than 85% of the

425
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:49,420
population.
That's a lot higher.

426
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,400
Now,
that doesn't make that much difference

427
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,800
in the middle of the distribution,
okay?

428
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,800
But genius is don't exist at the middle
of the distribution.

429
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,410
They exist at the tails of the
distribution.

430
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,650
And you don't need much of a move at the
mean to produce walloping differences at

431
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,720
the tails.
And the tails are important because a

432
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:11,920
lot of where we draw,
we draw exceptional people from the

433
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,690
exceptions,
right?

434
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,850
So here's an example.
Here's another example of the same

435
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:19,060
thing.
Most engineers are male.

436
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,930
Why?
Because men are more interested in

437
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:25,750
things and women are more interested in
people.

438
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,940
And he might say,
well that's socio cultural.

439
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:29,050
It's like,
no,

440
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,890
it's not.
And we know that because if you stack up

441
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:36,850
countries by their,
by their egalitarian social policies,

442
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,060
which you can do quite effectively.
And then you look at the

443
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,300
overrepresentation of men in stem
fields,

444
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,520
the overrepresentation increases as the
countries become more egalitarian.

445
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,210
So it's not socio cultural,
okay?

446
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,410
Now men aren't that much more interested
in things than women.

447
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:59,140
It's one standard deviation,
which is about the same difference,

448
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:01,330
by the way,
between the population norm and the

449
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,970
Ashkenazi Jews.
But if you're looking at the person who

450
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,500
the one person in 20 or the one person
in 50 who's most,

451
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,390
who's hyper interested in things,
and that's likely to become an engineer,

452
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,290
then most of them are men.
Here's another example of the same

453
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,140
thing.
Men are more aggressive than women.

454
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Now you might ask how much and answered
that as best place to look at that as in

455
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,170
Sweden,
where the egalitarian policies of be

456
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,030
laid out for a long period of time.

457
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,520
And you can,
you can get a more direct inference

458
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,730
about biology.
If you took a random man and around in

459
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:41,320
woman out of the population and you had
to bet on who was more aggressive and

460
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:44,050
you bet on the man,
you'd be right 60% of the time.

461
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,830
So that's not that much,
right?

462
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:48,200
It's,
it's deviates from 50 50 but it's not

463
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:52,940
like 90 10 it's 60 40 okay,
so,

464
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,890
so what does that mean?
Well,

465
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,630
we got a tail problem here.
Again,

466
00:23:56,631 --> 00:24:00,410
let's say that now you decide to go out
onto the extremes of aggression and you

467
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:04,460
identify the most aggressive one in 100
persons.

468
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,630
They're all men.
Guess who's in prison?

469
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,250
Those people,
that's why most of the people in prison

470
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,060
are men.
And so this is elementary part of the

471
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:20,630
problem in our society is that we don't
understand statistics.

472
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,410
We don't understand that you can have
relatively small differences at the

473
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,120
population level that produce walloping
consequences at the tails of the

474
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:29,954
distribution.

475
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,930
Okay,
so back died.

476
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:36,500
Q
one final thing to say about Iq.

477
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,050
The ethnic differences are difficult to
dispense with.

478
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,890
It's not easy to make them go away.
You can say,

479
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,230
well,
the tests aren't culture fair.

480
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,390
Well here's a test of that.
So imagine you,

481
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,780
you test group a with an Iq test and you
test group B with an Iq test and then

482
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,300
you look at their actual performance in
whatever you're predicting.

483
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,780
If the test was biased against ethnic
group A,

484
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,720
then it would under predict their
performance.

485
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,780
And that doesn't happen.
Now you could say,

486
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,850
well,
there's systemic bias in the performance

487
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:14,720
measures and the potential measures,
and that's a possibility.

488
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,890
All right?
Now one other thing about that,

489
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,130
there's a real danger in the ethnicity
Iq debate and the,

490
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,360
the danger is that we confuse
intelligence with value or that we

491
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:34,160
include,
we we confuse intelligence with yet with

492
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:34,970
human value.

493
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,560
That's a better way of thinking about
it.

494
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,060
And one of the things that we're going
to have to understand here is that

495
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,090
that's a mistake,
is that being more intelligent doesn't

496
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:47,090
make you a better person.
That's not the case.

497
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:50,450
It makes me you more useful for complex
cognitive operations,

498
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:55,220
but you can be pretty damn horrific as a
genius son of a bitch,

499
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,050
right?
It's morally neutral.

500
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:59,180
And we also know that from the
psychometric data,

501
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,380
by the way,
there doesn't seem to be any

502
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:02,930
relationship whatsoever between
intelligence and virtue.

503
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,500
And so if it does turn out that nature
and the fates do not align with our

504
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,780
eagle attarian presuppositions,
which is highly probable,

505
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,900
we shouldn't therefore make the mistake
of assuming that if group A or person a

506
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,810
is lower on one of these attributes than
group B or person b,

507
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,590
that that is somehow reflective of their
intrinsic value as human beings.

508
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,060
That's a big mistake.
