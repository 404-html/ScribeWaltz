1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,560
If you ask a disagreeable person what,
what he wants say or she wants,

2
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,060
they'll tell you right away.
They know.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,590
It's like,
this is what I want and this is how I'm

4
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,660
going to get it.
But agreeable people,

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,840
especially if they're really agreeable,
are so agreeable that they often don't

6
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:23,740
even know what they want because there
are so accustomed to living for other

7
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,950
people and to finding out what other
people weren't and to trying to make

8
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:30,250
them comfortable and so forth,
that it's harder for them to find a

9
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,340
sense of their own desires as they move
through life.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,790
And that's not,
not,

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,900
there's situations where that's
advantageous,

12
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:40,960
but it's certainly not advantageous if
you're going to try to,

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,290
uh,
forge yourself a career at just doesn't

14
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,590
work at all.
And so even though on average men and

15
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,420
women don't,
this don't,

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,380
aren't that much different in terms of
their levels of agreeableness by the

17
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:53,650
group.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,090
If you go out and you look at the
extremes,

19
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:58,240
they're very different.
So all of the most agreeable people are

20
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,970
women and all of the most disagreeable
people are men.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,750
And the thing is the extremes are often
what matter rather than what's in the

22
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,810
middle.
And so one of the ways that's reflected

23
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,140
in,
in society by the way,

24
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:13,141
is there's way more men in prison and
the best personality predictor of being

25
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,670
imprisoned is to be low in
agreeableness.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,370
It makes you callous.
Now you may think,

27
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,110
well,
what's the opposite of compassion and

28
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:23,590
politeness?
And the answer to that is I think it's

29
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,070
best sort of conceptualized as a,
as a trading game.

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,310
So let's say that we're going to play
repeated trading games and if you're a

31
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,530
very agreeable,
then you're going to bargain harder on

32
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,330
my behalf,
then you're going to bargain on your own

33
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,164
behalf.

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,480
Whereas if you're very disagreeable,
you're going to do the reverse.

35
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:44,090
You're going to think,
I mean this trading game for me and you

36
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,720
are going to take care of your own
interests where an agreeable person is

37
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,554
going to say no,
no.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,870
At best,
this is at worst,

39
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,230
this has to be 50 50 but I'd like to
help you every way I can.

40
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,160
One of the things you have to be careful
of if you're agreeable is not to be

41
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,160
exploited because you'll line up to be
exploited.

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,730
And I think the reason for that is
because you're wired to be exploited by

43
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:07,630
infants.
And so that just doesn't work so well in

44
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,670
that actual world.
And one of the things,

45
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,010
one of the things that happens very
often in psychotherapy,

46
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,540
you know,
people come to psychotherapy for

47
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,180
multiple reasons,
but one of them is they often come

48
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:19,470
because they're too agreeable.
And so what they get is so-called

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,270
assertiveness training.
Although it's not exactly assertiveness

50
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:25,030
that's being trained.
What it is is the ability to learn how

51
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:28,570
to negotiate on your own behalf.
And one of the things I tell agreeable

52
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:29,840
people,
especially if they're conscientious

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,683
conscientiousness,

54
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,830
say what you think,
tell the truth about what you think

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,460
there's going to be things you think
that you think are nasty and harsh and

56
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:42,510
they probably are nasty and harsh,
but they're also probably true.

57
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,780
And you need to bring those up to the
forefront and deliver the message.

58
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,800
And it's not straightforward at all
because agreeable people do not like

59
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,900
conflict.
Not at all.

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,510
They smoothed the water.
You know when you can see,

61
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,990
you can see why that is in accordance
with the hypothesis that I've been

62
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:00,820
putting forward.
You don't want conflict around infants.

63
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,850
It's too damn dangerous.
You don't want fights to break out.

64
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,570
You don't want anything to disturb the
the relative peace,

65
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,820
you know?
And if you're also more prone to being

66
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,650
hurt physically and perhaps emotionally,
you're also may be loath to engage in

67
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,280
the kind of high intensity conflict that
will solve problems in the short term

68
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,850
because a lot of conflict,
it takes a lot of conflict to solve

69
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,510
problems in the short term and you know
if that can spiral up to where it's

70
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,890
dangerous,
which it can,

71
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:31,060
if it gets uncontrolled,
it might be safer in the short term to

72
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,260
keep the waters smooth and to not delve
into those situations where conflict

73
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:35,860
emerges.

74
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,800
The problem with that is it's not a very
good medium to longterm strategy,

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,890
right?
Cause lots,

76
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,930
lots of times there are things you have
to talk about because they're not going

77
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,870
to go away.
And the advantage to having a well

78
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,770
socialized disagreeable person is that
they really don't let much get in their

79
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,470
way.
So if you can get a kid who's

80
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:56,710
disagreeable socialized,
that person can be quite quite the

81
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,461
creature,
you know,

82
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,460
because they're very,
they're very forward moving in their

83
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:04,600
nature and very difficult to stop.
But if you don't get them successfully

84
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,610
domesticated,
tamed,

85
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,020
roughly speaking by the time they're for
their peers,

86
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,740
reject them.
And that's a big problem because your

87
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,000
job as a parent is to make your child
socially desirable by the age of four.

88
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,240
Like you've got to you,
you want to burn that into your brain

89
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,090
because people don't know that that's
your job.

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,360
And here's,
here's why it's easy if you think about

91
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,030
it carefully.
So you imagine you've got to,

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,700
you've got a three year old child,
so it's sort of halfway through that

93
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,270
initial period of socialization and you
take that child out in public,

94
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,000
okay,
what do you want for the Child?

95
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,670
Who Cares about you?
What do you want from the Chubb for the

96
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,070
Child?
You want the child to be able to

97
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:50,020
interact with other children and adults
so that the children are welcoming and

98
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,270
smile and wanting to play with him or
her,

99
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,560
and so the adults are happy to see the
child and treat him or her properly.

100
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,680
And if your child's a horrible little
monster because you're afraid of

101
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,080
disciplining them or you don't know how
to do that properly,

102
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,860
then what they're going to do is they're
going to experience nothing but

103
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:10,810
rejection from other children and false
smiles from other parents and adults and

104
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,720
that's so then you're throwing the child
out there into a world where every

105
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,640
single face that they see is either
hostile or lying and that's not

106
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,250
something that's going to be
particularly conducive to the mental

107
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,990
health or the wellbeing of your child.

108
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,230
If your child can learn a couple simple
rules of behavior,

109
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,100
like don't interrupt adults when they're
talking too much and pay attention and

110
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,160
try not to hit the other kids over the
head with the truck anymore than is

111
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:37,270
absolutely necessary then and you know,
and share and play properly.

112
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,570
Then when they meet other kids,
the kids are going to try out a few

113
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,640
little play routines on them and that's
going to go well,

114
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,790
and then they're going to go off and
socialize each other for the rest of

115
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,930
their lives because that's what happens
is that from four years old onwards,

116
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,160
the primary socialization with children
takes place among other children,

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,830
and so if the kids don't get in on that
early,

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,250
they don't move into that developmental
spiral upwards and they're left behind.

119
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,150
And you can imagine how terrible that is
because a four year old will not play

120
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:10,151
with another four year old who's too,
but a five year old certainly will not

121
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:12,530
play with a five year old who's too
right,

122
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,230
because the gap is just starting to get
unbelievably large.

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,610
And so the kids start out behind and
then the peers leave them behind,

124
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,600
and then those kids are alienated and
outside the Peer Group for the rest of

125
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,330
their life.
Those are the ones that grow up to be

126
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,250
longterm antisocial,
right?

127
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,040
They're already aggressive.
It doesn't dip down.

128
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,220
Now what happens to normal boys,
roughly speaking?

129
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,370
Imagine that aggressive two-year-old
types,

130
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,370
they get socialized.
So their level of aggression goes down

131
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,060
and then they hit puberty and
testosterone kicks in and Bay levels of

132
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,270
aggression go back up.
And so that's why males are criminals

133
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,720
between the ages roughly of 16 in about
25 so,

134
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,790
and it matches the creativity curve,
by the way.

135
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,210
It's so cool if you look at the spike of
creativity among men,

136
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:00,890
16 to 25 and it starts to go down,
criminality matches that absolutely

137
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,660
perfectly.
So that's quite cool.

138
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,420
So,
and part of it,

139
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,960
so the testosterone levels raise raise
the average level of aggression among

140
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,380
men.

141
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,740
It's more dominance than aggression
actually in testosterone is by no means

142
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,140
all bad.
And then it starts to decrease at about

143
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:20,090
age 25 or 26 which is usually would men
stop staying up late at night,

144
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,800
stop drinking as much,
develop a full time career and take on

145
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,940
the burdens and responsibilities and
opportunities that are associated with a

146
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,910
long term partner and family.
And so while,

147
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,160
so that's,
that's the development of,

148
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,500
of,
of I would,

149
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,330
I would,
I would call predatory aggression

150
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:42,110
because I also think that the,
the agreeableness distribution is

151
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:46,430
probably something like predatory
aggression versus maternal sympathy.

152
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,250
It's something like that.
So if you look at other,

153
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
if you look at other mammals that are,
that are predators,

154
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,870
cause we're predators as well as prey
animals.

155
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,220
If you look at other animals like bears,
the male bear has absolutely nothing to

156
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,570
do with the raising of the infants.

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,620
In fact,
the female bears,

158
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,010
we'll keep the mail the hell away
because he's likely to kill the infants

159
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,170
and maybe even to eat them.
So there's no matter analogy at all in

160
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,430
solitary,
male mammalian predators,

161
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,060
it's really useful to investigate the
viewpoints of people who have opposing

162
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,150
views to yours because they'll tell you
things,

163
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,310
not only will they tell you things you
don't know,

164
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,910
they'll also tell you how to see the
world in ways that you don't see it.

165
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,320
And they'll also have skills that you
don't have that you could develop.

166
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,611
So,
for example,

167
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,850
if you're an introverted person,
it's very useful to watch an extroverted

168
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:38,090
person because the extroverted person
has ways of being in the social world

169
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,270
that aren't natural to you,
that you can use this to improve your

170
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,250
toolkit.
And if you're disagreeable,

171
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,560
one of the best things to do with
disagreeable people,

172
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,170
especially if that's alienating them
from other people,

173
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,580
for example,
because it can,

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,890
you know,
people treat you like you're a selfish,

175
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,900
arrogant son of a,
maybe that's because you are,

176
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,651
it's like,
okay,

177
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:55,740
so what do do about that?

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
One of the,
one of the most promising treatments,

179
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,920
let's say for that is get the person to
do something for someone else once a

180
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,560
day,
just as a practice and learn how to do

181
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,660
it.
Maybe you can wait the circuit up,

182
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,550
you know,
if you think that it's lying dormant in

183
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,930
you,
which is probably right.

184
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,300
You know,
I think we have a very wide range of

185
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:19,680
propensities within us.
Some are switched on genetic propensity,

186
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,230
some are switched on.
But I think that if you put yourself in

187
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,960
the right situation or walk yourself
through the right exercises,

188
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,060
you can switch some of these other
things on as well.

189
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,030
But it takes work and dedication and
discipline.

190
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,240
I would say generally speaking,
if you want to adapt yourself properly

191
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,010
to light,
you should find that niche in the

192
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,960
environment that corresponds with your
temperament,

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,870
right?
You shouldn't work at cross purposes to

194
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,940
your temperament because it's just too
damn difficult.

195
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,980
But having done that,
then you should work on developing the

196
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,810
skills and viewpoints that exist in the
space opposite to your personality

197
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,260
because that's where you're
fundamentally under developed.

198
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,440
And that way I think you could extend
out your temperamental capability across

199
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,380
a wider range.
And to me that's roughly equivalent,

200
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,960
has bringing a Richard tool kit to each
situation,

201
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,330
you know?
So if you're hyper extroverted,

202
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:09,510
you should probably learn to shut up at
parties now and then and listen just to

203
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,610
see what's going on,
to see if you can manage it.

204
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,200
You know?
And if you're introverted,

205
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,100
well then you should learn how to speak
in public and to end to learn how to go

206
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,400
to parties without hiding in the corner
and saying nothing to anyone,

207
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,900
you know.
And if you're agreeable,

208
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,540
then you need to learn how to be
disagreeable so people can't push you

209
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,230
around.

210
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,730
And if you're disagreeable,
you learn.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,630
You need to learn how to be agreeable so
that you're not an evil son of a book.

212
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,550
So,
and the same thing applies even in the

213
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,490
conscientious domain.
It's like if you're too conscientious,

214
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,390
you need to learn to relax and let go a
little bit.

215
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,420
And if you're unconscientious it's time.
Like get out the Google calendar man and

216
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,320
start scheduling your day,
right?

217
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,990
And beat yourself on the back of the
head with a stick until you're

218
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:51,780
disciplined enough so that you can
actually stick to something for some

219
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,720
length of time.
And not living in absolute squalor,

220
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,120
which is something that would
characterize someone who's very

221
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,490
disorderly for example,
cause they just,

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,430
they don't notice it doesn't bother
them.

223
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,610
Disorder.
It's like maybe they can see it,

224
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,890
but it doesn't have any emotional
valence.

225
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,170
And so it doesn't have any motivational
significance,

226
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,770
you know?

227
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,320
So the other thing you might want to
think about too,

228
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:17,430
if you're choosing a partner is try not
to choose someone who's too distant from

229
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,820
you on the temperamental variables
because you're going to have a hard time

230
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,500
bridging the gap.
You know,

231
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,670
it's hard for an introverted person and
an extroverted person to coexist and

232
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:30,090
it's really hard for an orderly person
and a disorderly person to coexist

233
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:33,450
because they will drive each other nuts.
Why don't you pick up?

234
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,350
Why are you so obsessed by it?
That's the basic argument,

235
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,203
you know,
so,

236
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,850
so it's useful to know about your
temperament so that you can negotiate

237
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,650
the space with your partner at a wet as
well.

238
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,130
And I don't think you should try to find
someone who is exactly the same as you

239
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,210
because then you don't have the benefits
of the alternative viewpoint,

240
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,060
but you got to watch it because you may
hit Eric concealable differences of

241
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,100
various sorts.
And I've seen that most,

242
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:01,480
particularly among couples who are high
and low and openness,

243
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,270
that's a rough one.
And also high and low in

244
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,370
conscientiousness.
That's another rough one because they

245
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:10,720
just cannot see how the other person
sees the world at all.
