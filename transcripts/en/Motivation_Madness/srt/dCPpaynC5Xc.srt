1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,230
Flesh but have the power to destroy
strongholds.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
God did not design to be in bondage to
anything,

3
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,660
to anyone,
to any southern states.

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,930
You were made in the image and a
creator,

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,430
and that creator is wholeness.
Completeness,

6
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,620
Great Ness.
The only place you can find true freedom

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
is in the presence of the Almighty.
Today I'm going to give you seven steps

8
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:53,210
to your breakthrough.
Steps are universal.

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,610
You can apply to any area of your life.
Step one

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,200
course
that means you got to get along

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,110
with
every time you get alone with God,

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,140
you give birth to something.
See breakthroughs about persistent.

13
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,190
You got to do whatever it takes to put
yourself in a position to hear God.

14
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,890
God has a crimp to power that your enemy
cannot withstand when in order for you

15
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:29,780
to access it,
you've got to come into his presence

16
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
implementing
in effective ways for your situation now

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,650
by your religion.

18
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,620
Retail,
always buy it wholesale.

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,820
Go to the original sauce,
the truth,

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,140
the place where it hasn't been diluted
hasn't been polluted.

21
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,680
Go to the sauce.
I'm not talking to you about theory

22
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,400
right now.
What I'm telling you was the moment I

23
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:03,080
started getting alone every single day
with God is the moment my life started

24
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,120
to change.
Now I'm going to close this step out

25
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:09,260
with scripture so you understand what
I'm telling you is rooted in the word

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,610
more.
At 1:35 says very early in the morning

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,670
while it was still dark,
Jesus got up

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,350
and went off to a solitary place where
he prayed spiritual intimacy window and

29
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,150
impregnates us with the paddle and
needed to get barb to his plane.

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,190
Step number two,
detox and emotionally

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,960
that this is rooted in Ephesians four,
30 1:32.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,620
It says,
get rid of all bitterness,

33
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,010
rage and anger,
brawling and slander,

34
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,930
along with every form of malice.
Be kind to capacity to one another,

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,760
forgiving each other just as in Christ.
God forgave you.

36
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,180
For Kevin,
this is dialysis one I'm telling you to

37
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:07,090
do with the stem is to examine your
spiritual calls in for traces of the

38
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,170
enemy.
You have to make room for success.

39
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,940
You have to make room for your
breakthrough in your spirit,

40
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:18,230
which will cause you are full of
resentment and anger,

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,970
bitterness or jealousy.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,530
There's no room for success.
There's no room for peace.

43
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,620
Your future is too important to let it
be held hostage by the past.

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,750
Let it go.
Now,

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,010
when I say forgiveness,
I don't mean that you have to agree with

46
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:44,011
the wrong done to you.
It just declares that you refuse to be

47
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,990
held in bondage by it.
Any

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,010
your future is worth it.

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,743
Oh,
worked it,

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,430
but that's the goal.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Some of the things that had been done to
you might be so deeply rooted in you

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,460
that you can't let go of it on your own.
Now you remember it.

53
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:06,830
Let's.
Let's look back to that first step that

54
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:10,460
I told you earlier about getting in the
presence of God daily,

55
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:15,461
getting alone with God daily,
and you come into his presence and you

56
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,900
laid this bitterness and this anger and
resentment and all the hurts and roles

57
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,200
that have been done to you.
When you come into his presence,

58
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,200
can you lay that stuff on the altar and
say,

59
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,400
Lord,
here it is.

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
Help me get rid of this stuff.
Tell me,

61
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,270
get rid of anything in the way of your
plan for my life,

62
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,340
but I can hear those chains
falling off where you embrace your

63
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,710
freedom,
your freedom.

64
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:47,711
You are not a slave in
the breakthrough where we all life

65
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,350
freedom,
trust God with your past.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,800
Give it to him.
Absolute surrender restores absolutely.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Step three for your breakthrough.
You've got to create a powerful vision

68
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,910
for your vickery and your mind.
You've got to be able to see what's your

69
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:11,420
breakthrough.
Looks like vision as the

70
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,880
greenness breakthroughs must be first.

71
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,950
You can't go someplace
where there is no vision.

72
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,600
The people perish.
Imagination is the womb that will get

73
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:34,070
better to your future.
They walk through life without a vision

74
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,360
in a constant state of confusion and God
is not in the confusion.

75
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,830
Think outside the box by moving your
mind into the realm of unlimited

76
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,460
possibilities,
but then the construction right now,

77
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
creating your mind today that you want
to live in tomorrow to find and in great

78
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,290
detail,
paypal,

79
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,290
what you watch your victory look like,
so you gotta keep your eyes on the prize

80
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,180
and you're fishing in front of you.
It's critical and biblical.

81
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,550
That's your right and down.
Habakkuk two,

82
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,170
two says,
write the vision.

83
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,230
Make it plain so they he didn't read and
can run with it.

84
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,770
Write it down.
Step forward to your breakthrough.

85
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Adopt the mindset of the unstoppable
discipline.

86
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,930
Mine rooted in the truth is the
chiropractor other mind,

87
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,560
every situation,
every trial and tribulation has the

88
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,870
mindset required to overcome it.

89
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,390
Thinking if the stain alone enough will
eventually bring peace and order any

90
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,860
situation.
Now,

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,870
let's go to the word we demolish
arguments and every brick tension that

92
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:57,911
sets itself up against the knowledge of
God and we take captive every thought to

93
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,880
make it obedient to Christ.
To change our behavior,

94
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,500
we must address the thinking that
produces it.

95
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,910
Stop attacking the fruit and get down to
the root.

96
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,700
The word says,
be not conformed to this world,

97
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,690
but be transformed by the renewing of
your mind.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,380
Show me your thinking and I will show
you your tomorrow.

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Adopt the mindset of a.
It starts right between ears.

100
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,360
The battlefield is over the mind and
you've got to win that every single day

101
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,210
you get on day in and day out.
You can't take a day off.

102
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,020
Your breakthrough must be possessed in
your mind.

103
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,810
Did it there and you have it in a
physical stamp.

104
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,810
Five to clear the breakthrough.
Your mouth is a creative device designed

105
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:54,341
to call for the food of trump says death
and life on the power to tone.

106
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,520
Those in love is the fruits.
There are some big life,

107
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,810
big factory.
Make the breakthrough.

108
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,820
The words you speak aloud will prove
allegiance to the God you serve.

109
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,880
You either serve in God,
have faith on a condom down the kind of

110
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,470
boldness and courage
and asked for me and my house.

111
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:23,480
We will serve the Lord.
Declared a breakthrough in your mouth,

112
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,230
mirrors they interstate of your
relationship with God.

113
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,830
Do you believe?
If a person who didn't know you

114
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,460
overheard your conversation,
would they know that you saw?

115
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,440
Would they think that that God you
started has limits on it all takes a

116
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,000
call for things that be not as though
they were the victory.

117
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,000
Step number six,
master the art of blindness.

118
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Bagging doesn't move God.
Faith is the only language spoken in

119
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,850
destiny is obligated by universal love
to concede to the demand of

120
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,080
master.
The Art of blindness.

121
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Doubt is the play.
Naysayers around you must be quarantined

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
when you're going through trials and
tribulations,

123
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,260
nothing but warriors and soldiers around
you.

124
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,410
You've got to get all those people that
doubt out of your life and your family.

125
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,410
There's people in your family speaking
death,

126
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:39,610
though when you got to shut them down,
you got to shut down.

127
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:44,611
All the enemy still has the power and
ability to gain access to the mouth of a

128
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:50,750
righteous person.
The enemy will use anyone around you to

129
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:55,751
sow seeds of defeats over your life.
Just like I spoke to you about the last

130
00:09:56,121 --> 00:10:00,290
step about declaring the blessing.
The enemy uses the same principle in

131
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,840
reverse.
He's got to declare and the curse over

132
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,590
you,
and if it can get you to do it,

133
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,920
he will find someone around you to do
it.

134
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,920
So let's go to the war and all things
whatsoever you ask in prayer,

135
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,020
believing you sound real.
Faith is never subject to circumstances.

136
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,150
It's unconditional.
It has nothing to do with your physical

137
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:25,340
senses.
What you saying what to hear,

138
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,240
what you taste,
what you smell,

139
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,610
how you feel.
None of that.

140
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,500
Faith is more than words.
It's an unconditional activity,

141
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,600
a continuous accident over refusing to
accept what's current circumstances.

142
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,710
I believe in the promise.
I believe in one God says nothing.

143
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Nothing can make me believe otherwise.
Stop focusing on your problems and stay

144
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:53,230
focused on the two.
Oh,

145
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,160
things
will not change your circumstances.

146
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Faith will step towards.
Faith is a step towards power.

147
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,910
The more you move from making decisions
based on your feelings to data,

148
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
true faith,
God's power you will have access to when

149
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:19,050
expectations and dreams collide,
they explore.

150
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,630
Wouldn't matter if a station is the
oxygen that breathes life into your

151
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:24,950
dreams.
I'm gonna.

152
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,820
Leave you with one last thing here on
this step is not the length of the

153
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,600
prayer that gives it power,
is the faith behind.

154
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,630
Keep it simple,
ask once and never stopped believing.

155
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,340
The final step.
Number seven,

156
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,440
plug into the power
changes.

157
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Every thing it touches.
God is love and whatever is not love.

158
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:51,830
It's not of God.

159
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,010
Infinite vibration that reaches to the
core of everything in existence.

160
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,660
It is by far the most powerful thing in
the universe.

161
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,920
Oh,
miracles originated from it.

162
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Powers of nature,
bound to it.

163
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh,
success isn't breakthroughs.

164
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,490
Hinge on it.
We overcome not my force.

165
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,620
Mike's Money,
knowledge,

166
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,880
talents we are not because of what we
do,

167
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,620
but because God loves us.
What Jesus did,

168
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,660
my Sauna Cross empowers us by grace to
break through the barriers.

169
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,830
You are God's ambassador owner when a
single agenda and that's to love.

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,450
The more fluent you are in this
universal language,

171
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,880
the greater your circle of influence.
Wellbeing is more than just emotional.

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,400
It's spiritual ballet act and express it
of this positive energy creates on

173
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,300
occurred in the world and you can
transform anything in your life by

174
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:10,140
plugging into this frequency,
a plow.

175
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,310
When you in here to the law of love,
you are sending consciousness to the

176
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:19,540
maximum level of awareness through the
eyes of love.

177
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,540
You will not only be able to see,
but to truly understand being firmly

178
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:29,440
rooted in his power allows you to
approach life from a place of strength,

179
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,400
but consistently projecting this divine
energy.

180
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,150
Your shits and outcomes become
limitless.

181
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,460
Love is a superhighway.
No the travel on and are destined to

182
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:46,360
impact the world.
It is the master key that grants access

183
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
to the spare room of all creation.
To love is the highest display of

184
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,650
wisdom,
the highest form of trust,

185
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,210
and the highest form of worship.
Shift from a state of needing love,

186
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,980
bleeding,
love,

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,820
never in a room with Alex.
never go a day without it released this

188
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,000
catalyst of change I to every
environment you infiltrate.

189
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,170
Instead of wishing for a miracle,
the miracle,

190
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,840
incorporating the gift of love to every
aspect of your life will make you a

191
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,710
difference maker,
your miracle

192
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,120
and the needs of those around you.
The only way to access it is by love.

193
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,490
Love thy neighbor as thyself,
so whatever miracle,

194
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:40,501
whatever breakthrough you need,
find somebody who needs that same thing

195
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,740
that junee and pray for them,
and they received their breakthrough

196
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,260
secret to the breakthrough resides in
this first show,

197
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,520
40 to 10,
and the Lord turned the captivity of job

198
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,730
when he prayed for his friends.
The Lord gave job twice as much as he

199
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:06,371
had before praying for others.
It's a catalyst for massive change.

200
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,330
Go get your breakthrough.

201
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,180
I'm Billy Brooks.
Blessed that unstoppable.

202
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,020
The first step to success is to get your
mind right.

203
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,410
The second step is to get your mouth
right.

204
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,280
The words
are a direct reflection of the beliefs

205
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:40,840
that you have internalized.
I could spend two minutes with you in

206
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:45,841
conversation and by the words and the
faith that I feel behind those words,

207
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,480
I can tell you exactly what you're going
in.

208
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:54,481
Life Word set outcomes in motion.
God has given us the power to create

209
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:58,630
with our mouse.
When you are going through the trial,

210
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,490
the challenge,
the struggle,

211
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:07,270
whatever it is you're facing,
your mind,

212
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,170
your faith and your mouth are your
weapons.

213
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,530
Success has to be spoken into existence
by either moving you closer

214
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,390
or further away.
I'm going to tell you the secret.

215
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,240
When you learn to tame your tongue,
you take control of your destiny.

216
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:36,241
You'll get behind the steering wheel.
When your mouth matches your man which

217
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,690
aligns with your faith,
nothing can stop you.

218
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,680
That's what I'm talking about when I say
blessed and unstoppable.

219
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,940
It's so faith your mind and your words
walking in agreement together.

220
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,720
Y'All mail carries full command of the
room around you.

221
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,590
You have the ability to bless,
curse.

222
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,360
He'll destroy every time you order
something out of your mouth.

223
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,410
Acknowledging this transformative power
is essential to building a life of

224
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,901
success rate through in the mind.
What is your mouth that initiates the

225
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,330
change?
In order to seize possession of the

226
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:19,480
victory,
you have to do that with words so shall

227
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,700
my word be that going forth out of my
mouth.

228
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,500
It shall not return unto me void,
but it still accomplish that which I

229
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,730
please and it shall prosper in the thing
were two half sentence.

230
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,580
Now it's time to declare the blessing.
Every sale,

231
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,320
muscle,
tissue,

232
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,750
ligament,
bone system in my body.

233
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,000
It's bullshit into perfection which God
intended a function I call forth healing

234
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,360
complete rest of the race today and I
will heal then I won't say it the Lord.

235
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,590
My body radiates greatness.
No sickness.

236
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,650
What had dominion over me.
I think like a champion.

237
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,570
I speak like a champion,
a champion,

238
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,640
and when I sit down at the table,
the Food I put in my body helps make me

239
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,620
a better chip.
My body is holding.

240
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,730
My body is the temple of the spirit,
was sad to my body and I will treat my

241
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,590
body with respect every ounce of my
being,

242
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,770
with my message.
I feel I radiate greatness,

243
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,750
not speak over my finances.
Money comes to me easily,

244
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,000
frequently in abundantly.
God's perfect way with no burden added

245
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,660
to it.
Money,

246
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,730
money does that on me.
I own it.

247
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,090
It serves me the head and not the tail.
Above,

248
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,250
not below.
I will lend to many nations and not

249
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,250
borrow.
I am a millionaire,

250
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,550
right?
I said,

251
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,830
I'm a millionaire.
Scarcity,

252
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,190
have no place in the life of a Christian
as explaining his crop,

253
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,200
harvested grain in the planet,
for the Lord blessed him and as well.

254
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,190
Continue to borrow.
Money is coming to me,

255
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:12,380
pressed down,
shaken together and running over to

256
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,080
overflowing with
every dollar,

257
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:19,680
with grace and for the betterment of the
kingdom.

258
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,350
I speak over my relationships now.
The right mentors,

259
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,630
coaches,
us,

260
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,490
people who have knowledge that I need
to,

261
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,280
my God and Colin are now coming into my
life.

262
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,100
My marriage is one of unity,
of love.

263
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,760
What a pass one,
a friendship.

264
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,630
We are united together as one under the
one true God.

265
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,240
I speak life over my wife.
Love,

266
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,850
happiness.
Encouragement is for racing,

267
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,220
uplifting everyone I speak.
No sickness has any dominion over the

268
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,830
has no place in her life.
She is prosperous,

269
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,040
successful
in the name of Jesus.

270
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,010
The devil has no place in my home,
my house.

271
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:20,011
We will serve the Lord United as one.
I refuse to give the devil a foothold in

272
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:25,591
my life because no corrupt communication
proceed out of my mouth fee.

273
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,560
It has no dominion over me,
but the Lord did not give me a spirit of

274
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:34,160
fear,
but of power and of love and of sound

275
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,450
mind.
I believe champions don't run from fear.

276
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,150
They attack it.
I'm not in chains.

277
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,770
I'm not in.
I'm not a slave danny anything,

278
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,120
but he who the son sets free is free
indeed,

279
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,400
and I am free.
Alcohol,

280
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,150
drugs last three,
bitterness or jealousy,

281
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,780
unforgiveness,
eating disorders,

282
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,810
panic attacks,
ptsd,

283
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,690
cancer,
heart attacks,

284
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
strokes.
None of these things have dominion over

285
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,034
me.

286
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,400
I got goals,
dreams,

287
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,510
and a vision so big,
so massive that it scares me if I say my

288
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,780
intentions.
If I want to collate my destiny out loud

289
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:40,781
with people around that will be a high
probability that they would attempt to

290
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:45,440
have me Baker acted on grounds,
that I'm delusional,

291
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,820
that I'm crazy,
that I've lost all sense of reality.

292
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,190
I know don't have the talent,
the ability,

293
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,900
the education,
the natural gifts,

294
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,400
the background,
the connect seems to image the financial

295
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:09,401
resources to bring my massive ambitions
to fruition,

296
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,910
the truth,
right on the edge of foolishness at the

297
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:20,200
intersection between genius and
insanity.

298
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,490
I know I'm not qualified,
experienced,

299
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,520
nor clip with the things required to
exceed this level of greatness that

300
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,590
I am bold in this one area
is faith.

301
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I believe not in my own efforts,
in that on the one who is mighty and old

302
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,590
things me,
that his grace is sufficient.

303
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,180
I don't hope that God still moves.
I know he does.

304
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,190
Therefore,
I pick up my five stones for my

305
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,850
slingshot and I fear not the modern take
Elias,

306
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,960
the diocese.
It gives me the walls of Jericho and the

307
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:09,850
armies and riches come.
Today's pharaohs.

308
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I locked my eyes on the prize and
without any doubt or hesitation or

309
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,560
anxiety,
I'm pressed for waving the banner of the

310
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:24,561
one true God and I slayed it.
Enemies who whispered doubt and fear in

311
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:27,870
my ears.
For years,

312
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,770
that same spirit and many claim died off
at the end of the book of acts has

313
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:38,871
landed on coachable fire deep on the
inside of me to do what the world keeps

314
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:43,120
on saying it's impossible.
My purpose

315
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,580
bring a claim to the God who
still lives in

316
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,890
Florence,
Alabama,

317
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,410
the son of a modern fandom game minute
DNA process,

318
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,480
wanting me
to the creative.

319
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,130
Now my tail walks with him.
Unleash the power that flows

320
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,560
unrestricted,
unrestrained.

321
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,480
God still moves.
I speak life,

322
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,010
hope and strength through this
microphone to every wounded soul,

323
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,940
broken heart,
the sick Delaine,

324
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,010
the hurting,
the scan,

325
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,840
the fearful,
the last,

326
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,420
the damaged,
the broken.

327
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,130
I am here to tell you,
God still moves.

328
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,720
Oh,
things are possible and I dreamed so big

329
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,050
that it takes the limits off of God so
that he can glorify himself through me.

330
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,630
I average no body.
I surrender and submit every ounce of my

331
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:05,900
being so that he can use me to inspire
you.

332
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,030
I speak not for likes.
I speak not for subscribers.

333
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,150
I speak not for ad revenue,
no fame accolades or personal validation

334
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,540
grind,
and I come to mountain of success to

335
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:28,541
bring the one true God of Abraham Glory
and I only pursue my simon fearlessly

336
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,740
attacking the unknown
as the day for me.

337
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,710
I attack going on.
I burned a long time ago.

338
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:48,890
I only know 1:20
with the type of grind it perseverance

339
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,450
it takes to change the world.
I exemplify the light radiate,

340
00:25:56,061 --> 00:26:01,061
champion and I execute with precision.
The daily actions required to penetrate

341
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:06,020
the walls and stand against me with a
shout of praise.

342
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Those walls are no match for me,
for God has promised me anonymous and

343
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:15,740
will deliver me from all the enemies to
stand in the way of greatness.

344
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,010
Now.
God has no keep a persons

345
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,390
what he did for me.
He will do the same for you.

346
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,610
Seize this crisis the same yesterday,
today and forever.

347
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,330
Those miracles to read about it in the
word in the olden days,

348
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,220
they weren't isolated for just one small
time period.

349
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,890
They are valid today and anybody could
faith anybody but trust can see it and

350
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,860
can experience those same type of
miracle.

351
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,230
Now
you're on the phone to

352
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,390
turn this off because I'm here to tell
you,

353
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Steve and you hearing this is no mistake
and it's no coincidence.

354
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,740
God is trying to reach you through this
video,

355
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,240
this video for entertainment.
See

356
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
struggling with panic attacks and ptsd
and it's been goes like this that got me

357
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,220
to take this seriously and know where
you're at right now.

358
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,120
When you're listening to me,
just believe

359
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,310
God still moves.
I'm Billy Brooks,

360
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,130
blessed and unstoppable to God.
Be The glory.

361
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,550
When you are anchored in grace,
rooted in purpose,

362
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,650
simply pursuing your colon,
you are blessed and unstoppable.

363
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,630
I am bold because I know I'm in my
colon.

364
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,300
I know the anointing is behind me.
Nothing could stop me.

365
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,260
Arise,
champion.

366
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,450
No weapon formed against me shall
prosper.

367
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,800
My colon is to speak life over the
future champions.

368
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,380
To be successful,
you must seize and conquer every moment,

369
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,390
every opportunity that presents itself
grabbing with both hands and

370
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,260
tomorrow's not promised,
so you don't know if they're going to

371
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:47,261
get a second chance at this.
So you got to squeeze every ounce of

372
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:53,021
victory out of every single moment.
God gives you a path for the moments you

373
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,790
got to become a workout more.
You know,

374
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,870
time is down.
You've got a choice either let the day

375
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:05,340
on you or you own it.
See,

376
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,370
the world has told you a lie.
You'll think success is left.

377
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,450
Somebody else has to put you on.
You got to have all these connections to

378
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:20,780
go where you want to go,
but I'm here to set the truth straight.

379
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,380
You determine your outcome,
what to do every day,

380
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,660
no work ethic.
Pledge your allegiance to the failure or

381
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,710
success or determine where you go.
Stop waiting for other people to put you

382
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:37,490
on that,
but so self,

383
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,720
oh,
stop making excuses.

384
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,100
Justice.
Stop observing life and start checking

385
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:48,934
it.

386
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,770
When you are a good in grace,
rooted in purpose,

387
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,510
aggressively pursuing your calling,
you are blessed and unstoppable is

388
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:09,070
nothing that makes me sick and then
seeing somebody wastes their gift.

389
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,930
Now I'm not trying to hurt your
feelings,

390
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,020
but sometimes I got to get up in your
face with the truth.

391
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,970
See,
denial will continue to hold you hostage

392
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,230
until you take responsibility for your
actions.

393
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Ignoring the facts were not approved or
circumstances is the practice of the

394
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,230
mind thinking,
sustain long enough will produce success

395
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,930
because I am telling you is straight out
of the word,

396
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,950
to not be conformed to this world,
but be transformed by the renewing of

397
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,860
your mind that by testing you made a
song,

398
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,270
what is the will of God and what is good
and acceptable and perfect.

399
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,200
The word always confirms this,
so I'm going to give you another one.

400
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Casting down imaginations and every high
thing that exalts itself against the

401
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:16,051
knowledge of God and bringing into
captivity every thought to the obedience

402
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,840
of Christ.
That's the mindset of a champion.

403
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,740
That's my message.
God still moves the message to not give

404
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:31,180
up on your dream.
Your best days are ahead of you.

405
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,300
There's a lot of you out there listening
to me right now that a war years you

You.
Ain't getting grace rooted in purpose.

409
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,670
