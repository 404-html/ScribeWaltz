1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,590
What do you say to those of you that
don't pursue their dreams are locked

2
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:17,591
into their careers because they are too
afraid to take risks and pursue

3
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:18,790
something meaningful?
Well,

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,810
the first thing I would say is,
well,

5
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:24,050
you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks
and pursuing something meaningful,

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,500
but you should be more afraid of staying
where you are.

7
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,410
If it's making you miserable,
it's like the first thing you want to do

8
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,950
is dispense with the idea that you get
to have any,

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,570
any permanent security outside of your
ability to contend and adapt.

10
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,500
It's the same issue with children.
It's like you're paying a price by

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,300
sitting there being miserable.
You might say,

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,300
well,
the devil I know is better than the one

13
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,210
I don't.
It's like,

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,200
don't be so sure of that.
The clock is ticking and if you're

15
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:54,260
miserable in your job now and you change
nothing in five years,

16
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,870
you'll be much more miserable and you'll
be a lot older,

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,720
but there's in the luxury to pursue what
is meaningful.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,750
Our viewers have more.
They have children,

19
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,720
they have payments on loans.
It's a luxury to pursue because we lack

20
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,461
the resources.
Well,

21
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,930
I don't think.
I don't remember.

22
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,580
Now.
I'm not talking about what makes you

23
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,640
happy.
It's a luxury to pursue what makes you

24
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,700
happy.
It's a moral obligation to pursue what

25
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,550
you find meaningful and that doesn't
mean it's easy.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,330
It might require sacrifice.
If you need to change your job to,

27
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:27,320
let's say you have a family and children
and a mortgage,

28
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,680
you have responsibilities.
You've already picked up those

29
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:33,560
responsibilities.
You don't just get to walk away Scott

30
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,131
free.
Say,

31
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:35,150
well,
I don't like my job.

32
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,310
I quit.
That's no strategy,

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,260
but what you might have to do is you
think,

34
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:41,140
well,
this job is killing my soul.

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,860
All right,
so what do I have to do about that?

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,290
Well,
I have to look for another job while no

37
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,310
one wants to hire me.

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,360
It's like,
okay,

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,260
maybe you need to educate yourself more.
Maybe you need to update your

40
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,360
curriculum,
veto your resume.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,930
Maybe you need to overcome your fear of
being interviewed.

42
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,310
Maybe you need to sharpen your social
skills like you.

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,510
You have to think about these things
strategically.

44
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,780
If you're going to switch careers,
you have to do it like an intelligent,

45
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:10,490
responsible person that might take you a
couple of years of effort to do

46
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:11,930
properly.
When you say pursue something

47
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,880
meaningful,
is it important to have a vocation?

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,140
I think it's more important to to have a
an ethos and ethic,

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,490
so I have a program,
for example,

50
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:25,850
called the future authoring program,
which is a writing program that enables

51
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:30,770
people to develop a vision for their
life and then to develop a strategy and

52
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,220
so it's based on the idea.
Imagine that and it's an extension of

53
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,520
the ideas in the book or at least
something along the same lines.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,280
The first thing that you want to do is
figure out.

55
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,520
Imagine you were taking care of yourself
like you were someone you cared for,

56
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,200
which is rule number two,
by the way,

57
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,750
essentially.
Then you should figure out,

58
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,030
well,
if you could have what you needed and

59
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,740
wanted,
what would it be?

60
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,490
What sort of friends would you have?
What would your family relationships

61
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,410
look like?
How would you conduct yourself with your

62
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,850
children?
How would you educate?

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,560
You need to think through how it is that
your life could be properly arranged if

64
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,470
you had that ability and then you can
name it that.

65
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,471
And the funny thing is is that if you do
positive goal of that sort and work

66
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,680
towards it,
you will move towards it.

67
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,090
The goal will change because you'll
learn things along the way.

68
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,540
But I mean I've,
I've dealt with hundreds of people in my

69
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,080
clinical and consulting practice and we
set a goal,

70
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,960
we develop a vision and work towards it
and it,

71
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,290
it,
things inevitably get better for people.

72
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,450
So it's not a luxury,
it's,

73
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,330
it's difficult.
It's a moral responsibility and it isn't

74
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,130
happiness.
It's,

75
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,970
it's not.
The pursuit isn't for happiness.

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,640
It's a moral responsibility to push you.
What has meaning?

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,220
Absolutely.
So when you know,

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,660
if you watch yourself,
you say,

79
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,550
well,
I had a particularly good day at work

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,940
and what does that mean?
Well,

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,510
it means that you lost your sense of
time,

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,060
right?
Because when you're having a good day at

83
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:00,540
work,
it's like first it's one minute to three

84
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:05,541
and then it's
45 seconds to three and then it's 30

85
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,680
seconds.
That's what school was like for me.

86
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,514
It was like

87
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,030
trick.
So funny.

88
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,260
You know,
I went to,

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,850
I went to my daughter's school,
I used to get in trouble for talking all

90
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:19,850
the time,
surprise,

91
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,870
surprise when I was a kid and uh,
and I was bored stiff in school and,

92
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,310
and so I would misbehave upon occasion
out of pure boredom.

93
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,970
And about 21 years ago I went to my
daughter's school to sit for a class.

94
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:43,040
It was about an hour long.
And uh,

95
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,620
I was sitting there and the teacher had
all the kids on the floor and was having

96
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,430
some of the kids read to the others.
And some of the kids who were reading

97
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:56,170
couldn't read at all.
And I had exactly the same experience.

98
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,520
I was sitting there.
It was like being,

99
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,390
it's like being seven years old,
ugly.

100
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,460
And I could see the clock going,

101
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,600
tick,
tick.

102
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,710
And I thought,
you know,

103
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,390
if I was in this classroom for three
days,

104
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,510
I would misbehave,
fit 40 years old,

105
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
I would misbehave exactly like I did
when I was when I was six.

106
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,090
Well,
that's no place to be right,

107
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,530
because that's.
You don't want to be in a place that

108
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,980
stultifying you don't want to be in a
place where there's no challenge.

109
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,110
You might even quit your job if there's
no challenge.

110
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,580
Say,
well that's a good job.

111
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,200
It gives you security and you think,
God,

112
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,300
I can't stand this.
It's eating away at my soul.

113
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,960
It's all security and no challenge.
So why do you want to challenge?

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,460
Because that's what you're built for.
That's what you're built for your built

115
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:42,070
to take on a maximal load,
right?

116
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,220
Because that's what strengthens you and
you need to be strong because life is

117
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:49,450
extraordinarily difficult and because
the evil king is always whittling away

118
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,990
at the structure of the state and you
have to be awake and sharp to stop that

119
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,950
from happening so that you don't become
corrupt and so that your family doesn't

120
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,010
become corrupt and so that your state
doesn't have to be come become corrupt.

121
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,730
You have to have your eyes open and your
wits sharp and your words at the ready

122
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,420
and you have to be educated and you have
to know about your history and you know

123
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,390
how have to know how to think and you
have to know how to read and you have to

124
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:15,290
know how to speak and you have to know
how to aim and you have to be willing to

125
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,870
hoist the troubles of the world up on
your shoulders.

126
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,110
And what's so interesting about that?
So remarkable.

127
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,970
And,
and this is something that's really

128
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,060
manifested itself to me as I've been
doing these public lectures.

129
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,280
I've been talking about responsibility
to people,

130
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,710
which doesn't seem to happen very often
anymore.

131
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,480
And the audiences are dead quiet,
and I lay out this idea that life is

132
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,510
tragedy tainted by malevolence,
and everyone says,

133
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,000
yeah,
well we already always suspected that no

134
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,870
one has ever said it quite so bluntly,
and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm

135
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,750
not the only person who has those
suspicions.

136
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,600
And then the second part of that is the
better part,

137
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:55,601
and it's the optimistic part,
which is despite the fact that life is a

138
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:00,050
tragedy tainted by malevolence at every
level of existence,

139
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,970
there's something about the human spirit
that can thrive under precisely those

140
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:09,860
conditions if we allow that to occur.
Because as difficult as life is and as

141
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:14,180
horrible as we are,
our capacity to deal with that

142
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,330
catastrophe and to transcend that
malevolent spirit is more powerful than

143
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:24,020
the than that reality itself.
And that's the fundamental issue.

144
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,730
I think that's the fundamental issue of
the Judaeo Christian ethic with its

145
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,920
emphasis on the divinity of the
individual.

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,080
As catastrophic as life is and his
malevolent as people can be.

147
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,460
And that's malevolent beyond belief.
Fundamentally,

148
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,150
a person has in spirit the nobility to
set that right and to defeat evil and

149
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,680
that and that more than that and that
the antidote to the catastrophe of life

150
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:57,590
and the suffering of life and the
tragedy of life that can drive you down

151
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,410
and destroy you,
is to take on exactly that

152
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,990
responsibility and to say,
well,

153
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,130
there's plenty of work to be done and
isn't that terrible and there isn't

154
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:12,131
anything so bad that we can't make it
worse and certainly try very hard to do

155
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,920
so,
but I have it within me to decide that

156
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,630
I'm going to stand up against that.

157
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,730
I'm going to strive to make the world a
better place.

158
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm going to strive to constrain the
malevolence that's in my own heart and

159
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:28,751
to set my family's straight and to work
to work despite my tragic lot for the

160
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,780
betterment of anything,
of everything that's in front of me.

161
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,890
And the consequence of that.
The immediate consequence of that is

162
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,480
that when you make the decision to take
on all of that voluntarily,

163
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,850
which is to stand up straight,
by the way,

164
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,130
with your shoulders back to take on
that,

165
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,940
all that on voluntarily.
As soon as you make that decision,

166
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,010
then all the catastrophe justifies
itself in the nobility of your striving

167
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
and that's what it means to be an
individual.

168
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,680
Thank you.

169
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,740
When I was 25 or so,
I probably weighed about 138 pounds.

170
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:15,741
I smoked like a pack cigarettes day.
I drank tremendous amount of alcohol.

171
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,260
I was from northern Alberta,
this rough little town up in northern

172
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,380
Alberta called fairview and you know,
there were long winters there and my

173
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,590
friends were heavy drinkers and most of
them dropped out of school by the time

174
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,350
they were 15 or 16 and went off to work
on the oil rigs.

175
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,920
And you know,
it was a rough town and we drank a lot

176
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,470
and I started when I was 14 and you
know,

177
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,740
um,
and so I was,

178
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,660
I had a lot of bad habits,
let's say,

179
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,260
and things that were.
And I wasn't in great shape physically

180
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,730
and I was also still intellectually
obsessed by as I am now.

181
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,730
And uh,
so that would've been,

182
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,960
that would've been an 85,
but when I,

183
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,190
but I decided around that about 85,
84,

184
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:58,230
something like that,
maybe a little earlier than I was really

185
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,700
going to try to get my act together.

186
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,983
And,
uh,

187
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,000
so I started doing that.
I,

188
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,750
you know,
I,

189
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,180
first of all,
I quit smoking.

190
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,830
Oh,
that took a long time because I

191
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:10,410
eventually had to quit drinking too in
order to quit smoking.

192
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,800
And I started working out,
started playing sports,

193
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,510
which I'd never done.
I was a small kid.

194
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,850
I been skipped a grade and I was a
small,

195
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,070
small for my age.
So sports were never,

196
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,820
especially team sports were never really
a domain of expertise for me.

197
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,000
Although I skied and went shopping with
my dad,

198
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,150
went cross country skiing and camping
and all that.

199
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,410
So,
but,

200
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,000
uh,
when I went to graduate school,

201
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:37,080
I started swimming the first,
the first,

202
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,380
uh,
physical exercise routine.

203
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,410
I did.
I enrolled in a swim suicides course,

204
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,420
I think it was called.
It was me and this like really

205
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:49,740
overweight kid and like these 60 year
old women and men naked out exercise me

206
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:50,310
like mad.

207
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,040
It was really embarrassing me in the
overweight kid,

208
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,870
you know,
we'd be just panting ourselves three

209
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:58,740
quarters to death at the end of the
bloody workout in these 60 year old

210
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,510
women who weren't great shape or like,
you know,

211
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,230
chatting way as if nothing was going on
at all in the pool.

212
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,790
So that was quite embarrassing as was
going to the weight room,

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,830
you know,
because when I started I could barely

214
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,850
bench press 75 pounds and people used to
keep coming over and helping me,

215
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,700
which was lasting I bloody well wanted
but certainly needed.

216
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:21,060
And I got to the point where I could
bench press 225 pounds.

217
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,970
I think that was the best I did.
And I gained about 30 pounds of muscle

218
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,790
in a year and a half.
So that was good thing.

219
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,610
So like I was kind of a wild man and you
know,

220
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:32,850
I'm a little bit manic in my,
in my temperament.

221
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,631
And so,
you know,

222
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,540
I was,
I was kind of going every direction at

223
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,160
the same time,
so,

224
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,980
and uh,
you know,

225
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,990
I don't regret that I had a fine time
when I was a kid and I needed really to

226
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:49,440
get disciplined and I had to do it
because I was working on these hard

227
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:50,700
problems that,
you know,

228
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,890
that I've been discussing with all of
you and I've been working on them really

229
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,180
obsessively since I was probably about
18,

230
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,990
maybe even earlier than that.
And got to the point around 25 when I

231
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,920
was in graduate school trying to get my
phd,

232
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,120
doing all my research.
Like I published 15 papers by the time I

233
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,960
graduated with my phd,
which was by I think by a fairly large

234
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,090
measure,
the most papers that any graduate

235
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,070
student at that time had ever published
at mcgill.

236
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,970
I think that's right.

237
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,370
Might have been twice as many or maybe
twice as many,

238
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,640
maybe even three times as many.
And at the same time I wrote maps of

239
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,170
meaning,
which was terrible,

240
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,050
terrible,
terribly difficult thing to do because I

241
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,000
was writing about three hours a day
doing that.

242
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:32,140
And I couldn't do all that and continue
with my misbehavior,

243
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,620
you know,
my sort of my what,

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,620
what would you say?
My,

245
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,080
my,
my hedonistic,

246
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,890
my hedonistic,
my massive hedonistic consumption of

247
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,160
alcohol and all of that.
I just couldn't keep it up and also work

248
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:49,870
seriously on the issues that were at
hand.

249
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,920
So,
you know,

250
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,300
I had to stop.
That's a sacrifice I had to stop messing

251
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,800
about,
straighten myself out.

252
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:00,130
And I,
I got married while my,

253
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,580
the woman who is my wife Tammy,
who I've known since she was eight years

254
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,050
old,
she lived across the street from me in

255
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,280
this little town called fairview.

256
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,710
And I was in love with her like first
time I saw her,

257
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,980
which is quite bloody thing.
So that's worked out pretty well for me.

258
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:16,120
But she came to live with me about the
same time and you know,

259
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,300
we decided jointly to get our act
together and we swore that we tell each

260
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,700
other the truth,
which I think she's actually done better

261
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,750
than me.
Like I don't think,

262
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,230
I don't think she's lied to me ever in
our entire marriage,

263
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:27,730
which is unbelievable,
you know?

264
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:31,060
And it's been so useful because I can
really tell her things that we can

265
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,620
really talk.
So I tell you,

266
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,270
if you want to have a good relationship,
man,

267
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,180
you embedded in the truth.
Because if you don't embed it in the

268
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,560
truth,
you don't have a relationship.

269
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,790
It's,
it's just lies.

270
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,740
It's a tissue of lies.
And it will,

271
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,730
it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as
the crisis comes along.

272
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,100
So the truth is a terrible thing,
but not,

273
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,380
not compared to falsehood.
So.

274
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,350
Alright,
so let's look at the live chat here.

275
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,710
You hear the Galitary Ian Clarion call
everywhere.

276
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,130
Everything should be equal.
Everything should be equally

277
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,320
distributed.
We should strive for equity.

278
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:10,310
It's like wrong,
especially if you're a conservative,

279
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,470
wrong.
What we want are just hierarchies of

280
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,860
competence.
Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.

281
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,130
You know,
if your father has a brain tumor,

282
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,940
you probably want a hierarchy of
competence for neurosurgeons.

283
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,870
So you can pick the one that's the best
so that he might not die.

284
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,390
That's what a hierarchy of competence is
for,

285
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,270
for the postmodernist.
There's no hierarchy that isn't based on

286
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,440
power.
Well,

287
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,620
because they think the world runs on
power and that's why they're willing to

288
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:43,580
use power to get what they want because
it's the only thing they believe it,

289
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,220
but a valid hierarchy of competence.
It's God.

290
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,360
We need those things,
man.

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,750
We need the best plumbers.
We need the best contractors.

292
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,584
We need best.

293
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,820
We knew we need the best carpenters.
We need the best lecturers.

294
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,970
There has to be a hierarchy of quality,
not only so that we know who the best

295
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,370
are and to reward them properly,
but so that we can reward them so they

296
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,880
keep being the best.
It's like you know if,

297
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,850
if you have a great educator,
if you have a great leader,

298
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,710
if you,
if you have a great thinker,

299
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,550
you want to reward them so they keep
thinking and keep educating so they can

300
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,730
tell you something.
It's not a reward for their intrinsic

301
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:22,730
being.
It's a calculated move on your part to

302
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,510
suck everything out of them.
That's valuable as fast as you can.

303
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,860
That's what a hierarchy of competence is
for and the idea that hierarchies of

304
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,530
competence don't exist is it's so
cynical.

305
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:37,970
It's such a pathologically cynical idea
and it's actually quite patently untrue

306
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,060
because here's an interesting tidbit
from the psychological literature.

307
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,070
Let's say you want to determine what the
best predictors are for lifetime success

308
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,150
in a Western society.
Well,

309
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,080
what would you hope for?
How about intelligence?

310
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,180
There would be a good one.
Let's hope the smart people occupied

311
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,590
more positions of complexity,
right?

312
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,430
Because they're smarter.
Would you want it any other way?

313
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,140
Okay,
and then so and that's great.

314
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,400
The number one predictor of
accomplishment in western societies is

315
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,950
intelligence,
so that means the system works.

316
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,340
What's the number to predictor
conscientiousness?

317
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,181
Well,
what's that?

318
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,030
It's a trademark or for hard work.
So who called,

319
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:20,450
who gets a head smart?
People who work hard.

320
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,830
Now that doesn't account for every bit
of the difference between people in

321
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,310
terms of their hierarchical structure
because hierarchies aren't perfect.

322
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,890
They're corrupt.
People get to the top sometimes because

323
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,660
there's psychopathic,
although believe me,

324
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,650
a hell of a lot less than you think
because a psychopath has to keep moving

325
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,890
from place to place because once he
reveals himself as deceitful,

326
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,370
untrustworthy,
he has to go find new soccer's to

327
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,070
fleece.

328
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,490
So the idea that you know,
there's no distinction between a CEO and

329
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:49,130
a psychopath.
It's like that's only made by someone

330
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,310
who knows nothing about psychopaths
being knows nothing about ceos and c has

331
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:59,270
something fundamental against the entire
capitalist structure because it's simply

332
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,710
not true.
Corrupt,

333
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,520
sometimes greedy,
sometimes short sighted,

334
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,120
sometimes running companies that are
doing their best to auger themselves

335
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,710
into the ground and so,
you know,

336
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,380
it's bad people running a dying
organization,

337
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,720
but generally speaking,
it's not the case.

338
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:18,470
Our hierarchies of competence are
reasonably functional and not only are

339
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,270
they functional,
they're valuable.

340
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
We need to know who the competent people
are and we need to reward them.

341
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,850
And even more importantly,
we need to tell young people,

342
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,010
hey,
there's some hierarchies of competence

343
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,070
out there,
like a thousand of them.

344
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,500
Go be a plumber man,
but be a good one.

345
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,640
You know,
being honest,

346
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,440
one B,
I had a plumber once,

347
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,510
you know,
it was the night,

348
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,060
it was the night before we were putting
drywall in our house.

349
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,480
We were redoing a house and he had put
in all the plastic piping,

350
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,880
you know,
and I was going to test the joints,

351
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,130
the they're supposed to be glued
together with his pipe glue.

352
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,960
And I said,
I told them I had to test the joints and

353
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,790
he said,
well you don't have to test my joints.

354
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,840
They never leak.
Can I thought,

355
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,100
yeah,
that's okay.

356
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,270
How about if I test them?
So I went up on the third floor and

357
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,310
filled the pipes with water,
capping them in the basement like you're

358
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,830
supposed to.
Like half an hour later I had two inches

359
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:08,220
of water in the basement.
There were 30 leaking joints and that

360
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:12,180
was the night before the drywallers were
supposed to show up so well.

361
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:15,210
So he wasn't particularly competent.
That's the point of that story.

362
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:20,211
But even more so he had put a bunch of
the plastic pipe outside where the

363
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,180
drywall would be.

364
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,720
So it would have been sticking through
the wall.

365
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,660
So I spent a frenetic night,
you know,

366
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,280
sawing through plastic pipe and re
gluing joints so that my well so that

367
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,460
the drywall is could come in.
What's the point if you're going to be a

368
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,270
plumber,
man,

369
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,360
be a good plumber because otherwise all
you do is go out there and cause

370
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,670
trouble.
We don't need people to cause more

371
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,160
trouble.
We need people to solve problems,

372
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,200
you know,
and so you can be a tradesman and you

373
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,700
can be,
can make a lot of money as a

374
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:47,190
tradesperson.
That's a bloody reliable,

375
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,950
honorable,
a forthright,

376
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,950
productive way of making a living.
And there is a hell of a lot of

377
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,690
difference between a working man who
knows what he's doing and one who

378
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,270
doesn't,
both in terms of skill and ethics,

379
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,730
right?
And you work with someone who knows what

380
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,050
they're doing,
it's a bloody pleasure.

381
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,380
They tell you what they're gonna do.
They tell you how much it will cost.

382
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,850
They go and do it.
It works,

383
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,760
and you pay them perfect.
Everyone's happy.

384
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,240
And that's what happens when you have
genuine hierarchies of competence and so

385
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,220
you to,
you listen to these panderers of

386
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,780
egalitarianism,
a gala,

387
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,250
egalitarianism,
inequity,

388
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,120
and they failed to recognize completely
that there are differences in rank

389
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,340
between people.
It's not such a terrible thing,

390
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,440
man.
Maybe you wouldn't be a great lawyer

391
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,780
like it's certainly possible.
Most people aren't,

392
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,330
but that doesn't mean there isn't
something you could be great at.

393
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:37,410
There's lots of hierarchies to attempt
to climb and if you fail in one,

394
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,830
go try in another.
But the point is you're still trying to

395
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,190
aim for the top and what the hell are
you going to do if you don't try to aim

396
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,510
for the top,
you know,

397
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,570
flap about uselessly and whine about
your life.

398
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,570
It's not helpful.
It just make you miserable.

399
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,080
You're not reliable to anyone.
You can't help out in a crisis.

400
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,130
It's like,
so you tell young people,

401
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,740
and this is another message for
conservatives,

402
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,270
like,
I don't care why you're going to do,

403
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,060
but go out there and make something of
yourself for God's sake.

404
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:07,710
Be An honest person and work and get to
the top of whatever it is that you want

405
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,810
to get to the top of you know,
and,

406
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,843
and,
and,

407
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,030
and stand up for yourself like a
respectable human being and be a bit of

408
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,280
a light on the world instead of a
blight,

409
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,250
you know,
and you can tell young people that and

410
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,790
they haven't been told that by anyone
now and so the young men are so hungry

411
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,624
for that,
that it's,

412
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,170
it's painful to watch.
They're so relieved when it was.

413
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,030
Someone finally comes up and says,
Hey,

414
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:33,060
you know,
you get your act together a bit.

415
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,760
Disciplined yourself.
See if you can learn to tell the truth,

416
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,650
concentrate on something for a year or
two.

417
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,760
You could be a bloody world beater.
They think really?

418
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,630
That's possible.
Wow.

419
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,340
That would be,
that would be interesting.

420
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,500
That might make life or life worth
living like,

421
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,580
yeah,
it might.

422
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,970
So why don't you go do it?
That's what the damn universities we're

423
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,100
supposed to be teaching people and
they've forgotten that.

424
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,770
I went to Harvard month ago,
month and a half,

425
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,740
used to teach there and I talked to a
bunch of students.

426
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,530
You know what I told them,
it's not easy to get into Harvard,

427
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,290
you know,
like you're a Valedictorian if you're at

428
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,660
Harvard and not only are you a
Valedictorian,

429
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,460
you're way better than most people at at
least two other things or you don't get

430
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:13,810
it.
It's so like it's.

431
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,860
I don't know what the acceptance rate is
like five percent and believe me,

432
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,910
not everybody applies.

433
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,230
So it's a very selective school.
And so why am I saying that?

434
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:27,070
It's like these are high quality kids.
So I told them what I just told you.

435
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,960
It's like,
here you are at Harvard.

436
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,080
It's like get yourself educated man.
Read some books,

437
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,670
learn to talk,
learn to think.

438
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,210
Make yourself into something.
Get the hell out there and make the

439
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:41,230
world that put you here.
Happy that you were put there in that

440
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,940
great institution,
you know,

441
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,520
and they came up to me afterwards and
said,

442
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,530
God,
I wish someone would have told us that

443
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:50,170
when we were in our first year.
It's like,

444
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,050
Jesus,
why didn't someone tell them that for

445
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,210
God's sake,
it's supposed to be the greatest

446
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,960
university in the world.
Is it so difficult to figure that out?

447
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,430
Well,
it is.

448
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,040
If that is what you want to have
happened in the university,

449
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,910
you want to make cringing milk sops to
whine about being victims while they're

450
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,580
going to ivy league institutions.
Jesus.

451
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,750
It's pathetic.
