1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,750
I'm only talking to the people that are
ready to get to the next level of they

2
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:22,740
life and they career and they're going
to boldly walk

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,580
until the next season of their life.
Unapologetically getting rid of all

4
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:33,560
things people in situations that no
longer belong in their life.

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,930
Most of you,
most of you,

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,080
you're so consumed
with everything that's going on in the

7
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,410
world.
This is the reasons you haven't figured

8
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:56,390
out your own life yet.
Every blog,

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,220
every website,
every tweet,

10
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,310
every instagram post,
you are so consumed with everything

11
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:09,310
that's going on in the world.
You're ignoring your own world.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,050
You can never shine trying to sit on
someone else's son.

13
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,580
You can never figure out who you are if
you consumed and everything that

14
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:25,920
everybody else is and what they're doing
in the moves that they're making because

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,250
you're trying to chase someone else's
life.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,560
You're trying to chase someone else's
lifestyle and identity all while

17
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,610
ignoring your own life and your own
path.

18
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,970
What is the vision for your life?
What are the ideas and the dreams for

19
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:43,670
your life?
What are you supposed to be doing?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Who are you?
What are your gifts and talents?

21
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,940
What is your ultimate destiny and your
goals

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,900
and you should understand this,
that it was always going to be your

23
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,980
family and your friends.
That would be the first ones to try and

24
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,290
talk you out of your vision and your big
idea.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,350
That's why you supposed to live your
life,

26
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,860
focus on your intentions and do your
thing.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,620
Did you allow yourself worth to be based
on what other people think of you?

28
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,020
Is the beginning of the end.
I believe in me.

29
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,990
If you stop believing in me,
I'm not going to believe in myself any

30
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,440
less.
If you believe that I'm irrelevant,

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,940
that no one is checking for me and that
I don't mean anything to the world

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,550
because you think or believe that about
me,

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,550
it doesn't mean that I'm going to
believe it about myself.

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,870
See,
the day that you start living your life

35
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,850
according to everybody else's opinion is
the beginning of the hand.

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,450
Most of you guys don't actually know
yourself or you don't know yourself.

37
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:02,000
Value.
Believe in yourself.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,960
Believe in yourself independent of the
validation of the world.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
Have opinions and feelings about
yourself,

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,300
independent of the feedback.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,720
I really think,

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,500
and if you get rid of the trash in your
life,

43
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,410
that can be people,
business in situations you too couldn't

44
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,160
really like.
I really believe that you can reach your

45
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,980
full potential.
I want you

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,930
to fly.
I want you and your career and your

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,590
financial blessings to bypass me.
