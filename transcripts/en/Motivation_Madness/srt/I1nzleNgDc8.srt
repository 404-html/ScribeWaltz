1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,390
Are complaining.
We are making excuses and we do it

2
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,120
everyday because it feels a lot better
to shit on somebody else.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,190
Then look at yourself and shit on
yourself.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,920
[inaudible]

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,410
whether it's one man,
I don't look at anybody else.

6
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:29,520
I have no fucking idea what you guys are
up to and I shit on myself every day.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,340
I critique everything I do.
Everything is my fault.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,810
Period.
End of story.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,260
I can sit and dwell on all the things.
Somebody hits me with a fucking car

10
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,621
tomorrow.
I'm like,

11
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,090
fuck,
I shouldn't have left the house that

12
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:47,091
early.
You get into that fucking mindset.

13
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,000
I promise you shit changes.
You need to fucking suffocate your

14
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,400
bullshit.
You're at this conference.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,670
That means you need to suffocate your
bullshit period.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,550
Either need to figure out who's holding
you back and their judgment and go to

17
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,140
them.
I want you to get out of this fucking

18
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,210
conference.
Go to your car or call your mom and say

19
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
fuck you.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,370
She's

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,660
the person that is suppressing you
because she's miserable and misery loves

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,160
company.
I'm being dead serious with you.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,560
I understand it's not a popular thing to
say.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,140
I understand,
but there's only a couple of things that

25
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,540
I'm seeing in the world today,
which is people aren't doing things

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,000
because they're fearful of other
people's judgments,

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,360
which usually comes from parenting or
environment or circumstance,

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,790
and they're still keeping negative
energy around them because they're

29
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,550
obligated and I get it.
I have negative people in my life too

30
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,360
that I keep around as well,
but to let that dictate your only life

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,580
is fucking ludicrous and all I know.
How about,

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,650
let me actually,
you know what?

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm going to give you a real weird one.
I want every person to do me a huge

34
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,070
favor.
If you really want to know what's

35
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:51,060
running through my fucking body,
go volunteer at a nursing home for one

36
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,894
day.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,650
Go volunteer at a nursing home for one
day.

38
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,630
Number one,
it's just a nice thing to do and you'll

39
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,300
probably feel pretty awesome about it.
Number two,

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,270
don't talk to eight people.
Six,

41
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,700
four,
you're going to see something that is

42
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,120
going to scare the living shit out of
here.

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,410
It's called regret.
Regret,

44
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:15,030
scares the shit out of me.
Regret is the fuel besides gratitude

45
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,080
that drives my life.
You will see people and they will tell

46
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:23,760
you things about the things they didn't
do and the silliness to why they didn't

47
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:28,380
do it and they're running out of time.
You sit in this room and you have time.

48
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,140
You have time.
If you're 70 80 90 of time,

49
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,970
if you're 15 you've time,
but to sit and list all the reasons you

50
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,220
can't.
It's just,

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,820
here's how I look at it.
If anybody that looks like you has ever

52
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,320
done it,
then you can too.

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,400
If you know,
if some kid that grew up with two

54
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,330
alcoholic parents,
right and grew up in an orphanage made

55
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,770
it,
you can too.

56
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
It's not necessarily that I don't
believe in luck or circumstance.

57
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,690
I believe in all of that.
I really,

58
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,250
I understand that this is not about
that.

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,120
It's about mindset.
The second you start having losing

60
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,890
mindset,
you've already fucking lost.

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,880
I love when people think shit like the
secret is real fucking real.

62
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,410
Here's how it works.
Friends.

63
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,940
If you actually are optimistic and you
make a goal and your actions map to it,

64
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,610
you've miraculously get somewhere close
to it.

65
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,550
Sitting on your couch,
jerking off and saying,

66
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:24,840
I wish I had $1 million.

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,200
The amount of people talking big game in
this office,

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,110
in this room office,
clearly I use that a lot.

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,700
The amount of people talking big game at
this conference right now where their

70
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:44,390
ambitions don't match their actions.
I mean people rolling around here and

71
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,110
say they're going to make 100 million a
year and then take the whole weekend

72
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:50,030
off.
Then I have nothing going for themselves

73
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,880
yet.
Do you know quiet my head is,

74
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,740
do you know how quiet my head is?
My head is soup.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,070
It is super quiet in here.
You know why no voices allowed.

76
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,600
No voices allowed.
Not My wife's,

77
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,060
not my kids,
not my business partners,

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,470
not my parents.
Nobody.

79
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm in it for me in my own mind.
The reason I can give so much to

80
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:16,250
everybody else,
it's because I'm good because I made it

81
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,810
with myself.
Period.

82
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,823
End of story

83
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,870
and I've been talking about a lot of
things and the reason I'm going further

84
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:30,490
down this rabbit hole of tuned out
everybody else is as I've gotten to know

85
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,930
people like,
oh,

86
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,950
they're scared because their partner
makes fun of them all the time.

87
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,770
Like it's just,
it's just very basic behavior,

88
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,700
right?
It's very basic behavior and so I just

89
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,550
don't want that for you anymore.
Like has anybody realize guys,

90
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:49,180
it's 400 trillion to one.
The odds of being in this fucking room

91
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:54,181
right now is 400 trillion to one.
The fact that your mom and dad had sex

92
00:04:55,491 --> 00:05:00,491
at that exact second to create you is
fucking insane and we are wasting it

93
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,010
away and I just don't want you to do
that mainly because I get a high off of

94
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,860
the email that you send me in six years
about this suffocating conversation.

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,690
Okay?

96
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,100
Content and distribution.
Content and distribution.

97
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,430
You have to make stuff.
Figure out what kind of content producer

98
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,140
you are.
Are you good at writing?

99
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,480
Are you good at talking?
Are you good in front of video?

100
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,351
Everybody thinks,
oh,

101
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,184
videos.
The answer,

102
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,930
not the answer.
If you suck on video,

103
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,290
can you talk?
Can you write?

104
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,720
Are you charismatic in front of a
camera?

105
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,870
All three are trying to video and
written word audio.

106
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,810
They play forever.
Figuring out which one you're good at

107
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,050
and go deep into that.
Everybody's trying to make you fix all

108
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,090
your shortcomings.
Fuck your shortcomings,

109
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,780
triple down on your strengths and is
your biggest advantage.

110
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,380
Please leave

111
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,220
this conference.
Figure out first you want to sell.

112
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,290
Actually,
before I figure out what you want your

113
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,050
life to be.
Do you really want all that money?

114
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,770
Do you really want to let them?
What do you want?

115
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,370
Figured that out.
Then figure out what you want to sell

116
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,840
your time,
your service,

117
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,400
a product.
I don't care.

118
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,500
A festival.
I figure out something you believe in

119
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,110
that you sell and then finally,
number three,

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,610
figured out how to let the world know
about it at the lowest possible cost.

121
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,960
Today,
if it's under 30 year olds,

122
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,920
that's instagram influencers and
snapchat ads.

123
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:28,060
They're $3 CPMS.
Everybody writes off snapchat because

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,820
instagram copies all its features.
That's exactly when I went all in on

125
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,820
snapchat the last three months and I'm
buying awareness at a price I've never

126
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,160
seen before.
If the person is under 30

127
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,390
okay,

128
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,220
be a practitioner.
I get a lot of accolades.

129
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,054
Yeah.
Gary,

130
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,270
I,
why do you think I do all this content

131
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,260
so I do it?

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,810
Yeah.

133
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,100
I built my personal brand,
not necessarily for the brand halo

134
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,610
effect to keep me in check to always be
on top of shit.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm in the green right now.
Tweeting and texting and consuming and

136
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,761
creating content.
I'm putting in work every day work and I

137
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,480
know the nuances of a filter and a geo
location and the copy of a facebook

138
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,310
post,
like everybody's talking about this

139
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,450
stuff doesn't work.
No,

140
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,770
no,
you don't work

141
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,930
you the ambition.
If you,

142
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,430
if you fucking came to this conference,
you clearly want something.

143
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:26,970
So if that's the case,
how do you not have 30 hours to go do

144
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:29,250
research on how to do this shit?
For Real.

145
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,730
I'll give you a free resource on how to
post ads on facebook,

146
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,630
how to find influencers on Instagram,
how to do snapchat better,

147
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,330
how to do linkedin better.
They'll give you free reshot resource

148
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:40,920
right now.
Here it is.

149
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,940
G.

150
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:47,850

E.

152
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,490
You

153
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,140
want something?
Go fucking get it.

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,970
It's called search engine.
How do I post better on instagram and

155
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:02,390
turn?
My friends are being serious.

156
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,570
I know it's funny but I'm flabbergasted
by people hitting me up.

157
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,970
Gary,
how do I get it?

158
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,130
You know I want to apply for it.
I saw you meant literally the scene.

159
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,610
The snap on the way.
This is Gary saw your hiring content

160
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,230
creators.
I do that.

161
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,730
I'm like,
are you fucking kidding me?

162
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,960
Calm asshole.
And you apply and be like,

163
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,860
why do we need,
you have the self start.

164
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,080
You have to self start.
If you believe like I do that mobile

165
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,860
devices have the consumer's attention
and that facebook,

166
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,850
instagram,
snapchat,

167
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:39,500
youtube,
podcasts have the percentage of time.

168
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,880
By the way,
this is not a debate.

169
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,480
This is data.
They own it besides games and utility.

170
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,000
It's social networks.
You may not like it.

171
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,990
You may not like the teenage girl duck
faces 24 hours a day.

172
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,410
It doesn't matter because I've got news
for you.

173
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,080
You're 40 year old sister's duck facing
too.

174
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,400
It's 2017

175
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,820
okay.

176
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,270
What do you think is coming next?
Are you ready for augmented reality?

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
Are you ready for machine learning,
for Ai,

178
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,950
for messengers,
for Vr?

179
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,880
I mean,
look,

180
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,290
how many people here are retiring within
the next 10 years and I don't mean

181
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,020
you're going to crush it and buy a
fucking island.

182
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,350
I mean,
you're old and you're fucking finished.

183
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,540
Great.

184
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,290
[inaudible] your hand if you're retiring
in 10 years.

185
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,340
Understood.
Okay.

186
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,700
For the 21 of you,
you can take some of this with some

187
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,430
level of grain of salt,
but for the rest of you,

188
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,950
everything,
I believe in everything that is

189
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,520
converting and creating your business
opportunities in today's world did not

190
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,320
exist 12 years ago.
All of it.

191
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,720
Not facebook,
not smartphones,

192
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,610
not youtube,
not snapchat,

193
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,970
none of it.
What do you think happens next?

194
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,910
Can you imagine if I told you 10 years
ago that you would prefer your teenage

195
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:04,720
girl to take a drive with a stranger
than drive herself?

196
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,580
Would you believe that we're living
through massive social norm changes?

197
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,920
Number,
how weird it was to online date,

198
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,670
not so much anymore.
We don't live in through massive human

199
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:19,000
shifts.
This is the biggest culture shift since

200
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:23,260
the printing press.
The Internet is only roughly 20 years

201
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:26,140
old in being a consumer product for all
of us.

202
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,000
This is just starting and the level of
disrespect or the level of,

203
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,370
it's kind of something the unbelievable
nature of you not becoming ridiculously

204
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,400
educated in this shit blows my mind.
You can not have the audacity for

205
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:46,570
ambition in the future world without
putting in hundreds of hours of homework

206
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,040
to the nuances of had a creek
communications and distributed them on

207
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,660
this device.
Your ass.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,580
If you don't do it and I don't want
outsourcing to nieces and I don't want

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,560
fucking bullshit excuses and I don't
want to hear that you're not good on

210
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:02,320
camera then fucking right rick,
I don't care.

211
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,670
But you need to fucking make a decision
today.

212
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,910
Are you going to allow yourself to buy
bullshit programs for the rest of your

213
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,880
life and come to shit like this or are
you going to finally fucking eat shit

214
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,870
and do something about it?

215
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,400
Are you,
are you

216
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,260
going to fuck him for 10 or are you
going to make pretend you're a business

217
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,440
person cause it feels nice.
Or are you going to become a business

218
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:34,441
person paying your big to look?
The part is a great business for other

219
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:37,810
people.
Eating shit for a decade and doing it

220
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:42,160
for yourself is a good one for you in
that eating shit decade.

221
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,090
If you actually get smart and stop
fucking judging every new thing that

222
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,280
comes along.
And you know what's so funny to me?

223
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,330
What's the funny of me is people that
get fancy,

224
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,240
let me on this fancy like the shit out
of it.

225
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,790
The amount of people that aren't where
they want to be.

226
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,450
Okay.

227
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,261
And did say,
well,

228
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:08,261
I don't have time for facebook.
I don't have time to learn another APP

229
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,810
like snapchat yet.
You're not winning.

230
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,213
Yeah,

231
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,920
I don't get them a man.
I don't understand.

232
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,280
You're not where you're at.
You'd rather spend thousands of dollars

233
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:26,990
on dumb shit to somebody teaching you
some fucking secret that doesn't exist.

234
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,280
Then you spending the 40 hours to learn
the newest thing even if it dies.

235
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,960
Let me tell you the story about Social
Cam.

236
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,520
Social camp came out six years ago.
I spent a fucking 50 60 a hundred hours

237
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,810
on it,
figuring it out,

238
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,780
right?
That's what I did and worked for about

239
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:44,540
four months and then the whole thing
collapsed and nobody gave a fuck about

240
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:49,460
social camp wastes of time or in those
learnings on a mobile first video

241
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,220
platform.
Did I learn what made me bet unbind

242
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,160
number two,
I bet on vine vine comes out.

243
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,390
Everybody's like,
who gives a fuck?

244
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,860
Six seconds videos stupid.
I'm like,

245
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,510
not me.
I'm going to learn everything about

246
00:12:59,511 --> 00:12:59,930
this.

247
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,030
I'm going to be friends with everybody.
What happens with fine.

248
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,770
That's pretty good.
I get a,

249
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,500
I started an agency representing a bunch
of talent with Jerome Jarre.

250
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,720
We make a couple of bucks but I learned,
I learned alert.

251
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,500
What happens with vine dies,
but what happens next?

252
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,940
Instagram video and what happens in the
last year for me on instagram video,

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,140
the last four years of me learning
mobile first video dynamics on two

254
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:24,590
things I wasted my time on.
Even though I had hundreds of millions

255
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,360
of dollars,
I wasn't too fucking fancy to put in the

256
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,330
work at two o'clock in the morning cause
I'm fucking hungry and I back at the

257
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:33,920
fuck up.
Then instagram comics,

258
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,500
then instagram comes and then I hit pay
dirt six years in the making a whole lot

259
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:43,040
of losing along the way,
but learning my craft,

260
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,000
learning my craft.
I end with this.

261
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:50,450
My friends in Utah,
do you actually know what the fuck

262
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:53,180
you're doing?
Are you actually putting in the work?

263
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,040
Do you really want this that bad or do
you want to make it look like you want

264
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,530
it that bad?
I challenge you and I hope to see you

265
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:01,370
soon.
Thank you.
