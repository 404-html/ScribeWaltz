1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,443
Okay.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,200
Here's the painful truth.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,650
Most dreams never come true and it isn't
because people aren't working hard.

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,560
It's not because they're not
worthy or they're not good.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,850
It's the simple reality that the things
that you're dreaming about are hard as

6
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,330
hell to accomplish.
So if you want to accomplish them,

7
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:29,030
let me tell you one thing right now,

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,230
you cannot ever be
passive and most people,

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,940
that's the posture that
they're in all the time.

10
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:38,240
People are going to tell you
terrible advice like be patient,

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,700
but the reality is you can't be patient,

12
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:44,060
not if you want to achieve at the highest
level. And if patients is your thing,

13
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:47,480
if you want to chill, if you want
to relax, that is absolutely fine.

14
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,970
There's no moral obligation to aim high.

15
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:53,480
There's no moral obligation to want to
be one of the greatest in the world.

16
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,860
But let me tell you right now,

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,960
if you want to be one of
the greatest of all time,

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,950
the reality is you're
fighting an uphill battle.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,870
The reality is your going to have to
go so hard to make that a reality that

20
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:12,800
other people simply cannot imagine working
that hard for anything in their life.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,160
That's the simple truth
and once you realize that,

22
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,650
once you realize that the people
that achieve at the highest level,

23
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:22,070
they have one thing in common,
they will bury them. It would work.

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,910
They'd put so much energy into
what they're trying to accomplish,

25
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,400
that other people simply
fall by the wayside.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,010
People simply can't imagine
trying to keep up with that,

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,770
and so what they say is
that person's extraordinary.

28
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:40,520
What they say is that person
is naturally talented.

29
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,130
What they tell themselves is that person,

30
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:47,240
that's something that they don't have
because what they don't want to do is face

31
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,920
the hard truth that the dreams that they
have aren't coming true simply because

32
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,880
they're not making the right decisions.
They're not pushing themselves to learn.

33
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,300
Once you embrace that, you're hopelessly
average. That's where we all start.

34
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,260
That's the beauty of it.

35
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,220
The greatest piece of news that I can
give you is that you are hopelessly

36
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,700
average. That was where you started, but
it doesn't have to be where you stay.

37
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,230
You can become anything you want to be,

38
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,160
but how to put in that inhuman
amount of work to improve.

39
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,070
But if you focus on that,
if you focus on improving,

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,780
then then your dreams
really can become a reality.

41
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:22,790
But it has to be this aggressive posture.

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,820
It has to be waking up every day and
asking yourself one simple question,

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,810
how do I get better today
than I was yesterday?

44
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,450
If you are myopically focused on that,

45
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,720
if that is the driving thing in your life
that you don't worry about whether or

46
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,300
not you're good or great or talented,
you just worry about,

47
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,460
am I getting better today
than I was yesterday?

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,200
Am I putting in that kind of energy?

49
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:48,950
Am I working hard enough to get better?

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,440
Am I working hard enough
to outperform other people?

51
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,290
Am I willing to hold myself to
this incredibly high standard?

52
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,220
If you're willing to do that and be
real with yourself about whether or not

53
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,120
you're making progress,

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,430
then then your dreams really can come
true and that's what I want for people.

55
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,510
I want people to know that.

56
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,900
I want people to believe it
to the core of their being.

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,100
You can do anything you set your mind to,

58
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,040
and if you need encouragement, let this
be that encouragement. You can do it.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,800
I don't care how average
you are in the beginning,

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,750
who do you want to become and what price
are you willing to pay to get there?

61
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,240
And when the answer to that question is,

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
I want to be the best and I'm willing
to pay an extraordinary price to get

63
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:35,824
there,

64
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,150
then and only then you will get there.

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:42,940
Yeah.
