1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,660
The one commodity that is most valuable
on this earth is time,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
time to love cancer live from the moment
the human body is born,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,550
it begins dying.
I don't think you need quite caught

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,600
that.
Let me say it again.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,010
From the moment the human body is born,
it begins dying.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,430
Some happening faster,
some happening slower.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,160
Some of US help them happy,
go faster.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,330
Some of them prevented from happening
sooner than later.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,100
Coach high coming to you live on the
field of life.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,780
How many seconds?
How many minutes do we waste every day?

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,260
Doing things that are no where near the
goals and aspirations and passions that

12
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:54,440
we have inside.
How many times are you go through the

13
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:58,970
course of a day and realize,
did I do anything I set out to do today?

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,450
Write down those goals each and every
day.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,120
No matter if there's two goals a day.

16
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,620
If you can accomplish those,
then you're doing more than just making

17
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:13,670
it through the day you are living and
achieving your dreams.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,460
You know as inspirational speakers,
we don't want to just talk to you.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,240
We want to live that as well.
I've done that in my life as well.

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,930
Find time to better yourself.
Read,

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,190
explore research,
live life,

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,100
do things you've never thought of doing
before.

23
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,400
That's what it's all about.
When you're born.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,610
That's their date that they put on the
left side of the tombstone.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,350
When you die,
they put another date on the right side

26
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:50,351
of the tombstone,
but that dash in the middle is the most

27
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,990
important thing on that tombstone.
That is alone.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Then throughout that entire time frame,
you were able to impact and touch others

29
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:04,200
lives.
You were able to leave your mark on this

30
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,890
earth.
You were able to build a legacy there.

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,610
Nobody could change.
You were able to have it to where people

32
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:16,500
remember who you are,
no matter what you're living for that

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,260
dash in the middle,
you're going to remember your why,

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,840
your why.
Why are you here,

35
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,950
not,
not the why.

36
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,530
Why did you do something your why,
your your reason for getting up in the

37
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,490
morning,
your reason for pushing yourself past

38
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:34,491
the brink of exertion and giving up your
reason for moving on and and getting

39
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,940
things done in life.
That dash in the middle.

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,860
That's the thing that pushes you.
Just this stop for a second.

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,420
Write down your why.
What,

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
what are you doing this for in life?
If your why doesn't make you cry and

43
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,150
that's not your why.
Again,

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,040
if your why doesn't make you cry the
last,

45
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,540
not your why,
your why should be something so big that

46
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:09,541
it moves your family tree.
Your why should be something so big that

47
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:14,320
it changes the whole outlook on how
things are with you and your home,

48
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,360
your family,
your religion,

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,420
your purpose.
Think about your passion,

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,640
okay.

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,270
Thinking about your opportunities and
that's how you find your purpose.

52
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,763
OPP.

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,063
Yeah.

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,750
When that y meets up with your passion,
your opportunity,

55
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,490
your purpose,
then you'll find out the most important

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,490
day in your life is the day you remember
why you were born.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,240
Okay.
