1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,950
Ignore the naysayers,
rook you ass off,

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,250
and give back and change the world
because if not us,

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,050
who,
if not now when?

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,200
What is the secret to success?
The long version is that the actually

5
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,900
always had five rules and everything
that it did.

6
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,680
Always use those five rooms,
those five rooms help it to become

7
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:43,060
successful in various different areas
and I think I believe that those rules

8
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:46,150
can be applied to almost anyone and
everyone.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,030
You don't need to be a bodybuilding
champion.

10
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:52,630
You'll either need to want to be a
governor of California or the be an

11
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,890
action hero or anything like that.
If you want to excel in whatever you do,

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,380
those rules are for you.
It's that simple.

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,570
Now I have to tell you right off the top
that I always was very intense as a kid.

14
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:06,640
That radio was very intense and I was
very hungry.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,310
I always wanted to be the best.
I always wanted to be.

16
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:11,350
Number one.
Always wanted to get to the top.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,750
I never believed in.
Just getting by.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,070
Now I have nothing against people that
just want to get by because I think

19
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:22,510
there are many roads to happiness,
but I think that we all here like to be

20
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:27,460
successful and we are driven,
so that's why those rules apply to you.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,080
So my first rule is find your vision and
follow it.

22
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,720
You see,
I think is the most important thing that

23
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:38,170
we have a very clear vision of where we
go a goal,

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,190
where do we go?
Because you can have the best ship in

25
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,780
the world,
you can have the best cruise liner,

26
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,940
but if the captain does not know where
to go,

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,340
that ship will drift around the world
and outdated.

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,320
See and will never end up anywhere.
And this is exactly the way it is in

29
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:58,660
real life.
If you don't have a goal,

30
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,330
if you don't have a vision,
you just drift around and you're not

31
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,164
going to be happy.

32
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,200
This is why it is so important to have
that vision.

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,010
Now,
I created that vision in Austria because

34
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:12,220
I grew up after the Second World War,
Austria,

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,890
right along with Germany.
Lost the Second World War.

36
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,630
Thank God.
Uh,

37
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,550
and the problem was that everyone was so
depressed because they lost the war,

38
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:24,970
that there was alcoholism everywhere.
There was of course depression,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,030
there was a economic situation,
there was famine,

40
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,670
there was starvation and all of those
things.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,250
And also it was kind of a little place
in narrow.

42
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,710
I felt kind of I wanted to get out of
there.

43
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:40,711
I wanted to escape and they couldn't see
myself really do work there in the state

44
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,810
of the work,
in the factory of the work on the farm

45
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,410
or the human to follow my father's
footsteps and to become a police

46
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,570
officer.
I couldn't see that either.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,090
Some havoc.
That's what my parents wanted me to do.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,750
They wanted me to become a police
officer and to marry a girl by the name

49
00:02:55,751 --> 00:03:00,160
of Heidi
and to have a bunch of children and do

50
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,160
random round like the funk trapp family
and the sound of music.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,000
But that's not what I saw.
This was the vision of my parents but

52
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,870
not mine.
And Luckily one day in school I watched

53
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,680
the documentary about America and I
found myself.

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,740
I knew exactly that is where I wanted to
end up.

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,030
I wanted to be in America.
Everything that I saw in that

56
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:25,030
documentary I just loved every was so
big.

57
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,880
I remember the tall skyscrapers,
the monsters bridges the giant freeway

58
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:34,330
is filled with beautiful cars.
The huge jetliners movie stars,

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,890
Muscle Beach and all of those things.
I could not wait to get there.

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,780
The question was just,
how do I get there?

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,090
How do I get the America?

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,610
I mean,
there's just another common thing to do.

63
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,670
Way Back in the fifties.
No one had the money to travel or

64
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,080
anything,
but one day I was fortunate enough to

65
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:58,081
see a magazine and that magazine showed
me the path to America and it was a

66
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,740
bodybuilding magazine.
On the cover was is very muscular guy

67
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,130
that was standing there like Hercules,
Hercules outfit.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,200
His name was rich park.
This rich park was on the cover and I

69
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,350
remember the cover said,
Mr. Universe becomes Hercules star.

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,920
I read the article as fast as I could,
learning about how he grew up in Leeds

71
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,700
in England,
poor and how it trained five hours a

72
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,990
day,
every single day and trained and trained

73
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:32,230
and trained and lifted weights,
and then he finally became Mr. Great

74
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,230
Britain,
and then he became Mr. Universe,

75
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,050
if anyone a second Mr. Universe,
title in the third Mr.

76
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,973
Universe,
title,

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,660
and then all of a sudden he landed in
Rome in gender chitter doing Hercules

78
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,240
movies and they made millions of dollars
and this,

79
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,480
this money.
He took embodied themselves,

80
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:53,950
that gymnasium chain in South Africa and
he became a successful gymnasium owner

81
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,320
and as I read I became more and more
certain about my own future.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
As I read this story,
I was so excited,

83
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:06,280
so interested and knew exactly that I
wanted to become another ridge park.

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,090
I know he laid out the blueprint for my
life.

85
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:15,091
Basically I could see myself,
I could visualize myself clearly to be a

86
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:20,230
champion and that same stage where he
won the Mr Universe and then to move to

87
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:23,830
America thing,
get into movies and then become rich and

88
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,460
famous.
I had that vision very clearly laid out.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,860
I was so happy that I knew exactly where
I was going from that moment on

90
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,880
everything that I did.

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,240
No matter how hard I had to grow or how
much I had to struggle,

92
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,740
it didn't matter.
It was a wonderful choice,

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,170
right?
Because I knew what the purpose was and

94
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,490
I found my passion.
The simple truth is,

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,810
if you don't have a vision,
if you don't have a goal,

96
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,510
if you don't see a future laid out in
front of you,

97
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,900
you're just floating around without the
purpose,

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,210
and I think that the numbers speak for
themselves.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,410
This is why so many people around the
world are unhappy with their jobs.

100
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,730
I mean,
in America,

101
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,230
74 percent of the people hate the job
and would like to change jobs,

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,080
but think about that.
That means that only a quarter of the

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,350
Americans love the life's work.
I mean,

104
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:20,351
that is a very depressing statistic.
I always smiled when overlooked the

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,890
middle,
how hard I grew up.

106
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,870
I always had a great time.

107
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,450
No matter what I did,
it didn't matter,

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,810
but was in bodybuilding over.
It wasn't the movie,

109
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,430
so it was this governor.
I remember in the pumping iron days,

110
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,360
people ask me in the gym all the time,
why are you smiling all the time?

111
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,570
Why are you so happy?
You have to lift 50 tons of weights.

112
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,030
You have to train five hours a day.
I mean,

113
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:45,280
I look at the other body bullets,
faces and lift the spaces and did look

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,480
kind of depressing.
That looks sour.

115
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,000
They're miserable that they have to lift
weights.

116
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,060
You look miserable,
you look happy,

117
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:56,230
and I tell them always.
I smiled because I know exactly what the

118
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,570
every rep that I do,
every set that I do,

119
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:03,770
every weight and the lift,
they get one step closer to turning that

120
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,030
vision of mind and the reality of
becoming the Mr Universe.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,180
I couldn't look weight to lift 500
pounds in the squats.

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,120
I could not wait to do another thousand
sit ups.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,410
I couldn't wait to do bench press bench
press more girls and I couldn't move my

124
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:23,411
arms anymore because I knew that every
rep got me close to the standing on that

125
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,790
stage as a champion,
so matter of fact,

126
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,460
then I lifted weights.
I didn't really feel like I was lifting

127
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:31,580
weights.
I felt like I was lifting a trophy over

128
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,930
my head each time I lifted and they'll
have all those body builders around me

129
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,170
and thousands of people screaming.

130
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,530
Can I tell you that this patient didn't
just help me in body building?

131
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,240
It helped me with everything.
Like I said,

132
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,810
I remember in the movie business,
deb was many times stunts that they had

133
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,860
to do it.
I got hurt.

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,940
That was in pain and agony and that to
do it over and over again.

135
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,930
I remember one incident specific young
Conan the barbarian.

136
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,880
There I was crawling on all fours,
on rocks,

137
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,140
over rocks and gravel,
holding my swords right in front of me

138
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,620
and us that was crawling.
The cameras followed me.

139
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,910
It was around 30 seats,
the crawl under rocks and gravel,

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,300
and eventually after 10 takes my elbows,
my knees are bleeding and hurting and

141
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,070
the director came to me.
She pushed me and said to me,

142
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,350
he says,
do you mind if we do another take?

143
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,840
I need a closeup of you?
And I said to them,

144
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,220
no,
I don't mind at all.

145
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,390
I said,
go into as many takes as you want.

146
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:39,800
This says,
no,

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,041
no,
no.

148
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,870
I don't want to do that because I know
you're in pain.

149
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:42,950
You're bleeding.
I said,

150
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:43,251
no,
no,

151
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,570
no.
I don't feel any pain.

152
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,270
I said,
the only thing I see is,

153
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:51,271
is the finished scene.
I see the finished scene of me crawling

154
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:56,591
on all fours with may sort than the
front crawling up and sneaking up behind

155
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:00,270
salsa doom,
the main building of the and movie that

156
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,290
killed my parents and rising up behind
him and cutting his head off.

157
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,430
That's what I see.

158
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
Remember,

159
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,270
crush your enemies.
See them driven before you.

160
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,160
And here the Lemann Foundation of their
women.

161
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,230
So this is why,
because I visualized that scene,

162
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,410
this is why I did not feel that pain.
I did not care if I was bleeding on my

163
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:32,810
knees because I know that pain is
temporary,

164
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,870
but the film is permanent and I
explained that to the director.

165
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,871
So this is why I tried to tell you,
always discover your vision and the rest

166
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:43,064
will follow.

167
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,420
Now,
my second,

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,170
my second rule is never ever think
small.

169
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,490
If you're going to accomplish anything,
you have to think big.

170
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,810
You have to go and shoot for the stars.
The biggest challenge most people have

171
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,740
is because they think small.
The reason why people think small and

172
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,330
why did you choose small little goals is
because they're afraid to fail.

173
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,090
They know that if you shoot for big
goal,

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,130
then the chances of failing of very high
and they're afraid of failing is one of

175
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,570
the most common things.
Why people are frozen by the book make a

176
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,280
moving live because they're scared of
failing.

177
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,170
I said to myself,
Hey,

178
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm not worried about failing because
that's part of life.

179
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,550
You're not going to go going when
everything and how far can you fall?

180
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,520
Look at this.
This is the ground that's as far as I

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,790
can fall.
Didn't know something that the only time

182
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,791
you really considered the failure is if
you fall and you don't get up,

183
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,980
but if you get up,
you'll never considered a failure.

184
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,720
So I never considered myself a failure.
I always considered myself a window even

185
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:55,980
though I fell every so often,
but I always got up and I always move

186
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,823
forward.

187
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,580
This is the important thing.
I never had any patients of course,

188
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,030
thinking small because in German we have
a saying,

189
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,730
Ben Shahn,
Dan,

190
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,550
Sean,
that means that if it was something

191
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,150
thing,
go all out and do it.

192
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,640
Well,
this was not just the case in

193
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,830
bodybuilding.
I didn't just want to be a bodybuilding

194
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,920
champion.
I wanted to be the greatest bodybuilder

195
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,600
four times.
I wondered if the muscle,

196
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,420
the muscle of all times,
the most definition.

197
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,060
I wanted the window.
Most trophies,

198
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,660
the most world championship titles.
I just wanted to be the best in the same

199
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,300
as Jose movies.
I didn't just think about being in

200
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:33,110
movies,
no,

201
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,830
I wanted to be a movie star.
I wanted to have above the title

202
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,230
building.
I wanted to become the highest paid

203
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,260
entertainer.
I basically wanted to be another John

204
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,640
Wayne.
What's wrong with that?

205
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,120
And then the same as in politics.
I didn't just want to go and be in

206
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,390
politics and end the,
uh,

207
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,040
raised for city council.
I'm in,

208
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,260
let's be honest,
the said sound bites.

209
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,420
What's Nega city council?
No,

210
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:04,490
come on.
What's that guy?

211
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,410
May or no,
it had to be schwartzenegger running for

212
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,870
governor,
but not just any governor,

213
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,770
but governor of the greatest state in
the United States of California.

214
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,480
That was the important thing.

215
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,480
I give you an example of big thinking
big when that became governor wanted to

216
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:25,690
rebuild cody corneas,
ancient infrastructure.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,610
You see,
America has been living off

218
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,780
infrastructure that was built in the
fifties and sixties and it drives me

219
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,810
absolutely insane that America hasn't
started rebuilding that infrastructure.

220
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,380
I mean,
we invested in new roads or new transit

221
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,380
on schools,
so in energy or anything like that for

222
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:47,050
decades,
the number of cars that we have,

223
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,320
nine America have four times as many as
we had in the sixties,

224
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,190
so therefore we should be having four
times as many freeways,

225
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,980
four times as many tunnels for them,
many bridges and orders,

226
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,670
but we don't.
So this is why I wanted to get our act

227
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:03,950
together and do the upgrading least in
California.

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,120
So when I talk about infrastructure,
didn't really want to just fix roads and

229
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,980
fixing close some holes in the roads.
I wanted to build massive free on top of

230
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:16,190
freeways.
I wanted to build the first high speed

231
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,700
rail in the United States.
I wanted to build what bridges and

232
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,080
tunnels were on ramps and off ramps.
I wanted to see literally cranes

233
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,060
everywhere.
Well,

234
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,700
there was no excuse for us to get stuck
in traffic and there was no excuse

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,490
really to send your kids in overcrowded
classrooms and schools and there was

236
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:39,491
also no excuse that Los Angeles has a
100 year old sewage system that's

237
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:40,790
shitty.
I think

238
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,980
at first,
of course some of the legislators looked

239
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,010
at me like I was absolutely insane.
Mentor told him this vision.

240
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,830
They were willing to spend maybe $5
million dollars,

241
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,010
which of course is petty cash.
He can be to what my vision was,

242
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,450
but so some politicians hip hop to see
the big picture because they didn't

243
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:04,760
really ever travel outside California.
So they haven't really seen big

244
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,890
infrastructure.
They haven't really seen big

245
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,540
infrastructure all over the United
States or maybe in Asia,

246
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:14,030
in China or in Korea or in Brazil or in
European countries or here in Australia

247
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,250
maybe.
So they haven't seen that.

248
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,310
And then of course the other politicians
that simply don't have a vision of the

249
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,030
future past the next election,
which is a common one.

250
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,420
Politicians of all over the world.
So it is.

251
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,430
It was my job as governor to motivate
them and to take them into.

252
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:35,720
To see the traffic jams in Los Angeles
and to see the overcrowded classrooms

253
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:39,410
and to see all the problems that be
happy to keep pushing and pushing the

254
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,410
pump them up enough that eventually this
salt,

255
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,030
the big picture and eventually Democrats
and Republicans came together.

256
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,670
It'd be invested $60,
million dollars.

257
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,340
You'll be billed California
infrastructure,

258
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,300
the biggest investment of our state in
50 years.

259
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,690
So that's what we did because we had a
big vision and everyone bought in on

260
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,580
this big vision.
So remember,

261
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,910
never think small.
Think big.

262
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,920
My third role is ignore the naysayers.
I think it is natural that we have the

263
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,980
big vision and big dreams and you have
big goals that people are gonna say

264
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,470
around you.
I don't think it can be done.

265
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,660
I think it's impossible or no,
I tell you this all the time,

266
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,810
but I want to tell you,
don't ever let them stop you from

267
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:34,811
dreaming and from shooting for the Gore
because eliminators simply those words,

268
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:39,320
no impossible and it can't be done.
I mean,

269
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,530
in each one of my careers when someone
said it's impossible,

270
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,270
I heard it's possible when someone said
it can't be done.

271
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,680
I heard it can be done,
and when someone said no,

272
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,990
then I heard loud and clear.
Yes,

273
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,340
so this is what I believe.
I am a big believer of what Nelson

274
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,570
Mandela said.
He said,

275
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:04,571
it always seems to be impossible until
someone does it and that's exactly

276
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,040
exactly what it is.
And I wanted to beat that one.

277
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,920
That does it.
I wanted to break the new records and I

278
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:12,230
wanted to do something that no one else
has ever done.

279
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,560
So I think that's what you need to do.
Don't ever be worried about that.

280
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,010
Someone hasn't done it.
Just think about how many times my

281
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,380
career would have stopped.
My career would have ended if I would

282
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,830
have listened to the naysayers.
I mean,

283
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,150
it started right away when I was 15
years old and I became a bodybuilder

284
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,860
right after it happened.
I said,

285
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,770
I want to be a world champion in
bodybuilding.

286
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,910
I want to be missed or universe.
They immediately said,

287
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,890
are you crazy?
You're in Austria in Australia can

288
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:44,030
become a ski champion or bicycle
champion or something like that,

289
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,640
but bodybuilding is an American sport.
Forget about it.

290
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,990
It's nuts.
Then men,

291
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,690
they wanted to move to America.
They said again,

292
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,360
it's impossible.
You will never be able to do that.

293
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:55,040
You have no money.
Your by yourself.

294
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,990
And then when I wanted to go into show
business after I won 13 world

295
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:04,160
championship titles in bodybuilding,
I said,

296
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,790
I'm want to the park.
I want to be a hercules.

297
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,030
I want to get into movies.
Well,

298
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,400
I tell you,
when I met those agents and managers in

299
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:16,400
studio executives,
their reaction was

300
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,370
so funny.
You want to be what?

301
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,350
Leading,
man.

302
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,423
Oh,
come on.

303
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,293
I mean,
look,

304
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,420
first of all,
let's start with your body with your

305
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:29,720
body.

306
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,200
I mean,
you overdeveloped your gigantic.

307
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,790
You're like a monster.
Are you kidding me?

308
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,370
Do you know what the news thing?
The new trend is?

309
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,110
His little guys like Dustin Hoffman,
our Pachino.

310
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,430
Woody Allen does set a new sex symbols.
Sonia,

311
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,720
get it,
and then your accent.

312
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,070
Oh,
it gives me the chills.

313
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,690
Just listening to your German bullshit.
Come on now,

314
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,310
I mean.
Oh God.

315
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,650
I mean it's that good.
Scary when you talk.

316
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,720
It's unbelievable.
I mean,

317
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,780
have you ever.
I mean this year is,

318
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,110
have you ever seen an international
movie?

319
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,170
Stop the German accent.
It doesn't happen.

320
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,050
Forget about that.
And then your name,

321
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,180
what is it?
What's the Schnitzel or something like

322
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:12,991
that?
Yeah,

323
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,030
I can see that name already up there and
the billboard years and people are going

324
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:21,590
to storm the theater,
the movie houses because what's starting

325
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,010
to move it?
Oh yeah,

326
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,120
I can see that already.

327
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,630
So that's what they said.
They said to me and says,

328
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,070
look,
forget about that.

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,530
You're a nice guy.
I mean your body building champion,

330
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:35,410
why don't you
or health food store or something like

331
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,560
that.
He can help with that.

332
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,250
And then it.
Yeah,

333
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,380
the side.
Some little pots like maybe playing a

334
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,930
bouncer.
I mean did your body perfect or maybe a

335
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,620
wrestler.
Oh I have a good idea.

336
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:51,010
But you accent the Nazi officer now.
That's really great for you.

337
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,650
I called my buddies over at Hogan's
heroes.

338
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,320
I mean they would probably use someone
like you.

339
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,760
So that's when they said imagine that
every way I turned.

340
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,511
They said,
no,

341
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,670
it won't happen.
It's not going to happen and forget

342
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:06,430
about it.
Luckily I did not listen.

343
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,800
I didn't listen because I knew if I
worked hard enough and I've.

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,690
I grew up as hard as I did embody
willing five,

345
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,630
six hours a day that I will make it,
that I could prove them wrong.

346
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,470
And I started working very hard.
I started taking acting classes,

347
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,050
English classes,
speech classes,

348
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,830
dialog classes,
even accent removal classes.

349
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,580
I ran around all day saying lines like a
fine wine grows and the binder

350
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,270
goes.
You see the Austrians and Germans have a

351
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:41,950
difficult time with the B and w and did
the FBI get it on big stuff.

352
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,010
So it was a fine wine grows on a vine or
the sink is made out of zinc and all

353
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
those kind of lines is it over and over
and you know something.

354
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,630
All of a sudden I got a little break in
the early seventies.

355
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:58,760
I remember all of a sudden I got a TV
show,

356
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,570
a little part.
Then another little part and then all of

357
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:06,220
a sudden I got a phone call from Lucille
ball to be in her special happy

358
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,880
anniversary and goodbye,
which was with Connie.

359
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,550
I had this six minute scene as an
Italian,

360
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,400
Missouri that most people don't get the
difference between an Italian accent in

361
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,960
the German accent,
so I got away with my German accent,

362
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,430
but I played this Italian Mr and I was
so delighted and then right after that I

363
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,180
got that guest starring role in streets
of San Francisco with Michael Douglas

364
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:31,390
and Karl Malden and then pumping on and
stay hungry.

365
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,870
And then of course I landed the big role
as Conan the barbarian.

366
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,970
So finally I got the big,
big break.

367
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,220
It was so interesting about it was that
soon as we were finished with the Conan

368
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,980
movie,
we were out there on a promotion to a

369
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,050
and the director said that the press
conference,

370
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,530
the directors,
John [inaudible],

371
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,250
he said,
if we wouldn't have had what's Watson

372
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,790
that go with those muscles,
we would have had to build one.

373
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,620
They'll think about that before.
It was this huge obstacle to have this

374
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,750
body and all of a sudden the director
says,

375
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,790
if he wouldn't have had schwartzenegger
going to be this body,

376
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,390
we would have had to build one now.
What a turn around,

377
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,080
and then when I did Terminator James
Cameron said,

378
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,880
which was really great.
He said that I'll be back.

379
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,560
Became one of the most famous movie
lines in history because of Arnold's

380
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,880
crazy accent because he sounded like a
machine.

381
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,800
So as you see everything that the
naysayers said was a liability became an

382
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,890
asset.
Same as also in my political Korea.

383
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,230
When I ran for governor,
they immediately said,

384
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,780
I shouldn't do it.
It is a big mistake.

385
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,000
It won't happen.
I will lose and all those kinds of

386
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,010
things that the rest of course is
history.

387
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,510
The bottom line is,
if I would have this is my career would

388
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:58,511
have ended up and that was 15 years old.
I will be still yodeling in Austria in

389
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:01,040
the Alps and that would not be talking
here.

390
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,850
The day the you and the reason why I'm
here today in talking to you is just

391
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,700
because it did not listen to you can't
though.

392
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,200
It's impossible or no,
so I just recommend to you very strongly

393
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,750
ignore the naysayers.

394
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Is Brooke your ass off?
Nobody ever stumbled up on success by

395
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:35,131
accident except maybe the guy who found
gold in California,

396
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,300
but don't ever think that you can be
that guy.

397
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,630
I'm an idiot.
You never want to fail because you

398
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:45,980
didn't work hard enough.
I always believed no stone unturned.

399
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,720
Work your butt off.
That's what I always believed.

400
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,730
The middle.
What you do,

401
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,810
Brooke.
Brooke,

402
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,090
Brooke.
I remember Mohammed Ali,

403
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,040
one of my great heroes,
had a great line in the seventies when

404
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,420
he's.
When he was asked how many sit ups you

405
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,010
do?
He said,

406
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,300
I don't know because I started counting.
Only when it starts burning,

407
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,290
it starts burning.
That's when it starts counting.

408
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,510
You see?
That's what makes you a champion.

409
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,230
It doesn't matter what area you're in.
No pain,

410
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,190
no gain.
The bottom line is one of my rules,

411
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,320
which is broke your butt off if you
don't apply that rule,

412
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,360
all the other rules won't mean anything.

413
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,960
I mean,
it drives me absolutely nuts when people

414
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:34,160
say,
I don't have time to work out who got

415
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,140
that many times I don't know if I'm too
broke out or I have worked so hard all

416
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,100
day.
I'm tired.

417
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,520
I cannot work out anymore.
Oh,

418
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,530
I cannot read another book or I improve
myself or I don't have time or whatever.

419
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,100
Work so hard that I cannot really
improve my business or I can grow as a

420
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,240
person or any of those things.
What the hell of it?

421
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,090
Talking about here,
I mean today is 24 hours.

422
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,690
You sleep six hours,
so you have 18 hours left.

423
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,180
I mean,
I know there's some of you out there

424
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:05,631
that say,
well,

425
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,730
wait a minute.
I asleep actually eight hours,

426
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,830
but it's asleep fast.
Okay.

427
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,460
You didn't get bogged down with this
stuff here.

428
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,290
Listening to.
I came to the United States.

429
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:23,291
I remember that I trained five hours a
day every day and it was managing a

430
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:28,751
construction business and that was a
brick layer and I went to college also

431
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,320
and that took acting classes from 8:00
at night to 12,

432
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,130
midnight of that in one day.
Every day I did that.

433
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,970
I did not worry about it.
I knew that at 24 hours and I didn't

434
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:45,530
want to waste one single hour because I
believe Ted Turner said,

435
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,070
was one of the great under Brunner's who
started CNN and so on.

436
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,250
He said,
early to bed early to rise.

437
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,660
Grew up like hell and advertise.
So that's what I believe.

438
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,560
Just remember,
you can climb that ladder of success

439
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,920
with your hands in your pockets.
You must work your ass off.

440
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,063
It said simple.

441
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,930
My fifth and last rule is don't just
take,

442
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,100
give something back.
Leave your mark in the world.

443
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,480
I believe that we all have an obligation
to do something for our community,

444
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,480
something for our state and something
for our country.

445
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,410
We must show good cause to this greater
than ourselves because we all know that

446
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,720
in the end we will be judged not by how
much we made,

447
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,180
the how much we give.
Ever since America greeted maybe dope

448
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,490
moms.
I've had this sense of responsibility

449
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,610
and I felt obligated to give something
back to America because I know that

450
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:52,700
everything that I have accomplished is
because of America.

451
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,450
If it's my body building career,
if it is my show,

452
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,310
Business Korea,
my political career,

453
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,320
the money they've made,
a great family that I have.

454
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,400
All of this is because of America,
but I have to recognize the fact that

455
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:09,440
America did not become the land of
opportunity in this great country by

456
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,274
itself.

457
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,150
No in history,
people work tirelessly in America.

458
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,770
People fought and died to make it the
land of freedom and opportunity in the

459
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:23,030
land of liberty.
So now it is our responsibility.

460
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,020
If we want to keep it the number one
country in the world to grow up for that

461
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,690
and to give something back to that
country.

462
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,580
And it doesn't matter if you're in
America,

463
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:35,240
if you're in Australia or if you're in
China or in Japan or in Italy,

464
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,740
it's the same thing.
You all have to give something back to

465
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,690
your country,
and by the way,

466
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:45,360
you from the love,
the words of my father in law,

467
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,270
Sargent Shriver,
who started the peace corps,

468
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,500
job corps,
legal aid to the poor during the Kennedy

469
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:56,960
and during the Johnson Administration.
He was the number one public servant

470
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,550
that he always inspired me to become a
public servant.

471
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,200
He was one of my heroes.

472
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,460
He's said at Yale University of the
commencement speech.

473
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,880
He said to the students here at Miro,
he had down that mirror that makes you

474
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:16,830
always look at yourself and you will be
able to look beyond that mural and you

475
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:20,760
will see the millions and millions of
people that need your help.

476
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,480
And I saw those millions and millions of
people,

477
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,280
and this is why I tried to take every
opportunity that I could give something

478
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,460
back.
I started training special Olympians.

479
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,730
People did went intellectually
handicapped to help them with weight

480
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,410
lifting and power lifting.
I became the national power lifting

481
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,350
coach and the torch torchbearer for
Special Olympics,

482
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,730
then laid on a joint,
the Simon Wiesenthal Center to fight

483
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,210
prejudice so we don't have the things
happening again.

484
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,790
Uh,
as we had during the Second World War,

485
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,410
during the Nazi Reich,

486
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,153
ed,

487
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,270
I joined also the president's council on
fitness that became the chairman or the

488
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:09,271
President Bush from 1990 to 1993 a to be
the German and to promote health and

489
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:13,090
fitness in all 50 states at Robert.
All 50 states.

490
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,380
I started afterschool programs for the
most vulnerable children for inner city

491
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,530
children to make them be able to say no
to drugs,

492
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:25,360
no to gangs and violence and to say yes
to education and yes,

493
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:30,040
the life and every single time I reached
out and I gave something back,

494
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,250
I felt fantastic.
Nothing made me happier.

495
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,690
I would rather play chess with an eight
year old kid in an afterschool program

496
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,380
or play golf around the golf with a
special Olympian and go down another red

497
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:47,240
carpet of a movie premiere.
And I have nothing against movies or to

498
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:50,950
give something back to me is more
important than just to think about

499
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:51,784
myself.

500
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,900
Eventually.
The joy of giving back was so great that

501
00:28:55,901 --> 00:29:00,400
I decided to become a public show
fulltime and determined by back.

502
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,800
I should walk away from my career as an
actor.

503
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,710
After they're finished promoting
terminated three,

504
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,640
I jumped into the race,
into the governor's race in California,

505
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,540
and that ran for governor.
And even though my friends advised me

506
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,550
not to do that,
they said,

507
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,850
are you crazy?
Don't you understand that you would lose

508
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:23,770
now this 20 to $30,000,000 a movie that
you're getting paid and they will only

509
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:28,771
pay you $178,000 as governor year?
Well,

510
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:33,500
I didn't care because I knew that all
the money that I've made and the being

511
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,940
that position in the first place to make
this money is because of America.

512
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,200
It was time to give something back.
So I became governor.

513
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,360
I didn't even take the $178,000.
I give it back to the taxpayers because

514
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,540
it was petty cash.
It's the last thing I needed

515
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,080
and I can tell you that

516
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,140
that those seven years were the most
exciting and the most rewarding and the

517
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:03,141
most gratifying years of my life to work
all day long to solve problems and to

518
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:09,201
serve the people was absolutely heaven.
He was the best job I've ever had,

519
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,240
but they also knew that eventually it's
going to come to an ent enough to two

520
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:17,610
terms.
It did come to an end,

521
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,940
but then he came to an end.
The one thing that didn't come to an

522
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:24,720
aunt and was not finished was my desire
to be a public servant and just to have

523
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:28,380
the people,
and this is why I continued to grow for

524
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:31,710
Special Olympics.
That's why I continued to grow on

525
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:35,610
fighting my fitness crusade and
traveling around the world to promote

526
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:40,020
health and fitness and this is why I
continue to support afterschool programs

527
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,280
and be even started the Watson institute
at the University of Southern California

528
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,200
to continue to inspire students and
leaders around the world.

529
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,500
To find solutions to complicated issues
and to give back to make the world a

530
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:57,600
better place.
So because.

531
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,390
Yeah,
but I tell you

532
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,270
that I was very fortunate that I had
great heroes,

533
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,020
great heroes that they could look up to,
and I mentioned two of them,

534
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:13,570
Mohammed Ali and Sargent Shriver,
my father in law,

535
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,300
but there's other great heroes like
Gorbachev,

536
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,010
Reagan,
Mandela,

537
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,090
great leaders like Mother Teresa,
chancellor Kohl and Churchill,

538
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:24,390
and the list goes on and on.
I mean,

539
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:26,890
this people had such an impact on the
world,

540
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,030
single handedly changed the world.
I mean,

541
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:32,790
if you think about,
just go up at Jeff.

542
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,350
I mean this man.
Every time I meet him,

543
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,360
I'm in all.
I mean,

544
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:41,090
he grew up on the communism and he rose
from the bottom of the rank,

545
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:45,340
straight up to the top.
He can president of the Soviet Union,

546
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,010
one of the most powerful people in the
world,

547
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,960
and he was the lead of the Communist
Party and Benny wasn't a top position.

548
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,920
He realized that the system was broken.

549
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,860
Now what do you do when you at the top
leader of the Communist Party and do

550
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,790
realize that the system,
that communism doesn't work well.

551
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,271
You know,
what did,

552
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:12,190
did he dismantled communism?
Think about the courage that it takes.

553
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,380
Guts did it takes to do that.
Think about the Gorbachev completely

554
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:21,790
transformed his country with class,
knows to give his people for the first

555
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:25,030
time,
freedom and dance through perestroika,

556
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,360
reforming Russia's economy.
He didn't wait for the next president.

557
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,310
He didn't complain.
He simply said,

558
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,970
if not me,
who and if not now,

559
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,830
when,
so I feel very strongly,

560
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,420
all of us need to have an embrace.
That kind of spirit.

561
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,250
We all can create change whether it is
not a neighborhood or in our local

562
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:52,340
schools or in our country.
He can be big,

563
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:56,740
but it can also be as little as just
going to a school kit that has problems

564
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,170
reading and teaching kids how to read or
how to do math.

565
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,130
We don't have to just work on me.
We should also work on we,

566
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,840
not just me,
but also remember that lead a truly full

567
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:16,070
live you must give back.
You must leave the world a better place

568
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:21,071
than you found it is.
The bottom line is it is up to us.

569
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I mean those rules that I've given you.
Important rules,

570
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,340
but giving back is one of the most
important rules.

571
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,150
I guarantee you that if you follow all
those rules,

572
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,240
you will have many victories to
celebrate.

573
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,980
You will leave,
you know you're broke and you have

574
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,930
extraordinary kind of a record and you
will leave a legacy behind that you can

575
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:52,490
be proud of.
So I want you to remember those rules.

576
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,610
Have a vision.
Think big.

577
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:01,190
Ignore the naysayers.
Work your ass off and give back and

578
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:05,390
change the world because if not us,
who,

579
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,430
if not,
now when.
