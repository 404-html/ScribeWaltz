1
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,733
Why not?
Now?

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,350
This is a good time.
As the 20th century starts to wind down

3
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,450
a few more years as we get ready for
century 21,

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,440
what a good time to set your goals,
work on yourself,

5
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:35,020
work on your skills.
What a good time to get it together?

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,740
What a good time to start this process,
personal development,

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,090
growing,
changing,

8
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:43,510
developing,
having a good plan for your money and

9
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,500
for your life and for your future.
Why not was

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,540
no opportunity is wasted.
Listen to me carefully.

11
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,240
God,
let's do me very carefully.

12
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,690
You got to hear what I'm saying.
This is important.

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,910
They're 86,000,
400 seconds in a day and if you maximize

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,360
each and every one of them,
you will live like you want to live.

15
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:11,630
You will have what you want to have and
you will be what you want to be.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,450
You can have more than you've got
because you can become more than you

17
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:22,230
are.
If you just remain how you are,

18
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,850
you'll always have what you've got,
but if you're willing to make changes,

19
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,390
the next five years of your life can be
totally different than the last one.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,480
If you don't change,
chances are excellent.

21
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:35,520
The next five will be like the last
fall.

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,070
For things to change,
you've got to change for things to get

23
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:46,050
better.
It's not what happens that determines

24
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,810
your future.
It's what you do about what happens.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,420
Direction determines destination.
All you got to do is make a little

26
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,380
change in direction to arrive at a brand
new destination in two years,

27
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,640
three years,
five years,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
user have to change your life.
That is.

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,700
She kind of said,
you know what?

30
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,940
My body is on there.
I'm going to go work out.

31
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,840
My relationship isn't there.
I'm going to change it.

32
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,810
I'm not making what are going to make.
I'm going to retool.

33
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,150
I'm going to get a new skill.
I'm going to go back to school.

34
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm going to start a business.
I'm going to do something.

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,370
You have to do something to change your
life or in order for you to be happy.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,780
You can't change your life.
You're going to have to change your

37
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,120
blueprint.
Usually in life.

38
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,490
It requires a little bit of beach.
Does that make sense?

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,480
And if you've changed your take,
change your life and change your

40
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,160
blueprint.
You can have an extraordinary life

41
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,600
because all of us are going to have
times in our life when we want or think

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,630
life should be like,
isn't gonna match how life really is?

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,230
Those moments?
If we blame our life goes into pain.

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,560
If we change,
we can change our life and match our

45
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:54,561
blueprint.
The fact that you're not happy has

46
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,880
nothing to do with what you have or
don't have.

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,250
The fact that you're an unhappy is that
your life doesn't match the way you

48
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,940
think it should be.
You have some idea of how you think it

49
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
should be.

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,260
Listen to me.
There are.

51
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,450
Those of you are.
What you're doing is that they're are 10

52
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,850
opportunities in a day and you're taking
advantage of it.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,020
If you think you're doing something
right.

54
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,850
Yeah,
you gotta hear me,

55
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,840
you gotta hear me.
You only have 24 hours in a day,

56
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,090
and you've heard me say this time and
time again,

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
the way you spend your 24 hours,
it determines how you live.

58
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,550
If you want the future to change for
you,

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,240
you've got to change.
If you don't change,

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,600
the next six years of your life is going
to be just like the last six.

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,490
You'll still be behind on your bills.
You'll still be behind on your promises.

62
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,130
No opportunity wasted.
Again,

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,830
no opportunity wasted.

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,900
If one of us can do it,
hey,

65
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,630
we all can do it.
Now,

66
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:57,090
here's my last question.
Why not?

67
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:57,924
Now

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,290
we all have this negative self talk that
goes in our head.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,950
Guess what?
There's enough people that are telling

70
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,920
us we can't do it,
that we're not good enough.

71
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Why do we want to tell ourselves that we
know for fact that thoughts influence

72
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,110
actions.
We sat there with the,

73
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,430
um,
with the video sheldon,

74
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,970
Dr Levy,
so right.

75
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,820
We know that our thoughts influence
actions.

76
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,880
Why do we want to see that negative self
talk to ourselves?

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,930
We need to get our own self-affirmation.
Muhammad Ali,

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,040
what was his self affirmation?
I am the greatest.

79
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,770
Who else is going to tell you you need
to be quiet moments in your bedroom,

80
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,860
quiet moments when you're brushing your
teeth that we need to reaffirm,

81
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,970
I am the captain of my ship and the
master of my fate.

82
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,480
That is my affirmation and looking
forward to a time that I would feel good

83
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,050
again,
helped me to keep moving forward and

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,500
sometimes I had to be brave and it
wasn't always easy.

85
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,890
Sometimes I faltered,
I had bad days,

86
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,520
but I realized that being brave is
supposed to be easy.

87
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,090
And for me,
I feel it's the key way to keep moving

88
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,850
forward.
So all at all,

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,850
I don't waste energy feeling bad for
myself.

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,850
Uh,
I surround myself with people that I

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,460
want to be with and I keep moving
forward.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,930
So with this philosophy,
I hope that all of you,

93
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,940
regardless of your obstacles,
can have a very happy life as well.

94
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,680
Shit,
if I don't see it,

95
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,590
if I don't believe you that no one else
will

96
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,620
get the people.
There's enough of that Mohammed Ali.

97
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,380
I am the greatest.
There is no one better than me.

98
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,340
It's a difference between Hubris and ego
and false pride.

99
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,120
It's just reminding yourself and quiet
silent moments.

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,390
I put it down on the list.
It's right beside my mirror

101
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,970
in Russia
and Japan ever met in,

102
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,280
made in America the whole world,
but better than all of those before.

103
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,910
Thank you.

104
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm not gonna argue with you.
You're going to be just like some of

105
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,350
your already there.
Well,

106
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,760
you don't know how you're going to make
this happen,

107
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,110
but you just feel within yourself some
way somehow with the help of God,

108
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm going to make it happen.
Repeat after me please.

109
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,910
No matter how bad it is,
oh,

110
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:16,911
how bad it gets.
I'm going to make it.

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,890
I'm going to make it
shake someone's hand on your right and

112
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:28,891
left and say you got the right stuff.
So yes,

113
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,570
it's possible for you to live your dream
because it's not about where you come

114
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,590
from.
It's about.

115
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,850
That's number one.
Number two.

116
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,370
Number two,
I want to make sure you got it.

117
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,750
Isn't as
though the important thing is this

118
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,420
right?
Mom said,

119
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,200
listen to me.
The most important thing is to be able

120
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,270
to sacrifice what for what
alligator.

121
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,930
Adam handcuff lightening undone jail.
Last week I'm murdering Angelo stone.

122
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,790
Hospitalized the brick eric.

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm so mean.
I make medicine sick

124
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,730
fast,
fast,

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,330
fast.
Last night I cut the light off in my

126
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,550
bedroom.
Get switched.

127
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,040
Was in the band for the room.
Was dog better fast?

128
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,510
You George Foreman.
Oh,

129
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,740
you chumps bow.
When I whip him.

130
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh,
I know you got him.

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,820
I know you got him picked,
but the man's in tomorrow.

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,870
I'm going to show you how great I am.

133
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,330
A lot of people tried to talk her side
of it.

134
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,330
A lot of people didn't understand it
by the people weren't ready for it.

135
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,890
Ready for it,
but I want to remind you mind to

136
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:24,430
continue to dream
and dream big.

137
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,293
Dream big.

138
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,440
They didn't call my name.

139
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,550
Go for you to live life with regrets.
I want you to remember this.

140
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,620
Every time you walk in the room
with anybody,

141
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,623
anybody,
right

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,120
know that you're special.
No that you mean something to this

143
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,073
world.

144
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,090
I don't care what you started at.
I don't care who told you what you

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
couldn't.
I believe

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,790
I don't care if nobody liked your
status,

147
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,510
family members turning back on
negative.

148
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,560
People want to keep coming to your life.
There's a bigger dream waiting for you,

149
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,260
waiting
for you to step into it,

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
a bit to it,
to step into it.

151
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Your life is big.
Your life is huge,

152
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,740
huge,
and we spend so much time wanting to be

153
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,200
in somebody else's life.

154
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,710
When I was young,
I had a lot of people telling me,

155
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,230
you have to adjust to the other ones,
the other ones,

156
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,750
you have to be like the other ones.
I was listening,

157
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:31,210
but I wasn't always following.
I dragged it in.

158
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,420
How do you say I was listening,
but I did my own thing,

159
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,210
my own thing.
I kept doing my own thing and I believed

160
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:41,500
in myself.
I kept going and it brought me where I

161
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,970
am today.
Confidence in believing what you do.

162
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,810
I think that is the goal.
Target

163
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,800
have to be relentless.

164
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,560
You have to never let off the gas.
Gas,

165
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,990
never stop,
never quit.

166
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Never allow anyone to talk you out
of the dream division and ideas that God

167
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,710
has sent you.
It doesn't matter how many times you get

168
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:12,420
knocked down.
It's about getting back up,

169
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,400
so if there's any kid out there that's
told by a parent or a coach or a teacher

170
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,250
or somebody that they look up to,
somebody that's supposed to push them

171
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,870
and believe in them and they're told,
no,

172
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,860
don't listen to them.
Believe in yourself.

173
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,620
Sometimes the outcome isn't always what
you desire it to be,

174
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,530
but the true failure in life is not
trying at all

175
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,900
and the master
no

176
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,670
get in line just because other people
are.

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,970
I'm only talking to the people that are
ready to get to the next level of a life

178
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:03,971
in their career and they're going to
boldly walk into the next season of

179
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,480
their life.
Unapologetically getting rid of all

180
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:12,460
things people in situations that no
longer belong in their life.

181
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,860
Most of you,
most of you,

182
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,970
you're so consumed
with everything that's going on in the

183
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,330
world.
This is the reason you haven't figured

184
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:35,310
out your own life yet.
Every blog,

185
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,110
every website,
every tweet,

186
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,230
every instagram post,
you are so consumed with everything

187
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:48,450
that's going on in the world.
You're ignoring your own world.

188
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
You can never shine trying to sit on
someone else's son.

189
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,470
You can never figure out who you are if
you're consumed in everything that

190
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,980
everybody else is and what they're doing
in the moves that they're making because

191
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:09,360
you're trying to chase someone else's
life trying to chase someone else's

192
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:14,270
lifestyle and identity all while
ignoring your own life and your own

193
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,090
path.
What is the vision for your life?

194
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,540
What are the ideas and the dreams for
your life?

195
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,690
What are you supposed to be doing?
Who are you?

196
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:28,100
What are your gifts and talents?
What is your ultimate destiny and your

197
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:28,934
goals

198
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,800
and you should understand this,
that it was always going to be your

199
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:37,880
family and your friends.
That would be the first ones to try and

200
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,130
talk you out of your vision and your big
idea.

201
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,250
That's why you supposed to live your
life,

202
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,730
focused on your intentions and do your
thing.

203
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,400
Did you allow yourself

204
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,550
to be based on what other people think
of you?

205
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,980
Is the beginning of the end,
I believe in me.

206
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,890
If you stopped believing in me,
I'm not going to believe in myself any

207
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,310
less.
If you believe that I'm irrelevant,

208
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,840
that no one is checking for me and that
I don't mean anything to the world

209
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,600
because you think or believe that about
me,

210
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,480
it doesn't mean that I'm going to
believe it about myself.

211
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,770
See,
the day that you start living your life

212
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,780
according to everybody else's opinion is
the beginning of the hand.

213
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,510
Most of you guys don't actually know
your self worth.

214
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,240
You don't know yourself.
Value,

215
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,610
believe in yourself.
Believe in yourself,

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,860
independent of the validation of the
world.

217
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,580
I have opinions and feelings about
yourself,

218
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,260
independent of the feedback.

219
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
I really think,

220
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,430
and if you get rid of the trash in your
life,

221
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,120
that can be people,
business and situations.

222
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,050
Youtube couldn't really like.
I really believe that you can reach your

223
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:16,910
full potential.
I want you

224
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,800
to fly.
I want you in your career and your

225
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,490
financial blessings to bypass me.

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,610
When I was a kid,
I can go through,

227
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:43,150
um,
a math book in a week.

228
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:48,151
So I'm going to have chocolate Ganache,
stockbroker,

229
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,360
stop focusing,
not an astronaut,

230
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,200
but I listened to what Jim Bob on will
say at 21 years,

231
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,940
the most poignant seven words ever
uttered in any speech anywhere.

232
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,300
Don't give up.
Don't ever give up.

233
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,790
Those great people didn't.
So I now have a responsibility to also

234
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:39,130
not ever give up.
I'm not special.

235
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,350
I just listened to what the man said,

236
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,800
but I'd say there is some times in life
where you fall down,

237
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,190
feel like,
like you don't have the strength to get

238
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:55,191
back on.
I will try 100 times to get up and if I

239
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:01,980
fail 100 times,
if I fail and I give up,

240
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,750
do you think that I'm ever going to get
up

241
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,760
and fail and try again and again and
again.

242
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,150
For as long as I'm trying to getting up,
don't quit.

243
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,340
The secret is not keeping up.
Everybody who's done something great,

244
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:24,341
they weren't that deep resiliency.
They have the ability to bounce back all

245
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,260
the way.
Just

246
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,100
stay on course.
I guarantee you cannot pass it.

247
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,800
If you quit.
I guarantee you,

248
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,310
you don't know what's going to happen.
If you keep going,

249
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm prejudiced,
I feel pain.

250
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,490
I heard I opened my eyes.
A great victory.

251
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,470
Do not give up.
I feel no fear.

252
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,640
I fear no man.
I create.

253
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,060
Conquer that.
Hold the power.

254
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,470
Make a choice.
Just decide what is going to be,

255
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,840
who you're going to be,
how you're going to do it.

256
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:17,841
Just decide and then from that point the
universe is going to get out your way.

257
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,120
We can have another bad year.
You got to get to the point where enough

258
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,420
is enough.
It's much easier to come up with excuses

259
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,320
why you can't do it.
If you do what is easy,

260
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,040
your life will be hard.
If you do want to say is complain about

261
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:44,220
your situation and circumstances,
surrender and give up on your dreams.

262
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,450
Become depressed and bitter and angry.
Anybody can do that.

263
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:51,210
If you do what is easy,
your life will be hard,

264
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,850
would have you do what is Paul?
Keep coming back again and again and

265
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:59,850
again.
Get up dressed every day.

266
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,870
Take life,
taking life by the column.

267
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,540
You say,
yes,

268
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I can do this,
and you've said to yourself,

269
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm willing to face the nose.
I'm willing,

270
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,300
I'm willing to.
I'm willing to make this happen.

271
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,100
It's,
it's possible.

272
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,920
It's necessary.
It's hard.

273
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,550
It's worth it to do whatever it takes.
I can do it.

274
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:41,500
If anybody has ever done at any point in
time in history than what's possible for

275
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,360
one,
it's possible for me and I'm going to

276
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,980
deal with,
and if you do that and over

277
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
and over again,
your life will be easy.

278
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,840
I want you to stop gathering information
from outside yourself.

279
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Start gathering the inside.
He made a mistake

280
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,250
and he paid for his mistake with a lot
of pain,

281
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,670
a lot of tears,
and there came to a point where he knew

282
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:23,450
he should've gotten a divorce,
but he was stuck.

283
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
He was stuck in something called
revenge.

284
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,450
He said,
she's made me so miserable.

285
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,050
I'm gonna.
Pay Her back.

286
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,900
He was stuck and he stayed in there
longer than he should have because it

287
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:37,760
began to us.
Attack him.

288
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,980
It began to affect them psychologically.

289
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,080
Mm.

290
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,990
He took that same attitude to other
relationships.

291
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,860
Looking for something to go wrong,
he was burned so badly,

292
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,180
he did not want to risk pain again.
He was going in relationships,

293
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:05,020
trying to avoid pain when it became too,
cause he will do something to make sure

294
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,290
the relationship did not work.
He would always try and find something

295
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:08,780
wrong with it.

296
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,880
The person,
because they're not perfect people,

297
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,530
so if you look forward,
you can find it.

298
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,280
He was stuck in revenge.
Is it difficult?

299
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,720
Sure isn't anything that's worthy of
character building.

300
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,560
Sometimes I have to forgive the same
people over and over and over again.

301
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,710
However,
forgiveness is a practice worth

302
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,140
cultivating,
worth experiencing.

303
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,040
When you forgive somebody for something
that you perceived that they've done

304
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,550
wrong to you,
you are releasing that animosity,

305
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,250
that energy,
that ill will,

306
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,180
that you're harboring inside,
and it's a lot more difficult than just

307
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,310
merely saying,
I'm sorry,

308
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,070
how did I get depressed to who I am
today?

309
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:59,790
Because I tell you I was depressed when
I was age eight.

310
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,040
I used to concentrate on the things I
didn't have.

311
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,900
I wish I had arms,
legs and I wish I could do this,

312
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,430
but what can I do?
You see?

313
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,800
I have a choice and that's what I want
to talk about today.

314
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,980
Choices,
I can either be angry for not having

315
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:13,110
arms and legs will be thankful for my
chicken.

316
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,900
Drumstick,
you see,

317
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:18,510
I can still do a lot of things at home.
I can brush my teeth,

318
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,550
comb my hair,
get myself ready in the morning.

319
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm traveling around the world.
It's amazing.

320
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,180
It's a choice.
That is what I want to live.

321
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,450
My life can't always be happy.
Listen,

322
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,510
I know I'm not crazy.
I realized the realism in always been

323
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,760
happy.
Sometimes you have to put up with crap

324
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,670
in your life,
but if we're always striving to choose

325
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,350
happiness everyday you wake up and you
say to yourself,

326
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,650
I'm going to choose to not let the
outside influences in the world affect

327
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,950
my mood.
I'm going to be in charge of how I feel

328
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,310
because I am a choose happiness.
I promise you,

329
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,860
you will leave a lot happier life.
At least.

330
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,730
At least you can try to write.
You just have to set the necessary

331
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:09,320
conditions for health necessity,
incentives for health,

332
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,750
both for yourself and your children.
If you have that set incentives for

333
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:15,584
sickness,

334
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,170
I felt depressed,
I felt miserable.

335
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,860
I felt at times where it may be better
to take my life,

336
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,950
but with the wisdom that I gathered in
my 33 short years of life,

337
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,220
I've come to realize that it's just
feeling and in the same way that

338
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,420
chameleon cold is diminished.
The misery of feeling cold is diminished

339
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,770
by the insight that spring will come is
the same feeling that you should

340
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,720
acknowledge the same law,
that you should have knowledge that no

341
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:57,690
matter how miserable things are right
now,

342
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,760
it is just a season.
It's going to pass the thing that keeps

343
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:05,520
one living,
his sense of future,

344
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,860
that there will be a tomorrow,
tomorrow to do this,

345
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:11,340
and then the day after I got to do that.
Not that any of these things tick

346
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,690
and convincing reason to exist,
they somehow keep one going in.

347
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,510
In the words of Dorothy Parker,
great job,

348
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,680
which
you might as well live.
