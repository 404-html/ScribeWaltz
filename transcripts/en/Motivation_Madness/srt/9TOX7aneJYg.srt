1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,330
Most people don't even make a resolution
anymore.

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:04,850
Why?
Because they made him from years and

3
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:07,340
years and years and they know they're
not going to follow through.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,770
So after a while,
who wants to disappoint yourself?

5
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:14,090
Who wants to be upset with yourself?
Why even bother to set a new standard

6
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:15,140
for this year?
You know,

7
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,550
it's going to be the same as last year.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,730
Many of us don't act because we want
other people's approval.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,360
We want everybody to like us and to
accept us.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,070
And that's not possible.
Many of us don't do the things that we

11
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:37,820
want to do and don't act because of lack
of self confidence.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,830
We don't believe enough in ourselves.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,560
There's no denying that inside of you.
The only thing that's gonna make you

14
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,560
happy and,
but you're ahead and the decades ahead,

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,820
it's going to be having you have an
experience where on a regular basis you

16
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,120
feel like your life is making progress.
So it's gotta be a vision that's

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,790
compelling.
Something that you know it's going to be

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,590
a gift to make sure that it happens.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,233
Yeah.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,600
If you want to do anything worthwhile in
life,

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,790
you've got to be hungry.
And so I started working to develop

22
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,541
myself.
He said,

23
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,910
I want you to practice everyday being a
disc jockey.

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,310
I said,
but I don't have any job now.

25
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,330
He said,
it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,490
You said that it's better to be prepared
for an opportunity and not have one than

27
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,860
to have an opportunity and not be
prepared.

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,550
No excuse that.
If you decided that you want to do this,

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,690
if it becomes hot and do it hard,
if it difficult.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,973
So what?

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,970
Beginning of the year we have this
tradition,

32
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,240
but it goes beyond tradition.
It's something inside of us that makes

33
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:41,900
us want to make things better.
And I think part of it is the calendar

34
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,180
gives us this idea that we get to have a
fresh start,

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,200
that we get to start from fresh and have
this great victory and it's really,

36
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,050
the calendar itself is quite arbitrary.
It's wonderful to use it,

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,710
but if you didn't use it effectively,
let's use the calendar to serve you

38
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,900
today.
Let's just see what does it really take

39
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:59,930
to make this thing happen?
Because there's no denying that inside

40
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,430
of you.
The only thing that's going to make you

41
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:04,430
happy,
but you're adding the decades ahead.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,690
It's going to be having you up an
experience where on a regular basis you

43
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:11,480
feel like your life is making progress.
Just thank you.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,580
What would your life be like if you
decided to keep your commitment?

45
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,840
It is important and the area of
motivating yourself.

46
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,880
It's important to know why you're doing
it,

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,670
because that mine will say,
why bother?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,290
Why go through all this?
This is too hard.

49
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,460
No,
throw in the towel.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,140
It's not worth it.

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,670
If you make the changes in yourself,
you're going to be proud this year and

52
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,480
no amount of money or accolades from
other people can mirror the feeling of

53
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:46,630
being proud of knowing you've taken back
control of your life or you've taken a

54
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,210
great life to another level.
Because once you do that,

55
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,680
you have something you can give other
people.

56
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,730
Would it be your kids and your friends
and your family and ultimately that's

57
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,190
why it's about.
