1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,050
So I'm embarrassed that I have a career,
I talk about things like trust and

2
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:20,390
cooperation and there should be no
demand for my work,

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,410
but the fact of the matter is,
is there is demand for my work,

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,940
which means that there's an opportunity,
it means that trust and cooperation are

5
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,150
not yet standard in our organizations
and yet they should be.

6
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,540
And we know that which is why we're
looking for ways to bring those things

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,230
to our organizations.
So I thought I would do something a

8
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,760
little different today.
You know,

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,330
when you're speaking to tens of
thousands of people and you have the

10
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,760
opportunity to share a message,
of course,

11
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,280
most rational people would say,
let's go with something I've talked

12
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,500
about lots of times and I'm really good
at,

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,790
but I'm not normal.
So I'm going to do something completely

14
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,860
new and I hope this works out.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,830
Um,
there are two things that I think the

16
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,130
great leaders need to have empathy and
perspective.

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,560
And I think these things are very often
forgotten.

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,680
Leaders are so often and so concerned
about their status of their position in

19
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,880
and organization.
They actually forget their real job and

20
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,060
the real job of a leader is not about
being in charge.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,300
It's about taking care of those in our
charge and I don't think people realize

22
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:25,940
this and I don't think people train for
this when we're junior.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,910
Our only responsibility is to be good at
our jobs.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,050
That's all we really have to do and some
people actually go get advanced

25
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,560
educations on so that they can be really
good at their jobs.

26
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,090
Accountants or whatever.
Right,

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,890
and you show up and you work hard and
the company will give us tons and tons

28
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,080
of training,
how to do our jobs.

29
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,700
They'll show us how to use the software.

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,810
They'll send us away for a few days to
get trained in whatever it is that we're

31
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,800
doing for the company and then they
expect us to go be good at our jobs and

32
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:58,280
that's what we do.
We worked very hard and if you're good

33
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:03,170
at your job,
they'll promote you and at some point

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,920
you'll get promoted to a position where
we are now responsible for the people

35
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:11,300
who do the job we used to do,
but nobody shows us how to do that and

36
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:14,480
that's why we get managers and not
leaders because the reason that our

37
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,570
managers are micromanaging us is because
they actually do know how to.

38
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,410
They do do the job better than us.
That's what got them promoted.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,710
Really what we have to do is go through
a transition.

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,710
Some people make it quickly,
some people make it slowly and

41
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,560
unfortunately some people will never
make that transition at all,

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,060
which is we have to go this through.

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,140
This transition of being responsible for
the job and then turning into somebody

44
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:40,040
who's now responsible for the people who
responsible for the job.

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,710
And as I said before,
one of the great things that is lacking

46
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:47,690
in most of our companies is that they
are not teaching us how to lead.

47
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,410
And leadership is a skill like any other
is a practice double learnable skill,

48
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,780
and it is something that you work on it.
It's like a muscle.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,140
If you practice it all the days,
you will get good at it and you will

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,740
become a strong leader.
If you stop practicing,

51
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,680
you will become a weak leader like
parenting.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,770
Everyone has the capacity to be a
parent,

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,190
doesn't even.
Everybody wants to be a parent and

54
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,970
doesn't mean everybody shouldn't be a
apparent leadership is the same.

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,710
We all have the capacity to be a leader.
Doesn't mean everybody should be a

56
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,350
leader and it doesn't mean everybody
wants to be a leader.

57
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,710
And the reason is because it comes at
great personal sacrifice.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,330
Remember,
you're not in charge,

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,240
you're responsible for those in your
charge.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,640
That means things like when everything
goes right,

61
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,520
you have to give away all the credit and
when everything goes wrong,

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,940
you have to take all the responsibility.
That sucks,

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,930
right?
It's things like staying late to show

64
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,650
somebody what to do.
It's things like when something does

65
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,960
actually break,
when something goes wrong,

66
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,630
instead of yelling and screaming and
taking over,

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,110
you say try again.
When the overwhelming pressures are not

68
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,190
on them,
the overwhelming pressures are on us.

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,910
At the end of the day,
great leaders are not responsible for

70
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,620
the job.
They're responsible for the people who

71
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,290
are responsible for the job.
They're not even responsible for the

72
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,290
results.
I love talking to ceos and say,

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,300
what's your priority?
And they put their hands on.

74
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,490
Their hips will proudly say,
my priority is my customer.

75
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm like really?
Even talked to a customer in 15 years.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,040
There's no CEO on the planet responsible
for the customer.

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,210
They're just not the responsible for the
people who are responsible for the

78
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,280
people who are responsible for the
customer.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,620
I'll tell you a true story.
A few months ago I stayed at the four

80
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:43,621
seasons in Las Vegas.
It is a wonderful hotel and the reason

81
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,900
it's a wonderful hotel is not because of
the fancy beds.

82
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:51,901
Any hotel can go and buy a fancy bed.
The reason it's a wonderful hotel is

83
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:55,750
because of the people who work there.
If you walk past somebody at the four

84
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,610
seasons and this and they say hello to
you,

85
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,640
you get the feeling that they actually
wanted to say hello to you.

86
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,010
It's not that somebody told them that
you have to say a load of all the

87
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,870
customers,
say hello to all the guests.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,140
Right.
You actually feel that they care now in

89
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,320
their lobby,
they have a coffee stand and I want.

90
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,490
One afternoon I went to buy a cup of
coffee and there was a Barista by the

91
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:19,150
name of Noah who was serving me.
Noah was fantastic.

92
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,890
He was friendly and fun,
and he was engaging with me and I had so

93
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,920
much fun buying a cup of coffee.
I actually think I gave 100 percent tip,

94
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,900
right?
He was wonderful.

95
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,540
So as is my nature,
I asked Noah,

96
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,510
do you like your job?
And without skipping a beat,

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,760
Noah says,
I love my job,

98
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,740
and so I followed up.
I said,

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,300
what is it that the four seasons is
doing that would make you say to me,

100
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,270
I love my job and without skipping a
beat,

101
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,680
Noah said throughout the day,
managers will walk past me and asked me

102
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,320
how I'm doing,
if there's anything that I need to do my

103
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,580
job better.
He said,

104
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,340
not just my manager,
any manager,

105
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,390
and then he said something magical.

106
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,430
He says,
I also work at Caesar's Palace and

107
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,770
Caesar's at Caesar's palace.
The managers are trying to make sure

108
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,860
we're doing everything right.
They catch us when we do things wrong.

109
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,720
He says,
when I go to work there,

110
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,530
I like to keep my head under the radar
and just get through the day so I can

111
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,440
get my paycheck.
He says,

112
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,640
here at the four seasons,
I feel I can be myself.

113
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Same person,
entirely different experience from the,

114
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,710
from the customer who will engage with
Noah,

115
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,020
so we in leadership are always
criticizing.

116
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,570
The people were always saying,
we've got to get the right people on the

117
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,404
bus.
I've got a film.

118
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,330
Ironic my team.
I've got to get the right people,

119
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,630
but the reality is it's not the people.
It's the leadership.

120
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,210
If we create the right environment,
we will get people like Noah at the four

121
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,044
seasons.

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,760
If we create the wrong environment,
we will get people like Noah at Caesar's

123
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:54,890
palace.
It's not the people,

124
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,190
and yet we're so quick to hire and fire.
You can't hire and fire your children if

125
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,200
your kids are struggling.
We don't say,

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,260
you got to see at school,
you're up for adoption,

127
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,960
so why is it that when somebody has
performance problems at work,

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,200
why is it that our instinct is to say,
you're out.

129
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,240
We do not practice empathy.
What does empathy look like?

130
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's the lack of empathy.
This is normal in our business world.

131
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,300
You walk into someone's office,
someone walks into our office and says,

132
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,090
your numbers have been down for the
third quarter in a row.

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,280
You have to pick up your numbers.
Otherwise,

134
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,410
I can't guarantee what the future will
look like.

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,310
How inspired you think that person is to
come to work the next day?

136
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,580
Here's what empathy looks like.
You walk into someone's office,

137
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,460
someone walks into your office and says,
your numbers of down for the third

138
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,220
quarter in a row.
Are you okay?

139
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,190
I'm worried about you.
What's going on?

140
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,000
We all have performance issues.
Maybe someone's kid is sick.

141
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,620
Maybe they having problems in their
marriage.

142
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,370
Maybe one of their parents is dying.
We don't know what's going on in their

143
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,010
lives,
and of course it will affect performance

144
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,680
at work.
Empathy is being concerned about the

145
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,440
human being,
not just their output.

146
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,550
We have for some reason our work world
has changed over the past 20 and 30

147
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,430
years.
We are suffering the side effects of

148
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:21,431
business theories left over from the
eighties and nineties and they are bad

149
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,480
for people and they are bad for
business.

150
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,810
Let me give you an example.
The concept of shareholder supremacy was

151
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:35,210
a theory proposed in the late 19
seventies.

152
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,070
It was popularized in the eighties and
nineties.

153
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,340
It is now standard form today.
You talked to any public company and you

154
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,960
ask them their priority and they say
maximize shareholder value.

155
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,380
Really,
that's like a coach prioritizing the

156
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,230
needs of the fans over the needs of the
players.

157
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,580
How are you going to build a winning
team with that model,

158
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,970
but that's normal today.
We don't even perceive it as broken or

159
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:04,620
damaged or wrong or outdated.
Remember the eighties and nineties were

160
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:08,670
boom years with relative peace and a
kinder,

161
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,800
gentler cold war.
Nobody was practicing,

162
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,740
hiding under their desks in school
anymore.

163
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,690
We are no longer in those times.
These are no longer boom years.

164
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,810
These are no longer peaceful times and
those models cannot work today.

165
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,170
Here's another one.
Mass layoffs.

166
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,550
Using someone's livelihood to balance
the books,

167
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,240
right?
It's so normal in America today that we

168
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,300
don't even understand how broken and how
damaging it is,

169
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
not only to human beings but to
business.

170
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,500
You know,
companies talking about how they want to

171
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,900
build trust and cooperation and then
they announced a round of layoffs.

172
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,800
Do you know the quickest way to destroy
trust and destroy cooperation and a

173
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:54,801
business literally in one day lay people
off and everyone gets scared,

174
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,140
right?
Can you imagine sending someone home to

175
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,621
say,
honey,

176
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:02,100
I can no longer provide for our family
because the company missed its arbitrary

177
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,090
projections this year
and forget about the people who lost

178
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,550
their job.
Think about the people who kept their

179
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:11,850
jobs because every single decision a
company makes as a piece of

180
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:15,840
communication and the company,
the company has just communicated to

181
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,600
everybody else.
This is not a meritocracy.

182
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,230
We don't care how hard you work or how
long you've worked here.

183
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,910
If we miss our numbers and you happen to
fall on the wrong side of the

184
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,440
spreadsheet,
I'm sorry,

185
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,940
we cannot guarantee employment.

186
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,110
In other words,
we come to work everyday afraid and

187
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,080
we're asking our youngest generation to
work in environments where.

188
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:40,890
How would any of us ever stand up and
admit I made a mistake?

189
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,770
We're cousins being told,
you have to be vulnerable.

190
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,050
Leaders are vulnerable.
What does that even mean?

191
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,810
It doesn't mean you walk around crying.
I'm vulnerable,

192
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,440
right?
Know what vulnerability means is you

193
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:56,250
create an environment in which someone
feels safe enough to raise their hand

194
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,770
and said,
I don't know what I'm doing.

195
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,010
You've given me a job and I haven't been
trained to do it.

196
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,100
I need help.
I made a mistake.

197
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,760
I screwed something up.
I'm scared.

198
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,130
I'm worried.
All of these things,

199
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:15,360
no one would ever admit inside a company
because it puts a target on your head in

200
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:19,380
case there is another round,
and so we keep it to ourselves and how

201
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:22,770
can a company ever do well if nobody's
ever willing to admit they made a

202
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,990
mistake that's scared or they don't know
what they're doing,

203
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,380
and so we've literally created cultures
in which every single day everybody

204
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,960
comes to work in light,
high lies highs and fakes,

205
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,460
and we're asking our youngest generation
to work and succeed and find themselves

206
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,270
and build their confidence and overcome
their addiction to technology and build

207
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,830
strong relationships at work.

208
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,040
We're asking them to do this and these
environments we've created.

209
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,860
We keep saying to them,
you're the future leaders.

210
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,780
We're the leaders.
Now

211
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,100
we're in control.
What are we doing?

212
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,680
This is what empathy means.
It means if there's an entire generation

213
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,380
struggling,
maybe it's not them.

214
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,551
It's like,
you know,

215
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,030
the only thing that,
the common factor in all my failed

216
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:15,031
relationships me,
same thing,

217
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,190
oh,
we just can't get the right performance

218
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,550
out of our people.
Maybe it's you're right.

219
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,190
It's not a generation.
It's not them.

220
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,830
They're not difficult or hard to
understand.

221
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,490
They're human beings like the rest of us
trying to find their way,

222
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,290
trying to work in a place where they
feel that someone cares about them as a

223
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,120
human being.
By the way,

224
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,270
that's what we all want.
In other words,

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,050
it's not even generational.
It's all of us.

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,870
This is the practice of empathy that
have wished,

227
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:50,860
struggling to communicate to someone if
it's struggling to help someone be at

228
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,000
their natural best.

229
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,090
I'm tired of people saying to me,
how do I get the best out of my people?

230
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,990
Really,
that's what you want.

231
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,400
They're like a towel.
Just ring them.

232
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,020
How can I get the most out of them?
No.

233
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,610
How do I help my people be at their
natural best,

234
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,040
right?
We're not asking these questions.

235
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,520
We are not practicing empathy.
We have to start by practicing empathy

236
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,220
and relate to what they may be going
through and it will profoundly change

237
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,900
the decisions we make.
It will profoundly change the way we see

238
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,260
the world.
Someone's driving to work.

239
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,530
You're driving to work and someone wants
to cut into your lane.

240
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,290
What do you do?
You pull your car up with you.

241
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,440
Let them in.
Most of us pull our cars up and go like

242
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,450
this.
You wait your turn.

243
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,000
Now let's practice empathy.
I don't know.

244
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,530
Maybe they've been out of work for six
months.

245
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,110
Maybe they had trouble getting the kids
out to school this morning and now

246
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,260
they're running late for a really
important interview and they just have

247
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:45,070
to get to this interview and they're
going to cut into our lane or maybe

248
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,300
they're just a bastard.
I don't know,

249
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,490
but

250
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,780
that's the point we don't know.
We don't know,

251
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,080
and the practice of empathy will say,
I'll let them in and I'll arrive to work

252
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,150
one car length lead,
right?

253
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,580
We don't always have to be,
right.

254
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,990
We don't always have to be in charge.
We don't have to be the one who

255
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,270
succeeds.
It's not about winning or losing,

256
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,200
and that's where I go to the second
point after empathy comes perspective

257
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,170
where it's not about winning or losing
in Game Theory,

258
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,020
there are two kinds of games.
There are finite games and there are

259
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:31,560
infinite games and this is how you're
going to change your perspective,

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
right?
A finite game is defined as known

261
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,270
players,
fixed rules and an agreed upon objective

262
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,580
baseball.
For example,

263
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,280
we know the rules,
we all agreed to the rules and whoever

264
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:47,700
has more runs at the end of nine innings
is the winner and the game is over.

265
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,800
No one ever says,
if we can just play two more innings,

266
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,640
I know we can come back.
Doesn't work that way.

267
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,230
The game is over,
right?

268
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:57,440
That's a finite game.
Then you have an infinite game.

269
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,120
Infinite Games are defined as known and
unknown players.

270
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,480
The rules are changeable and the
objective is to keep the game in play,

271
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,930
to perpetuate the game.
When you pit a finite player versus a

272
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,600
finite player,
the system is stable.

273
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,510
Baseball is stable,
right?

274
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,810
When you put an infinite,
an infinite player versus an infinite

275
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,140
player,
the system is also stable like the cold

276
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,660
war for example,
because there cannot be a winner and a

277
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:28,580
loser.
There are no winners and losers in an

278
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,020
infinite game,
right?

279
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,930
It doesn't exist and because there are
no winners or losers,

280
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,090
what ends up happening in the infinite
contest,

281
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,920
his players drop out when they run out
of the will or the resources to play,

282
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,410
but there's no winners or losers.

283
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,480
Problems arise when you pit a finite
player versus an infinite player because

284
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:51,620
in a finite player is playing to win and
an infinite player is playing to keep

285
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,270
the game going,
right?

286
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,110
This is what happened to us in Vietnam.
We were playing to win and the

287
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,480
Vietnamese were fighting for their
lives.

288
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,460
We were the ones who got stuck in
quagmire.

289
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,530
This was the Soviet Union and
Afghanistan.

290
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,220
They were trying to beat the Mujahideen
and the majority and would fight for as

291
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,920
long as is necessary.
Quagmire.

292
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,660
Now,
let's look at business.

293
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,020
The game of business has preexisted or
has existed long before every single

294
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,400
company that exists on this planet
today,

295
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,500
and it will outlast every single company
that he lives that exists on this planet

296
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:28,190
today.
There's no winning the game of business,

297
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,220
and the reason is is because we haven't
agreed to the rules.

298
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,470
I get such a kick out of this.

299
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,890
You realize how many companies actually
don't know the game they're in,

300
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,750
right?
Listen to the language of the companies

301
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,610
use.
We're trying to beat our competition.

302
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,180
We're trying to be number one.
Did you know that we were ranked number

303
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,670
one?
Look at the listing based on what

304
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,170
criteria,
revenues,

305
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,120
profits,
marketshare square footage,

306
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,460
number of employees,
based on what timeframe?

307
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,840
A quarter a year,
five years,

308
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:54,770
10 years,
20 years,

309
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,820
50 years,
100 years.

310
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,780
I haven't agreed to those standards.
How can you declare yourself the winner?

311
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,490
How can you declare yourself?
Number one,

312
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,340
where no one else in the game has agreed
to the rules,

313
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,110
it's arbitrary.
There is no winning because there's no

314
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,720
end.
In other words,

315
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,050
companies are playing finite games.
Listen to their language.

316
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,440
They try to beat their competition.
What does that even mean?

317
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,940
It's the leaders and the companies that
understand the game that they're in and

318
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,390
organize their resources and their
decision making around the infinite

319
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:30,500
contest that outlast and frustrate their
competition.

320
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,010
All the companies that we've referred to
as the exceptions,

321
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,160
southwest airlines,
apple computers,

322
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,560
Harley Davidson,
they're the exception.

323
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,110
No,
they're playing the infinite contest.

324
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,530
They frustrate their competition is what
happens.

325
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,620
That's what happens because they're not
playing to win.

326
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,960
Say Jim Senegal,
the founder of Costco,

327
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,390
which is the company,
the only real company that gives walmart

328
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,040
or run for its money.
He says,

329
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,090
public companies are looking to succeed
for the quarter.

330
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:00,780
It says we're looking for the next 50
years.

331
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,240
You could hear him.
He's playing the infinite contest.

332
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,920
I spoke at a leadership summit for
Microsoft.

333
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,950
I also spoke at a leadership summit for
Apple.

334
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,730
Now at the Microsoft summit,
I would say 70 percent of the

335
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,920
executives,
and this was under the Steve Ballmer

336
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,080
days,
I would say about 70 percent of the

337
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:24,081
executives spent about 70 percent of
their presentations talking about how to

338
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:28,350
beat apple
at the apple summit,

339
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,670
a 100 percent of the executives spend a
100 percent of their presentations

340
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,760
talking about how to help teachers teach
and how to help students learn.

341
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,980
One was obsessed with their competition.
The other one was obsessed with where

342
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,340
they're going.
So at the end of my presentation at

343
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,010
Microsoft,
they gave me a gift.

344
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:50,220
They gave me the new zoom,
which was the competitor to the ipod

345
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,960
touch when it was a thing.
Right.

346
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,660
And I have to tell you,
this piece of technology was

347
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,780
spectacular.
It was beautiful.

348
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,260
The user interface was incredible.
The design was amazing.

349
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,230
It was intuitive.
I was one of those beautiful,

350
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:07,260
elegant pieces of technology I'd ever
seen right now.

351
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,200
They didn't work with Itunes,
which is an entirely different problem.

352
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:15,201
I couldn't use it.
Something else.

353
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,380
I'm sitting in the back of a taxi with a
senior apple executive,

354
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:27,381
sort of employee number 12 kinda guy,
and I decided to stir the pot and I

355
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,460
turned to him.
I say,

356
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,900
you know,
I spoke at a Microsoft summit and they

357
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:37,080
gave me their new Zune and I have to
tell you,

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,130
it is so much better than your ipod
touch,

359
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,870
and he turned to me and said,
I have no doubt conversation over

360
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,430
because

361
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,430
the infinite player isn't playing to be
number one every day with every product

362
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,190
they're playing to outlast the
competition.

363
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,930
If I had said to Microsoft,
Oh,

364
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,880
I've got the new ipod,
touch it so much better than your new

365
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:06,570
zoom.
There was,

366
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,680
can we see it?
What does it do?

367
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,530
How we have to see it,
because one is obsessed with their

368
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:13,200
competition.
The other is obsessed with why they do

369
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,390
what they do.
The other is obsessed with where they're

370
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,890
going and the reason apple frustrates
their competition is because secretly

371
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,630
they're not even competing against them.
They're competing against themselves and

372
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:28,950
they understand that sometimes you're a
little bit ahead and sometimes you're a

373
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:33,240
little bit behind and sometimes your
product is better and sometimes you're

374
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,150
not,
but if you wake up every single morning

375
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,080
and compete against yourself,
how do I make our products better than

376
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:40,980
they were yesterday?

377
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,920
How do I take care of our customers
better than we did yesterday?

378
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,320
How do we advance our cause more
efficiently,

379
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,460
more productively than we did yesterday?
How do we find new solutions to advance

380
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,750
our calling,
our cause,

381
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,710
our purpose,
our belief,

382
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,720
our why every single day.
What you'll find is over time you will

383
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:02,920
probably be ahead more often.
Those who play the infinite game

384
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:07,921
understand it's not about the battle,
it's about the war and they don't play

385
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,430
to win every day and they frustrate
their competition until their

386
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:15,520
competition drops out of the game.
Every single bankruptcy,

387
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,420
almost every merger and acquisition is
basically a company saying we no longer

388
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:22,540
have the will or the resources to
continue to play and we have no choice

389
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,320
to either drop out of the game or or
merge our resources with another player.

390
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,900
So that we can stay in the game.
That's what that is.

391
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,570
And you can think about the number of
bankruptcies and mergers and

392
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,750
acquisitions.
It's kind of proof that most companies

393
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,590
don't even know the game they're in.
You want to be a great leader,

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,740
start with empathy.
You want to be a great leader,

395
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,350
change your perspective and play the
game.

396
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,520
You're actually playing.
