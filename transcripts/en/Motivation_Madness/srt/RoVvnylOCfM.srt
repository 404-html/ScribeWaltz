1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,380
And this is probably good human being
advice,

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,230
not just entrepreneur and startup and
investor advice.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,680
What I learned from Wine Library TV is
the following,

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,910
the true story of Wine Library TV was
the day that I thought I was going to

5
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,040
start it.
I thought I was going to do something

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,480
similar to Qvc and I don't know if you
have a qvc or shopping network in

7
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,910
Europe,
but QBC and America,

8
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,660
it's a show and they sell stuff through
the TV.

9
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,180
I thought I was going to do the qvc of
wine.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,570
The first episode of that show,
when that camera went on and that light

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,250
went on,
I realized that this was going to be on

12
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,880
the Internet forever and that I didn't
want to just pedal wine.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,240
I decided I wanted to be a value to
people in learning about wine because I

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,200
was scared that if I was peddling
something,

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,140
I didn't believe in that somebody would
come up to me at a party and say,

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:55,680
do you like this?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,520
And they'd say,
no,

18
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,354
I hate it.
They're like,

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,900
well,
you fucking said it was awesome.

20
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:00,540
A one liberty.
You're a scam artist.

21
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,111
I'm like,
shit,

22
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,130
no,
so I was very focused on leveling up and

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,680
I really believe that one great piece of
advice,

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,840
if you want to take anything from this
talk,

25
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:14,841
is we have to start realizing that
giving and doing things in business

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,570
without expectation of return from the
other individual is probably the

27
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,210
greatest leverage that you could ever
deploy in your business life.

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,220
Though it is extremely rare in today's
business environment and it has

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,360
absolutely been the bedrock of what is
allowed me to win all my engagement,

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,000
all my selfies right over there and
signing books,

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,500
all the content I have nothing to sell.
I have a book that I fucking sell once

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,670
every three years for $13.
This is not about monetizing an

33
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,090
audience.

34
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,010
It's about building leverage to build
brand versus sales.

35
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,340
One of the biggest things that I see
going on right now in digital media is

36
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,770
that we don't have a lot of people doing
branding and marketing.

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,760
We have a lot of people doing sales.
The reason so many of you were confused

38
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:03,060
by the value of snapchat is because in
the digital landscape,

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,900
we now think transactional.
Everything's about what's the Roi of

40
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,110
every piece of content,
every single action,

41
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,290
what's the last attribution,
what's the conversion rates?

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,820
It's all become math based and that's
fine because I love sales more than

43
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,880
anybody,
but I promise you these fucking guys,

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,510
Nike,
they need tagged me on a browser and

45
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,200
then re cookie me and then travel all
over the Internet and pound me with

46
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,210
banner ads until I gave up and bought
it.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I bought it because they fucking market
into me over the last 20 years and I

48
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,801
don't even fucking know why I buy it
and that is a very important point

49
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,040
because what we're living through is a
time where people are just being very

50
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:49,041
transactional and conversion based when
everything continues to get arbitraged.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,850
Another thought that I'm curious,
how many people here have gone to the

52
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,920
life that I've gone to over the last
three months?

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
I no longer have a laptop or an ipad.
I now only live through my mobile

54
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,490
device.
How many people are on that level doing

55
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,330
that?
Raise your hands.

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,720
Not a lot and this is like think about
this conference.

57
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,010
I really think that this trend,
I do believe that if I came back here in

58
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,420
two years,
that 50,

59
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,520
40,
30 percent of the hands in this room

60
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,960
would go up to that following question
and I'm completely fascinated by it and

61
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,320
then for everybody in the room that is
building businesses on the Internet,

62
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,610
the thought of what's happening in your
landing page optimization or the Ui and

63
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:31,840
Ux of your product in a desktop
environment I think is in the beginning

64
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,680
stages of being disrupted and that's
what I really spent most of my time in

65
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,140
which is what's the attention arbitrage?

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,210
Where do I think your eyes and ears are
going to be before you do and how do I

67
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,350
go and land grab and buy up that
property and how do I then deploy and

68
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,260
build the best houses on that property
through content.

69
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,770
That is the pattern of my career.
In 2006,

70
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,460
I felt this social media thing was going
to be really big and in 2007,

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,640
2008,
I've laid my foundation and by 2007 and

72
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,420
eight I invested in facebook and Tumbler
and twitter and things of that nature

73
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:08,080
and I did quite well.
I also use them to tell my story,

74
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,670
sell my wine,
do my thing.

75
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,070
I think this is super important to
understand because I think we also

76
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,890
decide that things are emerging too
fast.

77
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,370
This is not just being first mover.
A lot of people like to give me credit.

78
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,020
Like you predicted all this stuff.

79
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,720
You were sorry.
I just want to be on the record forever.

80
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,360
There's plenty of people here recording.
I've been predicted.

81
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,620
Shit.
I'm not.

82
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,071
No,
sir.

83
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,940
Domus.
What I've done well is I've moved

84
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,210
quickly once you actually started using
them.

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
I didn't predict twitter.
I wasn't right about snapchat.

86
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,480
I was just looking at data.
Snapchat two years ago when I first

87
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,210
started talking about it already had
tens of millions of users.

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,630
There was real people using it.
I'm not predicting anything.

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,420
I'm paying attention.
There's probably very few people in this

90
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,470
room there are paying as much attention
to anchor to peach,

91
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,370
to all these platforms as I am,
but I'm not putting all my content or

92
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,170
all my time and I'm also not crippled by
putting my time and effort into

93
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,800
platforms before they have a 100 or $200
million users.

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,100
For example,
how many of you remember that five

95
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,640
minutes?
Four years ago were Social Cam got big?

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,780
Raise your hand.
Alright,

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,820
so three nerds.

98
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,350
Social Cam got big for three minutes
because the facebook newsfeed juiced it

99
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,260
and it had a lot of users and it was hot
for four months,

100
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,470
six months.
I used it feverish Lee and use it a lot.

101
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,830
It collapsed and meant nothing,
but during that period I learned so much

102
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,930
about mobile video and the cadence of it
and how people interacted with it that

103
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,760
when vine came along,
a year and a half later and then

104
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,660
instagram video and then snapchat,
I'd already put in the work and had the

105
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,230
learnings from human behavior that I
deployed against the next thing.

106
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,100
There are way too many people in this
room that do not do actions because

107
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,550
crippled by the short term results
versus what it means in the long term,

108
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,020
and this goes to marketing and this goes
to running your business and this comes

109
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,110
down to what I probably want to spend a
few more minutes on right now,

110
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,820
which is my friends.

111
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,490
There's a lot of people in here that are
startup founders.

112
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,880
That should not be my friends,
that are a lot of people in here that

113
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,920
work at agencies.
That should not be.

114
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,640
They should be probably switched and
vice versa and different things.

115
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,790
One of the things that is absolutely
driving me right now in my life is the

116
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,100
untold depression,
the untold suicides.

117
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,650
To just get dark for a second,
it's not fun to talk about,

118
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:40,280
but it's important.
We are lacking self awareness in this

119
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:45,281
space in a very substantial way and
there's a lot of people that are about

120
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,930
to be met with a lot of disappointment
and are struggling.

121
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,660
How many people are an entrepreneur in
here?

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,280
Raise your hand.
You guys and gals know this isn't easy.

123
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,310
There's nobody else.
It's fun to work for somebody.

124
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:00,530
You know,
why you get the blame the boss,

125
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,840
she and he is an Asshole,
not you.

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,440
When you're an entrepreneur where
there's nobody else behind you,

127
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,590
it's on you,
and one thing we're not talking about is

128
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,170
the level of success.
Everybody thinks they have to build

129
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,570
fucking Uber.
Everybody thinks they have to make

130
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,500
millions of dollars.
It's unbelievable what we've done and I

131
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:22,370
absolutely want to make sure that we're
starting to have real conversations

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,180
making $100,000 a year,
100 year euros.

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,780
That's massively successful.
We need to recalibrate what success

134
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:34,580
looks like in our space because we're
forcing through the branding of what

135
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,100
we're doing.
Very impractical,

136
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,660
very high risk,
very low return results for so many

137
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,260
because everybody's shooting for 10
billion guys.

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,540
There's like four apps that big.
There's like Uber and Instagram,

139
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,960
like how many fucking billion dollar
companies do you think there are?

140
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,090
And so I really am passionate about
starting to reframe the conversation

141
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,230
about the number one thing that I have
noticed in my 20 years of my success.

142
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,830
Because let me tell you something,
I sucked shit at almost everything.

143
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,890
What I've done well is I've deployed
self awareness around what I am and I

144
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,610
know what I am and there's a lot of
things I wish I was seven years ago as a

145
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,091
lot of,
you know,

146
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,070
I had plenty of leverage in the web.
Two point.

147
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh,
social media movement.

148
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,390
I was one of the guys.
I was one of the 20 most follow people

149
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:26,300
on twitter.
I didn't go and raise $40,000,000 to

150
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:29,210
build the next facebook.
I didn't raise $50 million dollars to

151
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:33,050
build a platform around wine.
I was self aware enough even though I

152
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:36,470
had all the opportunity in the world to
build product that I wasn't going to be

153
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:41,471
successful seven years ago I went out
and built a boring digital agency.

154
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,210
Right?
I built something practical.

155
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,790
All My internet friends,
all a lot of the people can be on the

156
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,020
stage.
They made fun of me.

157
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,780
Like,
why don't you go build a big company or

158
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,690
something grand.
I built what I knew I could build.

159
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm very proud that over the last four
years I've grown vaynermedia from three

160
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,060
to $100,
million dollars a year in revenue,

161
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,860
not fucking valuation

162
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,970
and cool.
Great.

163
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,680
That's fine.
And who gives a shit?

164
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,910
What I'm way more worried about than
what I've done is what you're going to

165
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,350
do.
I implore you,

166
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,210
my friends.
This is fancy.

167
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,040
First of all,
this is unbelievable.

168
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,770
This is one of the nicest setup still
conference I've ever seen.

169
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,260
She.
Let's clap it up for these guys.

170
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,094
It's unbelievable,

171
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,110
right?
Fucking

172
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,460
food trucks.
It's like sunny and shit.

173
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,640
This is fucking awesome.
Anyway,

174
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,850
what I did well was I just didn't give a
shit when I'm.

175
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,500
When I'm old,
I'm 40.

176
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,170
When I grew up in,
in the United States,

177
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,320
like being a good student was the big
thing.

178
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,820
I was making $3,000 a weekend selling
baseball cards and getting D's and f's

179
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,240
and everybody thought I was a loser.
That's what the narrative was.

180
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,030
Now it's reversed.
If I was in school now making three,

181
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,750
$4,000 a weekend as a 13 year old,
I would have been the next big thing,

182
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:09,260
right?
I went through it and I did not succumb

183
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,950
to the current thing that everybody
thought in America was the right thing,

184
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,900
which was go to the best school you
could go to.

185
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,140
I understood who I was and I went in all
in on my strengths and I employ a lot of

186
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,110
you to do that.

187
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,830
There's too many people sitting in this
room that want to be the number one CEO

188
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:28,130
founder,
but if you were the seventh employee of

189
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,420
a company,
you know,

190
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,600
I'd much rather be number 41 at
facebook,

191
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,660
the number one of facebook,
and so I think we're seeing that and so

192
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,750
I'd like to stand up here and I'd like
to say,

193
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,970
look,
there's a lot of things that I wish I

194
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:47,630
was different at as matter of fact,
back to let's be very matter right now.

195
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,210
Do you know that I wish I didn't curse
on stage?

196
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,790
Do you have any people?
Don't share my content.

197
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,100
Don't like me because of it.
I wish I didn't do it.

198
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,930
I just can't be anything that I'm not
and so I implore you,

199
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,360
don't worry about what school right now
or what we're all focused on or what

200
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,830
your momma wants you to be.

201
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,720
You need to go home from this
conference.

202
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,910
You'll be inspired.
You'll be cool people.

203
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,180
There's interesting shit,
but I'm telling you with the bottom of

204
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:17,330
my heart,
it is fundamentally irrelevant if you

205
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:21,500
don't know who the fuck you are and the
quicker you can start forcing yourself

206
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:24,290
to understanding what role you play.
Number one.

207
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,880
Number seven,
PR,

208
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,870
marketing product you are.
Everybody wants to be somebody else.

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,180
I wish I was the quarterback of the New
York jets.

210
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,330
It's not gonna happen
and so if I could accomplish one,

211
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,380
and by the way,
I'm being very realistic.

212
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,140
I'll be very,
very transparent with you.

213
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,660
This little seven minute rant that I
just came up with.

214
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,830
I'm trying to reach one person like I'm.
This is not so easy.

215
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:53,831
It's hard to have the ego and the
humility at equal ends to figure

216
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,740
yourself out,
but I promise you,

217
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,030
as I've looked across the landscape,
and I've looked at 25,

218
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
50,000 startups at this point,
right?

219
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,840
I have now spent the last 40 years of my
life with the Toyotas and the pepsis and

220
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,350
the gi biggest brands enrolled myself,
my inner circle,

221
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,650
the one connection point from corporate
America to startup to vc to

222
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:20,830
personalities.
The one connection point is self

223
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:24,430
awareness.
Once you start understanding yourself,

224
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,060
once you start actually executing on who
you actually are versus who you wish you

225
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,090
were,
things start to change very quickly,

226
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,840
and so the reason I'm passionate about
this as this is always very worldly

227
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,410
advice and is probably historically
always good things to talk about.

228
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,600
I just feel that if any of you really
paid attention to the macro economic

229
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,390
infrastructure of what's happening in
our space right now,

230
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,100
this nirvana that we've lived through
for the last six or seven years is about

231
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,960
to shift.
It just is.

232
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,090
It's just the data.
I don't want it.

233
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,690
I wish it was nirvana forever,
just like everybody else during the down

234
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,570
cycles,
the people that are able to win are the

235
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,520
ones that are most in tune with
themselves,

236
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,280
the ones that are the most practical.
So again,

237
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,260
to make this valuable to you in this
room,

238
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,940
number one,
if you're a startup,

239
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,630
please start understanding how you're
going to make money as soon as possible.

240
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,390
You're running a business,
you're running a business.

241
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,510
Businesses need to make money,
especially when there's no money to fund

242
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:28,720
you based on your last valuation.
Number two,

243
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,420
as a human being sitting at this
conference,

244
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,840
this is all very encompassing and very
exciting,

245
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,580
but start chipping away against what you
think you want and start really looking

246
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,820
at what you bring to the table because
the quicker you figure that out,

247
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,970
the more successful you will have.
An number three,

248
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,620
please start understanding how to
provide value without expectation in

249
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,400
return.

250
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,420
It is unbelievable to me how many people
already tonight we've super five

251
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,350
minutes,
seven,

252
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,650
eight people giving me something as they
think,

253
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,770
but really expecting something in return
for that give.

254
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,120
Humans can feel that it's not the way to
go and we really need to start thinking

255
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,800
about that.
And number four,

256
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,770
understand the following,
and this is very ironic given my

257
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:16,690
concerns about where the market's going.
I'll end with this in lieu of all of

258
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:20,110
that.
This whole thing that we're living

259
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:25,111
through has just started.
The consumer web is only 20 years old.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Windows 95 kind of started this thing.
The Internet thing is very new.

261
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Everything that we all talk about didn't
exist 10 years ago over the next 10

262
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:41,440
years,
the biggest companies in the world from

263
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,790
Europe and Asia and us from anywhere in
the world because we are now at scale.

264
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,350
The biggest companies in the world are
going to be created over the next 20

265
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,730
years from zero.
There are people sitting in this room

266
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:57,731
right now that are going to build the
next major company and so we are all so

267
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,981
blessed that we are actually human
beings during this period where there is

268
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,010
so much upside,
so much opportunity and so everything

269
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:15,101
I've talked about when you parallel on
the ub noxious opportunity and land grab

270
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:19,130
an opportunity.
If you're able to wire those two things

271
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,710
together,
I think a lot of good stuff could happen

272
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,600
for you,
and I'd like that for you.

273
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,910
I'd like that a lot.
Thank you.
