1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,160
I had so many dreams of where I wanted
to go,

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,850
who I want it to be,
and what I wanted to do.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,850
Theater companies.
I wanted to start with classmates,

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,310
movies.
I wanted to be in directors.

5
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:24,700
I wanted to work with stories.
I read it to tell,

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,650
it might take a little time I thought,
but it would happen

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,000
when I sat there,
excuse me,

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,980
22 years ago.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,330
Okay.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,280
What I didn't want to think about is
where I would be tomorrow,

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,480
what I would have to start to do
tomorrow.

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,730
And I graduated in 1991 a great year,
uh,

13
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:04,951
time of resurgence for independent films
in this country at a time of relatively

14
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:09,990
affordable rents in New York City.
See,

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,070
I assumed that I could make a living
writing my place,

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,560
acting way off,
off,

17
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:22,561
off Broadway and hopefully one day join
the actors I loved and respected in

18
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:25,990
those independent films.
TV.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,831
Oh,
what?

20
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:27,551
No.
What?

21
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,384
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,080
Okay.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,240
No,
didn't even consider that I have much

24
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:36,400
more class than that.
Much more self respect than that.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,590
Soap operas and ship.

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,110
What I didn't have was cash

27
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,100
a bank account,

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,380
credit card or an apartment.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,950
I just had debt.
Okay.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,600
Big,
hungry,

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,880
growing larger every moment.
Debt,

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
so as you will tomorrow.
I had to leave beautiful Vermont.

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,430
I pack the life that I knew with socks
and a toothbrush into my backpack and I

34
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,581
slept on couch after couch after couch
after couch at friend's apartments in

35
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,410
New York until I wore out their rent.
Pang roommates welcome.

36
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,820
I didn't want a day job.
I was an actor.

37
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:49,300
I was a writer.
I was at Bennington graduate.

38
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,290
I had to get a day job.
I dusted pianos at a piano store on

39
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,880
ludlow street for five months.
I worked on the property of a

40
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,330
shakespeare scholar for a year,
pulling weeds and removing bees nests.

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,680
I went on unemployment ones,
but for not for long.

42
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:13,681
I couldn't handle the guilt.
Eventually I was able to pay rent for a

43
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,680
spot on the floor of an apartment on the
lower east side,

44
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,500
but my roommate had a breakdown and
disappeared.

45
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,130
He later resurfaced in a religious cult.
I'm making this sound romantic.

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,470
It really wasn't it.

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,333
Yeah.

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,850
I helped hang paintings at galleries,
paintings.

49
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,140
That inspired inspire you to think I
could do that.

50
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,463
Yeah,

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,760
and then finally,
after two years of job and couch

52
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,560
surfing,
I got a job

53
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,650
in application processing as it data end
juror at a place called professional

54
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:17,211
examination services
and I stayed for six years,

55
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,670
six years
longer than my time at Benning

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,890
from the age of 23 to 29
board.

57
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,190
They loved me there.
I was funny.

58
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,050
I wear black,
no cape,

59
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,884
no tights.

60
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah,

61
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,310
I smoked in the loading docks with the
guys from the mail room and we shared

62
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,020
how hung over.
We all were.

63
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,540
Okay.

64
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,190
Everyone.
You called each other's shorty?

65
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,863
I don't know.

66
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,550
Seven shorty.
Hey,

67
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,770
you doing shoddy or so hung over?
Shorter.

68
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,223
Yeah.

69
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,510
I called in sick almost every Friday
because I was out late the night before.

70
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,050
I hated that job and I clung to that job
because of that job.

71
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,730
I could afford my own place.
So I lived in Williamsburg.

72
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:27,641
Brooklyn.
Yeah.

73
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:32,991
You say that now
my kingdom for a time machine.

74
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,023
No.

75
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,990
Yeah,
that's right.

76
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,991
I lived in an industrial loft.
My rent was $400 a month.

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,970
My dream of running a theater company
with my friend,

78
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,810
fellow Bennington graduate,
Ian Bell had died.

79
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,550
I won't go into those details,
but neither one of us had any business

80
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,980
sense.
And the theater we lived in,

81
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,510
it had no heat or hot water.
We didn't smell very good,

82
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,900
but we had our youth.
The youth gets old very quickly.

83
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,140
You'll see.
So Ian moved out to Seattle and I moved

84
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:25,870
up to the street to my loft and I still
didn't have heat

85
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,370
in 1993 industrial loft men not legal to
live there.

86
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,610
I didn't see,
I don't want this to sound cool and I

87
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:40,750
feel like it's sending cool

88
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,823
ad Lib.

89
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,130
Uh,
but I did have hot water,

90
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,110
hot water in my bathroom,
which a friend of mine using said

91
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:59,770
bathroom once shouted.
It smells exactly like a summer camp in

92
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,280
here.

93
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,113
Okay.

94
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,280
It was true for some reason in the
middle of Brooklyn,

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,550
there was earth in my shower.
Sure Earth and then,

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,570
oh look,
mushrooms growing from the earth.

97
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,430
But I,
I was safe though.

98
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,080
The ideal fire control company was right
across the street where they make all

99
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,090
the chemicals that put out chemical
fires.

100
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,670
I did not fear a chemical fire.
I would be okay.

101
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,370
And all those chemicals in the air.
We're okay too because up the street we

102
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:42,390
had the spice factory.
They made spices and that just covered

103
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:47,391
everything up in a nice cumins centers.
I had a rat,

104
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,330
but that was okay cause I got a cat.

105
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,183
Yeah,

106
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,660
his name was Brian.
No relation.

107
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,310
My grandmother had given me a pink
pullout couch.

108
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,710
Oddly new friends or recent graduates
wanted to crash on my couch.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,840
So I put the couch on its end so brian
could climb it and look out the window.

110
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,380
I had only the one window.
I myself could not look out the window.

111
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,360
It was,
it was quite high.

112
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,020
So I had no heat.
No girlfriend.

113
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:35,120
What are you kidding me?
No acting agent.

114
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,400
But I had a cat named Brian who told me
of the world outside.

115
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,580
I stayed for 10 years.

116
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,983
Yes.

117
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,260
No,
don't pity me.

118
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,980
There's a

119
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
happy ending.

120
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,010
When I was 29 I told myself the next
acting job I get,

121
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,040
no matter what it pays,
I will from now on for better or worse

122
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,660
be a working actor.
So I quit my position at the

123
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:22,520
professional examination services.
My friends really weren't happy about

124
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,940
that because he was so easy to find me
when I work there work was,

125
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,710
there was the only place I had the
internet.

126
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:31,880
This was at the beginning of the
Internet and now I didn't have either

127
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:36,881
the internet or a cell phone or a job,
but something good happened.

128
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,950
I got a low ping theater job in a play
called imperfect love,

129
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,930
which led to a film called 13 moons with
the same writer,

130
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,570
which led to other roles which led to
other roles and I've worked as an actor

131
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,404
ever since.

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,540
Bye.

133
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Didn't know that would happen
at 29 walking away from data processing,

134
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,230
I was terrified.
10 years in a place without heat,

135
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,090
six years at a job I felt stuck in.
Maybe I was afraid of change.

136
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,410
Are you?
My parents didn't have much money,

137
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,840
but they struggled to send me to the
best schools.

138
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,450
And one of the most important things
they did for me and graduates,

139
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:45,451
maybe you don't want to hear this,
is that once I graduated I was on my

140
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:49,250
own.
Financially it was my turn.

141
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,410
Herons are applauding graduates or not.
This made me very hungry.

142
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,360
Literally
I couldn't be lazy.

143
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,920
Now I'm totally lazy,
but back then I couldn't be.

144
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,300
And so at 29 and a very long last,
I was in the company of the actors and

145
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,150
writers and directors.
I had sought out that first year,

146
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,810
that first day after school
I was,

147
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,450
I am by their sides,
raise the rest of your life to meet you.

148
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,350
Don't search for defining moments
because they will never come.

149
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,730
Well the birth of your children,
okay,

150
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,050
of course,
that's just six months.

151
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,570
She's,
my life is forever changed and that's

152
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,620
much defining moment ever.
But I'm talking about in the rest of

153
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,990
your life.
And most importantly in your work,

154
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,130
the moments that define you have already
happened and they will already happen

155
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,964
again

156
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,700
and it passes so quickly.
So please bring each other along with

157
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:26,680
you.
Everyone you need is in this room.

158
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,220
These are the shiny more important
people.

159
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,770
[inaudible]

160
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,440
sorry.
It sucks after graduation.

161
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
It really does.

162
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:57,890
Okay.

163
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,730
I mean,
I don't know.

164
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:00,950
At least it did for me,
but that's the only thing I know

165
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,230
you do.
You just get a bit derailed,

166
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,090
but soon something starts to happen.
Trust me.

167
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Rhythm sets in
just like it did after your first few

168
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,464
days here.

169
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,860
Okay.

170
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Just try not to wait until like me,
your 29 before you find it

171
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,130
and if you are,
that's fine too.

172
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,140
Some of us never find it,
but you will.

173
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,230
I promise you,
you are already here.

174
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,960
That's such an enormous step.
All its own.

175
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,750
You'll find your rhythm or continue the
one you,

176
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:54,751
I've already found.
I was walking downtown in Manhattan the

177
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,850
other day and I was approached by a
group of very sweet young ladies,

178
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,520
easy
actually there.

179
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,810
Erm,
sort of running fever actually down the

180
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:14,811
street after me.
When they got to meet breathless.

181
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,690
It was really,
they didn't know what to say or couldn't

182
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:27,280
form the words,
but it came out that they were Nyu

183
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,580
freshmen and they were majoring in
musical theater.

184
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,330
Of course.
Come on in.

185
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,150
We're like science majors.
We were running after me.

186
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,260
What musicals are you doing?
I inquired.

187
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,140
Well,
one of them said,

188
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,170
looking down at her shoes,
we aren't allowed to be in plays our

189
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,990
yet.
Our freshman year

190
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,810
now.
They were paying very high tuition.

191
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,330
Yeah,
tuning,

192
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:07,331
not do what they love doing.
I think I said,

193
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,680
well,
hang in there.

194
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Yeah.

195
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,900
What I should have said was
don't wait until they tell you you are

196
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,940
ready.
Get in there.

197
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,190
Sing.
We're quickly transferred to Benington.

198
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,380
[inaudible]

199
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,640
when I went to school here,
if a freshman wanted to write direct and

200
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:53,641
star in her own musical,
the lights would already be hung for

201
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:54,874
her.

202
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,283
Yeah.

203
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,310
Now I tell this story
because

204
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,190
the world might say you are not allowed
to yet.

205
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,863
Okay.

206
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,060
I waited a long time out in the world
before I gave myself permission to fail.

207
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,803
Please

208
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,100
don't even bother asking.
Don't bother telling the world you are

209
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:27,964
ready.

210
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,610
Show it.
Do it.

211
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,960
What did Beckett say?

212
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,280
Ever tried.
Ever failed.

213
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,730
No matter.
Try again.

214
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,600
Fail again.
Fail better.

215
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,220
Okay.

216
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Bennington,
class of 2012 the world is yours.

217
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,100
Treat everyone kindly
and light up the night.

218
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,590
Thank you so much for having me here.

219
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,600
[inaudible].
