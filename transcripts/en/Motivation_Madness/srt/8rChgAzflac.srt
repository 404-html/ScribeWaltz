1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,123
Oh,

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,000
and the biggest one is mindset.
You know,

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,490
to me,
the thing that has really become

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,570
fascinating,
you know,

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,050
the reason there's not a lot of content
that I put out between 2011 and 2014 if

6
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:24,380
you go back and look at the Internet,
is because I needed to go run and build

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:28,370
vayner media again for myself.
Because after writing crush it and

8
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:33,371
speaking a little bit from 2009 to 2011,
I was starting to get into a place where

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,540
people were talking about me and calling
me a speaker or a motivational speaker

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,250
and author,
an author,

11
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,820
which is super fine and an incredible
thing to do.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,350
Uh,
but for me,

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,700
my pride isn't being a practitioner and
being an entrepreneur and being a ceo,

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:53,660
I needed to build a nother hundred
million dollar plus business.

15
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:54,980
Really,
to be frank with you,

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,250
I need to feel comfortable standing here
and spitting my 2 cents on things.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I think that you need to have an
execution other than ideas to have the

18
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:10,370
audacity to stand up here and expect
people to waste her time and money

19
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:14,390
listening to what you have to say.
And so I'm proud that over the last six

20
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:19,190
years I've been executing vayner media.
And while I do this Gary v thing,

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,910
Gary Vaynerchuk,
the CEO of $150 million holding company

22
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,130
from scratch is exciting and
interesting.

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,640
And it really has become obvious to me
why that's happening.

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,320
And it's around mindset.
I,

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,490
I think that there's way too many people
in this audience that are in the excuse

26
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,160
business.
I've,

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,700
uh,
and yeah,

28
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:40,490
and it's,
and it's tough because I'm empathetic.

29
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,440
There's always things,
you know,

30
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,050
you could have two parents that were
drug addicts.

31
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:48,260
You could have lost your parents in a
car accident when you were a kid.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,620
You could have had your money stolen to
you by a partner.

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,570
There's so many things that happen in
life.

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,890
I'm super empathetic to it.
The ultimate problem is though,

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,900
is that the market,
the world doesn't care right there.

36
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:07,220
There's so much dwelling going on.
So many reasons why not.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,520
And the thing that has been really
interesting to me is that if you asked

38
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:15,521
me what works for me,
it's optimism and gratitude and positive

39
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,170
mindset.
Like it's really interesting to me.

40
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,930
Life is pretty binary.
It's either black or white.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,170
It's either yes or no.
And the one that matters to me the most

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,280
is you're either on the offense in your
life right now or you're on the defense.

43
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,820
You're either coming up with reasons why
not all this technology,

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,590
all this stuff.
Then why not?

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,050
Or why,
yes,

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,940
all this technology,
all this stuff.

47
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,610
You're looking at things and you're
making a decision.

48
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,760
And so for me,
a lot of what I've been thinking about

49
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,620
is mindset and why optimism works.

50
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,220
Literally seven minutes ago in the,
in the green room,

51
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,500
I'm on the phone with executives at
vayner media.

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,620
I'm getting texts of a scope that we
expect it to sign.

53
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,940
Failed million dollars,
literally counting out $1 million gone.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,010
Zero not happening.
Right?

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,170
Another pitch we went to final to $8
million,

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,110
didn't get it.
Literally in 47 second step back in the

57
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,240
back room.
I lost $9 million

58
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,620
and I'll be very frank with you.
I'm fucking pumped about it.

59
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,880
I genuinely like losing.
I like learning from it.

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,860
I was like thinking about like why?
What happened,

61
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,760
where we go,
where it was,

62
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,690
the MISSTEP,
why?

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,750
Like it's really incredible and look
when you can afford to lose it.

64
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,490
And I'm sure people are thinking is it's
easier.

65
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,500
I get,
it's not like I lost 9 million beaner

66
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,550
loss,
9 million revenue,

67
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:35,440
but to me it's not about anything other
than mindset.

68
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,680
And so if I got anything out of this,
I'll go into the tactics.

69
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,940
I'll talk to you about social in a
minute.

70
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm about to tell you why facebook and
Instagram,

71
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,220
you know,
did a lot of homework on Saturday about

72
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,950
the Australian market.
On my thesis is around influencers,

73
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,970
Instagram,
facebook,

74
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,190
and snapchat.
Let me save you a lot of time.

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,350
Everything that you've been hearing me
talk about,

76
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,820
how many people here are consumed my
content?

77
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,650
Raise your hands.
Thank you.

78
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,080
That was awesome.
Just going to do that again.

79
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,190
How many people here are consuming
content?

80
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,610
So here's what's interesting.
Literally everything that I'm spitting

81
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,190
comes obviously from an American centric
point of view.

82
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,410
That's where I operate.
Obviously we have a UK office,

83
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,120
we're looking at Singapore,
we're doing other things,

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,830
but I'm aware that outside of Russia and
men mainly and shine them most,

85
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,440
most of the stuff that actually works,
maybe there's a couple of different

86
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,050
nuances.
What fascinates the shit out of me is

87
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,770
the consumption patterns of the
Australian and New Zealand market and

88
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,860
the underpriced nature extremities of
what I believe in.

89
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,130
Literally everything that I've been
talking about for the last year,

90
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,350
you can add a additional 20 to 40% tax
of upside.

91
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,970
It is literally 20 to 40% even better in
this market.

92
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,530
And I get so pissed when people are in
any police besides the u s market or

93
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,820
China where they're like,
well,

94
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,750
it's a smaller market.
It's this,

95
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,930
that and the,
that's where all the upside is.

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,690
You can only compete against what you
can compete against.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
Right?
And so I believe that we are living

98
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,380
through the greatest era to be an
entrepreneur ever.

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,340
I think the Internet is grossly
underestimated and I think there's a ton

100
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,580
of opportunity,
but if you asked me what I would want to

101
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:13,200
leave with from this talk today,
it's to shift one or two persons

102
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,620
mindsets.
You know?

103
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:19,621
To me it's an incredible feeling to
stand up here and expect nothing from

104
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,400
nobody and take full responsibility for
everything.

105
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,830
I the Teleco company that gave it to us
and we lost it and weed in the backroom,

106
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,640
the 8 million.
I spent zero days in,

107
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,550
zero seconds on it.
I was not part of the pitch.

108
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,590
I was not part of the process.
I empowered on my people.

109
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,100
I saw the news in the back room and I
took full 100% blame and responsibility.

110
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,070
I am fascinated by your upbringing,
both your parents and the neighborhood

111
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:53,131
and those siblings and the friends.
I am fascinated by your upbringing,

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
the era you grew up in,
the macro and micro that you grew up in,

113
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,700
not the fucking weather.
I mean the economics and the politics

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and that climate.
I'm fascinated what made me my mom,

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,340
my dad being an immigrant from Russia,
being in America,

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,040
being in Jersey like like the friends I
ran into,

117
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,650
baseball cards becoming popular,
allowing me to sell something.

118
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm fascinated the environment that
created me in this completely emotional

119
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:25,100
place of enormous strength,
which is the engine and the oxygen that

120
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:30,101
allows me to be successful in business
and life and then what is it that other

121
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,110
people don't have or didn't have?
And I see it.

122
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,390
I see how my grandmother parented my
dad.

123
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,750
I see my sisters and brothers DNA
different than mine.

124
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,520
You know,
just timing and things of that nature.

125
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,230
And so I'm going heady for my opening
spot because I need you to understand

126
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,230
too many of you are going to take
fucking notes right now and think it's

127
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:52,010
about a facebook ad to many of you are
about to take a note and be like,

128
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,010
okay,
Google how to use instagram influencers.

129
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,930
We'll get to that.
I'm about to talk about that.

130
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,620
But if your foundation isn't right,
you have no shot of longterm success.

131
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,380
If you're not in a place where you
believe this and look,

132
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,930
this is super like I'm even like
throwing up on my,

133
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,820
to be very frank,
here's what's happening in my head.

134
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm listening to what I'm seeing right
now.

135
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm like,
this fucking sucks.

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,700
I'm being serious.
I'm being really fucking serious with

137
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,370
you actually,
and I'm seeing that because I'm like,

138
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,520
man,
it's so hot.

139
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,230
What I'm talking about is like so hard
to like touch,

140
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,140
right?
But it's still my truth.

141
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,810
It's what I believe.
Like you're either on the offense or

142
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:32,780
you're on the defense.
You either see all these technologies as

143
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:37,400
the gateway drug to your entire future
or you're upset that it was much easier

144
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:41,420
to do this on email and seo and you
don't like this social media thing,

145
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,970
right?
I don't like these new things either.

146
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,930
I built my dad's business from a three
to a $60 million business on email and

147
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,660
Google ad words.
I didn't want youtube to come along.

148
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,580
I didn't want twitter to come along,
right?

149
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,060
I didn't want facebook to come along.
I didn't want snapchat to come along.

150
00:07:56,061 --> 00:08:00,230
I don't want a voice and Alexa skills
and podcast to come along.

151
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,231
I'm not looking forward to Vr.
The problem is technology and the way we

152
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,050
live doesn't care about my opinion or my
feelings.

153
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:13,280
And it doesn't care about yours either.
And so you can walk around earth and

154
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,330
judge,
oh,

155
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,990
it's so sad that all these kids can't
communicate because they're on the phone

156
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:20,420
anymore.
Or you can walk out tonight and have

157
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,660
dinner and see people at a table and
nobody's talking to each other and

158
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,700
they're all on the phone and your
judging.

159
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,080
And you could talk about a day and age
when it was simpler and nicer and all

160
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,060
this.
Nobody gives a fuck.

161
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,610
And if you don't adjust to the reality
of the situation,

162
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,730
you will be completely left behind.
And that's it.

163
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,790
Too many people are executing or hoping
or trying to figure out how to live in a

164
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:51,491
world that used to be or the way they
wish it was versus attacking the reality

165
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,990
of the world.
And here is the reality of the world.

166
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,000
My friends,
the cell phones that you're all holding

167
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,990
right now or in your pocket or the
remote controls of our society,

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,660
they are the single most important thing
in the world.

169
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,880
There's nothing close.
Literally,

170
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,580
literally,
I would rather have somebody roll up on

171
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,580
me right now,
stab me with a knife and steal my wallet

172
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,810
than lose my phone.

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
The world is being lived through that
device and you can judge it.

174
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,960
You can do anything you want,
but that's the reality and if you sit

175
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,570
here today and have any ambitions
professionally,

176
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,940
personally,
whether you want to sell a course,

177
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,910
whether you want to sell a sneaker,
whether you want to raise money for the

178
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:37,911
PTA or nonprofit gets somebody elected,
whatever you want to happen in life,

179
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,900
whatever you want to happen in life,
you first need somebody's attention and

180
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,240
then you need to tell them about it in
the written word,

181
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,020
in audio or video.
This is how the world works and always

182
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:54,480
has.
You want something to happen.

183
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,010
You need to figure out where the people
are to tell them about that thing and

184
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,840
then you need to communicate that to
them.

185
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,710
In a compelling enough way that they do
the thing that you want them to do.

186
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,210
You can do that in the written word.
You can do that in audio and you can do

187
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,370
that in video.
That is how it's been.

188
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,490
It was called the newspaper,
the television and the radio.

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,180
Now it's called a blog of blog or a
podcast.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,690
It's the same thing.
Nothing's changed except one thing.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,640
Your attention is moving to a new place
and leaving an old place.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,320
The other thing is we have not figured
out the creative strategies to be

193
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:34,500
successful in this world.
The other thing is there's a lot of

194
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,460
people in here who are not self aware
and don't realize they should only be

195
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:43,461
writing and not making videos because
they're not good at it or reversed or

196
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,370
reverse these blanket statements that
everybody needs a personal brand or

197
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,130
everybody should be doing video.
That is ludicrous.

198
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,610
What everybody should be doing is
deploying self awareness and figuring

199
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,660
out who they are.

200
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,290
Quadrupled Downing on what they're
fucking good at and trying to get

201
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,750
resources to support the stuff they suck
at.

202
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,450
I've written four.
Thank you.

203
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,710
I've written,
thank you.

204
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,690
I've written for,
you know,

205
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,050
when she was like,
he's written for New York Times best

206
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,250
selling books.
I literally was laughing as I was about

207
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,150
to get to the stairs.
I'm like,

208
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,480
I can't put two fucking sentences
together if my life depended on it,

209
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,670
but I know how to hire a ghost writer
and I definitely know how to sit down

210
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:24,000
for nine hours straight and record a
book in one fucking sitting.

211
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,930
Right.
You need to figure out how you

212
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,950
communicate to the world as an executer,
which medium.

213
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,500
Some of you could do all three.
Some can do too,

214
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,260
but watch what's been happening over the
last 10 years.

215
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,790
In 2000 or 15 in 2002 to four it was the
era of the blog.

216
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,550
It was bloggers.
How many people here were a blogger from

217
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,920
2002 to 2005 at any point,
raise your hands.

218
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,650
So some of these early piners like they
felt the impact,

219
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,030
right?
Right.

220
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,260
You were blogging.
That was it.

221
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,340
That was the medium.
Wordpress or you know,

222
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:57,580
even going back further,
like it was just a very important

223
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,430
medium.
Youtube had been yet to be invented.

224
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,500
You know,
it costs too much to stream video

225
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,570
online.
There was no video players.

226
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,250
Podcasting then came in 2005 and six had
a little blip,

227
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,800
but then write quickly after that,
twitter came out,

228
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,300
youtube came out and everything shifted
to short form writing and video,

229
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,760
right?
And then in the last two years,

230
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,510
audio has risen again.
How many people here now listen to a

231
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,130
podcast?
Raise your hands.

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,120
How many of those hands did not listen
to a podcast three years ago?

233
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,980
Raise your hands.
Hold them up.

234
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,611
Actually,
you know what?

235
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,230
Watch this for visual.
We're gonna do this one more time.

236
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,850
How many people watched how many people
are listening to a podcast now?

237
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,340
Raise your hands.
I want people in the front to look

238
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,390
around.
See what I see?

239
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,390
All right,
an insane amount.

240
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,140
Now of those people,
of the people that now listen to a

241
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,120
podcast,
stand up.

242
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,750
If you did not listen to a podcast three
years ago

243
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,510
and you'd be look around because if you
want to understand why I'm standing on

244
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:04,960
this stage right now,
I didn't say sit down.

245
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,741
I'll just get him,
get him,

246
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,574
get him,
get a kitty cat

247
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,190
if you want to understand why I'm so
blessed to sit on the stage is I have a

248
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:17,650
unique uncanny.
I take no credit.

249
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:21,280
My parents get all the credit ability to
slowly understand what you're about to

250
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,710
do before you think you're going to do
it.

251
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,500
And so what I do is when I know
something's coming,

252
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,980
I have humility and this is a word that
I would love for people to look up,

253
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,650
understand,
and start really becoming religious

254
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:40,270
about for all my ego and peacocking,
for the ones in here who've been paying

255
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,810
attention,
it is my humility that has allowed me to

256
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,090
be successful,
not in the way that I interact with you

257
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,510
and being kind,
because that's kindness in the humility

258
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,610
that when I believe something new is
emerging,

259
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,880
I take the perceived risk of going there
first,

260
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,470
spending countless hours with no clear
Roi in the short you,

261
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:06,520
many people in here have left ungodly
amounts of money because when social

262
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:07,331
came along,
they said,

263
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,250
well,
what's the Roi of facebook and twitter?
