1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,580
Move on,
straight up,

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,410
move on,
forget them.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,900
They are lying and they are
untrustworthy,

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,870
so move on.
Now,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,230
sometimes this can be hard,
especially if they've somehow tied

6
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:29,890
themselves into your life,
especially like for instance,

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,550
you get the kids involved in a divorce
scenario,

8
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:37,720
you can't move on,
but you have to mentally move on.

9
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,721
You have to emotionally detach from that
human and that's hard to do because

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,750
obviously they were someone that you
trusted and the reason I know that you

11
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:55,510
trusted them is because they got to a
point where they were able to betray

12
00:00:55,511 --> 00:01:00,511
your trust and destroy you so they they.
It's hard,

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,310
but the fact that they trust that you
trusted them,

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,340
the fact that you had that relationship,
that's even more reason to walk away.

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,340
It's even more reason to move on.
You've got to see them for

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,990
what they are,
and this is an important piece right

17
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:21,290
here.

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,790
This is an important piece,
is something I learned as a young lad

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,030
out there in the world.
That person is not who you thought they

20
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,610
were,
right?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They are not who you thought they were.
The idea that this person

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,260
was a trustworthy,
faithful companion is not true.

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,910
It is not true.
That person does not exist.

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,420
They didn't exist and they don't exist.
It was in your head.

25
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,560
It was in your head that this person who
is trustworthy and you the they were

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,780
everything you wanted them to be and
they were faithful,

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,490
commanded.
That is a lie.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,900
They are not that person.
They have proved it.

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,310
They've proved it by their actions,
so

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,130
move on and at the risk of sounding
callous,

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,593
get over it,

32
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,740
get over it.
Do not dwell.

33
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
Do not dwell on to not dwell on on what
it was and don't dwell on what it could

34
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:35,230
have been.
You.

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,210
Who are you and guys go through bad
breakups.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,630
You know it's.
I just thought we were going to say no.

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,590
Don't dwell on that.
Deal with what it is right now.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,760
What that person is.
Deal with reality except reality and be

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,900
be thankful free album.
He thankful that you were able to learn

40
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,670
before you invested more into this
person.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,090
Be Be.
Be Thankful that you found out when you

42
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,200
did that this person was a liar,
that this person was unfaithful,

43
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,840
is untrustworthy.
Be Be thankful

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,540
that you know it and you know it now
instead of later and you know what else

45
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,650
is going to make it a lot easier to get
over these situations is recognize that

46
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,680
there's plenty of people out there in
the world are trustworthy and that our

47
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,710
faith,
we're good people.

48
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,500
They're out there.
Go find one of them,

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,543
but

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,190
don't think that that person that you
had was the only one in the world.

51
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,970
They're not.
And you know what if that as sometimes,

52
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,350
sometimes people have a hard time making
that trust because they're so caught up

53
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:41,770
and they,
they,

54
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,360
they don't want to meet someone else
right away.

55
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,550
That's fine.
Start with yourself,

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,010
right?
Rely on yourself.

57
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,250
Trust yourself because we want.
When someone breaks our trust,

58
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,980
we,
we,

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,130
we questioned ourselves too,
like we think are my judgments bad.

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,330
I'm not a good judge of human character
because I totally put my faith in this

61
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,910
person and look what they did to me.
So now we don't trust our.

62
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,230
So you've got to build that trust up.
You got to build that trust up back

63
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,700
again with yourself.
How do you do that?

64
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,370
Read
right?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Learn workout,
be alone.

66
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,390
It's okay to be alone.
Some people get freaked out when they're

67
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,920
alone.
It's okay to be alone.

68
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,140
It's okay.
It's okay to be alone.

69
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,540
There's no big deal.
Enjoy it.

70
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,930
Do something productive and build that
trust up in yourself.

71
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,700
You'll look back at a situation and
learn from it.

72
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,680
We do that.
It's an post operational debrief.

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,570
Oh,
you've put too much trust in somebody.

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,070
Cool.
They broke your heart.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,970
All right,
Roger that.

76
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,310
Let's see.
What would the steps,

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,990
what should I have recognized?
How many times did I say will?

78
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,580
You know?
They didn't call me,

79
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:50,610
but it's probably just because their
phone was out of battery.

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,640
No,
once your phone runs out of battery

81
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:54,480
once.
Okay.

82
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,250
You don't let it happen again.
Right?

83
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,960
So you start seeing those red flags to
you,

84
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,840
the mistakes that you made,
and then look for them next time around

85
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,790
because you deal with people all the
time that they made mistakes.

86
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,370
The first run,
they go back and they make the same

87
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:09,181
mistakes.
The second run,

88
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,410
they go back and make the same mistakes.

89
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,540
That third rung,
that's when you got to start blaming

90
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,560
yourself on your situation.
That's why.

91
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,710
That's why I said you got to like build
a relationship with yourself.

92
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,110
You gotta learn yourself.
You've got to trust.

93
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,050
You've got to learn to trust yourself,
so spend some time doing that and

94
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,390
then when you go back and you start
dealing with people,

95
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,070
because that's what,
that's what you got to watch out for is

96
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:36,730
that you become a hardened criminal.
You don't trust anybody like you were

97
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,820
talking about cops.
You know sometimes cops have a hard time

98
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:43,570
because they're dealing with scumbags
all day long and it builds up this,

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
this mistrust of other people.
So you don't want to have that happen.

100
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,990
You want to be suspicious of people,
but you want to be able to build trust

101
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:57,070
once they proved themselves.
So take those small steps and start

102
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,973
build up

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,830
overtime.
Don't just jump in and give someone 100

104
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,270
percent trust out of the gate.
You don't know him,

105
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,310
don't know him.
You know,

106
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,620
back in the day,
back in the day when old hardcore bands

107
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,430
used to have this t shirt that just says
trust.

108
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,870
No one was like,
yeah,

109
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,220
that's legit.
Right?

110
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,680
You don't.
Don't go out of the gate with the big

111
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,530
trust on somebody with important stuff.
Don't do it.

112
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,350
But the good news is,
like I said,

113
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,260
there's plenty of people out there that
are good people that you give you.

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,690
Give all your trust to just take it slow
brother.

115
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,840
Feel crazy how you just explained that.
So simple and it makes total sense when

116
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,710
you're in the situation though,
you know,

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,340
like you can't just detach it.

118
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,050
Be like,
what are the red flags that I didn't

119
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,870
know?
You're too busy missing the person or

120
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,490
whatever,
your disaster,

121
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,050
but even
going and looking at pictures has to

122
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,590
work to get out the picture and stare.
I've seen guys do that.

123
00:06:58,591 --> 00:06:59,424
I'm like,
Bro,

124
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,560
give me that.
Let me throw this away for you.

125
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,560
That's not going to help that person.
If that.

126
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,150
I was always to me was,
was explaining like,

127
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,370
listen
guys,

128
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,050
what she was.
No,

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,530
no,
she wasn't a.

130
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,870
That is a lie,
that person that you put put together in

131
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,550
your head that you've assembled in your
mind,

132
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,790
that person doesn't exist.
They don't exist.

133
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,150
The person that you dealt with was a
liar,

134
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,060
was unfaithful,
was a cheater.

135
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,730
That's the person,
the person who wasn't this person that

136
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,760
you're putting forth in your mind.
That person doesn't exist,

137
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,920
so stop,
but you don't understand the good time.

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,840
Yeah,
I know.

139
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,674
I know.
I know.

140
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,470
Here's the trick.
Okay,

141
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,780
so
if.

142
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,380
Okay,
that person will lie.

143
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,770
That part of the cheater and what I kind
of said there was like you don't

144
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,360
understand the good time.
That's a real part of it.

145
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,680
That's really it.
It's like,

146
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,700
sure they did this.
Sure.

147
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,440
She.
I'm a flats.

148
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,200
My tires when she gets measured,
all that,

149
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,720
but the good times we have are so good.
So it's.

150
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,510
It's,
it's proof that it.

151
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,190
It's not about the person.
It's not about the person that you can

152
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,580
see all the red flags and how they
mistreat you from time to time or they

153
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,550
you.
It's about yourself and how you're sad

154
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,510
now because of all these reasons,
but the trick comes with what one of the

155
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,070
tricks come with.
Um,

156
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,670
same thing I said about drinking where
it's your brain because it's like

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,320
chemicals when you bond with someone in
certain in certain ways.

158
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,370
And it's different from,
you know,

159
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,310
it varies from person to person,
but it's like,

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,010
I think it's like oxytocin or I don't
know,

161
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,190
something where it's,
it's it,

162
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,900
but yeah,
it's going to.

163
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,140
But you feel this bond with this
specific person.

164
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,830
That's why you have these feelings.
Even though this girl like lies to you,

165
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,980
you see her lying text messages on your
phone right now.

166
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,330
You're looking at him.
Meanwhile,

167
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,430
you still,
men still miss him.

168
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:44,431
It's a trick because it seemed like that
your emotional wellbeing is attached to

169
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,160
this person kind of thing.
Right?

170
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,730
And all the other stuff,
you just kind of ignore it.

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,390
So it just like,
I'm the same with drinking,

172
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,740
right?
Why know?

173
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,620
Consciously like,
I'm going to be hung over tomorrow.

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,700
I get anything done,
all this stuff.

175
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,350
Why do I want to drink so bad right now?
You know,

176
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,010
kind of thing and it's the same thing.

177
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,180
The chemicals in your brain are telling
you like this girl is essential for you.

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,610
You know,
for your wellbeing is not yet.

179
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,810
Oh,
that's the logic though.

180
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,040
That's a lie.
It's a tricky.

181
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,390
Listen to that.
Don't listen to your brain.

182
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:15,910
Listen to me that she's not essential.
That's all you bro.

183
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm telling you.
But that's the logic.

184
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Those chemicals are blocking.
I have seen so many situations where

185
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:27,930
guys are just in.
What's horrible is I'm sitting here

186
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:28,870
saying this,
it's.

187
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,620
You could be smacking someone in the
face telling them,

188
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,371
move on,
move on,

189
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,400
and they're not to listen to that too.
So you gotta make that decision.

190
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,141
Yeah,
that's,

191
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,950
that's,
that's it's hard.

192
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,750
And guys ruined their lives.
I mean the oldest due to the girls and

193
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,240
guys,
they ruined their lives,

194
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,050
you know,
with over somebody that is completely

195
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:49,200
abusive,
whether mentally or physically that just

196
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,510
completely abusive and they'll ruin
their lives for this person.

197
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,610
That per se,
in my mind,

198
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:55,950
I think it's because they build a
person,

199
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,150
they build a person on the framework of
reality.

200
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,680
They build a fantasy and they're in love
with that fantasy and they want to keep

201
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,514
it going.
Right?

202
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,330
It's a fantasy.
So stop and they get away ignore like

203
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,390
all the quona version for sure,
and they remember the good times.

204
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:15,210
Even if it's like like 10 minutes a
week,

205
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,600
they remember those good times.
They ignore the red flags

206
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,710
because of that,
that you know that trick,

207
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:27,060
that chemical trick in their brain and
so it reinforces that thing that they

208
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:27,871
built.
You know,

209
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:29,580
that fantasy that they built there.
It's true,

210
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,210
this big.
The reality is this big and look the

211
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,320
street and they just attached to it.
You ever see a friend or whatever

212
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,130
because I'm assuming you're in,
you've never been in this situation like

213
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,930
you ever had a friend where they're
really into it.

214
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,180
They're almost ruining their life.
They're in bad shape or whatever,

215
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,460
and then whether it be all of a sudden
or years later,

216
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,670
whatever they're thinking back in,
they're like,

217
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,371
whoa.
Was.

218
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,760
I think because the chemical trick so to
speak,

219
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,280
wears off,
and then they can see all of that logic

220
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,840
that you're talking about.
You're like,

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,010
oh my gosh,
man,

222
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,360
it's,
it's almost like,

223
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,580
it's almost like you feel like you were
a different person when you recover your

224
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,221
kids.
I mean,

225
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:09,510
just the fact that you can't talk any
sense into people when they're in that

226
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,610
situation is the trick.
You got to try and.

227
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,953
Yeah,
it's hard.

228
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
It's hard,
but I think knowing that that's it.

229
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,320
It's a chemical in your brain that is
tricking you and it goes for a lot of

230
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,600
stuff.
Donuts,

231
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:23,520
like all this that's tricking you.
If you know like,

232
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,480
Hey,
and you say,

233
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,010
I'm not going to be tricked.
I feel it.

234
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,800
I feel this.
I feel the sadness.

235
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,150
I feel missing this person,
but it's a trick,

236
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,163
you know?
Yeah,

237
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,570
it helps.
It totally helps.

238
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,410
I like it.
So move on,

239
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,060
man.
I know it's hard.

240
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,970
Trust us.
Speaking of moving on,

241
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,900
next question,
unless we want to talk about this

242
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,743
anymore.
No,

243
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,460
I think you're ready to move on.
Exactly right.

244
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,294
Let's move on.

245
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,430
In what circumstances

246
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,890
do you recommend direct?
I will hold on.

247
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
Oh,
we're not going to be stuck on,

248
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
but what's horrible is been people
killed themselves in these situations

249
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,900
over a lie.
Yeah,

250
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,641
that's,
that's me.

251
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:11,641
That's the trick,
but it's a lie in guys or girls get so

252
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:16,651
distraught over this fantasy that
doesn't exist and what's really jacked

253
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,700
up is if they could just move on,
they'd find a reality that was actually

254
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,340
congruent with what their desires are.
It's out there.

255
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,000
You can see people all over the world.
They're there,

256
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,330
they're in relationships.
I having fun from every level,

257
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
right?
There's someone out there,

258
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,490
but you,
you get caught up in this mental trap

259
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,820
and,
and obsessing over a fantasy.

260
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,200
It's a fantasy.
Don't,

261
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,480
don't,
don't obsess over the fantasy,

262
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,540
man.
There's,

263
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,860
you can,
you can get over it and there's plenty

264
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,230
of other human beings out there that are
awesome.

265
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,290
So go find one of them,
and in the meantime,

266
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,750
hang out with your Badass self,
right?

267
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,920
Become a better person and working out
is a big one for sure.

268
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
For sure.
That's it.

269
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,640
That's the 100 percent.
Just get,

270
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,610
get into the gym and get after it.
Jujitsu solves everything.

271
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,680
Yes,
lifting solves everyday.
