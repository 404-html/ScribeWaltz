1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,800
I have a terrible experience,
made a lot of mistakes when I was young

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,480
and child.
I think if you succeed,

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,540
every mistakes become a legendary.
If you feel that's just the garbage,

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,760
you know what I'm saying?

5
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,043
I think

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,810
everybody has great stories.
Everybody had a lot of mistakes,

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,280
everybody have lot of problems.
But very few people listen to you one

8
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:52,020
day where it becomes successful.
People listened to you say,

9
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,610
wow,
you are great.

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,950
I'm not that great.
I was born a normal family

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,590
and I'm not a good as schooling.
Of course,

12
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,750
I tried to study hard,
but as a boy,

13
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,510
you know,
my school was not that good at that

14
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:14,950
time.
So I felt looking for jobs,

15
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,970
looking for joining university,
joining good schools.

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,260
But I never give up.
And I think there's one thing I learned

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,890
is that,
um,

18
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,310
why,
why you should have a chance to be

19
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:37,780
successful.
Everybody should get used to beat,

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,810
get used to feel and get used to be
accepted by other people.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Why other people should help you.
You should earn the right to be helped.

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,020
So the thing I learned is that don't
give up.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,150
My opportunity has not come yet.
When everybody complain,

24
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,730
that is the opportunity.
I always thought when I was young,

25
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,910
when I was graduate in the high school
or university,

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,670
I thought Bill Gates took up my job.
You know,

27
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,710
Bill Gates did all the successful
things.

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,340
Larry Ellison from Oracle,
they,

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,430
they took all the wonderful
opportunities.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,420
IBM benefit,
we people have no opportunity

31
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,070
and I think our aim too high.
I should aim to support and help the

32
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:41,061
people around me to tiny things.
I never thought I could be today after

33
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,150
18 years,
Ali Baba become today's size.

34
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,760
Not because I'm smart.
I don't think I'm a smart person,

35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,360
but I have.
I work with a lot of smarter people

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,980
and most of the smart people,
they always want to do successful

37
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,090
things,
quick,

38
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,950
easy things.
And I think it's not easy to be

39
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:14,150
successful quickly.
Every time.

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,610
Everything we do,
we prepare for 10 years.

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,080
I know I'm not smart.
If we want to be successful,

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,030
we have to win 10 years later.
If we want to be successful,

43
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,090
we have to work with smart people.
If we want to be successful,

44
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,570
we should make a lot of mistakes and
never give up.

45
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,570
A lot of people,
they make mistake them problem.

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
They give up.
We never give up.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,460
We learn from the stakes
and I think when we're filled their

48
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:50,570
message,
the experience that I want to give you a

49
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:51,710
device,
I want to give you,

50
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,050
you a judge.
When this person will be successful,

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,060
not by where his cell,
he thinks it's his fault or the other

52
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:04,180
Ford,
if he thinks my field,

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,740
because of the others,
this guy has no chance.

54
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,850
Those people who feel always think,
hmm,

55
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,370
it is my fun.
I did not do the properly.

56
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,080
I should change care or change you
there.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,320
These guys have opportunities,
so I learned a lot from those people who

58
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:25,790
fail.
I learned a lot from those people who

59
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,940
made mistakes.
I learned a lot from my mistakes.

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,880
So this is what I,
when I,

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,790
this is my life attitude.
When I feel I say,

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,090
see,
I will fail when I succeed.

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,900
I said,
well,

64
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,610
I never know.
I could be successful.

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,900
This make me very positive and
optimistic and because of so many

66
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,790
mistakes,
too much of failure that make me never

67
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,930
complained.
God,

68
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,670
I get used to that.
We are making this stick everyday.

69
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Even to today,
we made stupid decisions almost every

70
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,200
day.
Nobody knows.

71
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,440
We thought as smart,
but finding approves stupid.

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,770
But we learn.
We'll do again.

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,150
We'll learn.
We'll do again.

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,130
That's the way.
That's the live attitude.

75
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,920
Thank you.
Thank you.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,730
I'll leave a,
bob was born in China,

77
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,790
but it was created for the whole world.
So can you tell us what Alibaba does now

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,070
outside of China and in particular in
Russia?

79
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,720
We're good buddy.
Alibaba builds notice of the lawsuit,

80
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,780
the [inaudible] Moses
chimps than you might sally.

81
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,850
Bubba [inaudible].

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Yeah.
Ali Baba stuff from no money,

83
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,500
no technology,
no people in my apartment,

84
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,190
18 people decide that we want the using
Internet technologies to help small

85
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,260
business.
That was the idea.

86
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,080
After 18 years,
we grow from 18 people.

87
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
Two today close to 60,000 people.
It is really not easy,

88
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,620
but we survive today.
We are one of the biggest internet

89
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,280
companies in the world.
I think we're lucky

90
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,220
we made so many mistakes,
but we still survive.

91
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,430
How can you be continued to be lucky?
That is the question.

92
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,470
Keep on asking me.
I think if you want to continue to be

93
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:08,471
lucky,
you have to give your lot to the others.

94
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,430
You give luck to the others.
You help others.

95
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,740
The operas in the future,
we're helping you.

96
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,100
That was my,
our thinking in the past 10 years.

97
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,910
Ali Baba was born in China,
but Alibaba should not be a Chinese

98
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:29,270
company.
The name the day when I choose the name

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,570
Ali Baba,
Ali Baba is not a Chinese name.

100
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,230
It's a Arabic name and Iran's that is
Iran nicknamed Turkey says taking him.

101
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,480
I don't,
I don't know we're in name,

102
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,220
but it's the name from Alibaba,
1000 when mistakes or Alibaba,

103
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,140
one founder,
one nights the story.

104
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,820
We want to make this company a company
that Boeing Chinar enabled the world

105
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,940
helping the global young company,
young people.

106
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,570
As I said that every century there's a
company for the century.

107
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,530
Microsoft was the company of last
century as a great century.

108
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,410
Ivn was a company of the century.
What is the company of this century,

109
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,490
21st century and I think it's,
we should not think about Alibaba.

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
We should always,
we make money,

111
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
serve Chinese.
We should have made the money,

112
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,960
serve the world,
serve this century.

113
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,010
This only think in that way we can do
more.

114
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Our company today is big but compared to
yesterday it was big but compared to

115
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:54,851
tomorrow it is still a tiny company.
The world changes so fast.

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
So this is our thinking.
We want to make all the Moba be the

117
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:06,171
company of the century.
We want make Alibaba the company

118
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,270
supporting global,
small,

119
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:13,830
medium size companies.
We want to make this company supporting

120
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:18,831
global young people and we want to make
this company to making sure women can

121
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,110
have a more jobs online because people
don't care.

122
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,130
You're a woman or man online.
This is what we want to do and we're

123
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,170
doing a lot outside China,
Southeast Asia.

124
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,230
We are also doing lot in Indian.
We just started doing more in America

125
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,690
and the and also Canada.
In Russia we have a small business

126
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,480
that's called Ali Express.
Maybe I'll express here is very big,

127
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,940
but in Cha,
all company,

128
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,500
probably less than 1% of our business,
Ali Express,

129
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,650
but on express is not our main purpose
of doing business in Russia.

130
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,070
We do not want to be a Russia e commerce
company.

131
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,053
Okay.

132
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,660
We are not ecommerce company.
We help other company become ecommerce.

133
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,320
We hope what we want to do in Russia,
we wanted to help you rusher to boot up

134
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,270
their logistic system.
Raj is so big,

135
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,290
the live of things so difficult.
Oh,

136
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,970
I can.
I imagine.

137
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,820
I met to some Russian girls two years
ago.

138
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,290
I say,
do you use Ad Express?

139
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,170
A yes.
Oh,

140
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:42,420
sure.
Uh,

141
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,690
how long?
What about the speed of delivery?

142
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
They say it's great.
I said,

143
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,500
what do mean by grade?
She said,

144
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:54,501
only 45 days.
I mean,

145
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,470
Greg was 45 minutes,
not 45 days.

146
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,120
Now we've reduced from 45 days to 15
days,

147
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,590
but that is not enough.
Russia should have a more than logistics

148
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:16,641
system
that'd be able to deliver within 48

149
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,890
hours or 72 hours anywhere,
any place or Russia where you place on

150
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,270
an online,
we should get it within 72 hours and

151
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,960
this should have using technology.
This is your opportunity.

152
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Young people logistics terrible and you
have the chess.

153
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,240
If were just as good,
we have no chunks.

154
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,960
We should have [inaudible] or the
payment online,

155
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,390
online payment today in China,
the mobile phone payment,

156
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,980
so popular.
I went to

157
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
see a few weeks ago,
I saw some beggars on the street.

158
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,250
You are you back money.
They use difficult mobile phone because

159
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,540
people don't have a pocket of money.

160
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,020
So we in a rusher,
we should have built up a good payment

161
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,080
system.
I'm more than payment system that every

162
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:18,550
young people can receive money,
pay money at the lowest cost.

163
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,920
Every young people should have be able
to reach financial assistance and we

164
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,710
should have good up Russia's art
express.

165
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,030
We should have built up a Russia,
alibaba.com this is what we want to do.

166
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm okay whether on express someday in
Russia,

167
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,330
no business.
But we should have luck rushing young

168
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:46,791
people to develop its own logistic oh e
commerce platform all click the payment

169
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:52,740
platform.
We would love to join this force.

170
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,050
This is what we've been doing in the
past two years.

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,740
But how went to the Moscow university?
I have a,

172
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,850
I have a personal and dream in path two
years cause I'm not a good at a mess.

173
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,020
But computers size,
big cloud computing.

174
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,100
The basic is by the math.
Physics.

175
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,980
There's about computing technology.
Moscow university,

176
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,800
I think a,
you guys have the best of physics to

177
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,820
scientist and a mathematics.
So I would hope that Alibaba,

178
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,230
we just announced two weeks ago that we
invested 15 billion US dollars.

179
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,310
I'm building up a lab to solve the
problem for future solve the problem for

180
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,050
the world economy and social science.

181
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,650
So we hope that in Russia,
in Moscow we can viewed a lab that work

182
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:05,061
with the young excellent mathematicians
from Russia,

183
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
young physicist,
scientist from Russia.

184
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,530
We work together,
China rushing young people,

185
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,820
young scientists working together,
solve problem for future.

186
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,780
And I wanted to announce cure.
Our cto of chief technology officer is

187
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:29,691
coming to Moscow university very soon
and we want a high as many young people

188
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,400
as possible.
Join.

189
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,560
You don't have to work in China if you
don't like.

190
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,740
But if you love to work in China,
we are very happy you can work I office

191
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,760
here and joint together
full cloud computing,

192
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,290
big data for the future and artificial
intelligence and machine intelligence.

193
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,530
This is something we want to do.
You Russia and this is something we

194
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,980
wanted to do together with Moscow
university.

195
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,200
That was your talents.
Here we have technology,

196
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,740
we have data,
we have consumers,

197
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,080
we have a little bit money.
You have talents.

198
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,730
We work together.
We can do something really big in this

199
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:20,390
way.
We can make Alibaba the company of the

200
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,223
century.

201
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,110
I would like to hear your thoughts on
technology today.

202
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:37,640
Many people are wary of it and
especially about the impact of

203
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:41,420
artificial intelligence on jobs and
society.

204
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,910
What are your thoughts on this?
Um,

205
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,970
Jack?
Yeah.

206
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,980
Boy.
[inaudible] minogue.

207
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,390
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] that
shot.

208
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,870
Don't worry about the future.
All right.

209
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:06,770
Don't worry about Tech College.
Let me tell you one thing.

210
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Why are you worried about the future?
That is because you are a lack of

211
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:17,910
confidence.
You lack of imagination.

212
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,370
We don't have,
I may not have the solution for future,

213
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,300
but there is a solution for future.
We don't have the solution for future,

214
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,350
but our young people have a solution for
future.

215
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,520
I find and this wall,
young people don't worry about the

216
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:39,470
future.
Older,

217
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,480
the people worry for the future.
I've found those six.

218
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,210
Today's successful people,
they worry about the future.

219
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Let me tell you,
future is the opportunity for everybody,

220
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,380
especially the opportunity for young
people because we have nothing to lose,

221
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,680
right?
This is what I tell myself.

222
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:08,710
18 years ago,
18 years ago,

223
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,650
we did not have money so we can,
we have no money to lose.

224
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,340
We don't have the technology.
We have no technology loose

225
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,220
and then we say we believe 10 20 years
later,

226
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,780
e commerce.
Internet will be powerful if we start to

227
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:30,781
do now
when a lot of success people successful

228
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:33,760
people don't like technology,
don't like Internet.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We started doing 10 20 years later,
we will be the expert.

230
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,730
10 20 years later we'll be successful.
So I think don't worry about the future.

231
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Prepare for the future.
Make your own future cloud computing,

232
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,760
big data,
artificial intelligence.

233
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
They are new to anybody.
You are successful,

234
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,730
new to you,
you are not successful,

235
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,070
new to you.
So what do you worry about?

236
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,300
Second thing is don't worry about the
things the other people worry about,

237
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:17,100
especially don't worry about the things
president and prime minister worry

238
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:21,150
about.
Worry about things you worry about.

239
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,070
We everybody have too many things to
worry about.

240
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,170
If you do not worry about yourself,
you worry too much about the world.

241
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,950
Now today,
Ali Baba should worry about the world.

242
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,130
You should not worry about the world
president of put these worry about what

243
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,710
you should not worry about the world.
You should worry about where you

244
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:46,320
graduate.
How can you make a living?

245
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,320
How can they do something that is
different?

246
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,670
How can you do something that is fun,
interesting,

247
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,810
and helping others?
By the way,

248
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,120
don't believe that technology is going
to take our way.

249
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,950
Human beings jobs.
Technology is going to replace a lot of

250
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:11,680
stupid jobs.
When the first,

251
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:16,681
the technology revolution come,
the steam machine comp people worry,

252
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,790
oh my God,
steamer,

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,520
she is going to take our,
we a lot of jobs.

254
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,040
After 50 years,
the steam machine created more jobs way

255
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,400
electricity comps.
Lot of companies worry about losing

256
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:39,091
jobs.
That electricity created so many jobs at

257
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:45,101
the Fisher intelligence,
they will create more jobs.

258
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,710
The problem is next to 2030 years may
lose credit,

259
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,510
lose a lot of job,
but this is shut period.

260
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,020
So we people have to learn how we can
survive in the artificial intelligent

261
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,450
period.
By the way,

262
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,230
why human being can wing machines,
machines,

263
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,580
they might be stronger deck human being.
They might be smart to that human being.

264
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,970
They might be rough faster,
the human being,

265
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,340
but they can never be as wise as human
beings because human being,

266
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,520
we have belief,
we have religion,

267
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,320
we have a heart,

268
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,190
which machine does not have.
So if you want to be ready for future,

269
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,940
please
did not follow yesterday's way of

270
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,050
learning and teaching.
Do not try to memory things harder and

271
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,940
more because computer can't remember.
Things are the more than you

272
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,060
do not try to calculate to faster
because the computer can,

273
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:09,061
cal could it much faster than you do.
So try to be creative,

274
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,160
tried to be innovative,
tried to be constructive.

275
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,350
These are the things,
everything you learn,

276
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,420
you think about is this thing can make
me more creative.

277
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,660
This one can be mum making me more
innovative.

278
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,520
This thing can be make me more
constructive as do it.

279
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,450
And also I think when other people
worry,

280
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,020
opportunity comps,
make them worry.

281
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,510
You should know nobody will and nobody
can stop this technology revolution.

282
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,740
You worry,
it comes.

283
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,990
You don't worry.
It comes.

284
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,210
So what's the point of a worry?
So I said people's a jet.

285
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Have you ever cried in the past 18 years
doing the business internet in China?

286
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,140
I don't cry because I know quiet does
not make any sense.

287
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:17,140
Does that help me?
If cry can help me,

288
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,400
I would cry every day.
We should not have cried.

289
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,460
We shouldn't make competitors cry.
So think about,

290
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,210
be positive.
Get ready for that.

291
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,440
If you,
people from Moscow university cannot a

292
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:42,931
solve the problem.
If you worry the whole,

293
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:47,860
whoa,
19 nine 9% of people have no future.

294
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,610
So don't worry about it.
The positive started do it.

295
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,200
And when people worry,
open the door,

296
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,170
see what are the worry about and the
solve the problem.

297
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,830
That's what I think.
And we will work together.

298
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,150
You're a great believer,

299
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,470
young people as a c and you spend so
much time with students and with young

300
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,760
entrepreneurs.
What advice is maybe some more you can

301
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:26,160
give to all of us?
Dick,

302
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,280
we watch in village more than two d but
[inaudible] [inaudible] that,

303
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,030
yeah,
I love to be with young people first.

304
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:46,031
I'm still yom.
And a second is that when you mel young

305
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:48,860
people,
you know,

306
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,160
you're young all the time and young
people are the solutions for tomorrow.

307
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,090
Okay.

308
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,330
Young people are the solutions for all
the worries.

309
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,820
Uh,
young people.

310
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,130
If you stay with them,
you will be full of energetic.

311
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,270
But the advice I give to the young
people is that also the advice I'd give

312
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:18,200
to myself,
that nothing is easy.

313
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Nothing is free.
If you want to be successful,

314
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,100
you have to pay the price.
I'll IBA by 18 years to today's size.

315
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,240
Yeah,
we are lucky.

316
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,880
Oh,
we work much harder than most of the

317
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:43,900
people will never sleep well and sound
in the evening.

318
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,220
I travel last year,
867 hours a year in the flood plane in

319
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,710
the plane.
I'm working hard.

320
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,760
My team working very hard.
18 years.

321
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,170
We work like a normal company.
70 years,

322
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,630
day and night.
Nothing is free.

323
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,020
Nothing is easy.
Easy beings.

324
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,470
You have to think different.
You have to do different.

325
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah.

326
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,260
If you,
everybody,

327
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,350
if a John said this is the right you for
John,

328
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,580
why you so you have to think,
for example,

329
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,460
early days in my company,
where's some ideas come to my desk.

330
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,890
Jack,
he's is a great idea and I look in every

331
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,500
like everybody's saying it is a good
idea.

332
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,360
Uh,
normally through into the rubbish

333
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,950
because everybody say there's good.
Then all the other people think of,

334
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,530
if everybody say this is going to be
very tough.

335
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,770
I'm very interested in that tough
question and a pickup and see how can we

336
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:05,841
do in a different way.
This is to be unique,

337
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,650
to be different and the third,
this is my advice and this is also

338
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,450
telling myself every day today is very
tough.

339
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,610
Tomorrow is more tougher.
The day off tomorrow is beautiful,

340
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
but most people die tomorrow evening.
You have to work very hard every tough

341
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,480
days,
every tough situation,

342
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,540
problems with meat.
That is the training of yourself

343
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,730
where you graduated at your school,

344
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,443
Ooh,

345
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,900
graduate from this school.
You just to start to your career of

346
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:56,450
learning,
you got a Ph d diploma,

347
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,450
a bachelor diploma.
This is just a certificate.

348
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,630
Your Paris pay the tuition for four
years.

349
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,160
Your real challenge is where you leave
the college.

350
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,390
The real life starts.
The real exam stats,

351
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,350
the real test of stats.
That's life.

352
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,200
One thing you got lucky,
as I said,

353
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:27,290
if students from Moscow university
cannot survive,

354
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,140
19 9.9% of people in the world cannot
survive.

355
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Only you have this confidence,
you will be able to face the challenge

356
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,333
of future.

357
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,343
You

358
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,780
do jack for all these stories for all
the sponsors.

359
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,840
And now I will turn to the audience and
you will have an ability and time to ask

360
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:59,470
your own questions and I'll appreciate
if you formulate them on English.

361
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:03,670
But if you have some problems,
we have someone who can repeat and we

362
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:06,910
will help you.
So who wants to be first?

363
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,343
Okay,

364
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,650
can you,
can you tell us who are you your name

365
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,800
and Bailey

366
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,220
law school?
Yes.

367
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,390
Oh,

368
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,640
my question is actually a little just
retold rhetorical.

369
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,350
So the times from one market is more
complete and there are times when market

370
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:36,120
is more competitive as an error is it's
hard to keep being confident on yourself

371
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:36,954
and your future.

372
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,770
Okay.

373
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,130
Okay.
So you formed the Lord Department.

374
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,490
The question is that in the time the
market is going to be more competitive,

375
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,640
how can you keep the confidence for the
future?

376
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:55,360
Right.
Knock it is never easy.

377
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,713
Okay.

378
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,990
In the early day,
just like a doing business is never

379
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,681
easy.
People say,

380
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:03,570
Oh,
I'm doing business more difficult.

381
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,810
No,
never is a continuum of more difficult.

382
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,740
The confidence is not.
The best way to do it is that find a

383
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:21,021
good team.
Find the people that share the same

384
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,780
vision,
same dreams,

385
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,130
work with them.
The only thing you listen is you listen

386
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:34,110
to grover up people.
If you doing a company,

387
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,160
listen to customers.
If they are happy,

388
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,630
if they your customers are happy,
don't worry too much.

389
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,510
You Stu,
have competitive.

390
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,230
Is your companies of your customers
happy?

391
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,410
Listen to your colleagues,
your team,

392
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,250
a big confidence.
If they have confidence,

393
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,760
don't worry about it.
Don't listen to a divisors lawyers.

394
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:08,070
I'm sorry.
Don't listen to those people are you

395
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,100
have no chance whether the market as a
child,

396
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:17,101
so not custom tell you,
your colleagues tell you.

397
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,143
So

398
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,360
nobody is the expert of future.
Most of the experts I yesterday.

399
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,710
So for the future,
the best way you learn it is know the

400
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,110
early days.
Ali Baba had no money,

401
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,630
no revenue,
nobody pay us

402
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,580
the revenue.
We got all the,

403
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:48,960
all the email of thanks from customers.
The customer send us email.

404
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,610
Oh Ali Baba,
you're so great.

405
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,450
You're helping me a lot,
but I don't have money to pay you fine.

406
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,890
We know one day they will pay if we
really help them.

407
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,820
So the confidence is from the customer's
confidence is from your team.

408
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,410
Hey,
y'all competitors always tried to

409
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:14,411
destroy your competence.
If your competitors spend a lot of time

410
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,480
is joy,
competence or confidence,

411
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,770
that means you're good.

412
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,073
Thank you.

413
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,110
Oh,
oh,

414
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,171
sorry.
No,

415
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:37,120
my question is going to be
watching price from us

416
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,170
as well.
To me just keep,

417
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,330
uh,
Jack,

418
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,820
uh,
my question is going to be a bit

419
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,470
sophisticated.
Well,

420
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:53,320
each is going to be regarding Russia and
delivery system.

421
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,730
Uh,
that's,

422
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:58,960
you inspired us to build up,
to build up the good one better than it

423
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,920
is now.
Uh,

424
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,210
however,
obviously we do not have this financial

425
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:09,211
opportunity that your company has steel.
We do not have a labor model delivery

426
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,960
now.
Well,

427
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,480
it as the first question,
second question.

428
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,910
Uh,
he does all of this that as like ass

429
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:22,010
others fees of production of goods and
services in Russian economy is

430
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,780
monopolized by government corporations.
What do you think of prospectus and

431
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:34,411
efficiency in Thomas in terms of
economic development of this current

432
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:35,734
situations

433
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,860
in the current market?
Thank you.

434
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,640
Thank you.
Good crushes.

435
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,810
The first question is will a good of a
logistic system,

436
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,840
but we don't have as much money as Ali
Baba,

437
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,350
so how can you be successful?
Right?

438
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,390
Tell me anybody who has some money for
building up our logistics system.

439
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,130
Okay.

440
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,130
I don't have money for good apple.
I don't think Ali Baba has the money to

441
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:11,041
build up rusher logistic system
cost then is then as billions of money.

442
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,850
Nobody has the money back has the money
they would not give you.

443
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,890
This is the opportunity.
You don't it first.

444
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,950
It's impossible to build up of
sophisticated at the logistics.

445
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:37,041
Them within one year takes about 10 1512
years and you have to do little by

446
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:40,614
little.

447
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,540
Okay,

448
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,540
this is the challenge.
I got nine year to file the one who's on

449
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:53,280
them to people's came to me say when we
go for raising money,

450
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,880
people ask,
how can you be successful?

451
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,130
No Internet in China enough,
no logistic,

452
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,280
no credit card,
no money,

453
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,800
no talents.
How can they be successful?

454
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,570
This question,
I'd been challenged year up to you

455
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,670
because everybody has no money.
That's the opportunity for entrepreneurs

456
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,700
sync.
Great.

457
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:29,380
If every business stopped from tiny
business,

458
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,870
we,

459
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,670
well we start Alibaba,
we try,

460
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,610
I go to a lot of,
I go to China Post.

461
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,910
Yeah.
I go to SOS say,

462
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,490
can you help us to deliver this are no,
no,

463
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:43,681
no,
no,

464
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,450
no.
You're too tiny to small.

465
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:50,510
We don't deliver.
So we went to the entrepreneurs who want

466
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:55,680
to deliver from their own village on
city owned properties.

467
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,120
So we're helping them

468
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,800
today.
We

469
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,230
65 million packages per day in China.
We delivered them.

470
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,100
How many people work here on that?
3 million people working on that.

471
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,640
We never do ourselves.
We do that a high 3 million.

472
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We help them get the jobs.
So let me tell you,

473
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,090
15 years ago,
Chinar logistic system was so bad trying

474
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,130
to post same speed like the Russia
today,

475
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,690
nobody believe it to work.
How can you work,

476
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,020
right?
China is also a big country.

477
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,750
The only thing is we have a bet more
population,

478
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,584
more people,

479
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,593
but

480
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,400
we think it's opportunity.
The developer countries,

481
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,200
the logistic cost of the economy is
today 12% of the GDP of the other cost

482
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,220
country and I can China under developed
countries developing countries,

483
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,370
they like six 16%
today because of the Internet we are

484
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,990
able to lower down to seven and 6% this
depends on you.

485
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,460
It's your opportunity.
If you want to do it,

486
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,110
it's young.
If,

487
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,570
if young people want to do it,
you will be.

488
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,480
There's a chance.
Don't talk to success.

489
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,830
This woe to convincing successful people
is the most difficult thing.

490
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,700
We are not successful.
You say I want to deliver this thing for

491
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,610
my city.
I don't think about the whole rusher

492
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,030
just in my city.
You will win if you say I want to build

493
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:14,850
up a whole logistic for whole rusher.
You don't have channels.

494
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:20,030
Nobody would give you money because
everybody working for same cities where

495
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:21,510
you connect,
it's going to be big.

496
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,860
This is my advice.
Rusher has chest.

497
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,390
You can learn a lot from Alibaba
experience sharpton.

498
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,903
Hm.

499
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,680
Right.
So we are our,

500
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,400
our packages delivered every day off our
company alone.

501
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,590
Big then whole us and package hold
country.

502
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,640
We made it happen in 10 years.
You also can make it happen,

503
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,730
right?
It's not about money.

504
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,260
When you do,
right,

505
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,020
where do proper,
if you do the right direction,

506
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,090
money will come.
If you,

507
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,360
a lot of people say,
if I have money,

508
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,870
I'm going to do this.
I say,

509
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:08,970
you will never have the money.
If you do this things delicate,

510
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,730
you really want to do it a made
progress.

511
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,910
Money will come.
This is the first question.

512
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,290
Second is have a monopsony.

513
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,980
Yeah,
rusher.

514
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,280
I saw Moscow very beautiful this time.
Much cleaner,

515
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,410
more traffic,
very sad,

516
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,820
but I've never been to a lot of other
cities.

517
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,550
I think Russia economy should be focused
on more private business.

518
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,910
Small Business.
Not sure.

519
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,150
We really rely on the oil.
Gasoline amage big s he stayed on the

520
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,810
business.
Big private company.

521
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,670
We should have more entrepreneurs.
Dynamic,

522
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,620
tiny,
small business and this is what we

523
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,890
think.
This is the future

524
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,840
business model of 21st century.
I think if we have more small business,

525
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,190
every small business can export thing.
Well,

526
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:17,420
by the way,
let me tell you,

527
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,360
people say,
oh,

528
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,840
Russian commerce and very developed
Russia.

529
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Ecommerce
today is a tiny infant baby less than a

530
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,420
baby.
Your ecommerce put together less than 1%

531
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:39,100
of the total Russia retail.
It's more like a 12 years ago.

532
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,930
China.
It's a huge opportunity,

533
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,240
but don't wait for the monopoly.
They would do it.

534
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,580
Don't wait for the SOE.
Don't wait for the logistic ready.

535
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,110
Don't wait for the back.
Ready.

536
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,670
You should do before they are ready.
If everything's already why they need to

537
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:01,810
you
is everybody.

538
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,330
Everything's already.
You have no chance because everything's

539
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,980
already you have the chance,
but get ready for the tough days.

540
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,543
Thank you.

541
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,350
Curly hair.
Oh,

542
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,710
of course.
Of course you will be next.

543
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Uh,
and uh,

544
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,450
yeah.
Thank you.

545
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,190
Yeah.
First let me tell you that the language

546
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,280
is very important
that you speak good English does not

547
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,530
mean you will do global business
knowledge or don't use.

548
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,850
He made a speech here,
right?

549
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,850
Maza dog does not speak,
uh,

550
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,720
English.
Nixon did not speak Chinese,

551
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,870
but this older two guy made a global
deal.

552
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,740
China,
us,

553
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,740
you're working together.
It's the vision.

554
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,360
It's the belief that you have that
change the world.

555
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,730
But let me tell you another thing.
Language is so important.

556
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,670
It helped me a lot because of artificial
intelligence.

557
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,860
In the future,
you don't,

558
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:09,260
people say,
I don't need to learn English or Russian

559
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:13,190
or Japanese or something.
A chip here can check later quickly.

560
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,120
No,
it's not about language.

561
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,340
It's about the culture where you learn
the other language.

562
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,820
You start understand the other culture.
You start to appreciate,

563
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,300
respect the other culture where you
appreciate respect the other culture.

564
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,680
You will be respected and appreciated by
the others.

565
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,950
Then you can work it out together.
I learned my English by myself when I

566
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:52,511
was child.
I never got to one day English training

567
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:58,091
class all side China,
but I think I understand the western

568
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:05,141
culture much more better than those
Chinese students study outside because

569
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,280
I'm not learning language and learning
culture

570
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,350
where you respect the other culture
where you appreciate the other culture.

571
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,880
It's easy to make friends if you don't
like the other culture.

572
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,600
You will never make friends if you don't
have friends,

573
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,840
how can you do business?
So I would say language helped me a lot,

574
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,510
but most thing helped me is my respect
for the different culture.

575
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,620
I wish I could speak Russian.
The more I come here,

576
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,230
the more I learn a lot.
I asked one of the Russian guy,

577
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,820
why no rushing through tough and Chinese
too gentle.

578
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,610
How can they mix together?
And he asked you a very good,

579
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,830
he said,
check this country is so code.

580
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:18,850
We have to be tough.
I the house is so good weather so we

581
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:22,790
don't have to be tough.
Yeah.

582
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,630
So
if you,

583
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,900
if you have to everything with a
translator,

584
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,750
no.
Cool.

585
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,790
Sometimes you have to write,
but if you can't understand a language

586
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,730
that can community,
it's easier for you to communicate.

587
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,380
Easy to understand and be understood.
Thank you.

588
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,490
I hope I answer your question.

589
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,773
So

590
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:58,550
let's ask this girl who turned one to
Tusk and then someone next.

591
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,993
Yup.

592
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,950
Please.
Please present yourself.

593
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,633
Yup.

594
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:18,030
Hello,
my name is [inaudible] Tech

595
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:18,920
Entrepreneur,
uh,

596
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:22,610
and then founder of hydro,
which is a unique nona cosmetics,

597
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,730
a brand for apparel and footwear is it
was developed here in Moscow State

598
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,890
University.
Uh,

599
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,910
so my question,
um,

600
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,140
Mr Ma,
before you created an Alibaba,

601
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,410
all the small businesses in China,
all the small manufacturers is they

602
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:44,541
didn't have access to the global market.
And right now we have a similar problem

603
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:48,930
in Russia,
but wasn't intellectual products,

604
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,690
not was manufactured goods,
not with commodities,

605
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,960
but with innovations,
with inventions.

606
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,030
Like look at this audience is this pool
of scientists and inventors and we have

607
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:02,520
many more,
we'll have millions of talented people

608
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:04,950
in Russia who are developing a high
quality,

609
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:09,900
creative and innovative technologists.
But our local market is too small.

610
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,760
It cannot digest and it's a huge waste
is,

611
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,770
and this such a shame that all of this,
um,

612
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,040
technologists are not serving to the
humanities.

613
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,250
So my question is,
what would you advise us to do in order

614
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:28,530
to give to Russian intellectual
products?

615
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,390
Uh,
access to the global markets.

616
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,790
All right,
thank you.

617
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,630
Sure.
Lot of people have a great technology

618
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,710
inventions,
but they cannot do a,

619
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,530
Russia is too small market and the
offside market,

620
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,220
there's no access.
So what's,

621
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,980
how can do it pops in though with the
others

622
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,710
popped into was a company like Alibaba.
Okay home.

623
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,850
So a lot of people,
if you are good that invention,

624
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,830
but you may not a good at the marketing.
If you're good at marketing,

625
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:11,831
normally you're not a good animation.
So people need to work it together.

626
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:18,470
If you have a great invasion or you
extremely strong and good at invention

627
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:24,421
and creative to college,
must've fine good business people to pop

628
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:28,370
in there
and finding good.

629
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,580
So like me,
I know little about technology

630
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,550
today.
I'm so happy we don't use PC.

631
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,870
The only thing I can use my pc and the
sen receive email and the brows,

632
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,500
I don't know how to use to.
I'm happy we all use a mobile phone.

633
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,470
I'm not a technology guy,
but I know if we,

634
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,640
if I want to,
if we want to realize our dream,

635
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,420
we must have the technology.
But if I don't know the technology,

636
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,780
we should invite the best engineers and
science I worked with them or listened

637
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,344
to them.

638
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:19,490
Nobody can do anything.
What you should do is always

639
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,600
form a team.
I think

640
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,870
it is very difficult to make exact
company like Alibaba.

641
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Again,
you can make a company better than

642
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:43,010
Alibaba,
but it would be difficult to make exact

643
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:46,040
business model.
Our model,

644
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I will not say be great,
but it's a very workable our model

645
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:56,450
because of 18 years,
especially for the first 10 years,

646
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,700
nobody believe it.
Everybody say Jack,

647
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:02,360
my stupid crazy too is something that
will never make money.

648
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,350
So the smart people,
rich people never be our competitors

649
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,190
that give us chance.
So

650
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,750
finding good partner,
find a good team

651
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,370
and always focus on the things that you
are good at.

652
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:32,090
Focus on the things that you love
and that is the record of partnership.

653
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,840
I see that.
I give you a device for those young

654
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:41,674
people.

655
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,030
If you

656
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,650
uh,
20 to 30 years old,

657
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,820
please find a good boss.
Not,

658
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:56,780
not necessarily good company.
Learn from the bus.

659
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,070
Learn how to do it while you have 30 to
40 years old.

660
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,730
Try to do something yourself if you
really want to try while you're 40 to 50

661
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:15,071
years old,
two things that you are good at after 20

662
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:19,730
years of learning is you should do
something or good at where you are.

663
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:24,731
50 to 60 years or so.
Spending time supporting young people

664
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,380
where you are.
Sixth over 60 are sold.

665
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,380
Spend time with your grandchildren.
Right.

666
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:41,030
Is normally a lot of people like that.
So where you are graduate,

667
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,330
why you just in the university don't
think about I want resigned from the

668
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:52,220
school and be under the Bill Gates
because Bill Gates left Harvard.

669
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,770
There's only one bill gates in the
world.

670
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,500
When you graduate find a company
most important.

671
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,670
Find a good boss.
They can see you,

672
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,060
discipline you and tell you what is good
and right is more important in a good

673
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:12,710
company.
Right.

674
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,080
Of course.
I'm good comment.

675
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:18,740
I go Boston even better
and then continue your life.

676
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,260
It's all about the partner.

677
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,500
Sure.
Thank you.

678
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,840
These guys one?
Yes.

679
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,560
You or your friend.
Okay.

680
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,990
Well yeah,
I'm not supposed to meet him across from

681
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,890
yes.
And it will be the last question.

682
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,200
Sorry.
I'm fortunate to be our time runs out.

683
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Okay.
Can you

684
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,050
repeat it?

685
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,220
Yup.
I'll just repeat the question.

686
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,270
So every week.
So um,

687
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,000
she said three weeks ago,
Alibaba launch team all in Russia and is

688
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:47,230
wondering what opportunities there are
for people in the room to contribute to

689
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:52,290
to Alibaba is team all team.
How will you and your team developed

690
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:00,120
team all here in Russia?

691
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,700
Okay.
Thank

692
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,700
you very much for this question.
I think Timo rusher is something that

693
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:18,531
Web testing
personally my wish is that she more

694
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:25,650
rusher k in spy.
As many people,

695
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:29,280
as many entrepreneurs as possible,
they can do the same thing.

696
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,250
We not necessarily want to make Timo
Russia big.

697
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,810
I hope you understand my seat cause we
don't want Ali Baba one day become the

698
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,000
largest e commerce company in Russia.
This is no,

699
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,250
this is my dream.
This is not our dream.

700
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,210
We won by work held Timo rusher.
Lot of no house,

701
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,180
lots of experience,
lots of things we'll learn from Russia

702
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:03,450
market.
Can you share with people so more young

703
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:07,020
people in Russia start to do things our
ecommerce,

704
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,930
that is something that really want to
do.

705
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,170
So we

706
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,870
sing that

707
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,240
Alibaba.
Aliexpress is something we want to do a

708
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:26,241
better job.
Odd Express today is helping Chinese

709
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:28,740
products.
Oh,

710
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:34,070
you're a or you ship product to Russia.
The peppers is what we want is help you

711
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:40,431
Russian products to the world.
This is what we want to do.

712
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:46,620
So we are very,
very happy that we are just her.

713
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,110
Before I came here,
I was,

714
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:53,250
I was having a lunch with our team in
Moscow.

715
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,110
We have about 100 colleagues here

716
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,660
and I sat

717
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:06,380
in 10 15 years,
we must have 5,000 people in Russia.

718
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,670
That means we need at least four foul
than 900 people.

719
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,650
These 5,000 people is not to the economy
because five people do ecommerce in

720
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:30,831
Russia does not a work.
5,000 people kiss support rusher,

721
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,760
sme to do ecommerce.
5,000 people can help logistic to

722
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:43,080
better.
5,000 people can help payment better.

723
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,710
5,000 people can helping the sme
promoting their products better.

724
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,170
So this is our thinking.
So many people keep on asking me,

725
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,360
Jack,
you know you are coming here to conquer

726
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:57,300
and the occupy a whole rusher.
You're not going to take our way.

727
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:58,470
A lot of our business,
no,

728
00:55:58,471 --> 00:55:58,741
no,
no.

729
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:03,741
This is not our purpose.
We're not Amazon Ali Baba.

730
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,900
No,

731
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,540
I mean we are better than Amazon.
We just have a different the business

732
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:19,980
model.
So we want to have him more talents from

733
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:24,981
Russia joining Ali Baba.
And we also have a lot of problems or

734
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,700
translation for Ali Express.
Right?

735
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,670
People say,
I have a funny translations,

736
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,860
which I'm sorry I don't understand,
but people say it's great we have a

737
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:40,120
unique language capability,
but I hope that

738
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,090
I ope

739
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,760
more and more young people in Russia
getting jobs because of ecommerce

740
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:56,330
infrastructure.
Finding jobs on the logistic but not

741
00:56:56,521 --> 00:57:01,521
logistic does not mean delivered.
Logistic is smart logistic based on

742
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,220
data,
technology and payment.

743
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,450
So this is something about how to
joining Ali Baba.

744
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,880
I'm very happy to hear that.
And uh,

745
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,480
we have a office here and uh,
maybe I should,

746
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:20,330
uh,
right to my eating.

747
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,210
Yeah.
Okay.

748
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:26,210
Of course I ride a bike.
I'm not my email that my contact email,

749
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,120
the guys I don't read email.

750
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,263
Yeah.

751
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,400
I think the world is getting so
complicated by reading emails.

752
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,200
You write a long email with time.
She grier iml and then everybody remail

753
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,450
the efficient to the mobile phone is
much more efficient.

754
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,020
So,
