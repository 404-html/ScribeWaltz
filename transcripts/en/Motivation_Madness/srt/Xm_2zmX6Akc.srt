1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,130
So the question is,
how do you differentiate the utility of

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,730
behavioral slash psychotherapeutic
treatments for conditions like

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,220
depression versus medical treatments?
Okay,

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:21,690
so the first thing I would say is don't
underestimate the utility of medical

5
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,230
interventions.
Depression is a cat,

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,850
a catastrophe.
It carries with it a very high suicide

7
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,851
rate and it also levels people out and
it's really hard on their families and

8
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,760
so and it and it's physiologically
extraordinarily damaging.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,530
And so if you're in a depressive state
and it's severe,

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,430
you can try an antidepressant.
You'll know in a month if it works,

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,800
if it works well,
maybe it'll help you get your life

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,760
together.
Like we could say,

13
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,550
well maybe you're depressed because your
life isn't very well together.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,400
Could be.
Sometimes people are depressed,

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,580
their life is just,
it isn't fine because no one's life is

16
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,500
fine.
Everyone's life is a tragedy,

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,280
but sometimes people have their lives in
order,

18
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,650
as much as you could expect anyone to
have.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,840
They have friends,
they have an intimate relationship,

20
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,760
they have a career that they like,
you know,

21
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,230
they're,
they're qualified,

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,320
industrious people working hard on what
they're doing.

23
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,060
And,
and,

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,700
and really playing a minimum number of
games with themselves and they're

25
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,630
terribly depressed,
antidepressant man that's sometimes that

26
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,000
will just fix it.
And so hooray,

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,930
you were biological entity.
If,

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,540
if there's something out there that can
help you strengthen yourself so that you

29
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,430
can prevail.
Great.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,780
And you know,
people,

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,120
you hear,
everyone takes antidepressants,

32
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,410
you know,
everyone's taking them.

33
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,010
It's like no one takes those bloody
things without serious consideration.

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,270
Half the time I spend with my clients
who are depressed is often the two years

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,860
long attempt to get them to tentatively
try an antidepressant because there are

36
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,580
so guilty that they're relying on an
external crutch to sort out their lives

37
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,870
that they can't even tolerate it.

38
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,401
But you know,
I say,

39
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,190
well look man,
what if you had diabetes?

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,390
You're not going to take your insulin.
It's like you got stressed.

41
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,910
He blew out at your weakest point.
That's what happens when you get

42
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,320
stressed.
If there's something out there that

43
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,590
might help you,
it's like try it for God's sake.

44
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,400
You'll know in a month and you'd just
stop if it doesn't work.

45
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,410
Now,
having said that,

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,080
you want to do a multidimensional
analysis,

47
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,681
it's like,
well,

48
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,830
do you have any friends?
Do you have an intimate relationship?

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,290
Are you pursuing one?
Do you have a reasonable career or you

50
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,380
as educated as you are intelligent?
Do you have something useful to do with

51
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,830
your time outside of work?
Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,370
Are there other behavioral issues like
sleep dysregulation and lack of eating

53
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:39,240
that are contributing to the pathology?
You want to differentiate all of that

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,630
and wherever you can make a behavioral
intervention so much the better,

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,360
but sometimes too,
you're dealing with people whose lives

56
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,520
are so racked that they don't even know
where to start.

57
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,850
They're different than the ones who have
everything in order to say and you say,

58
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,350
well,
try this man.

59
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,320
Maybe you won't cut your throat in the
next month because if your dad,

60
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,050
it's going to be hard to work with you,
and so,

61
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,290
so medical interventions,
anything.

62
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,220
If you're sick,
you do what it's necessary to get better

63
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,320
and you leave your pride behind.
If you.

64
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,790
If you have to,
and that says nothing about the utility

65
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,610
of the behavioral interventions,
you want to hit the problem with

66
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,611
everything you have at your disposal,
but some antidepressants especially

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,030
especially for people whose lives are
together and who are depressed,

68
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,280
antidepressants can be absolutely
miraculous.

69
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,740
So you know when you hear about the
clinical evidence in their favor being

70
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,720
iffy,
and that's partly because the diagnosis

71
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,580
of depression isn't very well
formulated.

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,140
It's very different to have a terrible
life than to be depressed and

73
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,230
antidepressants can only help you so
much if you have a terrible life.

74
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,053
So

75
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,063
yeah,

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,210
you want to stay inside this little map
because it's working.

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,240
You want to get from point a to point a
to point b and this is good.

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,670
This indicates that you are moving
forward.

79
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,540
That's the first thing it indicates and
the second thing it indicates,

80
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,060
which is even more important,
and you'll never hear this from

81
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,030
behavioral psychologists,
is that your map is correct.

82
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,600
So every time you move a little bit
forward and something that you want

83
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,411
happens,
it says,

84
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:14,690
oh,
the game I'm playing is the right gate.

85
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,580
And so not only does the reward indicate
progress,

86
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,300
it indicates that the frame within which
progress is being calculated is the

87
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:26,210
right frame,
and that's good because it's the frame

88
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:30,080
that makes things irrelevant and you
want them to stay irrelevant.

89
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,190
So if you don't move forward and you
start to question the frame that's way

90
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,140
worse than merely not moving forward.

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
You get a bad exam grade,
what do you think?

92
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,280
What the hell am I doing in university
anyways?

93
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,940
It's like probably that's not the first
place you should go with that piece of

94
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,320
information.
And you think,

95
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:45,890
well,
why?

96
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,230
Why is that worse?
Well,

97
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,060
as far as I can tell,
your map of view as university student

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,480
is a comprehensive representation.
It tells you what you should do every

99
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:58,100
day.
It kind of tells you where you're going

100
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,370
in the future.
And if something emerges as an anomaly,

101
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,120
you get worse grade than you expected
and you blow that whole map.

102
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,050
It's like,
okay,

103
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,790
what have you been doing for the last
four years?

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,680
What kind of high school student were
you?

105
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,350
How clueless are you about how you're
arranging your future?

106
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,900
What's your identity going to be if
you're not going to be a student,

107
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,850
where are you going to end up in five
years?

108
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,820
It's like,
so it's like a that little grade,

109
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,480
that bad grade is like a portal through
which snakes can crawl and that's

110
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:26,450
exactly how you respond to it.
Especially if you open the door too

111
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,141
much.
Well,

112
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:29,660
maybe this means that I shouldn't be in
university.

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,380
Well,
one of the rules is don't you want to.

114
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,090
You want to constrain the anomalous
event to the minimal necessary domain.

115
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,100
It's really,
really important.

116
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,290
You want to do that when you're arguing
with your partner,

117
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,780
which will do all the time.
We have an argument,

118
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,730
well,
I should never have married you.

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,251
It's like,
no,

120
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,830
no,
that's not the first response.

121
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,350
That's a bad response,
or here's a really good one.

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,080
You've always done that sort of thing
and you always will.

123
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,310
It's like,
oh good,

124
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,200
great.
It's like the only answer to that is to

125
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,390
hit someone because like you're done,
right?

126
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,490
Your your life,
that you've always been like that.

127
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,460
There isn't a chance that you can be
repaired and none of it is acceptable.

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,460
It's like the person's gonna fight with
you right away because what else are

129
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,950
they going to do?
So what you want to do is you want to

130
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,530
minimize.
It isn't rationalization.

131
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,251
You want to say,
okay,

132
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,980
this person did something that disrupted
our joint map.

133
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,340
Okay,
what's the smallest possible thing they

134
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,920
could do to put it back together?
And you have to know,

135
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,250
well,
we need to make a plan so you don't do

136
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,620
it again.
Or we need to have a discussion so that

137
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,480
you know that it wasn't a good thing to
do,

138
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,670
but I'm not going to go after your whole
character.

139
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,380
I'm going to say when I come home
and you're watching TV,

140
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,510
just come to the door and say hello,
not,

141
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,410
don't you love me?

142
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,670
Or something like that.
It's like,

143
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:46,971
no,
no,

144
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,460
you just have to walk to the door and
like give me a hug or something,

145
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:53,090
and then that's good enough,
and so then the other person might be

146
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,670
able to tolerate that much corrective
information.

147
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,240
Maybe if you're kind of Nice about it
and you also understand that they're

148
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:03,260
probably going to have something equally
horrible to say about you in the next 15

149
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,820
minutes because you're going to do
something stupid so so you don't wanna

150
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,660
you don't want to open the door so that
every possible snake comes crawling

151
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,380
through because that's a pathway to
depression and you actually see that

152
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:20,381
happening in depressed people is that
every small event produces a cascade

153
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,780
through their entire value system and
they end up saying,

154
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,220
well,
that's just another reason that I should

155
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,710
jump off a bridge and they really see it
that way.

156
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,770
It's really awful because they've got no
defenses.

157
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,604
It's like,
well,

158
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,020
I didn't do so well in this course.
It's like I'm going to get a bad mark

159
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,320
and they or an exam,
I'm going to get bad mark in the course

160
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,630
that's going to screw up my ability to
finish my degree.

161
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,060
I'm never going to get into the field of
my choice.

162
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,540
It's just another piece of indication
that I'm useless and that life isn't

163
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,560
worthwhile.
Bang,

164
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm going to jump off a bridge and if
you're really depressed,

165
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,800
it's like each of those things hits you
with the certainty of truth.

166
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,040
It's really not good and so you want to
be careful.

167
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,460
You want to be careful about walking
down that pathway when you make a

168
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:02,151
mistake,
you think,

169
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:05,150
okay,
what's the narrowest framework of

170
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,750
interpretation within which I can.
I can understand this.

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,520
That will require minimal behavioral
change to decrease the probability that

172
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,360
it will happen.
Again,

173
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,230
it's mental hygiene fundamentally.
Yes.

174
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,090
Yeah.
We'll get to that.

175
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,070
We'll get to that.
That is the next question.

176
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,440
It's because they don't exist in
isolation,

177
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,350
so and that's another thing.
Frequently when when you,

178
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,740
when you hear behavioral accounts of
cognitive processes,

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,630
they generally only focus on it as if
it's an isolated thing.

180
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,760
It's not.
It is.

181
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,750
It's scalable,
it's scalable.

182
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:46,190
A bunch of ways it scalable temporarily
because what you do now is associated

183
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,890
with what you'll do tomorrow and that
with what you'll do next week and so

184
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:52,070
forth.
So it has to be scalable temporarily and

185
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,650
it's also scalable socially.
Right,

186
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,410
so it has an effect on you that has an
effect on your family that has an effect

187
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:03,210
on the community and so forth,
and so you don't want to take.

188
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,710
It's very difficult to think through the
effect of your auction and all those

189
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,350
scaling level simultaneously,
but,

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,000
but you have mechanisms that allow you
to do that and we'll see.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,020
I think that the sense of let's assume
that you're not lying to yourself

192
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,560
constantly so your head isn't full of
chaos and garbage and you have

193
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,050
reasonable relationships with people in
the world.

194
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,000
I think that this is leaping way ahead.
I think that your sense of meaningful

195
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:34,440
engagement with what you're doing is the
psychophysiological marker,

196
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,400
that you're acting in a way that takes
all of the stacked representations into

197
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,950
account simultaneously because you're,
you're,

198
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,400
you're,
you're like,

199
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,390
you're trying to figure out where you
are and you might think,

200
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,040
well,
that means where I am in this room,

201
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,910
but look,
this room is not a simple thing,

202
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,250
right?
It's nested.

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,560
It's,
it's a subset of the university that's a

204
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,930
subset of society.
It's a subset of your life.

205
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,680
The room is a complicated thing and you
need to figure out where you should be

206
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:05,460
in the room and you can't do that shit
surely with perception because all you

207
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,830
see is me and some of the wall,
right?

208
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,830
It's you got this little narrow,
this little narrow portal and so you

209
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,190
can't really rely on your perceptions to
Orient you,

210
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,730
but you do Orient Yourself and I think
what you do is you.

211
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,960
It's engagement.
It's like does this seem meaningful and

212
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,760
deep and engaging?
Yes.

213
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,960
Then it's an indication that it's
serving multiple masters,

214
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:35,160
similar caneously,
so both maybe both socially and also

215
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,520
temporarily.
And so I think the sense of meaning is

216
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,450
actually an instinct that orients people
in time and space.

217
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,750
It's not an EPA phenomena.
It's the most fundamental form of

218
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:49,170
perception and that's the only
optimistic thought that I've ever been

219
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:53,190
able to derive from psychology is that
that actually could be true.

220
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:58,191
It could be that the sense of meaning is
an orienting reflex and that would be

221
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,900
wonderful if it was true because it
would make it real,

222
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,940
you know,
and it's one of the,

223
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,480
you know,
the one of the devastating elements of

224
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,890
nihilism is something like,
well,

225
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,830
who the hell cares what you're doing,
what differences are going to make in a

226
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:10,830
million years?

227
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,840
It's like your sense of meaning is just
an illusion.

228
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:13,980
You know,
you're,

229
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,030
you're limited creature in a limited
place and nothing you do really matters.

230
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,840
It's like that's a powerful argument,
especially if you're an objective

231
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:24,510
materialist in a reductionist.
It's a killer argument,

232
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,430
but it looks to me like it's wrong.
It's actually wrong because meaning

233
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:31,290
looks to me like it's an actual
phenomenon.

234
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,310
It does say that you're,
you're positioned properly between chaos

235
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,600
and order.
Something like that.

236
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,380
It's a real so.
Well.

237
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:44,160
So we'll see.
We're going to develop that argument

238
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,070
because if,
if it's real,

239
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,560
you want to know that because it gives
you something to stand on.

240
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,600
You know,
maybe it's as real as pain,

241
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,270
but it's not.
It's something positive and you need

242
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,970
something positive that you can rely on.
All right,

243
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,000
so and psychoanalyst,
I think,

244
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,210
err too much on the side of the subject.

245
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,390
They tend to think that too much of you
is inside of you and too little of you

246
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:13,391
is outside of you and part of the reason
I believe that is because of my clinical

247
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,090
experience.
I love the psychoanalyst man.

248
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,870
They're brilliant.
They're brilliant or deep.

249
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,940
They grapple with real problems like
with the problems.

250
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,120
When people have real problems and I
mean profound problems.

251
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,330
They're really profound.
Moral problems or problems of good and

252
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:35,440
evil really know there are things going
on in their family that are so terrible

253
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:39,910
that well that there are.
There are some times fatal,

254
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,380
you know,
lie upon,

255
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:45,580
lie upon,
lie upon lie for decades and decades and

256
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,020
decades.
It's awful

257
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,310
and that's not exactly inside them.
It's out there in the world and lots of

258
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:04,820
the people that I see,
very famous critic of psychology,

259
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,040
I can't remember his name,
but I probably will

260
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,680
criticized the practice of psychology
quite effectively in the believe in the

261
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,510
early sixties.
The Myth of mental illness by Thomas

262
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,990
says zed,
a s zed,

263
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,120
it's classic.
You should read it if you're interested

264
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:28,000
in psychology,
read it like it's a classic,

265
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,140
and he basically said most people have
problems in living.

266
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,500
They don't have psychological problem,

267
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,220
and so I've experienced despite my love
for the psychoanalysts,

268
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,770
very frequently what I'm doing as a
therapist is helping people have a life

269
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,990
that would work.
You know,

270
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:50,260
and you can parameterize that.
It's like,

271
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,770
what do you need?
How about some friends that people kind

272
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,950
of like that.
How about an intimate relationship with

273
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,320
someone that you can trust that maybe
has a future.

274
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,290
That'd be good.
How about a career that puts you in a

275
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,670
dominance hierarchy somewhere so at
least you've got some possibility of

276
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,310
rising,
some possibility of stabilizing yourself

277
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,350
and our schedule and a routine because
no one can live without a routine.

278
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,290
You just forget that if you guys don't
have a routine,

279
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,810
I would recommend like you get one going
because you cannot be mentally healthy

280
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,660
without a routine.
You need to pick a time to get up

281
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,350
whatever time you want,
but pick one and stick to it because

282
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:34,351
otherwise you disregulate your circadian
rhythms and they regulate your mood and

283
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,580
eat something.

284
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,550
In the morning.
I had lots of clients who have that

285
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:42,430
anxiety disorders,
hired one client who was literally

286
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,920
starving,
very smart girl.

287
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,540
She was very little that she liked.
She kind of tried to subsist on like

288
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,070
half a cup of rice a day.
She came to me and said,

289
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,090
I have no energy.
I come home.

290
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,730
All I want to do is watch the same movie
over and over.

291
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,564
What?
Like,

292
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,820
is that weird?
And I thought,

293
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,260
well,
it depends on the art work.

294
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,120
You know,
it's a little weird,

295
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:05,600
but whatever it's familiar,
you're looking for comfort.

296
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,810
So I did an analysis of her diet.
It's like three quarters of a cup of

297
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,800
rice.
It's like you're starving,

298
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,200
eat something,
you know,

299
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,150
you'll feel better.
So she modified her diet and you're all

300
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:24,490
are anxiety went away and she had some
energy.

301
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,720
It's like,
yeah,

302
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,630
you got to eat.
So schedule.

303
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,550
That's a good thing man.
Your brain will.

304
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,340
Thank you for it.
It will stabilize your nervous system

305
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,740
when it's a bit of a plan.
That's a good thing.

306
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,040
You need a career.
You need something productive to do with

307
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,760
your time.
You need to regulate your use of drugs

308
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:49,090
and alcohol.
Most particularly alcoholic is that does

309
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,740
eating a lot of people,
um,

310
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,480
any your family,
like the family,

311
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:57,310
you have,
your parents and all that,

312
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,800
it'd be nice if you all got along.
You could work on that.

313
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,450
That's a good thing to work on.
And then,

314
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:03,100
you know,
you probably need children at some

315
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:04,060
point.
That's life.

316
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,890
That's what life is.
And if you're missing,

317
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,010
you know,
you may have a good reason to not be

318
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:16,120
operating on one of those dimensions.
It's not mandatory,

319
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,070
but I can tell you that if you're not
operating reasonably well on four,

320
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,740
I think I mentioned six,
if you're not operating reasonably well

321
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:28,000
on at least three of them,
there's no way you're going to be

322
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,870
psychologically thriving.
And that's more pragmatic in some sense

323
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:35,450
than psychological,
right?

324
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,180
Human beings have a nature.
There's things we need and if we have

325
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,200
them,
well that's good.

326
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,960
And if we don't have them,
well then we feel the lack.

327
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,250
So behaviorists,
behavioral psychologists concentrate a

328
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,570
lot more on that sort of thing.
No,

329
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,320
it's practical.
It's like strategizing.

330
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,290
Make a career plan,
figure out how to negotiate because

331
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,720
that's bloody important.
Figuring out how to say what you need,

332
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,460
figure out how to tell the truth.
He figured out how to listen to your

333
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:08,920
partner in particular because if you
listen to them,

334
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,970
they will actually tell you what they
want and sometimes you can give it to

335
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:16,900
them and maybe they'll return the favor.
And if you practice that for like 15

336
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:20,020
years,
well then maybe you're constantly giving

337
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,090
each other what you want.
Well Hooray.

338
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,120
That would be good.
And then there's two of you under all

339
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:31,121
circumstances and it's better to have
two brains than one because people think

340
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,970
differently because of their temperament
mostly.

341
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,420
And so the negotiation is where the
wisdom arises and it's part of the

342
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,970
transformation,
the psychological transformation that's

343
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:47,380
attendant on an intimate relationship
and one of the fundamental purposes of a

344
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
longterm intimate relationship.

345
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,940
So we're starting to be able to put the
traits to sort of nail the traits down

346
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,000
to their underlying biology with regards
to neuroticism.

347
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
Well,
if you're high in neuroticism,

348
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:04,230
you're more sensitive to anxiety and
that's regulated at least in part by the

349
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:07,560
hippocampus and and generated in part by
the Amygdala.

350
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,160
There's another part of the brain called
the [inaudible] aqueduct will gray.

351
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,990
That seems to be associated with the
experience of pain and pain is quite a

352
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,390
complex phenomena.
Depression is pain.

353
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:22,230
Like grief is pain,
like social isolation is pain.

354
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:26,370
Like disappointment is pain.
Like there's anxiety components to that

355
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,830
too.
And so neuroticism seems to be something

356
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:33,000
like threshold for activation in those
negative emotions systems.

357
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,130
So if you're higher in neuroticism,
one unit of uncertainty might produce,

358
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,520
let's say three units of
psychophysiological response.

359
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,090
Whereas if you're lower in neuroticism,
one unit of uncertainty might produce

360
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,310
one unit of psychophysiological
response.

361
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,710
It's hard,
obviously that's a simplified schematic,

362
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,230
but there's variability because if
something unexpected or threatening

363
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:58,260
happens to you,
it isn't obvious how upset you should

364
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,290
get one answer,
what might be a brush it off?

365
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,900
It's nothing.
Now their answer might be it's a bloody

366
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,830
catastrophe and often when something
uncertain or threatening occurs,

367
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,970
you don't have enough information at
your disposal to make a full

368
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,490
determination of the potential impact of
this,

369
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,090
of the circumstance,
especially if it's uncertain and so then

370
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:22,170
you have to guess at how upset you
should be and where you are on the

371
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,870
normal distribution with regards to
trait neuroticism.

372
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:29,490
Say that sort of determines what your
guests on average is going to be.

373
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,870
So you know the other with
conscientiousness say it might say,

374
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,090
well,
how hard should you work?

375
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,850
Well,
that's a really difficult question.

376
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:42,840
If you're going to die tomorrow and then
you probably shouldn't work very hard

377
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,680
today at all.

378
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,160
So one thing you might say is that the
degree to which you should work hard is

379
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,320
dependent on your assumptions about the
stability of the future.

380
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,410
We actually know this to be true because
if you put people in wildly uncertain

381
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,540
circumstances,
they discount the future,

382
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,340
which is exactly what you should do,
right?

383
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:07,341
It's only makes sense to store up goods
for future consumption if the future is

384
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,740
likely to be very similar to the past
and the present.

385
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,420
You need a stable society for that and
conscientiousness only works in in a

386
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,910
stable society because all you do
otherwise,

387
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:20,820
if you're piling up goods,
which is Kinda what conscientious people

388
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,890
do,
is leaving them there for the criminals

389
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:26,970
to take or waiting for the next chaotic
upheaval to wipe out everything that

390
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:30,750
you've stored and so even
conscientiousness is a kind of guess,

391
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,430
hardworking people say,
well,

392
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,000
you know,
a sacrifice the present for the future.

393
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,730
That's great as long as the future is
going to be there and you can predict

394
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,350
it,
but if it's not going to be there and

395
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:43,620
it's unpredictable,
then the right response is take what you

396
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:46,050
can take right now while the getting's
good.

397
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,880
Now you know,
obviously there are troubles with that

398
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,181
too.
It,

399
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,070
I'm speaking,
you know I'm,

400
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm offering rough rules of thumb,
but I'm trying to provide you with some

401
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:00,520
indication of how and why these
difference in value structures exist

402
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,190
because they're are applicable in
different environments.

403
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,830
You know,
sometimes in a dangerous social

404
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,570
environment,
it's not obvious that being an

405
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:11,110
extroverted person is a good idea
because extroverted people,

406
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,600
they stand out,
especially if they're extroverted and

407
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,830
creative,
right?

408
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:18,190
Because not only are they noisy and
dominant and assertive,

409
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,690
they're also colorful and flamboyant and
provocative,

410
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,170
but happens to people is that as they
move towards zero,

411
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,500
positive feedback loops get set up so
they're more likely to hit zero,

412
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,010
and as they move away from zero positive
feedback loops get set up so that

413
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:35,680
they're increasingly more likely to move
away from zero.

414
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,830
So here's an example.
Let's say a,

415
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,200
you're not doing too bad,
so maybe you're in the middle of the

416
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,250
normal distribution,
then you lose your job.

417
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,300
Okay?
And so let's say you're a conscientious

418
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:49,480
person and we could say just for the
sake of argument,

419
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,940
that you lose your job because of mass
layoffs in your company.

420
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,400
So it has nothing to do with you.
It's fundamentally,

421
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,200
it's just like luck of the draw
basically.

422
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,150
But then what happens to you?
Well,

423
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,030
if you're conscientious,
you're gonna,

424
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,830
you're gonna.
Go after yourself pretty hard.

425
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,860
So you're going to add,
especially if you're also high in

426
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,870
neuroticism,
it's going to depress you to lose your

427
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,610
job,
and maybe you're in a situation where

428
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,400
you just for one reason or another,
you don't have that many other

429
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,350
opportunities.
Now maybe you should look for them,

430
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:18,520
but maybe you're in a depressed strata
of the economy or you're geographically

431
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:21,550
located somewhere that makes moving
difficult or so on and so forth.

432
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,361
You know,
so,

433
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:26,290
but you lose a job and then you start to
get depressed because of that.

434
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,700
Well then as you start to get depressed,
you know it decreases the probability

435
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:34,000
that you're going to look for a job,
but it also maybe starts to put stress

436
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:37,610
on your family and it also starts to
decrease the probability that you're in

437
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,650
gonna.
Engage in positive social interaction.

438
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:43,540
So now not only are you unemployed and
suffering from economic stress,

439
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,320
but your marriage is starting to suffer
and you're starting to isolate yourself

440
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,520
from your friends.
And then of course,

441
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,590
as your marriage suffers in the stress
builds up,

442
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,360
then that's gonna.
Make you more depressed.

443
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,640
And that's going to keep you even
farther away from your friends and

444
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,250
that's going to decrease the likelihood
that you're going to have enough

445
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,040
positive emotion and enthusiasm to look
for another job.

446
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,320
And then you know,
maybe you want to add a bit of a

447
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:05,230
drinking problem too,
that just for fun and you can see that

448
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,170
you can get a spiral going that's just
taken you down.

449
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,810
Right?
And there's all sorts of things because

450
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,290
lots of times people conceptualize,
let's say,

451
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,840
you know,
you're unemployed guide,

452
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,900
you go to counseling and you get a
diagnosis of depression.

453
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:23,200
And the thing about a diagnosis of
depression,

454
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,020
it's sort of like the assumption is
there's something gone wrong with your

455
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:29,110
psychological structure.
It's like if you're unemployed and

456
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,190
you're,
you're depressed,

457
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,680
it isn't obvious at all that the problem
is in your head,

458
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,060
you know,
you know what I mean?

459
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,710
It's,
it doesn't.

460
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,240
If it isn't even obvious that it's a
psychological problem,

461
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,570
it's just a problem and problems can
take you out.

462
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,440
And so you know,
if you're unemployed and you're under

463
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,040
economic stress,
your marriage is starting

464
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,090
to shake and you're isolating yourself
from your friends and you're less likely

465
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:53,540
to be motivated to go look for a job.
You can sort of think about that as a

466
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,880
depressive spiral,
but you can also think of it as a

467
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,881
conspiracy in some sense of external
forces that are arguing you into the

468
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,910
ground and we don't tend to
conceptualize psychological disorders

469
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,790
that way,
but we should because lots of times when

470
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:11,450
people are suffering from something that
you could describe in psychological

471
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,540
terminology and depression is a very
good example of that.

472
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,760
It isn't obvious that there's something
wrong with them.

473
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:20,660
Psychologically.
Often they are in trouble and there

474
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,661
isn't a category in psychological
diagnosis for client in serious trouble.

475
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,170
But my experience has been almost
without exception,

476
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,220
that the people that come to see me come
to cv because something's gone wrong

477
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,110
with their life,
not because they have a psychological

478
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:36,410
problem.

479
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,340
Now you could say,
well,

480
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,630
there are psychological inadequacies
such as they might be,

481
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:45,230
are interfering with their ability to
recover or maybe even served as

482
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:47,030
precursors to,
you know,

483
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,070
increase the probability of the
catastrophe.

484
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,480
And so a well functioning personality
has all the micro routines in place.

485
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,630
That's actually something that you help
people with if you're a behavioral

486
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,440
therapist because one of the things you
assume if you're a behavioral therapist

487
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:04,010
is that sometimes the reason people
aren't doing things is because they

488
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:05,780
don't know how.
You know,

489
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:09,110
sometimes maybe the person is depressed
but potentially high functioning.

490
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,290
They got all the damn micro routines.
They're well socialized,

491
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,810
they're just dormant.
You got to get them awake again and

492
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,560
implementing them.
But sometimes you get someone in your

493
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,350
practice say who's just been neglected,
like you cannot believe,

494
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,360
right?
The parents never paid any attention to

495
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:26,000
them or maybe just punish them every
time they did something good.

496
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,010
That's really fun.
And then,

497
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,660
you know,
they didn't make friends and so they're

498
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,530
really,
really

499
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,540
vague and,
and,

500
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,620
and poorly articulated.
And so then what you do is you work at

501
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:40,760
the bottom of the micro routines and get
them to practice building up all these

502
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,430
little attributes that they didn't build
up and you know,

503
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:47,000
one of the things you can think about in
terms of character development is so now

504
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,220
maybe understand something about your
own personality.

505
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:49,821
You might say,
well,

506
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,680
what could you do to improve your
personality?

507
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,270
And the answer is develop some of the
micro routines on the other side of the

508
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:59,600
personality distribution.
So if you're disagreeable as hell,

509
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,230
maybe you could start learning how to do
nice things for people and without

510
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:05,660
actually works by the way.
So if you take disagreeable people who

511
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,240
are depressed and you get them doing
nice things for other people,

512
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,470
their depression tends to lift.

513
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,750
But then by the same token,
if you're agreeable,

514
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,280
then you should practice doing some
things for yourself and being more tough

515
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:19,850
minded in your negotiations.
So you can sort of place yourself on

516
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:21,140
the,
on the personality trait,

517
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,420
distribution.
You know you're extrovert.

518
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,380
It's like,
okay man,

519
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,350
learn to spend some time with yourself.
Right?

520
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,850
You're low in openness.
Well,

521
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,740
try reading a book that's outside of
your,

522
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,510
you know,
your,

523
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,560
your sphere of interest now in that,
um,

524
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,740
if you're conscientious,
well you should probably learn how to

525
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,720
relax occasionally and so forth.
So you can,

526
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,710
I think partly what you're doing as
you're developing your personality is

527
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,970
not moving the mean much,
the average where you know,

528
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,570
where you're located,
but you're extending the standard

529
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,930
deviation so that you're a bigger bag of
tricks than you were before.

530
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,660
And I think you can practice that
consciously.

531
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,340
It's like you're hyper orderly.

532
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,230
It's,
well get a dog,

533
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,090
you know,
dogs are messy,

534
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,140
horrible things,
you know,

535
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,480
it's just what you need if you're hyper
orderly because they're going to leave

536
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,340
hair everywhere and force you to live
with it.

537
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,480
And so,
okay,

538
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,700
so and so this is sort of,
you right?

539
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:12,470
This is your personality.
It's this connect collection of routine

540
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,970
sub routines that you've turned into a
hierarchy.

541
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,830
And then there's something at the top of
it.

542
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
And that's,
that's a big question.

543
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,280
Like what the hell should be at the top
of the hierarchy?

544
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,350
Because that's the ultimate question of
unity.

545
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,390
And the clinicians would say,
well,

546
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:27,480
it's the self actualized person,
or it's the self or something like that,

547
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,380
you know,
that's,

548
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,410
that's the,
that's the implicit and perhaps explicit

549
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:34,320
ideal that you're aiming for.
And you might say,

550
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,110
well it does such thing exists that I
would say,

551
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,030
well,
do you admire people?

552
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,770
Because that's your answer,
right?

553
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,030
Do you despise people while you like
some people and you don't like others?

554
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,090
You respect some people,
you don't respect others while you're

555
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,390
acting out the notion that there's at
least an implicit ideal,

556
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,250
you do the same thing when you go to
movies,

557
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:56,130
you know you know who the hero is,
you know who the bad guy is.

558
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,730
You're acting out the proposition that
there's some sort of value hierarchy and

559
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:03,210
there's some sort of manifestation of it
that's coherent across time.

560
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,990
So you appear to believe that and you
know you are driven at least to some

561
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:11,880
degree by your own inner ideals.
And so you tend to answer the question,

562
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,780
is that real with an affirmative?
And if you don't,

563
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,840
there's catastrophic consequences.
Nietzsche and the existentialists were

564
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,230
very good at detailing.
That's like,

565
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,950
let your value hierarchy disintegrate.
Well then what?

566
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,160
Well,
part of it is nihilistic chaos,

567
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,670
who that's not so much fun,
and then there's the alignment of

568
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,480
nihilistic chaos with the intrinsic
desire that someone will come along and

569
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:35,250
tell you what to do.
Right?

570
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,410
So what happens is if you let this
devolve,

571
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,220
you end up with nihilistic exit,
not with nihilistic chaos or the demand

572
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,230
for,
for the tyrant to come forward.

573
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,380
And we've had that happen lots of times
and it doesn't seem to have gotten that

574
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,760
well.
So.

575
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,901
Alright,
well,

576
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:55,140
so what happens when you,
you lay out these little routines in the

577
00:28:55,141 --> 00:29:00,060
world at different levels of analysis.
Well this is how your emotions function

578
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,800
broadly speaking,
what you're aiming at something and that

579
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,890
this is an oversimplification,
which is why I want to show you this

580
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,870
right?
When I show you this.

581
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,460
Assume that it's made out of that,
right?

582
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,990
It's just a schematic,
oversimplification because even if let's

583
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,620
say that I'm trying to do something as
simple as walking towards the door,

584
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,930
I mean that the action of walking
towards the door is predicated on the

585
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:32,931
existence of all the sub routines that
enabled me to propel my body across time

586
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:37,530
and space and like there's.
That took a lot of internal organization

587
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,860
to get that right.
It's a traumatized now and so you can

588
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,560
treat it like it's invisible,
but implicit in any one of these

589
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:48,670
structures is this entire structure and
you actually see this in therapy very

590
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:50,400
frequently to get.

591
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,200
One of the things that I've figured out
over the last years is this is a good

592
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,250
proposition,
so no,

593
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,950
it's pretty self evident that life is
has got its rat's nest of miseries and

594
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:03,160
that's for sure and maybe you could even
make a categorical statement that life

595
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,580
is mostly a rat's nest of misery.
You know,

596
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,690
when you could make a pretty powerful
argument for that,

597
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,510
but then there's a counter question
which is,

598
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,070
well,
what if you tried not to make it any

599
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,620
more miserable than it had to be?
Right?

600
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,520
Then what then what would it be like,
and my suspicions are,

601
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:22,300
is that Laura had misery.
I would suspect that most of that misery

602
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:25,510
would go away because it's the
unnecessary misery that really brings

603
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:26,201
you down.
You know?

604
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,220
It's like,
well,

605
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,510
if someone has cancer,
it's like,

606
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:31,240
that sucks,
but it's not like.

607
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,610
It's not like you can say,
if only we had done this differently,

608
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,140
then that wouldn't have happened.

609
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,590
But when someone's out like torturing
you in a malevolent way,

610
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,780
or maybe you're doing the same,
you can always ask yourself,

611
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:44,570
well,
it's really,

612
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,640
is this really necessary?
Is this just like a useless add onto the

613
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,980
miseries of life?
That's what disheartens people,

614
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,990
and so even in your own life,
if,

615
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,560
if you,
if,

616
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,620
if you aren't suffering from self
imposed misery and you're only suffering

617
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:03,340
from an escapable misery,
maybe you could handle that and who you

618
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,930
could.
You could survive.

619
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:09,670
You could bear it and even maybe without
becoming irredeemably corrupt.

620
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,440
So the goal would be,
well yeah,

621
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:15,010
life is a rat's nest of miseries and
maybe it has no ultimate meaning.

622
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:18,100
We could say that if we're feeling
particularly pessimistic,

623
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,580
but it still leaves one question open,
which is if you didn't do everything you

624
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:25,330
could to make it worse,
how good could you make it be?

625
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,480
And the least answer is,
well,

626
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,310
it could be tragedy,
but maybe not hell,

627
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,150
and I think that's right.
I really believe that that's the most

628
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:38,380
pessimistic proper statement.
The worst case outcome in the worst of

629
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:41,800
all possible worlds is that your life
could be tragic but not hell,

630
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,380
and that's blood better than hell,
right?

631
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,243
It's,
it's.

632
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,350
And you think I could give you an
example of the difference.

633
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,510
You're at your mother's death bed.
Well,

634
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:52,270
that's tragedy.
Here's another scenario.

635
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,550
You're out of your mother's death bed
and all you,

636
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:57,010
you and all your idiot siblings are
arguing.

637
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,650
Well,
that's the difference between tragedy

638
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,890
and hell and you might be able to
tolerate the first circumstance and

639
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:05,590
maybe it would even bring you closer
together with your family members.

640
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,410
The second one,
no one can bear that.

641
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,570
You walk away from a situation like
that.

642
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,210
Sick of yourself and sick of everything
else too.

643
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,340
And you know,
it's often the case that tragic

644
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:20,341
circumstances bring out the dragons
because the stress is high and all those

645
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:25,240
things that people haven't dealt with,
they don't have the energy to repress

646
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,250
and,
and all the bitterness comes pouring

647
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,570
forward.
So like,

648
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,670
seriously man,
it is.

649
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:32,950
So that's actually a good.
It's a rough lesson,

650
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,470
but it's a good hallmark for figuring
out whether or not you're.

651
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,130
You've got yourself adjusted properly
and in relationship to your siblings.

652
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:42,890
It's like if you all gathered around the
bed,

653
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:46,220
if someone close who was dying,
could you manage it?

654
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,560
And if the answer is no,
it's like,

655
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,310
well put your life together because it's
going to happen and you should be the

656
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:55,190
person who's there that can do it and do
it properly.

657
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,180
And then maybe you'd find that it isn't
the sort of thing that will undermine

658
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,680
your faith in life itself.

659
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,650
And I've seen,
I've seen both of those situations,

660
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,580
you know,
ugly,

661
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,320
ugly,
ugly situations,

662
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,860
murderously,
ugly situations.

663
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:13,610
And then they're opposite where people
have had terrible things happen to

664
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,410
happen to them as a family.
And you know,

665
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:19,550
they pulled together and
they rebuild their damn ship and they

666
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:23,120
sail away.
So that seems to me to be a lot better.

667
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,940
That makes,
you know,

668
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:27,080
uh,
when the flood comes,

669
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:28,280
right?
Well,

670
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,510
okay,
so the same thing.

671
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,040
Question emerges.
Well,

672
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:31,880
who are you?
Well,

673
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:35,120
you could say
you're this plan.

674
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,730
That's what people usually,
that's how people usually identified.

675
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:42,020
Maybe they have no plan at all and
they're just in chaos,

676
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,240
right?
That's like being in the belly of the

677
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,950
beast.
They're nihilistic and chaos.

678
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:48,290
They have no plan.
They're just chaos itself.

679
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,660
And that's a very dreadful situation for
people to be in.

680
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,440
Or maybe they conjure together a plan
that's their identity.

681
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,590
It's kind of fragile and they're holding
onto that with,

682
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,090
with everything they've got.
It's the little stick would that they're

683
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:01,010
floating in the ocean,
clinging to,

684
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,140
you know.
And so they're identifying really hard

685
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,900
with that plan.
That's what happens when you're an idiot

686
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,210
log has that.
You're identifying really hard with that

687
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,940
plan.
The problem is if something comes up to

688
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:12,280
confront it,
well,

689
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:14,450
how do you act when you can't let go
with the plan?

690
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,930
Because you drown,
then you clean to it rigidly.

691
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,120
Well that's no good because then you
can't learn anything.

692
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,820
Then if that's you,
you're a totalitarian,

693
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,670
you're going to learn anything.
You're going to end up in something

694
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,250
that's close enough to hell so that you
won't know the difference and you might

695
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,010
drag everyone along with you.
Now it's happened plenty of times,

696
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,660
right?
It's the whole story of the 20th

697
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:33,020
century.

698
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,680
It happened over and over and over,
and it happens in people's states.

699
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,890
It's to happens in their business
organizations.

700
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:42,320
It happens in their cities,
it happens in their provinces,

701
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,490
it happens in their states,
and it happens in their psyches all at

702
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,390
the same time.
You can't blame the manifestation of

703
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,280
that sort of thing on any of those one
levels.

704
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:55,220
It happens when a society goes down that
way,

705
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,230
it goes down everywhere.
At the same time,

706
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:01,160
it's not the totalitarians at the top
and all the happy people striving to be

707
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,290
free at the bottom.
It's not that at all.

708
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:06,020
It's totalitarianism at every single
level of the hierarchy,

709
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,380
including the psychological and so you
don't want to be the thing.

710
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,150
You don't want to be in chaos,
that's for sure,

711
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,960
but you don't want to be the thing that
clings so desperately to the raft that

712
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:15,950
you can't let go.

713
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,290
When someone comes to rescue you,
right?

714
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,200
You don't want to be that,
so then you think,

715
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,430
well,
exactly what are you?

716
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,040
You're not the chaos.
You're not the plan.

717
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,820
Maybe you're the thing that confronts
the obstacle,

718
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,070
and I would say that's the categorical
lesson of,

719
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,330
of psychology in so far as it has to do
with personal because that's what you

720
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,680
always teach people in psychotherapy.
I don't care what sort of

721
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,780
psychotherapist you are,
you're always teaching them the same

722
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,270
thing.
You're the thing that you're not.

723
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,570
You're not the plan.
You're the thing that can confront the

724
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:52,440
obstacle to the plant and then when you
know even further that the obstacle is

725
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,400
not only an obstacle,
but opportunity itself within your whole

726
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,290
view of the world can change because you
might think,

727
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,190
well,
I've got this planned.

728
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:03,660
Something came up to object to it.
It's like it's possible that the thing

729
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,780
that's objecting has something to teach
you that will take you to the place

730
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,630
where you develop it,
even better plant and it's a nice

731
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,530
framework to use.

732
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,840
It's like,
are you so sure that this is a problem?

733
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,860
Is that the only way that you can look
at it or is it an opportunity?

734
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,210
I mean,
I'm not trying to be naive and

735
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,960
optimistic.
There are some things that's pretty hard

736
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:25,470
to extract gold from some dragons and
maybe the death of a family member is a

737
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:28,380
good example of that,
but in even in a situation like that,

738
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,900
I can tell you that it's an opportunity
for.

739
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,170
It's an opportunity for maturation,
that's for sure.

740
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,630
And the thing is you might say,
well,

741
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,350
it's pretty miserable to go to be
digging for gold when someone's falling

742
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:41,790
into the grave.
Well,

743
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,110
if they really love you,
first of all,

744
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:45,390
that's what they'll want you to do,
and second,

745
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:48,330
you're going to make their death a lot
more palatable experience for them.

746
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,610
If you're someone who can be in the room
and be helpful instead of being,

747
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:53,520
you know,
quivering in the corner and feeling that

748
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,380
the entire world is collapsing in on
you.

749
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,500
I mean that's another.
You want to be the useful person at the

750
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:00,780
funeral.
How's that for a goal?

751
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,490
That's a good goal,
man.

752
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,820
You know that you've got yourself
together in a situation like that

753
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,630
because you're gonna be active and maybe
you want to be the person on whose

754
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:13,230
shoulder people cry.
That'd be a good goal and it's Kinda,

755
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,750
you know,
I don't like being naively optimistic.

756
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:17,340
So when I tell you to get your life
together,

757
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,880
I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.
It's like,

758
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,720
that's,
that's,

759
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,940
that's,
that's Pablum for fools.

760
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,290
But it really is something to be the
reliable person at a funeral.

761
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,850
There's this idea in union psychology
called the circumambulation and you had

762
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,870
this idea that you had a potential
future self which would be in potential

763
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:44,490
everything that you could be and that it
manifests itself moment to moment in

764
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:49,350
your present life by making you
interested in things and the things that

765
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,220
you're interested in.

766
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,400
Are the things that would guide you
along the path that would lead you to

767
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:58,050
maximal development.
Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea

768
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,840
or a or a mystical idea even,
but,

769
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,180
but it's not.
It's not.

770
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,310
It's a really profoundly biological
idea.

771
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,870
The idea is something like,
well,

772
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,770
your set up so that you're automatically
interested in those things that was

773
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,610
fully expand you as a well adapted
creature.

774
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,280
There's nothing radical about that idea.
How well what else could possibly be the

775
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:24,570
case unless there's something
fundamentally flawed about you that is

776
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,990
what the situation would be.
It's kind of interesting to think about

777
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,300
how that would be manifest moment to
moment,

778
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,250
but the idea is something like,
well,

779
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,980
your interest is captured by those
things that lead you down the path

780
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,620
of development.
Will that better be the case?

781
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,970
Okay,
so that's fine.

782
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,790
And so there's some utility in pursuing
those things that you're interested in.

783
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:47,140
And that's the call to adventure,
let's say so.

784
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,540
And the call to adventure takes you all
sorts of places.

785
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,700
Now the problem with the call to
adventure is like,

786
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:54,970
what the hell do you know?
You might be interested in things that

787
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:59,950
are kind of warped and bent,
and often it's the case that when new

788
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,690
parts of people manifest themselves and
grip their interest,

789
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:08,691
say they do it very badly in shoddily
and so you stumble around like an idiot

790
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:12,190
when you try to do something new.
That's where the fool is the precursor

791
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:15,460
to the savior from the,
from the symbolic perspectives.

792
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:17,920
Because you have to be a fool before you
can be a master.

793
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,350
And if you're not willing to be a fool
and you can't be a master,

794
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:25,351
so,
so you're gonna get it's an error error

795
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:26,380
ridden process.

796
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,140
And that's also laid out the old
testament stories because the first

797
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,980
thing that happens to all these
patriarchal figures when God kicks them

798
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:35,500
out of their father's house when they're
like 84,

799
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,040
is that they,
they run into all sorts of trouble.

800
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,160
And some of it's social and some of it's
natural and some of it's a consequence

801
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:45,910
of their own moral inadequacy.
So they're fools and.

802
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,580
But,
but the thing that's so interesting is

803
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:50,200
that despite the fact that they're
fools,

804
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,920
they're still supposed to go on the
adventure and that they're capable of

805
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:57,910
learning enough as a consequence of
moving forward on the adventure so that

806
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:59,830
they straightened themselves out across
time.

807
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,240
And so it's something like this and this
circumambulation that young talked about

808
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,300
was this continual,
we'll return to this,

809
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:11,110
this continual circling in some sense of
who you could be.

810
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,580
You might notice,
for example,

811
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:14,140
that there are themes in your life.

812
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,120
You know,
when you go back across your

813
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:17,080
experiences,
you see,

814
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,310
you kind of have your typical experience
that sort of repeats itself and there

815
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,800
might be variation on it,
like a musical theme,

816
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:28,801
but it's like you're circling yourself
and getting closer to yourself as you

817
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:31,420
move across time.
That's the circumambulation.

818
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,850
Now you remember that for a sec because
we'll go back to it.

819
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,460
Okay?
So imagine that something glimmers

820
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:39,640
before you.
It's an an interest that's daunting and

821
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:40,690
you decide,
well,

822
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:41,980
first of all,
you're paralyzed.

823
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,431
You think,
well,

824
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,430
how do I know if I should pursue that?
It's probably a stupid idea,

825
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,280
and the proper response to that is,
you're right,

826
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:52,930
it probably is a stupid idea because
almost all the all ideas are stupid and

827
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:57,400
so the probability that as you move
forward on your adventure that you're

828
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,100
going to get it right the first time is
zero.

829
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,370
It's just not going to happen.
And so then you might think,

830
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:08,230
well maybe I'll just wait around until I
get the right idea and which people do.

831
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:09,910
Right?
So they're like 40 year old,

832
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,220
13 year olds,
which is not a good idea.

833
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,110
So they wait around until it's waiting
for Godot until they finally got it

834
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,940
right.
But the problem is you're too stupid to

835
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,270
know when you've got it right.
So waiting around isn't going to help

836
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,920
because even if it's the perfect
opportunity manifested itself to you in

837
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:30,340
your incomplete form,
the probability that you would recognize

838
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:34,190
it as the perfect opportunity is zero.
You might even think it's the worst

839
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,710
possible idea that you've ever heard of
anywhere,

840
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,930
highly likely,
highly likely.

841
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
So.
So you ha.

842
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,670
There's a niche,
a niche are called that will will to

843
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,710
stupidity,
which I really liked,

844
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,450
so because he thought of stupidity as
being,

845
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,900
you know,
it's,

846
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,100
it's,
you have to take it into account

847
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,580
fundamentally and work with it and so
and so.

848
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,580
You can take these tentative steps on
your pathway to destiny and you can

849
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:05,150
assume that you're going to do it badly
and that's really useful because you

850
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:07,730
don't have to beat yourself up.
It's pretty easy to do it badly.

851
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,340
But the thing is it's way better to do
it badly,

852
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,240
the not to do it at all.
And that's the continual message that

853
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,390
echoes through these historical stories
in genesis.

854
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:21,320
It's like these are flawed people.
They should have got the hell out of

855
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:25,910
their house way before they did.
And they go out and they stumble around

856
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,120
in tyranny and famine and self betrayal
and,

857
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,810
and violence.
And,

858
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,000
but it's a hell of lot better than just
rotting away at home.

859
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,070
And that's the,
that's great.

860
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,230
So that's good.
And so why is that?

861
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,801
Well,
okay,

862
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:44,120
so you start your path and you think
that you're heading towards your star

863
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,850
and so you go in that direction and then
because you're here,

864
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:52,820
the world looks a particular way,
but then when you move here,

865
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,410
the world looks different and you're
different as a consequence of having

866
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,790
made that voyage and so what that means
is that now that thing that glimmers in

867
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:06,320
front of you is going to have shifted
its location because you weren't very

868
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:10,280
good at specifying it to begin with and
now that you're a little sharper and

869
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:14,810
more focused than you were,
it's going to reveal itself with more

870
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:16,010
accuracy to you.

871
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,450
And so then you have to take a.
You know,

872
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,460
it's almost like 180 degree reversal,
but it isn't because you know you've.

873
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,520
I mean you've gone this far and that's a
long ways to get that far,

874
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,120
but that's a lot farther than you would
be if you just stayed where you were

875
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,580
waiting.
And so it doesn't matter that you

876
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,470
overshoot continually because as you
overshoot,

877
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,830
even if you don't learn what you
should've done,

878
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:51,710
you're going to continually learn what
you shouldn't.

879
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:55,370
Keep doing,
and if you learn enough about what you

880
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:59,270
shouldn't keep doing,
then that's tantamount at some point to

881
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,610
learning at the same time what you
should be doing.

882
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,480
So it's okay.
So it's like this.

883
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,760
Now what's cool about it though,
I think is that as you progress,

884
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:14,510
the degree of overshooting starts to
decline,

885
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:16,940
right?
And that we know that there's nothing

886
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,790
hypothetical about that.
As you learn a new skill,

887
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,400
like even to play it play a song on the
piano for example,

888
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:24,920
you overshoot madly,
you'd making all sorts of mistakes to

889
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:29,921
begin with and then the mistakes
disappear.

890
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,420
There's a great ted talk,
I think it was about this guy set up a

891
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:41,400
really advanced computational recording
system in his home and recorded every

892
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:45,780
single utterance his young child made
while learning to speak.

893
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,960
And then he put together the child's
attempts to say certain phonemes and put

894
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:56,520
them in list and you can hear the child
deviating madly to begin with.

895
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,960
And then after hundreds and hundreds of
repetitions just zeroing right in on the

896
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:03,430
exact phoneme.
So you know,

897
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,450
you might not know this,
but when kids babble because they start

898
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:09,810
babbling when they're quite young,
they babble every human phoneme

899
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,140
including all sorts of phonemes that
adults can't say,

900
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,410
and then they die into their language so
that after they learn,

901
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,090
say English,
then there's all sorts of phonemes they

902
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,340
can no longer here or pronounced,
but to begin with,

903
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:25,350
it's all there,
which is really quite interesting,

904
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:29,340
but so they see as they learn a
particular language,

905
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:33,810
they zero in on the proper way to
pronounce that and their errors minimize

906
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,840
and every time you learn something,
that's how it is and that's really

907
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:40,860
useful to know too because it means that
it's okay to wander around stupidly

908
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,710
before you fix your destination.

909
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,990
Now you see that echoed in exodus,
right?

910
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,310
Because what happens is that the
Egyptians or the Hebrews escape the

911
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:52,830
tyranny,
which is kind of whatever you do

912
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,090
personally and psychologically.
When you escape from your previous set

913
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,080
of stupidly held and ignorant and
stubborn axioms,

914
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,090
it's like away from that tyranny.
It's like,

915
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:04,680
great.
I freed myself from that.

916
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,780
Well then what?
Well,

917
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:08,160
you think,
well now I'm on the way,

918
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:08,791
it's no,
you're not.

919
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:12,300
Now you're in the desert where you
wonder around stupidly,

920
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:17,430
you know and worship the wrong things
until you finally organize yourself

921
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:19,890
morally again and head in the proper
direction.

922
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:22,560
So that's worth knowing too because you
think,

923
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,350
well,
I got rid of a lot of things,

924
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:27,630
baggage,
excess baggage that I didn't need in my

925
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,190
life,
and now everything's okay.

926
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:29,671
It's like,
no,

927
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:32,010
it's not.
You've got rid of a whole set of

928
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:35,730
scaffolds that were keeping you in place
even though they were pathological.

929
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,960
Now you have nothing and nothing
actually turns out to be better than

930
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:43,920
something pathological,
but you're still stuck with the problem

931
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,170
of nothing,
and that's well,

932
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,880
that's exactly why exodus is structured
the way that it is.

933
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:51,660
It's that you escaped from materiality.
It's hooray.

934
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:53,040
We're no longer slaves.
Yeah,

935
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,480
well now you're nihilistic and lost.
It's not necessarily an improvement,

936
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,780
but it is,
but it is the pre.

937
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,490
See,
it's also useful to know that because

938
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,600
you can also be diluted into the idea
that imagine that you're trying to

939
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,510
become enlightened,
which might mean to turn all those parts

940
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:11,640
of you on that could be turned on.
You think,

941
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:13,760
well,
that's just a linear pathway uphill.

942
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,050
You know,
it's just from one success to another.

943
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:16,950
It's no,
it's not.

944
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,160
It's like here you are and you're not
doing too badly in the first step is a

945
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,810
complete bloody catastrophe.

946
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:26,220
It's worse and then maybe you can pull
yourself together and you hit a new

947
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,470
plateau and then that crumbles and
shakes and bang.

948
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,460
It's worse again and so because part of
the reason that people don't become

949
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:38,461
enlightened is because it's punctuated
by intermittent deserts essentially by

950
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,860
intermittent catastrophes,
and if you don't know that well,

951
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:46,030
then you're basically screwed because
you go ahead on your movement forward

952
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,440
and you collapse and you think,
well,

953
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,790
that didn't work.
I collapsed.

954
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:49,624
It's like,
no,

955
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:54,130
that's par for the course.
It's not indication that you failed.

956
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:57,940
It's just indication that it's really
hard and that when you learn something,

957
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,810
you also unlearn something and the thing
you unlearned is probably useful and

958
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,970
unlearning it actually is painful.
You know,

959
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:06,100
let's say if you have to get out of a
bad relationship,

960
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,910
it's like not every,
not any real.

961
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,740
There isn't any relationship that's a
hundred percent bad,

962
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,340
and so when you jump out of it,
well maybe you're in better shape,

963
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:17,830
but you're still lonesome and
disoriented and you don't know what your

964
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:20,350
past was and you don't know what your
present is and you don't want know what

965
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:21,190
your future is.

966
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,880
It's not.
That's why people stay with the devil

967
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,180
they know instead of you know,
looking for the devil they don't know

968
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,000
so,
so anyways,

969
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,590
the fact that you're full of faults
doesn't mean you have to stop and thank

970
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,750
God for that.
That's a really useful thing and the

971
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,460
fact that you're full of faults doesn't
mean that you can't learn and so you can

972
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:48,370
pause it in an ideal and you're going to
be wrong about it,

973
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,310
but it doesn't matter because what
you're right about his positing,

974
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:54,610
the ideal moving towards it,
if the actual ideal is

975
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,500
conceptualized perfectly well first
surprise,

976
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,000
surprise,
because like what are you going to do?

977
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,150
That's perfect.
So it doesn't matter that it's

978
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:05,200
imperfect,
imperfect,

979
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:07,750
it just matters that you do it and that
you move forward.

980
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,570
So that's really,
that's really positive news as far as

981
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:12,430
I'm concerned because you could actually
do that,

982
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:13,990
right?
You can do it badly.

983
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,940
Anyone can do that.
So that's,

984
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,730
that's useful.
Okay.

985
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:22,720
So like if you were an efficient person,
you would have just done that but you're

986
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:24,160
not.
But who cares?

987
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,600
You know,
you still end up in the,

988
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,470
in the same place and maybe the trip is
even more interesting.

989
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:31,210
Who knows?
Probably too interesting.
