1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,920
Don't you sometimes wonder why so many
immigrants who come to America can build

2
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:16,490
a new life and a fortune,
while many of the people who were born

3
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:20,630
here are barely surviving,
they have a dream,

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,990
a defined goal,
ambition aside from the pioneers that

5
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,860
crossed the prairies and the mountains
to reach their vision of hope and future

6
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:34,550
promises.
There are other amazing examples of how

7
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:39,500
ambition has shaped America.
Take Ben Franklin for instance,

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,820
when most people think of Ben Franklin,
they remember the kite and the lightning

9
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:48,821
bolt and the discovery of electricity.
What a lot of people may not know is

10
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:54,491
that Ben Franklin was one of the first
riders to address self making when

11
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:59,090
Franklin started poor Richard's Almanac
in 1732.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,810
He used the blank spaces between the
crop data and the weather information to

13
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,480
insert clever bits of moral and
practical advice.

14
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,670
I'm sure you've heard the saying fish
and companies start to stink in three

15
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:14,504
days.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,690
Well,
that was one of hundreds of Ben

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,340
Franklin's comments on life.
Another was diligence is the mother of

18
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,290
good luck.
You know,

19
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,190
it's amazing how hard working smart
working people have.

20
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:33,191
All the luck we sometimes hear of a
brand new musical group and overnight

21
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:37,130
success,
they must have been in the right place

22
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,910
at the right time,
knew the right people and a friend to

23
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:44,090
help them out.
But if you've ever watched an interview

24
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,580
with some of these folks,
you'll probably hear that there

25
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:51,581
overnight success took several years.
Diligence is the mother of good luck.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,500
Now,
in addition to these witticisms,

27
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:01,501
Ben Franklin gave us three principles of
success and ambition that have withstood

28
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:04,480
the test of time.
Number one,

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,680
happiness doesn't come from big pieces
of great success,

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,460
but from small advantages hammered out
day by day.

31
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,440
What Mr Franklin is saying here is that
we must be happy with what we've got.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,310
When we're in pursuit of what we want
to.

33
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,780
Often we say,
oh,

34
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,480
I'll be happy when I just get that
promotion.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,990
I'll be happy when I just land that
contract.

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,530
I'll be happy when I just have more
money.

37
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,060
I'll be happy when I just.
Just what?

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,530
You won't be any happier when you reach
your goals than you are right now.

39
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,540
It just doesn't work that way.
Abraham Lincoln said it best,

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,810
he said,
you'll be as happy as you make up your

41
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:54,370
mind to be right now.
Whether you're on your way,

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,650
whether you've already gotten there,
you'll be as happy as you make your mind

43
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,120
to be.
Now,

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,470
right now,
being happy on the way doesn't mean you

45
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,260
can't aim for great things.
After all,

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,440
look at everything Franklin accomplished
in his lifetime.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,690
It means that big achievements come one
small advantage at the time.

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,080
It means that you've got to enjoy the
journey.

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,960
It means that you must enjoy and take
pride in your little accomplishments.

50
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,640
It means enjoying who you are becoming
in pursuit of your eager desire.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,970
Every day,
every single day,

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,640
Ben Franklin,
second principal,

53
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:41,641
said that life is plastic within each of
us is the power to mold,

54
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
mold ourselves and mold our environment.
It is up to each of us to begin this

55
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,790
molding process with a final product in
mind,

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,500
and it is within our power to work it.
Inform it every minute,

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,900
every day,
every month,

58
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,310
every year.
By using your mind and your abilities

59
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:07,000
and your attitude to work a little each
day on molding your life,

60
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,760
you'll soon see how magnificent your
power is to gain those small advantages

61
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,390
each day,
the little steps it takes to build up to

62
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,180
success.
Principle number three,

63
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,190
successes.
The pleasure.

64
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,410
Success is a pleasure.
If what you are doing today isn't

65
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,660
satisfying,
gratifying,

66
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,523
guess what?

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,390
You're really not successful.
If you are not fulfilled with what you

68
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,660
are doing today,
you cannot possibly be successful.

69
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,440
It doesn't matter how many worldly
possessions you may have,

70
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,720
how many cars,
how many toys,

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,590
how much money?
If you're not happy with your life as it

72
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:51,200
is,
you cannot be successful.

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,010
Now,
I know that success is a relative term.

74
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,200
It means different things to different
people.

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,820
To a school kid,
success may mean a star on top of his

76
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:06,650
latest test to a homemaker.
It probably means that she has a well

77
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:11,300
run household and a wonderful family to
an outside professional.

78
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,740
It's most likely the thrill of closing a
major contract or the pride and

79
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:21,741
accepting a performance bonus or being
named the top producing sales person,

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,650
but the one thing you will hear from
everyone who is successful is that they

81
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:31,010
are happy with who they are and what
they are doing.

82
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,030
They are happy content,
satisfied successes of pleasure.

83
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,080
What have you done today that makes this
day successful?

84
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,970
Think about it and write it down.
If at the end of the day,

85
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,940
you can jot down the things that have
made it a good day,

86
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,250
you will soon see patterns.
For me.

87
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,220
This really is a good habit to get into.
When you can see a of pleasure,

88
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,430
you'll know you're on the road to
success

89
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,760
though.
Take note of Mr. Franklin's three

90
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:08,120
principles of success and ambition.
Number one,

91
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,780
big achievements come one small
advantage at a time,

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,410
one step at a time,
one day at a time.

93
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,030
Number two,
you have the power to mold your life,

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,040
to make it whatever you want to shape it
and reshape it,

95
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,210
and number three,
success is measured through pleasure.

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,070
This is the key one.
Success is measured through pleasure.

97
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,740
You've got to be happy along the way.

98
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,220
You've got to learn to give yourself a
pat on the back.

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,130
Good job.
You need to tell yourself,

100
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm proud of me today.
You've got to be happy.

101
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,100
You've got to learn to enjoy the
process.

102
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,280
These are really common sense ideas.
They're practical and William James

103
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,230
agreed.
He's another American great.

104
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,450
One of the most notable philosophers and
psychologists in our history and he

105
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:08,451
founded a philosophy called pragmatism.
To be pragmatic is to be practical,

106
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,880
to test the validity of a concept by its
practical results,

107
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,370
to actually question something and rate
it's usefulness by what it can do for

108
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:22,510
you to hear a method of,
yeah,

109
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,680
doing something and figuring out if it's
even worth your while.

110
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,410
One of the issues Mr James dealt with in
his lifetime was what does it mean to be

111
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,850
a success?
A significant person after years of

112
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,240
palm.
During this question,

113
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,970
William James described yes as a
combination of two things.

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Number one and inner ideal,
which is followed persistently with

115
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:54,081
courage and number two,
outer achievement related to that ideal.

116
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,030
Let's go back to number one and enter
ideal,

117
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,790
which is followed persistently with
curry.

118
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,490
I take that to mean defining a goal and
having the resolve to complete it.

119
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,660
No matter what,
I'll do it or die.

120
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,670
Promise yourself.
You'll read the books until your skills

121
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,460
change.
Go to the seminars until you get a

122
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:24,090
handle on it.
Do it until it makes sense.

123
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Practice it until you've got it right.
Don't give up until you get where you

124
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:32,430
want to be.
However long that is,

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,250
step by step,
piece by piece,

126
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,670
book by book,
seminar by seminar.

127
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,910
Do it until,
go for it until as a very important

128
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,930
word.
It's magic.

129
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,730
It means that you'll never give up.
Don't miss the chance to grow,

130
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,550
to pay the price.
Until you learn,

131
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,380
change,
grow.

132
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,210
You'll discover some of life's great
treasures when you pay that price.

133
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,060
William James Second part to success
dealt with the outer achievement related

134
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:10,300
to that ideal.
You need both aspects to really be a

135
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:14,110
success,
but what Dr James Realized about his

136
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:19,111
philosophy of success was that the first
part is indeed more important.

137
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,570
Then the second going for it.
As long as you're working toward your

138
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,380
inner goal,
your dream,

139
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:30,880
then success is possible,
but once you give up your innovation,

140
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,420
then you can never become successful.
You never will become successful until

141
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,530
it doesn't even matter.

142
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,840
Now,
maybe the person who's been working on a

143
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:47,670
project for 10 years can be successful
in his own right if he's honestly

144
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:52,080
working toward it,
doing everything to make himself worthy

145
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,280
of reaching the dream,
really happy with where he is.

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,520
According to the Christian story.
The first couple,

147
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,470
Adam and eve were instructed to be
fruitful,

148
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,510
fruitful,
produce some results,

149
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,430
fruitful.
It's kind of an interesting word.

150
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,940
It's sort of denotes abundance.
Here's what I think,

151
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:16,941
fruitful and abundance and productivity,
and I think here's what it means to go

152
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:21,990
to work on producing more than you need
for yourself.

153
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,080
Go to work,
producing more than you need for

154
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:31,081
yourself,
and I think we fulfill that command so

155
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,170
long ago given to be fruitful,
to be productive,

156
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,440
to produce far more than you need for
yourself so that you can bless others

157
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,050
and bless your community.
Bless your nation.

158
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,600
Bless you.
Were enterprise

159
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,010
producing more ideas than you need for
yourself that you could share and give

160
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:59,010
them all away,
produce more in terms of substance and

161
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:03,620
money and treasure and all things
valuable to human beings,

162
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,630
far more than you need for yourself.
Rg laterno story.

163
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,160
The man who built the big earth moving
machines,

164
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,900
it was his goal to someday give away 90
percent of income

165
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,600
giving away far more than anyone could
possibly imagine.

166
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,351
Someone says,
wow,

167
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,930
90 percent is enough to give away.
Well,

168
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,850
you should have seen the 10 percent that
was left.

169
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,740
I mean,
once abundance starts to come.

170
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,950
Once someone becomes incredibly
productive,

171
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,010
it's amazing what the numbers turn out
to be.

172
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,470
It's amazing what it finally totals

173
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,023
incredible,

174
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,650
so hopefully we'll have guidelines for
you during this weekend so you can turn

175
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,890
the response you've created already by
being here.

176
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:56,891
Then the response by employing your
mental activity and taking notes,

177
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
putting all this through your mental
processes so that you can create this

178
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,520
kind of results when you leave here.
Next

179
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,040
best way to make the most out of this
weekend is just a few things.

180
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,710
Number one,
be thankful for what you already have.

181
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,760
This looks like a pretty prosperous
audience already,

182
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,790
so we're already doing well,
which is okay,

183
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,440
but what if we could multiply the value
of our productivity by two,

184
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:32,221
by three,
by five,

185
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,690
by 10?
Would that be valuable?

186
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,460
The answer is yes,
of course it would,

187
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,120
but first of all,
to have the mechanism or the inspiration

188
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,170
or whatever it takes to really do
extremely well.

189
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,870
First,
you start with Thanksgiving to be

190
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:47,790
thankful for what you all ready,

191
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,343
Eh,

192
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,730
we have already solved the problem of
necessity in this room.

193
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:00,130
We've probably already solved the
problem of survival,

194
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,120
so we're no longer concerned with just
necessity and survival.

195
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:08,380
We are perhaps beyond that,
but now that we have gotten beyond that,

196
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,900
no telling what else we can do,
but first of all,

197
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,460
let's be thankful for what we've
accomplished up until now,

198
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,060
the years that have brought me here and
the experiences that brought me here.

199
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,020
Starting with my parents who raised me,
gave me an incredible foundation that's

200
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,490
lasted me all of these years and the
mentors that I've met along the way.

201
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,280
Absolutely the changing and
revolutionizing my life,

202
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,810
my income,
my bank account,

203
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,170
my future,
all of that collectively has brought me

204
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:39,700
here.
I'm so grateful for the people,

205
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,160
the Association for the ideas,
for the chance to work in labor,

206
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,460
produced myself,
all of that that brought me to this

207
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,580
place,
uh,

208
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,120
this weekend.
I'm grateful for it.

209
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,480
For the countries we represent,
where we have freedom.

210
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,760
Liberty,
make this note.

211
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,390
It's one of the best for the day.
These are extraordinary times.

212
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,510
About 11 years ago,
the walls came tumbling down in Germany

213
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,190
and it started a wave of democracy and
freedom like the world has ever seen

214
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:17,810
before.
It looked like communism was on the

215
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:21,770
march for so many years in the dark
shadow of that political philosophy fell

216
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:25,730
on so many countries that I visited it
even back in those early,

217
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,480
early days.
And now those shadows are beginning to

218
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:33,750
flee away in the light of democracy and
freedom and capitalism is,

219
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,030
is now the order of the day and there's
just a few old dictators left and they

220
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,310
will soon be gone.
Here's the good news.

221
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,560
In our lifetime,
they will all be gone.

222
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,630
That's an incredible thought to think
the dictators of the past will all be

223
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,464
gone.

224
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,170
Years and years ago when I went to South
America,

225
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,990
almost every country had a dictator.
Now they're all gone.

226
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,030
I mean in that whole hemisphere,
there's only one left and that's Castro

227
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,860
and he will soon be gone and the
Qaddafi's will soon be gone and this at

228
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,400
am.
Hussein's will soon be gone and they

229
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:13,660
will all be gone because now,
once this wave of capitalism and freedom

230
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:17,440
and free enterprise and spirituality now
sweeping the whole world,

231
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:21,220
once it started all those years ago,
I'm telling you,

232
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,340
it is such an incredible sight to see.
I now have the opportunity to lecture in

233
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,490
East Germany into lecture in
Czechoslovakia and Poland.

234
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,470
Now,
last time I was in Poland,

235
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:36,040
we had a bomb scare,
was incredible middle of the winter.

236
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,040
And uh,
they said,

237
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,450
you know,
there's a bomb in the place.

238
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:43,130
So we all vacated and went out in the
winter.

239
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,200
I stayed for about,
I don't know,

240
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,850
20,
25 minutes while they brought in the

241
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:50,440
sniffing dogs to clear the place and no
one left.

242
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,130
Everyone came back in middle of the
winter in Poland,

243
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,730
so that means everything is changing.
Jim Rowan,

244
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:02,350
teaching capitalism in Moscow and in
Siberia Novosibirsk.

245
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,890
I'm one of the few that's been sent to
Siberia that came back

246
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,090
and now I'm going again,
hoping I get back again.

247
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,630
Incredible.
These are extraordinary times,

248
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,800
politically,
socially,

249
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,770
and every other way.
There's never been anything like it in

250
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:21,340
the history of the last 6,000 years of
the human race.

251
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,950
It's extraordinary.
These are extraordinary times

252
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,640
politically with freedom on the march,
socially,

253
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,030
economically extraordinary times.
So make this note,

254
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,090
Jim Rollins view of the 21st century
unprecedented opportunity.

255
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,470
Every field you can imagine,
every endeavor you want to try,

256
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,600
unprecedented opportunity

257
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,550
of course,
along with all the challenges that we

258
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:56,540
faced forever.
This is a new day.

259
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
This is a new way.
This is a new scene nationally and for

260
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:05,660
each of us personally,
nothing like it.

261
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,760
Unprecedented opportunity.
Now,

262
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,460
here's number two,
the 21st century keen competition.

263
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,010
It's called world competition.
Now,

264
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,010
not just person to person,
not company to company,

265
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,100
not the industry to industry.
What happens on the other side of the

266
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,900
world.
Now it greatly affects us on this side

267
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:24,110
of the world,
so it's a world game to play.

268
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,740
This is one of our chances now to play
the world game.

269
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,780
I travel all over the world.
I mean,

270
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:33,410
it's incredible.
I leave Los Angeles 14 hours later.

271
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:35,690
I'm in Tokyo.
Five meals,

272
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,130
three movies in.
You're there.

273
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,660
I mean,
this is easy stuff.

274
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,630
I fly the concord,
right?

275
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,070
Three hours.
London,

276
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,100
New York.
These are extraordinary times.

277
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,590
In about 10 days I'll be down in South
America,

278
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:51,420
Argentina,
Venezuela,

279
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,440
incredible.
The jets fly everywhere and then all

280
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,810
night long,
the jets fly to our countries,

281
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,670
bringing us goods and services and
fruits and vegetables from anywhere in

282
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,290
the world.
It's unbelievable.

283
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,440
These are extraordinary times.
Unprecedented Opportunity,

284
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,980
but keen competition.
So here's what you need now to really be

285
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,310
successful in the 21st century.
Number one is multiple skills.

286
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,580
Hopefully we'll talk about some of those
skills this weekend.

287
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,010
Don't be caught now in the 21st century
with just one skill.

288
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,490
If you want to flourish,
be fruitful.

289
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,140
If you want to grow,
produce more than you need for yourself.

290
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,690
Learn more than one skill.
This is also my perception now and

291
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:42,300
traveling around the world.
It would be useful to know more than one

292
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,290
language,

293
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,010
learn more than one language.
My father spoke German when I was a kid

294
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,060
growing up,
but he never taught me.

295
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:55,000
My mother was English,
but she also spoke French,

296
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,420
but she never taught me.
I could have learned three languages at

297
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:02,980
the same time.
These extra languages are so useful.

298
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,460
I ask a teacher one time,
how many languages going to child learn?

299
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:08,620
Here's what you said.
As many as you'll teach them,

300
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,040
they don't lack capacity.
They don't lack imagination.

301
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,100
They certainly don't let curiosity.
They only lack of teacher,

302
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,880
so if you think learning another
language is sort of passed you by.

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,150
Make this note,
give it as a gift to your tools.

304
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,880
Another language,
and then another language.

305
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,060
When I lecture in the Scandinavian
countries,

306
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,440
they all speak several languages.
I do my seminars in English because they

307
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,490
can all understand English.

308
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,330
In the Scandinavian countries,
you're required to learn four languages

309
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,390
during your educational process.
Three,

310
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,230
they assigned in one.
You can choose,

311
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,030
so when you finished the educational
process in the Scandinavian countries,

312
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:56,031
you now know for languages which if you
live in Europe is a great advantage,

313
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,950
but it's a great advantage anywhere
learning that extra language.

314
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,610
Some of my business colleagues that make
mega millions every year,

315
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,130
many of them speak more than one
language,

316
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,850
several languages.
Michael Coles speaks seven languages.

317
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,450
It's so much fun to travel around the
world with Michael because he can talk

318
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:16,590
to anybody.
Everybody.

319
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,530
He knows all the languages.
It's a gift,

320
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,210
a gift to give to your tooth.

321
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,133
Okay,

322
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,020
so anyway,
I said all that to say this.

323
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,453
Oh,
one more.

324
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Learn all the disciplines that make
language and skills worthwhile,

325
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,170
the disciplines of good health
disciplines of staying vital.

326
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,600
We'll talk about that just a little bit
later.

327
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,190
So that's your best advantage for the
21st century.

328
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,250
So of all,
be thankful.

329
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,470
Here's the next one.
Now to make this weekend.

330
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:55,471
Really powerful for you to be eager to
learn and I hesitate to say that because

331
00:20:55,511 --> 00:21:00,400
you know you wouldn't be here if you
weren't eager to learn to pay the price

332
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,330
of time and money and it wasn't the
money that was really the expensive part

333
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,370
for this weekend.
It was the time

334
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,110
you haven't made that note before.
Make it now.

335
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:15,080
Time is more valuable than money.
You can get more money,

336
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,540
but you can't get more time.

337
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,140
So to ask you for the price for the
seminar,

338
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,100
fairly modest,
but to ask you for the price in time for

339
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:32,720
the seminar,
incredibly expensive to ask me for three

340
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:35,020
days.
I mean that's.

341
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,600
It's a heavyweight cost for me,
but it's exactly the same for you.

342
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:43,601
Three days is a chunk of time and so the
biggest investment for this weekend is

343
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:47,300
not the money.
The biggest investment is the time.

344
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,200
So here's what I want to happen.
I want this investment to pay off for

345
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:55,820
you multiplied many times over what will
the seminar be worth?

346
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,510
Not The price it cost to get in and not
the really the price of time.

347
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,760
It may be worth a thousand times more
than that.

348
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,070
What if I tried to make the seminar
worth just exactly what you paid.

349
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:11,740
That would be difficult.
What if I tried to make it worth a

350
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,140
thousand times more than you think?
I'm telling you?

351
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,900
That might be easier because I'm
inspired by ideas that have worked

352
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,870
miracles in my life and I want to share
them with you,

353
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,810
so I want you to be a lot Richard,
when you walk out.

354
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:23,770
Then when you walked in,

355
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,810
so be eager to learn.
Take good notes.

356
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,260
You know,
no matter how well you do,

357
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,690
no matter,
no telling what else you can do.

358
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,740
You know if you're mega rich,
you might become super mega rich.

359
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,910
Right after this weekend

360
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,120
we had the millionaire's club often
invite a billionaire to come talk to us.

361
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,541
He says,
well,

362
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,820
you guys are doing okay,
but you know,

363
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,120
come on,
get your act together.

364
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,370
So no matter how rich you are,
here's what's possible.

365
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,760
If you can multiply it by two by three,
by five,

366
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,860
by 10,
with the right idea,

367
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:11,310
the right inspiration,
the right collective association here,

368
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:13,380
this weekend,
it's going to give you a good chance.

369
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,320
Now,
here's the next one.

370
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,160
Argue later with all my stuff.
I wish we had time to open it up so we

371
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:22,770
could debate all this stuff right on the
spot.

372
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,430
Debate later with all of my ideas and
the things I'm going to share with you,

373
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,460
but make this note now debate is
important.

374
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,880
That's why we have at least two parties
in Congress to debate good ideas.

375
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,670
Communism said no one party sufficient,
but see lacking debate.

376
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:47,930
It's easy to become tyrannical.
Power tends to corrupt.

377
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,570
Absolutely.
Power tends to corrupt.

378
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:53,420
Absolutely.
So without debate,

379
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,330
you know something can gather far too
much power.

380
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,080
So it's important and a lot of the
issues I'm going to raise this weekend,

381
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:02,660
a lot of the stuff I'm going to share
with you is up for debate.

382
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,250
Here's why it's up for debate.
I can only share with you my point of

383
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:10,730
view
and there's got to be more than one

384
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:14,930
point of view.
If I looked at something from over here

385
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
and I said,
here's what it looks like to me,

386
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,490
and you were standing over there and
looking back this way at it,

387
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,540
you would say,
no,

388
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,510
it.
Here's what it looks like to me now.

389
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:27,410
If I invited you from back over there to
come up here and look at it from where I

390
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:28,670
am,
you might say,

391
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,020
Gosh,
you're right Mr Allen.

392
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:33,560
I never looked at it before from this
vantage point,

393
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,140
so that's what I want to do in the
speakers we've got this weekend are

394
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,150
going to gather all of this up and share
ideas from our point of view,

395
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,250
but here's what you must remember.
There's more than one point of view,

396
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,410
so here's what's important to be a
student,

397
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:54,470
not a follower,
to be a student,

398
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,490
not a follower,

399
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,000
and part of being a student is to
debate.

400
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,650
The idea is once you hear them,
you say,

401
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,020
right or wrong,
could it work for me?

402
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:06,580
Not Work for me.
Is it a,

403
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:10,240
is that a little too heavy or isn't it
sufficient enough?

404
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,820
Now,
sometimes it's useful to debate with

405
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,580
each other.
I'm a good debater,

406
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,860
right?
If I choose one side,

407
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:21,750
I don't really care which side to
choose,

408
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,220
you know,
just pick a side,

409
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,730
go for it.
I remember a great debate.

410
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:32,780
I really heard someone in America was
debating someone in Canada that held a

411
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:37,781
little more liberal position and the
American was very conservative and the

412
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,980
American said,
every man for himself,

413
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,820
individual individualism,
rugged individualism,

414
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,390
and on the other side the liberal said,
well,

415
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:50,270
yes,
every man for himself said the elephant

416
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:52,640
is he danced among the chickens.
I thought,

417
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,290
hey,
that's a pretty good point.

418
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,360
So whether it's liberal or Conservative,
we need both.

419
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,280
In America,
the Declaration of Independence is

420
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,520
America's great liberal doctrine and the
constitution of the United States is

421
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:13,810
America's great conservative document.
So it takes a bit of both,

422
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,940
but to debate the idea.
Now,

423
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:21,330
if you can't debate with someone,
here's what you must learn to do.

424
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,380
Debate with yourself.

425
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Is it valuable or isn't it valuable?
Is this idea I've heard a bit off track

426
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:31,610
or is it on track?
Would it be useful or not?

427
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,730
Be useful
to debate the merits of trying to beat

428
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,760
the merits of putting it into action.
So debate is a way to refine a good

429
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,500
idea.
Someone in Congress says,

430
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,530
I have an idea for the country,
and the rest of them say wonderful.

431
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:51,400
Put it on the table.
So someone asks three questions and this

432
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,211
guy says,
wow,

433
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,610
I never thought of those questions.
I withdraw my great idea.

434
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,000
Well,
it's a good thing we didn't try it on

435
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,010
the country.
So here's why we learned from multiple

436
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,290
voices,
but we don't become followers.

437
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,100
We become students.
And that is to refine ideas that can

438
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,990
change our health,
change our income,

439
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:13,480
change your future,
change everything for the better.

440
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,170
Make us more productive to finally have
far more in productivity than we need

441
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:24,931
for ourselves,
but eager to learn.

442
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,590
Exercise,
good debate.

443
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,020
Now here's the last part to make this a
valuable weekend.

444
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,420
And that's to be a good listener.
And then no,

445
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,220
that's not going to be easy.
You know,

446
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:42,040
most of our life is going on outside
these four walls.

447
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,000
You know our businesses out there and
our customers are out there and you

448
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,890
know,
the store we run is out there and our

449
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:50,080
children are out.
There are families out there and our

450
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,400
friends are out there,
everything.

451
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,100
Most of the things that involve our life
are out there.

452
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:58,690
So sometimes when a big part of our life
that's going on out there,

453
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:01,650
it's a little hard to sort of dismiss
all of that for awhile.

454
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,950
Put it into a place where you can just
push it aside for just a little while

455
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,950
and really listened intently and gather
up the information,

456
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,350
but I know you're going to do your best.
