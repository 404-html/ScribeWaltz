1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,230
When you have some goal out here that
you're stretching for and reaching for,

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,250
that takes you out of your comfort zone,
you'll find out some talents and

3
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,710
abilities you have that you didn't know
you had.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,090
When the messenger of misery visits you,
what are you going to do?

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,920
One,
we'll keep you in the gate.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,820
There are things that you think you'll
never need to know

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,690
that you may only need to know one time
in your life,

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,170
but that could save your life because
you have that knowledge unless you

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,600
to do something beyond that which you've
already mastered,

10
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,900
you will never grow.
What is it that you looked at at some

11
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,000
point in time and you decided that you
couldn't do it,

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,740
that you talk yourself out of it.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,680
You're waiting on your next door
neighbor to make it happen for you.

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,500
It may not happen if you're waiting on
your mother or your father.

15
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,800
They may be so ancient in their thinking
that they don't understand this

16
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:58,140
opportunity that you have and if you're
waiting on them and they never get done,

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,650
but don't beg average people to be
phenomenal.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,200
You don't beg good people,
the people nominal.

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,580
You just are phenomenal and you want to
try phenomenal.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,810
What reason can you remember that you
can call on the chicken restaurant that

21
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,120
can make you get back up?
Find that reason if you're not where you

22
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,180
are,
if you're not where you want to be,

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,120
if you don't have what you want to have,
if you're not where you think you should

24
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:26,420
be at this particular place,
it has nothing to do with the system,

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,480
but it has everything to do with the
fact that you're not making the

26
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:33,560
sacrifice.
I want you to make that dream become a

27
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,400
reality because if you don't,
you will be working for somebody else to

28
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,200
make their dreams become a reality.

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,230
Everybody is against you or don't
believe in your normal.

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,500
Let me tell you something that's a
lonely feeling.

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,220
It's a lonely feeling,
particularly people that you're doing it

32
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:55,990
for.
Most people take their greatness,

33
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,790
take their ideas to the graveyard with
them.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,740
I said to me,
if it was easy,

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,310
everybody would do it.
There are people right now who are

36
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,100
working who don't want to work.
There are people who hate their jobs,

37
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:14,101
but they keep getting up to do it.
The wealthiest place on the planet is

38
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,190
the graveyard.
The graveyard,

39
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:22,760
we will find inventions that we never,
ever were exposed to.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,740
Ideas,
dreams,

41
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:29,480
and never became reality.
Hopes and aspirations that were never

42
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,350
acted upon.

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,610
Question is,
what are you going to do with your time?

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,490
What drives you?
Greatness as a lot of small things done

45
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:44,491
well day after day after
day after day

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,680
when things don't work out for you.
When things happen that you could not

47
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,410
anticipate,
what are the reasons that you can think

48
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,244
of?

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,630
I'm only talking to the people that are
ready to get to the next level of they

50
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,650
life and they're going to boldly walk
into the next season of their life.

51
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,870
Unapologetically getting rid of all
things people in situations that no

52
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:24,301
longer belong in their life.
Most of you,

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,760
most of you,
you're so consumed

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,450
with everything that's going on in the
world.

55
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,470
This is the reason you haven't figured
out your own life yet.

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,450
Every blog,
every website,

57
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,730
every tweet,
every instagram post,

58
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,650
you are so consumed with everything
that's going on in the world.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,740
You're ignoring your own world.
You can never shy and trying to sit on

60
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:06,330
someone else's son.
You can never figure out who you are,

61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,610
if you're consumed and everything that
everybody else is and what they're doing

62
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:15,690
in the moves that they're making because
you're trying to chase someone else's

63
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,360
life.
You trying to chase someone else's

64
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:23,280
lifestyle and identity all while
ignoring your own life and your own

65
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,130
path.
What is the vision for your life?

66
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:29,550
What are the ideas and the dreams for
your life?

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,700
What are you supposed to be doing?
Who are you?

68
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:37,080
What are your gifts and talents?
What is your ultimate destiny and your

69
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:37,914
goals

70
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,800
and you should understand this,
that it was always going to be your

71
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:46,880
family and your friends.
That would be the first ones to try and

72
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,160
talk you out of your vision and your big
idea.

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,850
That's why you supposed to live your
life focused on your intentions and do

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,980
your thing.
It's you allow your self worth to be

75
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:06,590
based on what other people think of you
as the beginning of the end.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,890
I believe in me.
If you stopped believing in me,

77
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,490
I'm not going to believe in myself any
less.

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,160
If you believe that I'm irrelevant,
that no one is checking for me and that

79
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:26,120
I don't mean anything to the world
because you think or believe that about

80
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,980
me,
it doesn't mean that I'm going to

81
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,980
believe it about myself.
See,

82
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,430
the day that you start living your life
according to everybody else's opinion is

83
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:42,491
the beginning of the hand.
Most of you guys don't actually know

84
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,460
your self worth.
You don't know yourself.

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,900
Value,
believe in yourself.

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,470
Believe in yourself,
independent of the validation of the

87
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,100
world.
Have opinions and feelings about

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,270
yourself,
independent of the feedback.

89
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,640
I really think,

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,430
and if you get rid of the trash in your
life,

91
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,350
it can be people,
businesses and situations you couldn't

92
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,060
really like.
I really believe that you can reach your

93
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,880
full potential.
I want you

94
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,810
to fly.
I want you in your career and your

95
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:34,590
financial blessings to bypass me.

96
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,490
You know,
I never want to be that nine to five

97
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:05,520
person that just lives my entire life
working a nine to five and just be happy

98
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,510
with a modest lifestyle.
Um,

99
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400
you know,
being secure.

100
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:09,630
A lot of people,
that's all they want.

101
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,650
They just want a secure lifestyle,
you know,

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,030
own a house,
you know,

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,900
and be able to retire and that makes
them happy,

104
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,810
you know,
and I just believe that we should always

105
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,390
be always be pushing,
you know,

106
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,460
to achieve more.
It's become more,

107
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,930
you know,
and sit at a job.

108
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:29,600
The same job for 30 years is not
something I would ever choose to do in

109
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,040
the society.
You know,

110
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,250
we,
we are tied to go to college and get a

111
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,720
job.
That's what we're taught.

112
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,820
If you become a doctor or a lawyer,
you're successful,

113
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,933
you know,
but

114
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,870
most of the time you still have a boss
still have someone you know Tony what to

115
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,560
do and you still have a schedule you
have to stick to,

116
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,780
you know.
So it's not much different than working

117
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:53,650
at Mcdonald's.
I mean,

118
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,520
it's just you're making more money,
but you're still

119
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,570
working at Mcdonald's or
money,

120
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,650
lifestyle freedom that you want when you
want to know is the most people don't

121
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,930
understand that you've got to work hard
at whatever you do,

122
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:15,910
whether you're working for someone else
or working for yourself.

123
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,400
If you want to put that in,
you know you're going to end up being

124
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:22,000
successful,
but that's what keeps us going.

125
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,060
You know,
when you become content over

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,330
the mentality is what's going to make
things happen.

127
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,550
You know,
is having that mentality and never give

128
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,950
up.
Keep pushing forward and trying to

129
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,580
accomplish your goals and hopefully you
have more goals constantly trying to

130
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,560
move on to bigger and better things and
find a,

131
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,390
improve ourselves in every area.

132
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,770
You really have to believe what you're
doing is working.

133
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,200
You know,
it's very important to believe you have

134
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,210
to believe to achieve.
If you're doing something you're not

135
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,560
hundred percent competent,
we're doing,

136
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,880
you're going to fail.
You know,

137
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,640
someone who is doing maybe not 100
percent correctly,

138
00:08:56,641 --> 00:09:00,600
but they truly believe in their mind
that they're doing the best they could

139
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,460
possibly do.
And they believe what they're doing is

140
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:05,490
the best possible scenario.
I think they're going to have a lot more

141
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,220
success than someone that is doing it
100 percent right,

142
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,260
but aren't positive and what they're
doing,

143
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,210
you know,
the mind is the most powerful tool we

144
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,160
have.
And in order to be a winner,

145
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,280
you have to lose,
you know,

146
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,260
you know,
that's,

147
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,520
that's,
that's how you learn.

148
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,640
You know,
one day I made him tell him he better

149
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,500
get out there and start busting your
ass,

150
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,920
you know,
going forward and never stopped.

151
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't miss a day,
you know,

152
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,770
one day Mrs can't

153
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,963
back.

154
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,200
Always.
Always look at the positive.

155
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,850
You know,
the glass is always half full.

156
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,690
If you think positive and you look at
the positive,

157
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,790
you know you're,
you're only going to continue to get

158
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,510
better.
And it's been positive in every area is

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,760
the secret.
It's the secret to life.

160
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,280
If you're negative about anything,
you're going to fail.

161
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,990
No matter what it is.
You're not happy.

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,470
Do you want to be better?
But you want in every aspect,

163
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:55,890
like if you want to better yourself in
every way.

164
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,580
A lot of people,
somebody else,

165
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,450
and it just what comes around goes
around.

166
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,470
The most important thing is to not give
a shit what other people think,

167
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,040
you know,
that's the most important thing to have.

168
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,070
That kind of an attitude and mentality
is rare.

169
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,480
You know,
people are always concerned about what

170
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:29,400
other people think,
no matter who they are,

171
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,660
it really doesn't matter what other
people think,

172
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,380
you know,
it really doesn't matter if you can have

173
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,381
that kind of mentality.
People don't like to think they like to

174
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,780
ask and they don't have enough
confidence in their decisions that they

175
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,450
make on their own.
When they get advice from someone else,

176
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:51,210
that gives them more competence to
believe that that's gonna work.

177
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,220
We should always be trying to be better
at every aspect in life.

178
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,450
I mean,
you know,

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,940
are you a good husband,
a good wife?

180
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,850
Are you a good son?
You know,

181
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,980
are you a good,
you know,

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,700
you know,
whatever it could be.

183
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,620
You know,
there's a million things in life that we

184
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:09,760
are,
we,

185
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,450
I think we should constantly be trying
to be better in every area.

186
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,110
I kinda liked to just,
you know,

187
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,610
relax,
you know,

188
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,930
enjoy life and that's Kinda what I do.
Um,

189
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,110
and being able to,
to not stress and do what I want to do

190
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,150
when I want to do it is just a great
feeling.

191
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,950
What changes our whole life is action.
Why don't we take action,

192
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,320
fear or are we going to do to get
ourselves to do it?

193
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,570
Well,
you got to make sure that we push

194
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,100
ourselves through.
If I'm making a decision,

195
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,520
the point in which change happens is a
decision.

196
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Every change in your life that you want
will come from something simple.

197
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,840
A decision.
People,

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,840
what does making change decide
if I persist,

199
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,750
if I continue to try,
if I continue to charge forward,

200
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I will succeed.
I will persist until I succeed.

201
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,780
I was not delivered unto this world in
defeat.

202
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,300
No,
just fair your course in my veins.

203
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,780
I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded
by my shepherd.

204
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,200
I am a lion and I refuse to talk,
to walk,

205
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,840
to sleep with the sheet.

206
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,190
Don't be a follower.
Be a student.

207
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,430
Take advice but not orders.
Take information,

208
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:37,210
but don't let somebody you know order
your life not to do what someone else

209
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:39,700
says.
Take what someone else says.

210
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,050
Processing.
Think about it.

211
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,940
Ponder.
It makes you wonder.

212
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,820
It makes you think,
then it's valuable.

213
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,440
Then when you go take action,
make sure that the actions,

214
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,180
not what somebody told you,
make sure the action is the product of

215
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,014
your own.

216
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm exactly where I wanted to be because
I realized I've got to commit my very

217
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,450
being to this thing.
I got to read it.

218
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,390
I got it,
and until you get there,

219
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,580
once you get there,
I guarantee you the world is yours.

220
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,240
Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.
Invent.

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Reinvent yourself.
Change your toe shape so often that they

222
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:27,751
could never categorize you.
Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is

223
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
be self taught and reinvent your life
because you must live.

224
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,773
Your life

225
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,950
belongs to you.

226
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,330
Wait,
not

227
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,580
everybody
is putting in place.

228
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:18,030
Happy place this
pain.

229
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,230
You can only have two things in life
reasons or resolved.

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Notice reasons don't count.
False will always point out reasons on

231
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:44,130
why they are not living their dream on
why they're not manifesting their

232
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:46,290
greatness.
They will always be able to point those

233
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,420
things out,
but none of those things count.

234
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,040
The only thing that counts the results
and results don't lie.

235
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
they tell it all judge a tree by the

236
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:01,760
fruit that it bears,
not the ones that it might talk about,

237
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,840
not the ones that it might wish for,
but the fruit that it actually bears,

238
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,530
the people that are committed are busy
doing it,

239
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,460
but I think that some of us are
producing results in our lives that that

240
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:20,270
level of commitment brings that we
particularly don't like or find

241
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,290
distasteful.
You want to take care of yourself.

242
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,920
I don't think that as a participant in
life,

243
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,280
you cannot be committed.
You either committed to mediocrity or

244
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,920
you're committed to greatness.
You're either committed to being

245
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,710
productive or your committed to me,
nonproductive.

246
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,100
You committed to being happy or you're
committed to being unhappy.

247
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,690
Once I look at how you commit your time
one time,

248
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,920
do an evaluation on how you spend your
time.

249
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,840
I can tell you exactly what you're
committed to.

250
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,170
People that say they have dreams of one,
open a business or wanting to do

251
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,180
something differently than what they're
now doing.

252
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,770
They don't like.
Their jobs are unhappy,

253
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,620
they're unfulfilled.
People said they want to improve their

254
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,080
income level.
Look at how they spend their time.

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,960
Commitment shows up in your life,
in what you do.

256
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,300
You can make the commitment to your
life,

257
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,090
but you know black,
the results that you have and that

258
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:21,690
you're going to do something about it.
See that power is available to all of

259
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,600
us.
People who look at life,

260
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,720
I want something different for myself,
so most people like to use that

261
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:35,620
language.
They don't want to commit themselves

262
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,380
because commitment means among many
things.

263
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,020
No,
it's feels is acceptable.

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
If you decided that you want to joe
this,

265
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,010
if it becomes it difficult,
if it's inconvenient,

266
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:56,011
so what would your life be like if you
decided to keep your commitments?

267
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,430
One will be like if we decided to keep
our commitments,

268
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,330
but we decided to do the things and we
said that we were going to do,

269
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,490
but we wouldn't even speak it unless we
were going to do it.

270
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,360
Say,
I will do anything.

271
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,350
I'm going to do it.
Seven days,

272
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:21,060
you'll feel strong and powerful.
There's nothing as powerful as the human

273
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:22,480
spirit.
You can't destroy

274
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,250
when you walked the minute you're
dancing to the beat of a different

275
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,390
drummer.
Don't expect people to understand.

276
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't expect it to make sense to
anybody.

277
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,990
Why you got to do this?
This is a good job.

278
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,890
I'm
going,

279
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,720
I don't understand.
You don't have to

280
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,010
look to this day for his life,
the very life of light in its brief

281
00:17:57,011 --> 00:18:00,370
course lie all the realities and
verities of existence,

282
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,590
the bliss of growth,
the splendor of action,

283
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,450
the glory of power for yesterday is but
a dream and tomorrow is only a vision,

284
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,840
but today,
the day well lived makes every yesterday

285
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:15,841
a dream of happiness and every tomorrow
a vision of hope look well.

286
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,220
Therefore,
to this day,

287
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
a journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step from an old Chinese

288
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,680
proverb.
Most people have heard it or have come

289
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:44,130
across it at some point in the meetings.
Pretty straightforward,

290
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,740
right?
Advocates having the courage to take

291
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:51,570
that step towards the goal and let's
keep making that decision to move

292
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:56,571
forward towards something you want,
but it's what happens immediately

293
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,820
following that first step that I'm
interested in.

294
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,010
What happens when the journey's begun
and it's you and your goal in all of a

295
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,590
sudden you realized how long that road
ahead.

296
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:12,310
Really,
this is a turning point for a lot of

297
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:17,311
people and those who can succeed or able
to take their daunting,

298
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,370
intimidating goal or journey and see it
for what it really is.

299
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,230
Just a bunch of small manageable tasks
strung together.

300
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,620
You know when you look at why people
quit,

301
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,400
a lot of the time it's because they were
overwhelmed by their goals and

302
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:41,330
ambitions.

303
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,510
Let's say you have this wonderful plan
in your head to climb a mountain.

304
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,600
You're thinking about that feeling of
being on top,

305
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,750
looking down with pride.
Every time you think about it,

306
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,450
your heart starts racing,
so you pack your stuff,

307
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,400
you make your way down on the base of
the mountain,

308
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,520
and then you look up
different ballgame right now,

309
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,700
the entire mountains in front of you and
you realized that that's no small feat.

310
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,020
That is when people walk away,
when they aren't able to see a

311
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:15,690
challenge,
is the sum of tiny steps.

312
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,500
They see it as a crazy,
impossible task.

313
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,890
It's like saying you want to be the next
Tom Brady or coby Bryan to tall mountain

314
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:31,490
to climb,
like trying to hit a target from a mile

315
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:35,690
away,
but if you can identify and map out what

316
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:38,600
you need to conquer in order to become a
better basketball player,

317
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,930
football player,
and begin taking those small steps,

318
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,530
improving everyday,
that makes real.

319
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,410
That's what gives schools like
the ability to see your objective not as

320
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:53,550
a marathon,
but as a series of little 400 meters

321
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,200
stretches,
stepping stones.

322
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,370
You know what your objective is today,
tomorrow,

323
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,320
the end of the week and the end of the
year,

324
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,650
and then completing them day by day.
These little victories.

325
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,710
That's what gives you a dream life.
It's what gives you momentum.

326
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
You feel good about the process,

327
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,250
and by the way,
when things blow up in your face,

328
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,940
which happens every so often on this
little place,

329
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,380
we call them

330
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,213
birth,

331
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,290
you'll have that foundation and that
sense of accomplishment to stay focused

332
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,410
because you're approaches tangible and
it's realistic.

333
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,150
This applies with everything.
Losing a job,

334
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,470
a breakup,
failing a test.

335
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,700
These things are monumental.
If you allow them to know,

336
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,010
they can turn into that unclimbed bubble
mountain

337
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,410
or they can roadmap a new path for you,
and if you define what you want,

338
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,880
you define success and begin stepping
towards it one hour,

339
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:55,090
one day at a time,
you'll get where you want to be quicker

340
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:55,924
than you thought.

341
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,540
How you can live an easy life,
you know,

342
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,960
accomplishing goals and be successful in
going out in the world and as tough.

343
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,360
The only way to live an easy life is to
basically give up on all your dreams and

344
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,040
aspirations and just sit around doing
nothing.

345
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,860
Shit.
The disease is not worth accomplishing.

346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,680
Therefore,
a life that is easy.

347
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,880
It's not even worth living.
Nothing in this world,

348
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,530
it's worth having or doing,
unless it means effort,

349
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,060
pain,
and difficulty.

350
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,040
What you listening to me,
you listen to be good.

351
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,480
You are going to die.
All of you,

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,380
you or your friends,
your family,

353
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,110
everyone you know,
everyone you care about.

354
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,350
It's gonna be if you love life,
not waste time because time is what life

355
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:54,560
is made of,

356
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,660
so if you respect and appreciate the
time that you've been given,

357
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,120
why you out there doing what you want to
do,

358
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,620
where you need to be,
telling yourself is an acceptable to be

359
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:07,830
sitting around procrastinating and I no
longer wants to be a loser.

360
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,400
I no longer wanted to be offered.
I know what it is that at one and I'm

361
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:12,870
going to work hard and I'm going to get
it.

362
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,820
When you want to succeed,
as bad as you want to breathe,

363
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,010
then you'll be successful.
Suddenly you lost sleep.

364
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,690
More success,
and I'm here to tell you today,

365
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,450
if you're going to be successful,
you've got to be willing to give up

366
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,540
sleep.
You got to be willing to work for three

367
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,650
hours of sleep,
two hours.

368
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,130
If you really want to be successful,
some days you will have to stay up three

369
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:34,964
days in a row,

370
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,710
but you don't need to
if you don't really want it.

371
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,970
How badly are you wanting success rather
than actually working towards your

372
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,830
dreams?
A lot of you are just thinking about it.

373
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,440
I have high hopes for everybody watching
this.

374
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,690
I want you to remember your name.

375
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,840
It is not the things we do in life that
we regret on our deathbed.

376
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,520
It is the things we do not because I
assure you I've done a lot of really

377
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:14,610
stupid things.
None of them bother me.

378
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,760
All the mistakes and all the dopey
things and all the times I was

379
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,170
embarrassed.
They don't matter.

380
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Find your passion and in my experience,
no matter what you do at work,

381
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,880
what you do in official settings,
that passion will be grounded in people

382
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,530
grounded in the relationships you have
with people and what they think of you

383
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,410
when you were talking

384
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,940
in the teeth of these stupefying odds,
which is you and I,

385
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,160
you know,
ordinarily are here,

386
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,270
but one thing I can tell you ever single
day of my life trying to find somebody

387
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,990
else change their life.
I waited till 39 to get married because

388
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:30,711
I had to wait that long to find someone.
Her happiness was more important

389
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,090
and if nothing else,
I hope that all of you can find that

390
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:40,460
kind of passion and that kind of love in
your life.

391
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,023
Thank you.

392
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,300
Most people don't even make a resolution
anymore.

393
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:49,630
Why?
Because they made him from years and

394
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,340
years and years and they know they're
not going to follow through.

395
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,740
So after a while,
who wants to disappoint yourself?

396
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,060
Who wants to be upset with yourself?
Why even bother to set a new standard

397
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,950
for this year?
You know it's going to be the same as

398
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:00,784
last year.

399
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,700
Many of us don't act because we want
other people's approval.

400
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,330
We want everybody to like us and to
accept us,

401
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,040
and that's not possible.
Many of us don't do the things that we

402
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,760
want to do and don't act because of lack
of self confidence.

403
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,830
We don't believe enough in ourselves.

404
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,560
There's no denying that inside of you.
They only thing that's gonna make you

405
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,560
happy and but you're adding the decades
ahead.

406
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,790
It's going to be having you have an
experience where on a regular basis you

407
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,120
feel like your life is making progress,
so it's got to be a vision that's

408
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,760
compelling,
something that you know it's going to be

409
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,560
a gift to make sure that it happens.

410
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,580
If you want to do anything worthwhile in
life,

411
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,940
you've got to be hungry.
Josh Todd and working to develop myself.

412
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,200
He said,
I want you to practice everyday being a

413
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,580
disc jockey.
I said,

414
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,560
but I don't have any job now.
He said,

415
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:02,040
it doesn't matter.
He said that it's better to be prepared

416
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:06,330
for an opportunity and not have one than
to have an opportunity and not be

417
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:08,700
prepared.
No excuse that.

418
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:12,980
If you decided that you want to do this,
if it becomes hot and do it hot,

419
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,840
if it's difficult,
so yes,

420
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,970
beginning of the year we have this
tradition,

421
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,210
but it goes beyond tradition.
It's something inside of us that makes

422
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:26,140
us want to make things better and I
think part of it is the calendar gives

423
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:28,150
us this idea that we could have a fresh
start,

424
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,170
that we can start from fresh and have
this great victory and it's really.

425
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:35,020
The calendar itself is quite arbitrary.
It's wonderful to use it,

426
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,710
but if you didn't use it effectively,
let's use the Kennel under served you

427
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,900
today.
Let's just see what does it really take

428
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:43,900
to make this thing happen?
Because there's no denying that inside

429
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,430
of you.
The only thing that's gonna make you

430
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,400
happy and but you're adding the decades
ahead.

431
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,660
It's going to be having you up an
experience where on a regular basis you

432
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:55,510
feel like your life is making progress.
Just think,

433
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:56,410
what would your life

434
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,650
be like if you decided to keep your
commitments?

435
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,810
It is important and the area of
motivating yourself.

436
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,500
It's important to know why you're doing
it because that mind will say,

437
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:12,770
why bother?
Why go through all this?

438
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,840
This is too hard.
No,

439
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,570
throw in the towel.
It's not worth it.

440
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,650
If you make the change in yourself,
you're going to be proud this year and

441
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,460
no amount of money or accolades from
other people can mirror the feeling of

442
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:30,610
being proud of knowing you've taken back
control of your life or you've taken a

443
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:33,190
great life to another level because once
you do that,

444
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:34,630
you have something you can give other
people.

445
