1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,030
When people don't do things,
it's not because they can't.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,010
It's not even because they don't want
to.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,600
It's because of the way they are.
Focusing on what I call chunking things.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,750
When people don't follow through,
here's what they do.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,350
Give you an example.
Who here believes exercise is very

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:25,230
important but you don't exercise
regularly?

7
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,320
Let me see a show of hands.
Raise your hand more hands than most of

8
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:32,580
us want to raise your hand right now.
Who here was really focuses or I should

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,440
say exercises regularly?
Raise your hand.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,580
Regulate.
Okay,

11
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,620
great.
Who here does not exercise regularly

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,210
even though you believe it's important
just beach with.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,380
Okay,
great.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,700
So let's see what the difference is
here.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,820
A person who does not exercise
regularly,

16
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,430
I want you to raise your hand and I want
you to tell me why you don't exercise

17
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,720
regularly would be truthful.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Okay?
Yes sir.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,870
I don't have the top guy.
Is that true?

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,890
He even knows it's not true.
He's going to answer your first.

21
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,950
No.
But if feels like he doesn't have the

22
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,550
time,
cause time is emotion and he's got so

23
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,900
many other things,
he is focused on getting results in the,

24
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,870
adding this to the list seems like a
lot.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,360
Right.
And the other things are very important

26
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,560
to him.
I guess business,

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,360
I don't have a time.
He has the time.

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,620
What's the real reason he doesn't do it?
Because of the way he thinks about

29
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,020
exercise.
When he focuses on what it would take to

30
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,540
exercise,
he does it very differently than someone

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,300
who follows through.
When you think about exercising,

32
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:35,301
what's involved,
okay.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,080
Starts thinking about,
I gotta get to mile 14 or the London

34
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,200
marathon and that even the font of
trying to get to the 14th mile,

35
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:47,190
much less the 25th mile is like beyond
my imagination right now.

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,850
So he is what I call over chunked.
He's not thinking about what he wants.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,930
He's thinking about what's painful.
You just saw a perfect example.

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,660
He's not even thinking about victory.
You're succeeding.

39
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,080
So the chance of him following through
on something that he associates major

40
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,720
pain too.
When are you can do something else right

41
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,940
now.
He can feel competent or successful.

42
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,150
APP is chances of falling through our
very limited.

43
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,300
How many would follow that?
Say Aye.

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,730
His focus is on failure.
His focuses on pain.

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,090
That's why he isn't following through.
Okay?

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,750
He's also focused on the 14th mile of a
marathon rather than today's workout.

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,380
Which one seems more daunting to you?
So when you think of what is,

48
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,830
and here's also what he's thinking
about,

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,480
he's thinking about the process,
not the outcome or result he wants.

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,600
And when you think about what it's going
to take the do something,

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,600
usually it takes a lot and you're not
going to want to do it.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,280
So he's over chunked himself.
He's trying to eat the whale hall

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,780
without taking any smaller bites.
It seems too big for him.

54
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,620
So he says,
well,

55
00:02:55,621 --> 00:03:00,070
I'll do it when later down my friends
will say later,

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,270
of course,
the problem with doing it tomorrow is

57
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,280
when you get to tomorrow,
Tomorrow's Today.

58
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,360
Tomorrow never comes.
So when you keep promising yourself,

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,830
by the way,
what does this do to you emotionally

60
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,120
when you keep breaking your own promises
with yourself or you keep failing to do

61
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:20,740
things that you know are important?
Does it increase your lens?

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,610
Some of certainty and confidence.
Know what it does?

63
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,320
Is it it?
And when you rode competency in one

64
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,131
area,
believe it or not,

65
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,100
it affects the other areas to do.
Believe me on that.

66
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,530
Don't believe me.
What about your own life experience?

67
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,050
Maybe not one area,
but it starts to be multiple areas.

68
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,300
It sure does.
Another reason why somebody has an

69
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:42,301
exercise or do anything is because they
don't just chunk it too big a chunk it

70
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,850
into many details.
I'll give you a perfect example.

71
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,580
So I asked somebody one time,
I said,

72
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,430
uh,
okay,

73
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,350
how important is exercises?
Oh,

74
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,720
exercise is extremely important.
Really?

75
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,451
Okay,
good.

76
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:56,200
And tell me why don't you exercise
regularly?

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,880
Well,
I and I just don't have time.

78
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,060
Okay.
Everybody gives that answer.

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,990
That sounds wonderful.
So tell me though,

80
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,730
don't tell me about how much time you
don't have,

81
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,940
tell me this.
When you think about exercising,

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,040
what do you think about,
which is a way of saying what do you

83
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,460
focus on?
And so this woman says to me,

84
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,570
well my gosh,
you know,

85
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,940
I mean I do.
What do you mean?

86
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:16,930
When I think about,
well,

87
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,870
let's say I said to you,
you,

88
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:22,660
you got to start exercising and I'm
going to put a gun to the head of your

89
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:26,860
children and I will do very horrible
things and hurt them badly.

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,210
If you don't exercise,
could you do it?

91
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,410
Oh yeah,
I can do it.

92
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,091
You know,
if I,

93
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,980
if you,
if some mafia person came here and said,

94
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm going to kill your children,
you don't exercise every day,

95
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,880
how many things you can find a way to
exercise everyday no matter what your

96
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,000
time constraints may be.
So remember this,

97
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,800
remember this change is never a matter
of ability.

98
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:48,100
It's always a matter of motivation.
I'll say that again.

99
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,840
Change is never a matter of ability.
It's always a matter of motivation or

100
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,880
drive.
Having strong enough reasons.

101
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,590
If you've got a stronger,
the reason you could figure out the

102
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,424
time,
couldn't you?

103
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,230
So the biggest part of life and time
management is knowing what you want and

104
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:05,530
having enough reasons to follow through.
But there is one more piece.

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,930
If you make enough reason to fall
through and you'll you want,

106
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,570
but you make the task overwhelming,
you'll be overwhelmed.

107
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,500
So I said to her,
forget what I said,

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,750
let's just say you really going to start
exercising.

109
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,520
You're going to do it regularly.
How would you do it?

110
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:18,990
What,
what?

111
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,290
What's involved with exercising?
What's involved with exercise?

112
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,521
What do you focus?
He goes,

113
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,650
well,
if I was going to work out regularly,

114
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,430
I'd,
I,

115
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,550
I'd have to find a club to join.
I said,

116
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:33,070
okay,
so we watch it goes well,

117
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,250
but you want to know the whole process?
Yes.

118
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,960
Tell me the whole process of what it
would take an extra.

119
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,771
She goes,
oh my God,

120
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,570
I,
I,

121
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,391
I,
I'd have to,

122
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,510
I'd have to get on the web and search
for like all the exercise places around

123
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,940
my home and I,
you know,

124
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,560
didn't have to look through those and
see which one's probably closest or

125
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,470
which one is probably the nicest.
And I don't really know.

126
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,390
So I probably have to search on the web
and like read about it,

127
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,880
each of them and get a sense and see the
pictures of the place.

128
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,530
But of course,
you know it's never that way.

129
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,070
They really show it to you.
They always should have the best

130
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,720
pictures.
It's not really that nice.

131
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,870
So then I have to get in my car and I
got to find these places so you don't

132
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,790
have to google the location and look it
up.

133
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,260
And then I drive the I,
you know,

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,020
a lot of times instructions are wrong on
Google.

135
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,510
So sure enough I get the place,
it's not even the right place.

136
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,820
And then they have to coldplay,
somebody's cell phone there.

137
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,590
If they're called the place,
I can write down the directions.

138
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,940
Of course,
I probably don't have a pen.

139
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,410
I'm,
you know how it is when you're driving.

140
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,470
And so finally I get a pen and I drive
down the directions or try to remember

141
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,620
in my mind,
and I get to the place and now I've got

142
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,400
to get a ticket.
You know how you get that ticket?

143
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,560
And then I gotta go find a parking space
and then find a parking space.

144
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:31,280
Then what do I going to do now?
I got to go into this place and when you

145
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,690
go on the place,
you can't just go look around.

146
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,370
They want to escort,
you don't pay.

147
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,670
Some salesperson wants to score it me,
so I got to go with the salesperson.

148
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:40,490
They walked me around and they show me
the locker room and they show me this

149
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,130
and they show me that and they show me
all this stuff and then let's say I

150
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,830
won't even buy it here.
I get just give him a credit card.

151
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,840
Then when we fill out a little
application,

152
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,970
like I'm two years old again,
I'm in high school,

153
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,500
oh come on,
give me a break.

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,080
And then I fill out the application.
Now I got to pay him and then they want

155
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,500
to sell me a 10 million year membership
and I just want to try this for six

156
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,360
months.
And then after all that,

157
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,820
then they want to take a picture that
looks worse when you take it,

158
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,400
then your driver's license plus after
that.

159
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,760
Now what I do now,
I've got a flash.

160
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,000
The car going to work out and what I got
to do work out,

161
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,400
I had to take off all my clothes and I
got to hang them up in this tiny little

162
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,130
walker where my stuff doesn't really fit
and it's going to get wrinkled.

163
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,440
I know it's going to fall off and it's
going to get wrinkled and be terrible.

164
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,710
So let's say now I do that because now I
go to the first station,

165
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,910
I got to figure out which station to go
to.

166
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:22,130
So now they will probably want to give
me some trainers going to tell me what

167
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,570
to do.
But Let,

168
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,141
let's say,
dude,

169
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:24,974
I'm like,
oh,

170
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,320
I go to first nations,
somebody sitting,

171
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,290
some sweaty,
smelly person who gets up and they,

172
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,400
they got sweat.
All over sudden I gotta take my towel

173
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,550
and I got to wipe it all off and then,
and then I got to adjust the weight and

174
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,750
then I don't know what the right way it
is.

175
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,690
I got adjusted again and get the hassle
of figuring out how to Justin and I

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,350
finally do my exercise.
And then I got to wipe the thing off and

177
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:44,270
then I gotta go find the second station
and maybe there's somebody there,

178
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:47,780
maybe it's all sweaty and I don't know
the numbers and they have to like do all

179
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,730
these one station after station,
after station,

180
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,270
after station.

181
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,390
Now I got to go to the locker room and
take off my sweaty clothes,

182
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,430
which I'm going to put in a bag,
which I know is going to speak up my

183
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,280
car.
And then I got to go in and take a

184
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,800
shower and maybe I'll first do a steam
room or something,

185
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,410
but then I'm going to see body parts of
other people I don't even want to see.

186
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,870
And then they're not going to go on.
I've got to do my hair now,

187
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,660
do my makeup all over again,
start all over my makeup and do the

188
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,550
whole thing.
All these little pieces and they're

189
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:14,090
going to put on mine now wrinkle clothes
and now I can't even just leave.

190
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,520
I got to go to the front and I ain't got
to get my ticket stamps.

191
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,260
I don't have to pay for it.
They've got to find the car,

192
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,840
which I forgot where it is and then I'm
going to shortly the guy and then I

193
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:21,674
dried out.

194
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,680
That's what it takes to work out
well.

195
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:32,360
What does it take deed to do it?
What do you mean just do it well,

196
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,400
I don't know what you want.
Tell you.

197
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,900
Okay,
I know 12 places.

198
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,170
Let's go
well,

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,150
but what do you mean?
See eating is one chunk.

200
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,810
Exercising is 3,229
where every little step of,

201
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,060
well I got to do,
I think about all the consequences and

202
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,700
the elements and the pieces and that's
why they don't do it.

203
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,160
They're over chunked.
What you focus,

204
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
you feel what you feel.
You are moved to somehow actuate,

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,230
change a question,
change your life when it comes to

206
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:10,320
planning your life.
I want to get your learned to ask three

207
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:13,980
questions now and the first one is not
what am I going to do and how many

208
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:17,640
understand why now say hi.
The question one to ask yourself is what

209
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,474
do I want?

210
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,460
What's my outcome?
What's my result?

211
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,050
The word R,
p.

212
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,630
M.
The first one is to get you focused on

213
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,430
the target.
The target is not the activity.

214
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,350
The activity can change.
It's what the,

215
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,400
what's the result I'm after?
If you knew exactly what it is you

216
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,900
really want,
what you desire,

217
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,230
what you're really after,
clarity is power.

218
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,260
The more clear you are in specifically
what you want,

219
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:44,310
the faster your brain can get you there.
But if you're generally saying things

220
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:44,941
like,
what do I want?

221
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,770
Well,
you know I want more money.

222
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,700
Fine.
Here's a dollar.

223
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:51,150
Get outta here.
Did you achieve the outcome?

224
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,130
Yeah.
When you're that general,

225
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
you may be,
you think you're not getting your goal.

226
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,420
You are the way you language your goal.
Then when you think about it,

227
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,730
you're receiving it.
You know?

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,390
You know I,
you know,

229
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,830
I want to feel a bit better.

230
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,080
I want to lose some weight.
Finally,

231
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,420
I lost a pound.
You're done because your brain's like a

232
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,370
servo mechanism and a bomb and a
missile.

233
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,150
The old days you shoot a missile and the
target was going and if you miss the

234
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,230
trajectory,
you missed it.

235
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,480
Today.
What happens when the missiles not on

236
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,120
course?
What happens in locks onto the heat

237
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:20,520
signature and wants to do it moves and
follows it.

238
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,650
That's the way your brain is.
If it knows the outcome,

239
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,790
if it knows the result,
so rpm starts with I got another result.

240
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,060
This is a results planning system.
The rapid planning method.

241
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,740
You can think of it as a results
planning system.

242
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,980
I need to know the result I'm after
before I ever asked myself what to do.

243
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,920
That takes more time
but it's worth it now for time's sake.

244
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm not going to do this with you right
now but I'll tell you when I do,

245
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,710
when I've taught this to people and I
got full weekend to do this and just

246
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:47,544
give you a picture.

247
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,480
If I asked you right now to write out
your name,

248
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,490
your full name.
Now some of you abbreviate your

249
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,950
signature but write out your full name
and have cursive.

250
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,220
Couldn't do that one time right at your
full name and curse it.

251
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,750
I can't even use the word cursive.
Is that really the word people still use

252
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,870
means in handwriting I guess,
but in cursive.

253
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,480
Just write it out in full name because
you can do this later on.

254
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,980
Now if I add you get with a partner and
you can try this later if you want.

255
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,990
I'm just going to tell you because I
don't want to take the time because they

256
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,410
have such limited time today and I have
your partner say to you with a stopwatch

257
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,071
here,
okay,

258
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,720
ready?
And I go,

259
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,030
go and you write it out and you told me
when you're done,

260
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,093
I go stop.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,530
I write down how long that was.
So let's say you wrote out your

262
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:28,620
signature and it took five seconds and
then say,

263
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,030
ready,
write it out.

264
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:30,864
Ready,
go.

265
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,140
You told me we didn't stop and I write
down five seconds.

266
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,500
I have to do that 10 times.
You'll find in the beginning you'll be,

267
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,000
let's say six seconds.
I'm making it up.

268
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,720
Every signature is different and you
probably might get down to as little as

269
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,850
five seconds.
If you have like an iphone,

270
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,140
you can do it as a digital stopwatch.
You could see the middle seconds.

271
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,030
Then I say to you,
I want you guys to write every other

272
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,080
letter in cursive.
What would you write?

273
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:59,110
Half as many letters?
How long do you think it would take to

274
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,080
do it?
Half as much time.

275
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,170
Most of you will take twice as much time
in the beginning and then eventually,

276
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,800
what's interesting is if I do a 10 times
and the last two or three,

277
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,290
and this makes no logical sense,
and again,

278
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,540
I don't want to take the time to have
all of you do this 10 times,

279
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,291
10 times,
10 times,

280
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,050
but you can do it on your own.

281
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll just tell you the result.
In most cases,

282
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,630
even though you're doing half as many
letters,

283
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,630
you cut it by two thirds of the time.
There's something happens when you break

284
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,040
an whole pattern and you do it fresh.
Your brain over the years has learned

285
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,580
ways to move more rapidly since when you
did your original signature and you'll

286
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,630
do it in a third.
The amount of time.

287
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,620
It'll take twice as much at first and
then she'll across your third amount of

288
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:38,891
time.
Now,

289
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,030
let me tell you what I'm telling you.
This,

290
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,100
the system I'm calling a rapid planning,
nothing.

291
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,920
By the time I show it to you,
you're going to go,

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,150
this takes more time than just making my
to do list.

293
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,210
It will win.
When will it take more time when

294
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,320
initially,
but once you get it in your nervous

295
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,090
system,
it'll take you less time because your

296
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:58,990
brain will be thinking and outcomes and
not activities and when you think in

297
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:02,700
terms of outcomes and activities,
pretty soon some of the activities and

298
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,150
you'll see what lead me to do to get the
outcome.

299
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,310
You find a better way to get the outcome
quicker.

300
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,260
The how do you do that?
Yes.

301
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,610
Three questions.
Question one,

302
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,940
what is my result?
What is my outcome?

303
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,370
What does it I really truly want from
this?

304
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,090
If you're going back next week and you
say this next week,

305
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,840
what are the most important?
What outcomes for me to get this week in

306
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,360
my business?
And he was right.

307
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,310
Those outcomes are not your action
items,

308
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,790
the outcomes you,
if you do that and nothing else,

309
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,400
you'll be ahead of the game.
And if you just keep looking at those

310
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,620
outcomes every day,
how am I doing on that outcome?

311
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,840
Your brain will come up with ways to get
to that outcome.

312
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,000
I promise you.
Focus on outcomes,

313
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:45,001
not on activities.
Action for most people activities,

314
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,880
most people may mistake movement for
achievement.

315
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,750
They mistake action items.
Introduce for achievement.

316
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,640
We're after the achievement.

317
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Are you with me on this?
Yes or no?

318
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,280
It's a different way of thinking and I
think all of you inherently have it,

319
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,970
but if you make this ritualized,
just like the things you've learned this

320
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,080
week,
they're all great,

321
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,050
but if you don't systematize them,
they'll work when you do them.

322
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,350
But if you systematize them,
right,

323
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,160
and you see like Mr. Holman here,
where he goes in and just does it and

324
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:18,580
does it make sure it's being done again
or what you've seen chet do or what I

325
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,620
do,
you just do it over and over again.

326
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,810
You don't miss it.
Now the results are geometric.

327
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,660
So I want to get you to systematize the
thinking,

328
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,820
whether you do it visually the way I'm
going to show you or not.

329
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,190
So first question,
what's the result from after?

330
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:33,790
What's the ultimate result?
What I want out of this week out of this

331
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,601
thing,
out of my business,

332
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:38,650
out of my life for my body,
and you want to be as what as possible

333
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:42,280
when you described that outcome,
that result as well as clear and

334
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:47,230
specific as possible,
generalities will confuse you so it

335
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:50,680
might take you longer than just right
now called So-and-so to think,

336
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,530
if I'm calling my my son,
I'm going to call Gerrick or I'm going

337
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,364
to call my brother.

338
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,580
This is what goes through my head before
I called always,

339
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,090
what's my outcome because I don't want
to just call them,

340
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,940
I want jerk to feel loved by his dad or
I'm thinking about what for?

341
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,570
How come I got to talk to him about this
thing that's out there.

342
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,360
I got to make sure I get through to him
on this because I want to guide him and

343
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,520
moving in this direction.
That's what I want to be as his father.

344
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,050
I want to,
I don't want to just Chit Chat.

345
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:19,580
I can do that too.
So if you think before every phone call

346
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,110
before every time you're planning your
day and you think before you have any

347
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,861
meeting,
what do you think?

348
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:27,530
The first thing I ask of anyone when we
sit down in the meeting is,

349
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,090
okay,
what are your,

350
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,530
what are your outcomes?
What are the outcomes to this meeting?

351
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,840
First thing I want to know because if I
know the outcomes,

352
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:39,110
guess a lot of meetings,
they're done pretty quick because I know

353
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,580
the outcome.
You don't have to go through all the

354
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,960
activities,
the sell me on it.

355
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,030
Just that's your outcome.
How do you want to do it?

356
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,430
Sounds good to me.
Rock.

357
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,960
That's how you make a meeting
productive.

358
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,090
I know a meeting for Dr Number,
the hours or time.

359
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,160
Sometimes it takes longer to the outcome
than you want,

360
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,500
but I'm going to get the outcome.
That's by the way,

361
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,410
what you see with me on stage,
that's my time is very,

362
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,470
it's based on an outcome.
I'm going to get that outcome.

363
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,330
I don't give a damn whether it's the
right time or not.

364
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,030
I want to do it at that time,
but I must deliver the outcome.

365
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm going to get that.
And by the way,

366
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:10,130
how many like to have your company
focused on outcomes,

367
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,750
results and not activity?

368
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,780
Say I people say all the time,
well if you do,

369
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:15,910
you get that done.
Well do you want,

370
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:19,520
I left them an email.
I left him a voicemail.

371
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,680
I sent them three emails.
So in terms you heard that.

372
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,600
When that happens with me,
I'm like,

373
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,220
you know,
but I don't show it.

374
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,430
I just like really?
Wow.

375
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:30,230
That's fascinating.
We'll explain our about our culture.

376
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:34,670
It's about getting the result.
So I can help you if you can't figure

377
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:37,250
another way to do it.
But there may be 12 of the things we

378
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,810
might want to do.
Maybe they don't have the answer.

379
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,100
Maybe somebody else can give us the
answer.

380
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,880
The outcome was to get this information,
not to leave an email or 12 or three

381
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,290
voicemails that will not do any of us
any good.

382
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,930
How many faults.
Now,

383
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,340
whether you get the outcome or not,
whether you get that result will be

384
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:56,690
based first.
He have clarity.

385
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,180
Think about it.
You can look at any business and if you

386
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,460
want to know what shifts a business,
which shifts your life,

387
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,900
there's one force decision making.
Decision making is the force that shapes

388
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,160
destiny,
personal,

389
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,690
corporate,
business,

390
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:14,390
destiny.
How many of you can think of Disney?

391
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,430
The decisions that you made years ago,
one or two decisions five,

392
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:24,080
10 15 years ago that that decision you
may not have realized at the time,

393
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:27,170
but that decision was one of the most
important decisions of your life.

394
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,260
You've made a different decision there.
You're going a different direction in

395
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,210
your life would be completely different
today.

396
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,050
Who can relate to this and made him,
I say hi,

397
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,950
secret then is getting darn good and
making more effective decisions?

398
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:40,401
No,
by the way,

399
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,780
are we always going to make the right
decision?

400
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:43,760
Yes or no?
Absolutely not.

401
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,820
No way in a million years,
but most people don't have the guts to

402
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:49,470
make the tough decisions because they
want to make the right decision.

403
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,930
So they make notices and that's a
decision.

404
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,450
Is it a true?
And what happens is the world takes them

405
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,450
over.
So decision making is the power.

406
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
Now,
there's three decisions you're making

407
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,600
every moment of your life and of your
business and making it right now in this

408
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,940
room,
and if you're watching here on film

409
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:11,010
especially,
you might make some decisions because

410
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,450
there's,
you're not in the environment that's

411
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,670
different,
but the first decision you're making

412
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:16,510
every moment your life,
it affects your life and businesses.

413
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,500
What are you going to focus on?
Because whenever you focus on,

414
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,400
you're going to feel so as a business
owner,

415
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,340
every employee you have,
each day comes in and they make

416
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:29,310
decisions about what the focus on.
Some people focus on their own needs.

417
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:33,060
Some people focus on the customer's
needs is not going to change the quality

418
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,950
of what your business does,
how it does,

419
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,290
yes or no,
a little or completely,

420
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,053
completely.

421
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,140
Some people focus on what they can't
control every day.

422
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,410
Can you predict?
If you're focusing every day on what you

423
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,180
can't control,
how you're going to feel about your life

424
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:50,580
or your business,
you're going to be overwhelmed.

425
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,170
You're going to be depressed,
you're going to be frustrated.

426
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,290
Right now,
you're deciding what to focus on.

427
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,720
You can be focusing on,
okay,

428
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,490
we're getting into it now.
I got the energy,

429
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,170
now we're going to get into the meat of
this.

430
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,480
You're right.
All business is decision making,

431
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:04,830
better decisions,
better life.

432
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,720
Or You'd be saying,
wow,

433
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,670
my neighbor's smells after all that
jumping up and down,

434
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,770
notice that focus,
right?

435
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,380
Whenever you focus on,
you're gonna experience though.

436
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,240
True.
Now some people make a decision and then

437
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,870
they focus on the decision about how it
didn't work out versus what they

438
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,180
learned.
Because we're going to be plenty of

439
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,450
decisions that don't work out back.

440
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,320
Probably for your honest,
most of us forget them,

441
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,170
but most of their decisions aren't
necessarily the right decisions if we

442
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,140
make gutsy ones.
But the open decision is the ability to

443
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:37,320
choose again.
So focus is a decision.

444
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,930
It's happening right now.
It's happening in your business.

445
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:44,190
But here's what we're looking for.
There's a pattern of focus at some

446
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:48,010
stages in business is you're gonna learn
today the focus of the entrepreneur and

447
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:51,690
the business is increasing sales and
increased sales,

448
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,490
increased sales.
And when they're successful,

449
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,280
they eventually fail because their sales
are increasing.

450
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,760
But what's not someone telling me what's
not profits?

451
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,220
Some people are totally focused on
profits,

452
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:02,911
profits,
profits.

453
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,980
Can you make any company profitable?
Yes or no?

454
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,990
Sure.
You can cut enough stuff.

455
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,150
You can make any company profitable for
a while,

456
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,131
a day,
a week,

457
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:11,791
a month,
a year,

458
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,380
a decade,
true.

459
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,190
At different stages in the business,
you must change your focus.

460
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,150
There's a life cycle to a business.
If you're going to make effective

461
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,770
decisions,
you've got to know where you are on that

462
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,500
lifecycle.
You make decisions differently for a

463
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,560
teenager than a toddler than a grown
adult,

464
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,920
don't you?
Same thing's true in the business and

465
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,410
your life,
so if you're going to control your life,

466
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,270
the way you take controls by making new
choices,

467
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:40,410
if you don't like how things are,
when you got to do change it and to

468
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,270
change it,
you have to make a decision.

469
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,180
And by the way,
leaders make decisions.

470
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,340
That's what makes somebody a leader.
They have the guts to make the most

471
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:50,770
difficult decision.
Nobody else has the guts to make and

472
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,110
they know they're going to be wrong,
but if they're wrong,

473
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,270
what will they do?
They'll know what they want,

474
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,040
they see it's not working and they'll do
what?

475
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,950
Change it,
which means don't make another decision,

476
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:03,190
do something new and see if it works.
That's the essence of how we grow.

477
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,770
So first assisting controls your life is
focus.

478
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:08,110
Lots of patterns.
Some people focus on what they control.

479
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,630
Some focus on what they can't control.
Some focus on customers,

480
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,370
as I said,
some focus on themselves.

481
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,850
If you let me this whole business about
meeting your needs,

482
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,320
you can run a successful business,
but it will be a job because you'll

483
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,680
never be able to sell it because it was
just meeting your needs.

484
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,880
It's not a system.
It demands your attention.

485
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,370
We your connection.
It's giving what you want,

486
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,550
but ultimately it's not going to give
somebody else what they want so he can't

487
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,200
sell it.
If you can't sell your business,

488
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,690
if you don't have an exit strategy,
you have a job.

489
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,720
I don't care how successful the
businesses,

490
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,850
he doesn't mean you have to sell the
business,

491
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,020
but one of the most important decisions
you make in business is ultimately,

492
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,380
if I was going to sell this by chose to,
I have to know who,

493
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:52,480
what I sell this to so that I have
longterm value,

494
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,950
not just an income or walking away.

495
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,750
I have this critical mass,
yet I got a multiple of my business and

496
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,520
most people don't have a clear exit
strategy.

497
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,460
They think all come up with that some
day.

498
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,270
You're going to start with that end in
mind.

499
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,640
That's gotta be part of your focus.
If you're gonna be successful in your

500
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,620
business.
I can remember,

501
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,320
um,
gentlemen has built ca and Hollywood is

502
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,450
largest,
most successful agency,

503
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,160
right?
Michael Ovitz,

504
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,160
remember that name?
He put together Nike and Coca Cola and

505
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:22,150
these billion dollar deals and
eventually Mike Ovitz went to go sell

506
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,710
that business.
He'd never thought through an exit

507
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,340
strategy and he got almost nothing for
it because the laws prevented him from

508
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,610
selling it to a studio.
He had to sell it to some of his

509
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,190
employees for pennies on its real value.
No,

510
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:36,190
Mike found a way to make money later on
in another place off of Disney.

511
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,300
But the bottom line is the guy didn't
have an exit strategy and there was

512
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:41,710
brilliant,
made lots of money in the end,

513
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,330
didn't get the value focus.

514
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,220
Your first decision is what are you
going to focus on?

515
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,800
The second decision,
the minute you focused on something,

516
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,720
you're going to feel it.
So if you focus on,

517
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,340
oh my God,
the economy's coming apart,

518
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,830
my industries,
you know,

519
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,750
people are not buying my product or
service,

520
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,450
they're shutting it down.
Consumers are not spending the money.

521
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,580
Is that going to affect your state?
Yes or no?

522
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,120
Now should you lie to yourself and just
pretend there aren't challenges?

523
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,650
No,
but you're going to have to focus

524
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,970
instead on what am I gonna do?
What's the need that's still there in

525
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,820
any marketplace?
There's all one still people buying.

526
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,380
I've seen it throughout the years.
Even in some simple little business.

527
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,050
Let's say you're a realtor,
you have your own little real estate

528
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,500
office or you kind of your own
salesperson.

529
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,670
You've got a couple of people that work
with you that help you leverage

530
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,030
yourself.

531
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,940
Some got simple.
I remember years ago I met a woman named

532
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,940
Marty Rodriguez.
She's from the town I grew up in.

533
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,540
She came and one of my seminars and that
she be sitting in front row and I did in

534
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,180
a year.
I made done 25 seminars.

535
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,490
She was probably at 10 of them,
same seminar in front of low.

536
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,300
This is the woman who was the number one
real estate agent for century 21 in the

537
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:46,700
free world,
nine out of 11 years.

538
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,470
I watched her in good times,
make money in the worst times,

539
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,550
make money.
A few years ago,

540
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,570
she sold more real estate in the city.
She's from than the entire multiple

541
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,940
listing service of other agents
combined.

542
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,060
One person now she built into a
business.

543
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,490
It's got a whole team that runs it,
but it still hurt.

544
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,700
She built the brand.
How does he do well when it's going

545
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,150
horrible?

546
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,460
She says,
I love when the economy gets terrible

547
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,350
because it gets rid of all those flaky
realtors,

548
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,910
all those flaky mortgage brokers,
there are so many of them.

549
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,350
They got in,
the business was going up and they all

550
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,330
got successful because they're on a
trend.

551
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,310
When the train crashed,
they all left and left me all the

552
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:24,890
business.
She loves these times,

553
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,320
but the reason that's her focus is
different.

554
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,390
Does that make sense?
Completely different focus.

555
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,120
So when you're focusing,
you've got to decide what I'm going to

556
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,950
focus on.
But as soon as you focus on something,

557
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,750
even if it's not true,
you're going to feel it.

558
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,440
So if you think someone tells you,
someone screwed you over,

559
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,700
they took advantage of you and you're
like,

560
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:42,300
what?
And you're all upset and you picture in

561
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:46,850
your mind and now you're angry,
and then later you've got to confront

562
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,300
this person.

563
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,420
You find out it wasn't true.
Who's ever had some like this happened?

564
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,040
It felt like an idiot.
Raise your hand and say hi.

565
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,500
But when you focus on it,
does it control you?

566
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,670
Do you feel it,
yes or no?

567
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,160
So just write fun.
Focus equals feeling.

568
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,470
Whatever you focus on,
you're going to feel.

569
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,450
And as a leader,
you're gonna have to manage those

570
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,330
feelings and you gotta do it by managing
your focus.

571
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,670
By the way,
if you can lead other people,

572
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,320
do you have to create a focus for the
company,

573
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,810
for the organization to be successful?
Yes or no?

574
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,600
You've got to find yourself.
What are people focusing on?

575
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,310
It's affecting all the decisions in the
company.

576
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,610
So as soon as you focus on that,
finally get to decision number two.

577
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,070
Decision number two is what does this
mean?

578
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,100
When you focus on somebody got up to get
him to meaning.

579
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,620
Is this the end or the beginning?

580
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,660
If you think this is the end of your
business,

581
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:36,890
the end of opportunity,
the end of our economy,

582
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,520
are you going to feel differently and
act differently than if you think it's

583
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,450
the beginning?
Yes or no?

584
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,770
See the difference between Joe Kennedy
with 4 million bucks in 1929 and Joe

585
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,250
Kennedy when 180 plus million dollars in
1932 that big a jump,

586
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,920
different focus,
different meaning when everybody else

587
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,230
said it was the end and it we're
focusing on how to survive.

588
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,030
He was focusing on how to take market
share.

589
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:00,320
He was focusing on what the
opportunities,

590
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:03,080
where the meaning for him was.
Is this the greatest opportunity of my

591
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:05,090
lifetime?
They'll never be another time like this

592
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,560
and he made enough money in that time
that took care of all his heirs after

593
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:13,790
that for decades to come all because he
had a different focus in a different

594
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,330
meaning.

595
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,940
Listen,
if you're in an intimate relationship

596
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,520
and you think it's the end of that
relationship,

597
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,430
are you going to treat that person the
same way as if you think it's the

598
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:23,270
beginning?
Yes or no?

599
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,970
No.
Somebody's laughing over here.

600
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:28,850
They know no way,
but you know what?

601
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,310
In the beginning of a relationship,
what will you do for somebody you love

602
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:32,210
what we do for him?
Come on.

603
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:35,150
What?
What if they say,

604
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,710
would you take out the trash?
What do you say?

605
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:40,280
I'll take up the trash of course.
What else would you like me to do?

606
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,460
Isn't it true after three or four years,
they say a five or seven.

607
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,710
They go,
we take out the trash first.

608
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:47,461
He goes,
what do I look like?

609
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,370
Your janitor?
I don't know what it is.

610
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,200
We don't seem to have same attraction.
I don't know what happened.

611
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,720
Here's,
I tell people,

612
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,960
treat people at the end of the
relationship,

613
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,690
like it's the beginning and it won't be
in it.

614
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,020
And that's not just your intimate
relationship.

615
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,450
What if your customers,
what if you fell in love with your

616
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,610
customers,
with your clients more than your

617
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:11,010
product,
more than your company?

618
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,340
If your entire life was about meeting
their needs,

619
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,350
if you would do what for your customers,
clients,

620
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:19,650
you would do what?
If you love your customers and clients,

621
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,180
you'd do anything.
Guess what?

622
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,630
They're going to love you.
But most people love their customers and

623
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:27,120
clients as long as they buy from them,
do what they want,

624
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,620
respond to them.
And,

625
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:29,340
um,
they don't,

626
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,400
they don't that the end.
You want clients for life,

627
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,110
not just customers fall in love with
them.

628
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,370
It's a different focus isn't it?
It's a different meaning and that

629
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:40,920
creates a different life because you
make decisions differently from that

630
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:43,050
place.
There's another meaning.

631
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,050
You know,
is this punishment in my business?

632
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:51,051
Am I being punished by God or am I being
challenged or is this actually a gift?

633
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,290
What I'm facing right now?
Whatever meaning you give controls what

634
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,020
you feel and what you feel controls the
third decision,

635
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,330
what are you going to do?
Right?

636
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,490
The minute you give it a meaning,
you get a feeling.

637
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,360
When you get,
you know,

638
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,120
a feeling you're going to do something,
you're going to take action,

639
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:08,820
you're gonna pull back.
A whole economy is driven by this.

640
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,290
People start focusing on,
oh my God,

641
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,050
maybe this is going to go on forever.
Maybe I'm not going to get what I need.

642
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,810
This might be the end of the way things
are.

643
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,880
I've been a pull in my reins.
I better not spend this money I've been

644
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,570
or not take any action.
It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

645
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,070
How many know what I'm talking about it?
So decision making is your power.

646
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,550
You want to change your business.
Think about whatever's changed your

647
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,660
business in the past.

648
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,570
I guarantee which change your business
is.

649
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:38,280
Some decisions you made,
you made some decisions that shifted

650
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:42,360
your business in a radical way,
changed things in a way that shifted the

651
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:44,460
game for you.
Decisions about people,

652
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,760
decisions about products,
decisions about marketing or promotion,

653
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,650
decisions about locations,
decisions about what you're going to

654
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:52,890
offer,
your offerings,

655
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,870
decisions you want to change your whole
business.

656
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:57,180
You can do it next few days just with
some new decisions,

657
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,490
but you're going to get stimulated.
All kinds of decisions.

658
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,850
Look at got to decide which ones will
make the biggest difference today.

659
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,980
Again,
it's going to help you understand where

660
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:08,220
those decisions need to be focused based
on where you are in the lifecycle of

661
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:10,680
your business and where you are in your
personal life cycle.

662
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,960
By the way,
you make decisions differently.

663
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,100
You'll look at time differently when
you're 20 than when you're 30 and when

664
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:20,940
you're 40 and when you're 50 then when
you're 60 then when you're 70 yes or no,

665
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,070
it'll affect your decisions.
