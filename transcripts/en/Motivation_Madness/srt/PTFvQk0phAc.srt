1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,570
So I'm not here to tell you,
don't do this,

2
00:00:02,571 --> 00:00:03,620
do that,
don't do that,

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:07,610
do this.
I'm here to change the way you think and

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:12,050
if I can change the way you think,
I can't help but change what you do,

5
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,140
can I?
So I'm going to take your brains out of

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,840
your head,
squish them up and stuff and back in

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:21,140
again and change your world.
That's my goal today.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,890
Let me introduce you to the concept of
success.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,760
Ben Franklin was a pretty smart guy and
I want to start with a quote by him.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,870
If you do tomorrow,
what you did today,

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,610
you won't get tomorrow.
What you got today?

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,280
Want to know what that means?
The average American makes between three

13
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,680
and five percent more each year.
That's the deal.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,620
And in today's economy,
I'm not sure we're going to make the

15
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,840
three to four to five percent.
Next year is employed,

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,280
so it takes you 20 years ago,
double your income in America as an

17
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:55,160
average.
That's the mediocrity that was stuck in

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,300
and then give me uncanny ability to
double their income in the year.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,820
I got promoted five times in a year.
The ones that beat the system once the

20
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,900
contract,
your last name of having a difference

21
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:13,740
between them and the ones that don't do
that is that they wake up in the morning

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,450
and they think differently.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,940
We're going to look at every aspect of
our lives.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
We go see what we doing,
right?

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,000
What was your role?
We're going to analyze this thing and

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,950
when we come out of the lab,
maybe we're going to be bigger boned up,

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,050
be better.
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,520
And so if you wanted to have it up and
make it happen,

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,860
if we wanted to have it rise and ride,
if you wanted to happen,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,530
you want to do what I do and that's to
get up at 3:00 in the morning if be

31
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:48,170
wanted to have it,
that means you don't have to get home at

32
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:52,290
2:15 and get your butt up in troy six.

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,770
I was lucky.
I found what I love to do.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,360
The heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a

35
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,194
beginner.
Again,

36
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,250
less.
I convinced that the only thing that

37
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,440
kept me going was that I loved what I
did.

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,540
You got to find what you love and that
is as true for work as it is for your

39
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,480
lovers.
Your work is going to fill in large part

40
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:33,140
of your life and you only way to be
truly satisfied is to do what you

41
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,190
believe is great.
Only way to do great

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,030
if you haven't found it yet,
keep looking.

43
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,900
Don't settle her.
As with all matters of the heart,

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,470
you'll know when you find it in like any
great relationship,

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,380
it just gets better and better.
As the years went along.
