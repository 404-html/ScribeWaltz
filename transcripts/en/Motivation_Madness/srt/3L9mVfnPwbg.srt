1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,170
Life is a manifestation of where you
direct your energy.

2
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:13,890
It truly is,
and what we should really start with is

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,200
to actually look at energy the same way
we look at water.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,590
If I took water,
if I took a watering can and water the

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,170
garden bed with the weeds,
grow,

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,400
the flowers grow both right?
What?

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,370
It has no ability to discriminate
between the weeds and the flowers.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,490
Whatever water starts growing and it is
the same way as well.

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,090
If I took energy and I invested it into
something negative,

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,880
it will grow and become more negative.
If I took energy,

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,450
invested it into something positive,
it will grow and become more positive.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,650
Energy has no ability to discriminate
between what's positive and what's

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,560
negative.
Whatever you invest energy into starts

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,500
to grow and manifest in your life right
now.

15
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,830
You are the sum total of where you've
been investing your energy throughout

16
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,760
your entire life.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,780
So the goal really in life is to figure
out what it is you want,

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,400
right?
What's your purpose in life?

19
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,640
Who and what's important in your life,
and be able to direct energy too.

20
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,800
It's that so that you can manifest that
in your life.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,370
So where do we begin with this?
We begin by understanding how the mind

22
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,410
works.
I'll have to say with you,

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,100
after living 10 years as a celibate monk
in a cloistered monastery in Hawaii,

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,580
this would probably be the most
important thing I could ever share with

25
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,770
you.
Understanding how the mind works from

26
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:24,370
amongst perspective of understanding a
monk and experience of a month's

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,490
attractive.
I've understanding the mind and

28
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,050
experience at the mine in my
perspective,

29
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,440
in my experience of the mind,
the two things we need to understand

30
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,170
awareness and the mine,
let's define what they are.

31
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,960
Let's define awareness as a glowing ball
of light.

32
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:39,810
So imagine an ob,
a glowing ball of light that can float

33
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,820
around.
Let's call it awareness and put that

34
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,770
aside.
Now let's define the mind.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,010
Let's define the minus a vast space with
many different areas.

36
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,710
Within one area of the mind is angry,
hatred,

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,330
jealousy,
jai happiness,

38
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,164
sex,
food,

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,070
art,
science,

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,110
technology,
whole bunch of different things,

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,973
right?

42
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,130
Yo awareness that ball of light can
actually move to any area of the mind

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,050
you want it to go to.
So if your awareness,

44
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,510
this glowing ball of light goes to,
they're happier of the mind,

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,550
it lights up that particular area of the
mind.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,150
You become,
you become conscious of being happy.

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,290
Are you happy?
No.

48
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,180
You're in an area of the mind call
happiness.

49
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,430
If this ball of light goes to the
angrier of the mind,

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,590
it lights up that particular area of the
mind.

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,700
Are you angry?
No.

52
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,160
You in an area of the mind called
hangar.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,120
And by using your willpower and your
powers of concentration,

54
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,560
you can actually take your awareness as
well of late to any area of the mind

55
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:34,860
that you want to go to.
And here's the most important part where

56
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,440
your awareness goes.
That's where your energy is flowing.

57
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,480
So if your awareness goes to the angrier
of the mind,

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,660
your energy is flowing that it's
actually strengthening that particular

59
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:43,280
area of the mind.

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,380
So this is the theory of it.
So let's do a little practical exercise

61
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,500
to see if this actually works of some
mung talk.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,780
Okay.
So for that they need some audience

63
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,790
participation.
They need all of you to sit up straight

64
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,960
in your chair.
Okay?

65
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,840
And put your feet down on the ground.
And if you're leaning in your chair,

66
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,200
sit forward a little bit.
Keep your spine straight,

67
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,800
roll your shoulders back and keep your
head nicely balanced on top of your

68
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,300
spine.
Your eyes are closed.

69
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,860
Don't worry,
we're not going to chat.

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Oh,
hold hands until later.

71
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,040
Just kidding.
Uh,

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,890
so take a slow deep breath in with your
eyes closed.

73
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,530
Take a slow deep breath in.
Slowly exhale.

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,410
Then take another slow deep breath in
again.

75
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,160
And then slowly exhale.
I want you to become aware of the

76
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,380
chatter that you're sitting on.
Is it comfortable?

77
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,640
Is it not comfortable?
The temperature of the room?

78
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,320
Is it cold?

79
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,343
Warm?

80
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,510
What about your body posture?
Is your spine straight?

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,440
Your shoulders roll back,
your sitting a little bit forward,

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,140
your head nicely balanced on top of your
spine.

83
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,270
Now I want you to become aware of the
most recent wedding that you attended.

84
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,490
Do you remember whose wedding it is?
Where are you happy for the couple

85
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,950
getting married?
Trying to think as much detail as you

86
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:02,160
can about the wedding.
Do you remember what you wore to the

87
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,760
wedding?
Do you remember what the bride wore?

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Did she make a good choice with a dress?
How was the food at the wedding?

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,860
Alcohol.
Did you drink a lot?

90
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,220
Was that good music?
Did you dance?

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Did you do some crazy wedding dance?
Now I want you to become aware of the

92
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:35,001
most recent vacation that you went on.
What kind of vacation was it?

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,090
Was it a surfing trip?
Yoga retreat.

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,940
Holiday shopping.
Camping.

95
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:44,774
Backpacking?

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah.

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,900
Try and think as much detail as you can
about the vacation.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,140
What was the weather like where you
went?

99
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,600
Was it cold,
rainy,

100
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,620
hot,
humid,

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
dry,
snowing?

102
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,630
Do you remember the favorite hotel you
stayed in?

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,270
How was the food land?
Spicy.

104
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,290
Did you get sick eating the food?
Did you shop a lot?

105
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,220
What was one thing you bought on the
trip that you really liked?

106
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,000
Your eyes are still closed.
I want you to become aware of the room

107
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,850
again.
Try and feel the temperature of the

108
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,690
room.
Is it warm?

109
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,524
Is it cold?

110
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,100
The chair you're sitting on.
Is it comfortable?

111
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:34,580
Is it not?
It's your spine still straight or you're

112
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:38,090
hunching your shoulders roll back.
Okay.

113
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,670
Slowly open your eyes and you can lean
back in your chat.

114
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,590
Well,
thank you very much for doing that

115
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:46,040
exercise with me that the exercise is
really to prove two things to you.

116
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,070
One is this a clear separation between
awareness and the mind.

117
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,970
Two completely different things.
Second is you can actually take your

118
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,940
awareness and move it to any area of the
mind you want it to go to.

119
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,170
Well,
you gave me permission,

120
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,150
do it.
So I took your awareness from the room.

121
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,150
I took it to an area of the subconscious
mind where the memory of the wedding

122
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,720
recited and then I took you to the
vacation area of the mine and then back

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,300
to the room again.
How do I know you were thinking about

124
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:08,841
the wedding?
Well,

125
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,230
I had my eyes open and your eyes were
closed and when to ask questions.

126
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,630
I could see the reactions in your face
to the bride.

127
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,330
Make a good choice with her dress.
A couple of UN.

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,370
Okay.
Did you drink too much?

129
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,210
A few heads went down,
so I knew you were thinking about the

130
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,021
wedding,
right?

131
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,510
So I took your awareness,
different areas in the mind.

132
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,490
This happens to all day,
all day.

133
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,060
We allow people and things around us to
dictate where awareness goes in their

134
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,730
mind.
Let's do one little exercise again,

135
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,010
just to emphasize this point because to
me this is really,

136
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,610
really important and it's the crack of
crux of really managing energy in your

137
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,380
life.
Can you remember your first kiss?

138
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,060
Do you remember who it was?
Do you remember his or her name?

139
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,280
Do you remember where it took place?
Back at dad's car.

140
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,170
Behind the garage.
What was the experience?

141
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,690
So what was the emotion that was
associated with the experience

142
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,590
from a real,
think about it wasn't that long ago.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,440
Come on,
we embarrassed,

144
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,430
we nervous.

145
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,603
Do you remember?

146
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,980
Do you remember the person's name?
Okay.

147
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,480
Some people are laughing,
blushing.

148
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,310
Do you remember the first time someone
you loved,

149
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,470
someone really close to you,
passed away?

150
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,240
Do you remember that?
Do you remember getting a phone call

151
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,630
being told that this person that you
love has just died?

152
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,990
How did you feel?
What was the emotions associated with

153
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,880
that experience?
Did you have the blessing of being able

154
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,760
to see the body before they was cremated
or buried?

155
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,750
Do you remember standing next to the
body wondering how it felt knowing that

156
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:11,360
you'll never see this person again?
How did it feel for you?

157
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,790
Do you remember the emotions?
Isn't it interesting?

158
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,600
In the space is 60 to 90 seconds.
I take your awareness from an area of

159
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:24,410
the mind where all of you are smiling or
giggling or slightly embarrassed to an

160
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:28,450
area of the mine where all of you are
completely sad and that Saturday just

161
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,190
feeling the vibration of the rooms has
completely changed,

162
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,890
right?
And I could take your awareness now to

163
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,840
an angry area of the mind where you all
get anger,

164
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,930
you get up and you leave and Sarah and
her team would be really upset with me

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,680
and this happens all day,
right?

166
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,950
All Day.
We allow people and things to dictate

167
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:49,280
where awareness goes and because they
dictate where awareness goes.

168
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,670
That's where our energy flows as well
and where our energy flows is what

169
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,010
manifest in our life.
So really the goal in is not really to

170
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,250
control your mind,
but rather to control where your

171
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,740
awareness is going it within your mind.

172
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,580
So don't control your mind.
Control where your awareness goes within

173
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,200
your mind.
How do we do that?

174
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,940
We do that by learning how so your
spiritual practice or your homework for

175
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,850
taking away is to control where your
awareness goes in your mind throughout

176
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,900
the day.
And that's really it.

177
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,110
How do we do this?
We learn the fine art of concentration.

178
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,350
First,
let's define what concentration is.

179
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,340
I define concentration as the ability to
keep your awareness on one thing for an

180
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:29,490
extended period of time.
So if I can keep my awareness on this

181
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,920
lady and hold it on her,
I'm concentrating.

182
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,680
If I around with my awareness,
my ball of light to move away,

183
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm getting distracted,
I use my willpower and I bring my

184
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,801
awareness back and I hold it on her.
Being able to do that allows me to

185
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:46,410
concentrate.
Most people can't concentrate for two

186
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,580
reasons,
right?

187
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,580
One is they've never been taught how to
concentrate.

188
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,190
Second is they never practice
concentration.

189
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,440
How many of you growing up here in
school have classes on concentration

190
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,230
every single day?
The same way you had classes on

191
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,000
geography,
on math and science?

192
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,720
Anybody?
I travel all around the world and I

193
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,850
asked this question and nobody puts
their hand up.

194
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,340
How many of you,
when you were growing up in school,

195
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,760
we're told to concentrate?
Isn't that amazing?

196
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,850
You get tall to concentrate,
but you never get taught how to do it.

197
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,070
Right?
When I was growing up,

198
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,010
I got told to concentrate all the time.
Dandapani concentrate on doing your

199
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,470
homework.
Dandapani concentrate on eating your

200
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,660
food.
Anybody want to show me how to do it?

201
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,790
No.
How many of you have kids?

202
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,850
How many of you telling your kids to
concentrate?

203
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,630
Have you ever showed them how to know?

204
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,310
Right?
And then if you don't show them how to

205
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,170
concentrate,
how would they know how to do it?

206
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,730
And then if you want to be good at
something,

207
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,730
you have to practice it.
If you want to be really good at

208
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,560
concentration,
you need to practice it all day.

209
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,460
People are good at distraction because
that's what they practice all day long.

210
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,830
It's not that they don't have the
ability to concentrate,

211
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,380
they've just practice distraction and
then become really,

212
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,950
really good at it.
So how do we concentrate?

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,820
We concentrate by practicing doing one
thing at a time and integrating this

214
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:05,460
practice into our everyday life.
So for me,

215
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,830
I look at my average day and I asked
myself,

216
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,060
what's a reoccurring event in my life?
Everyday I speak with my spouse.

217
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,350
Every time I speak with my spouse,
I give her my undivided attention.

218
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,640
I keep my awareness on her.

219
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,650
It drifts away.
I bring it back,

220
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,150
it drifts away.
I bring it back.

221
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,940
I keep my awareness on her.
I give her my undivided attention.

222
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,410
Now every day I also speak to my
clients.

223
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,530
So I speak with my clients.
I speak with my friends,

224
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,380
family.
Every time I speak with somebody,

225
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:33,870
I give them my undivided attention.
If I'm on the phone,

226
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,360
I give the person on the phone my
undivided attention.

227
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,760
I practice doing one thing.
At a time.

228
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,820
By the end of the day,
I've clocked about maybe six to eight

229
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,510
hours of practicing concentration.
Six months later I become really good at

230
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,400
concentration.
12 months later,

231
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:51,450
I'd become really good at concentration.
The best way to become good at something

232
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:56,451
is to take a tool and insert it into a
reoccurring event in your life and this

233
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:00,880
is the best way to become good at
something rather than to create another

234
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,990
practice in your life.

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,660
Just take a tool and insert it into the
practice,

236
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,840
into a reoccurring event in your life.
So your homework is to give someone or

237
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,850
whatever you're doing,
your undivided attention.

238
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,570
Pick one person in your life for the
next one month that you will give your

239
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,630
undivided attention to.
Every time you speak with that person

240
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,630
can stay completely focused on them.
Keep your awareness on them.

241
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,430
The rest of the day you can go ahead and
be a squirrel,

242
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,110
but on just whenever you're speaking
with that person,

243
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,400
give that person you are and divided
attention and you need to practice and

244
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,220
bill in incremental steps.
The other thing we need to learn to

245
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:37,240
develop is how willpower,
right everybody is born with various

246
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,750
levels of willpower.
But one thing we never get taught to do

247
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,660
is to actually develop willpower.
And willpower is like a muscle.

248
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,250
I call it a mental biceps.

249
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,670
If I could draw a biceps around my mind,
that would be my willpower.

250
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,010
The three ways to develop willpower.
One,

251
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,250
finish what you begin to finish it well
beyond your expectations.

252
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,320
Three,
do a little bit more than you think

253
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,830
you're able to do.
All of these three ways require effort

254
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,080
and that effort is willpower,
right?

255
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:07,081
So how do I develop willpower?
I take these three methods and I apply

256
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,780
it to things that reoccur in my life.
What's something that reoccurs in my

257
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,060
life everyday,
everyday I sleep.

258
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,400
What a great opportunity to develop
willpower.

259
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,440
Before I go to sleep,
I floss,

260
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,360
I brush my teeth,
put on my pajamas,

261
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,760
I go to sleep.
When I wake up in the morning,

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,100
I finished the process of sleep.
How do I finish?

263
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,430
The process is asleep and then the bed
everyday.

264
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,110
So everyday I wake up in the morning,
I make the bed.

265
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,920
What's something else I do every day?
Every day I have breakfast.

266
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,070
If I have time to make breakfast,
I have time to eat breakfast.

267
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,340
Then I have time to do the breakfast
dish and put it away.

268
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,180
Right?
So finish the process that I begin and I

269
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,510
bring this into everything that I do.
Then throughout the day,

270
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,580
I develop willpower.
The more end practices,

271
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,810
the better I get.
Now,

272
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,390
I have tremendous amount of willpower.
After six months,

273
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,750
I've developed a lot of willpower.
Every time my awareness drifts away,

274
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,050
I used that mental muscle,
that willpower to bring my awareness

275
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,750
back.
Then I used the powers,

276
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,630
the concentration that I've developed to
haul my awareness on what I'm focused on

277
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,900
and because I'm focusing on that where
my awareness goes,

278
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,390
energy flows in my now my energy is
flowing to.

279
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,060
It's what I want that starts to manifest
in my life.

280
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,530
That's why it's so important.
Firstly,

281
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,650
to understand there's a separation
between awareness and the mind.

282
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:21,010
Two completely different things.
You control where your awareness goes.

283
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:24,580
You control where your energy is flowing
and you control what's manifesting in

284
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:29,110
your life and use your powers of
concentration and your willpower to hold

285
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:32,080
your awareness on the priorities in your
life.

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,280
The next thing we wanted to do is to
learn to manage energy in our life,

287
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,880
right?
This is based on the premise that we

288
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:43,390
only have so much energy each day.
We have a finite amount of energy each

289
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,430
day.
Each day we have this much energy.

290
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,670
We take our energy and we invested into
people and things around us.

291
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:49,840
We keep investing,
investing,

292
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,830
investing.
Until we have no more energy left,

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,890
we get exhausted.
That's usually around 11 or 1130 or

294
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,390
midnight.
We go to sleep,

295
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,650
I energy builds up again.

296
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,980
We go out the next day and we invest our
energy into people and things till we

297
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,190
have no more energy,
but,

298
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,220
but the one thing most people don't do
is we never evaluate who and what.

299
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,790
We're investing our energy.
And so I always tell people to treat

300
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,820
energy the same way you treat money.
It's a finite resource.

301
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,160
There needs to be wisely managed,
wisely,

302
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,990
reallocated,
and wisely invested.

303
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,860
No matter how rich you are,
you only have so much money,

304
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,450
right?
And before you spend money,

305
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,600
most of us think and evaluate what we're
investing our money.

306
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:31,190
And if somebody asks us for $5,000 or
$30,000 to invest into a startup or a

307
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,870
company,
we would ask questions.

308
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,200
Who would just wouldn't hand them
$30,000 we would ask,

309
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,420
what's your plan with it?
What are you going to do with this

310
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,060
money?
What's my return on my investment?

311
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,280
Because it's a finite resource.

312
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,210
So why don't we do the same thing with
energy before we invest energy into

313
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:50,270
someone or something?
Why don't we evaluate if that person or

314
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,600
that thing is deserving of energy?
Because if you only have this much

315
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,410
energy,
in fact,

316
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,850
10% of my energy and I gave it to John,
that's 10% I could have given to my

317
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,500
spouse,
my business,

318
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,800
the things and people that I love.
Remember the law of thermodynamics.

319
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:07,730
Energy cannot be created or destroyed,
but it can be transferred or transformed

320
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,440
from one thing to another,
right?

321
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,140
So I can't create energy.
If I give 10% to John,

322
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,280
I want to know he's going to do
something good with it.

323
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Cause if it's just going to squander it,
I'd rather take it and give it to the

324
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:21,070
people and things that I love.
So why is it important to manage energy?

325
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,900
For me,
the greatest impetus for managing energy

326
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,060
is is death.

327
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,640
Death is the greatest impetus for me to
manage energy.

328
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,170
I realized that life is finite,
that I only have one life as me.

329
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,770
And regardless of my beliefs,
I know I have one existence and as done

330
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:42,020
the piney and what happens after death,
I'm not quite sure.

331
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,440
We all have different upbringings,
different religious beliefs.

332
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,050
Some people say when you die,
you go to heaven or hell.

333
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,120
Some people say when you die,
it's game over.

334
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,800
That's it.
And nothing happens afterwards.

335
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,490
Some people say when you die,
you get reincarnated as a man or a woman

336
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,301
and other.
See,

337
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:59,480
you get reincarnated as a man.
Woman may be an insect or an animal,

338
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,710
but no one really knows.
We have our beliefs and we hold strongly

339
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:07,760
to them.
But no one's ever died and gone to

340
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,380
heaven,
taking the Selfie,

341
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:11,170
come back,
posted it on instagram and say,

342
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:11,660
look at me.

343
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,270
He didn't have an Hashtag Poli Gates,
right?

344
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,380
So we don't quite know.
But the one definitive thing is that we

345
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:21,830
know we're going to die.
And I know I have a finite amount of

346
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,840
life.
I don't believe life is short,

347
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,640
but I do believe it's fine.
And because I,

348
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,510
my life is finite.
I want to be extremely clear where to

349
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:32,600
focus my energy.
There's no point learning to concentrate

350
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,550
if you don't know what to concentrate
on.

351
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,080
So along with learning concentration,
it's really important to also learn what

352
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:43,040
to focus on.
So what I would recommend as a homework

353
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,530
is to be clear what your purpose in life
is.

354
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,350
One way to do this,
the suspend five minutes each morning

355
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,790
reflecting on what your purpose in life
is,

356
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,510
get to know yourself.
Most people are happy to spend time with

357
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,280
other people and things,
but very few people actually make time

358
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:00,690
to spend time with themselves.

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,860
So when you wake up in the morning,
take a shower,

360
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:07,861
or go to a quiet place in the house,
sit down and ask yourself questions

361
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,050
about you.
What do you want in life?

362
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,910
What's my purpose in life?
Why am I here?

363
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,610
Why do I love?
What am I passionate about?

364
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,360
How many people can generally answer
this is might say,

365
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,070
this is my purpose in life.
Very,

366
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,470
very few people.
Once you're clear with your purpose,

367
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,980
you know what to concentrate on and you
know what to direct your finite amount

368
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,560
of energy to it,
right?

369
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,650
So the next thing we wanted to look at
as energy consumers,

370
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,830
right?
People and things are two of the biggest

371
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:39,150
consumers of energy and people and
things also give you a lot of energy.

372
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,210
Since the subject is vast and timeless
shot,

373
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,920
let's focus on the people that consume
energy and how we can deal with them.

374
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,790
I call these people,
uh,

375
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,760
energy vampires,
all right?

376
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,670
That's what a vampire that's right.
Baits in the neck and suck the life out

377
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,740
of you.
And some people consume tremendous

378
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,750
amount of energy.
Essentially speaking.

379
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:01,200
There are three types of people.
And let's keep this simple monk simple.

380
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,490
There are uplifting people.
They are neutral people and they are not

381
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,240
uplifting people.
Let's define what this is,

382
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,050
what they are and uplifting person.
I spend five minutes with an uplifting

383
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,490
person.
I walk away,

384
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,840
I feel great and go like,
wow,

385
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,200
that was an amazing conversation.
A neutral person.

386
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,190
I spent five minutes with them.
I walk away,

387
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,650
I'm still the same and not uplifting
person.

388
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,900
I spent five minutes with them,
I walk away and I go like,

389
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,490
oh my God.
That was exhausting,

390
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,560
right?
And you've probably experienced that in

391
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,770
your life.
So then the next question is to ask is

392
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,920
are they an energy vampire in the two
ways to figure this out.

393
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,130
One is I can judge,
I can evaluate right?

394
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,230
Once a judging and evaluating,
judging is this.

395
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm at a party in New York City in a
penthouse.

396
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,630
There are 200 people in the room.
The door opens.

397
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,980
This guy walks in,
he's got white,

398
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,340
choose the purple suit,
he's got a keen and the top hat.

399
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,070
He's wearing a chain with a big clock
hanging off his chest.

400
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,820
I look across the room and go,
he must be a pimp or a drug dealer does

401
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,601
judging.
Right?

402
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,400
I didn't get to know him.
I just judged.

403
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,490
He was a pimp,
a drug dealer evaluation as this.

404
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,180
I spent 50 occasions with John over a
period of two years,

405
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,960
49 of those I walk away from and I go
like,

406
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,700
oh my God,
that was exhausting.

407
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,100
It's safe for me to evaluate that John
is an energy vampire.

408
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,280
Okay.
Then there are two types of energy

409
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:17,710
vampire.

410
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,400
The next question is,
are they a transient energy vampire and

411
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,530
inherently an energy vampire,
right?

412
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,710
What's a transient energy vampire?
Just say John is going through a hard

413
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,500
time in life because his dad is dying of
cancer for example,

414
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,200
and for three years is it consumes a lot
of energy.

415
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,660
You know,
he's always down.

416
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,470
You need to uplift him.
He's feeling very sad.

417
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,560
It's okay.
You give him that energy because he's

418
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,720
your friend and that's where we do.
We express compassion,

419
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,471
empathy,
and love,

420
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,140
and we support our friends during
difficult times.

421
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,770
What someone who is inherently an energy
vampire is someone who is inherently an

422
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:49,900
energy,
has always been this way for decades.

423
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:53,470
They just haven't changed.
There's just not an uplifting human

424
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:56,560
being at all.
So how do we deal with someone who's

425
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,950
inherently an energy vampire?
So before I go there,

426
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,950
quick question for all of your,
how many of you in this room feel like

427
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:06,640
you have someone who's inherently an
energy vampire in your life?

428
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,510
That's a lot of people in this room,
right?

429
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,620
So how do we deal with someone who's
inherently an energy vampire,

430
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,030
right?
My who taught me the best way to do this

431
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,240
is to practice the art of being
affectionately detached,

432
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,940
but always kind,
gentle,

433
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:26,440
sincere,
and loving to its stem.

434
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,150
What does this mean?
So just say,

435
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:31,360
John is inherently an energy vampire.
I live in New York City.

436
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:34,150
I'm walking down fifth avenue.
I see John Walking too.

437
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:35,560
It's me.
What do I do?

438
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,600
Do I cross the street?
That's not very nice.

439
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,370
I meet John.
John Meets me.

440
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,530
What do you say when two people meet
each other?

441
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,340
I know what you guys say in Australia.
Get,

442
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,410
hey,
how's it going mate?

443
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,720
Right?
Do I say that?

444
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,070
No.
Do you know why you don't want us?

445
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,540
How are you?
Because I don't want to know.

446
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,940
It's true.
You have to understand I'm in the monk

447
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,070
business.
When I ask somebody,

448
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:03,220
how are you?
They tell me their entire life story.

449
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,520
It's a confession time.
So I don't even ask,

450
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:07,990
how are you?
John asked me,

451
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:09,640
how are you?
I say I'm doing very well.

452
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,320
Thank you very much.
And then I reply,

453
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,020
what a beautiful day in Sydney,
right?

454
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,480
It's true.
I'm being sincere and being kind.

455
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,730
And then I say to him,
please excuse me.

456
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,980
I have something really important to do.
It's true.

457
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,920
My life is finite and I'm very clear
what my purpose is,

458
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,750
right?
I'm not,

459
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,850
I'm not lying.
And then what do people say at the end

460
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,820
of a conversation?
It was a pleasure meeting you.

461
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,670
Actually it wasn't,
let's do lunch.

462
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,030
Why
see you later?

463
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,350
Not really.
Don't want to.

464
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,790
Why do we say to the things we don't
mean and ask the questions we don't want

465
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,624
answers to.

466
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,410
So at the end of a conversation,
I say have a wonderful day.

467
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,750
Which is true.
I know he is inherently an energy

468
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:52,060
vampire,
but I do wish he has a wonderful day.

469
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,830
So the concept of being affectionately
detached is to not engage with someone,

470
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,900
right?
Just to be kind to be gentle,

471
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,870
to be sincere and loving towards them,
but not engaging with them.

472
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,100
What's another way to protect yourself
from an energy vampire is to place the

473
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:09,100
burden of responsibility on them.
What does that mean?

474
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,790
I'll give you an example.
I have a client of mine who's a expert

475
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,140
in social media,
right?

476
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,910
So a lot of people wanted to get
together with him,

477
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,500
have a cup of coffee,
a glass of wine.

478
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,570
Let's catch up for lunch.
Let's do dinner.

479
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Why?
Because they want to pick his brain,

480
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,440
right?
And get information from him.

481
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,100
And he can sustained us because
everybody wants to have a little bit of

482
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:30,160
his time and his just kind of live this
way.

483
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,870
So I told them,
this is what you need to do.

484
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,290
You need to,
you need to tell this person who wants

485
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,690
to meet with you.
To read your favorite marketing book,

486
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,880
read your favorite marketing book,
write down seven key points and email it

487
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,590
to you.
Once you received the seven points from

488
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,980
the book,
tell them that you know you want to see

489
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,950
what stands out to them in the book.
Once you received these seven key

490
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,720
points,
you email them and say,

491
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:58,550
let's meet up on this day for a couple
hours and we can discuss a marketing

492
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,140
strategy for you,
strategy for you.

493
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,010
You know how many people actually read
the book and email him the seven key

494
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,380
points.
Nobody.

495
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,150
As soon as you place the burden or
responsibility on someone they know and

496
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,000
do it.
I travel all around the world.

497
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,680
I speak.
People come up to me and the one to ask

498
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,840
questions.
I always give them my personal email

499
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,501
address.
I tell him,

500
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,590
please don't share it with anybody.
Can you put your question down on this

501
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:24,560
email and send it to me,
one that'll give me time to reflect on

502
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,420
it and they can give you a proper
response.

503
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,970
And they always say,
for sure I'll put it all down in email

504
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,070
and I'll send it to you.
You know how many people email me?

505
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,330
Nobody emails me.

506
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,730
Simple little task,
right?

507
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm not asking them to do yoga,
to meditate,

508
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:43,850
to read out of one nostril.
Just send me an email with your

509
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,230
problems.
And they don't do it.

510
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,290
So place the burden of responsibility on
someone.

511
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,810
If you are somebody who's developed a
particular skill,

512
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,780
you had an expert in a particular niche
and that particular area,

513
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,090
and you find that people want your time,
they want your energy.

514
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:59,750
And the one simple way to protect
yourself is to place a bet on

515
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:00,670
responsibility.
Turn them,

516
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,890
give them a simple task to do and see if
they do it.

517
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:06,170
And if they've fulfilled their tasks and
come back to you,

518
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,690
then go out of your way to help them.
Okay,

519
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,970
another thing I want to talk about,
so your spiritual practices to every

520
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,660
year,
evaluate the people in your life.

521
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,540
All right?
So go through a process of evaluation

522
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,200
and reallocate your energy between
people who uplift you and people that

523
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,400
don't evolve,
uplift you.

524
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,250
And this is something that I do all the
time.

525
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,800
All right.
Another thing I want to talk about and a

526
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:31,210
wrap up with is mental energy vampires.
What's a mental energy vampire?

527
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,720
Mental Energy Vampire is a unresolved
emotional experiences that are sitting

528
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,040
in our subconscious,
right?

529
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,610
Most people sub much conscious mind
looks like this.

530
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:44,960
Indian flower markets is packed with
stuff because people don't resolve stuff

531
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,240
as they go through life,
right?

532
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,930
Everything that is one pass through,
once pass through your conscious mind in

533
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,990
the form of experience is a resident in
your subconscious mind.

534
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:57,050
And all of these experiences have
emotion attached to them,

535
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,650
right?
One simple way to deal with unresolved

536
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:04,640
emotional experiences to do this
exercise called the [inaudible] Tantra,

537
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:07,970
that's a Sanskrit name for it.
And what it really is is to take a piece

538
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,980
of paper and write down the problem on
it.

539
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,830
Every experience has emotion attached to
it.

540
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,050
And I want to share with you a quote
from Tesla,

541
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,690
which I think really income,
uh,

542
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,250
encapsulates the philosophy that I
believe in or that I was trained in.

543
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:22,820
In the monastery.
Tesla says,

544
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,440
if you want to find the secrets of the
universe,

545
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:26,750
think in terms of energy,
frequency and vibration.

546
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,470
Everything is made up of energy and it's
vibrating at a certain frequency.

547
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,340
So if I have an experience,
it has emotion attached to it,

548
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,460
it's vibrating in my subconscious mind.
My goal is I can't do anything about the

549
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,630
experience because it's already
happened.

550
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,780
But what I can do to help myself is to
remove the emotion that's attached to

551
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:50,460
experience.
So I take a piece of paper,

552
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,100
I write down the problem.
As I write down the problem,

553
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,980
something really interesting happens.
They experience moves from my

554
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,620
subconscious mind to my conscious mind
because I'm reliving it.

555
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,020
The interesting thing that happens is
the energy,

556
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,120
the emotion actually comes out of the
experience,

557
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,670
flows through my hands into the piece of
paper.

558
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,700
Now I crumbled a piece of paper and I
burn it in a fire.

559
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,290
It could be a garbage can,
a fireplace.

560
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,960
It doesn't really matter.
Does the fire destroyed any emotion?

561
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,880
No,
because you can't destroy energy.

562
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,020
But what it actually does is transform
the emotion and the paper into heat,

563
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,430
flame,
ash,

564
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,230
smoke.
And a whole bunch of different things.

565
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,670
I remember the first time I ever shat
this exercise was with a group of

566
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,250
entrepreneurs in Perth actually about
five years ago,

567
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,690
and one of them said to me,
he looked down to pawnee.

568
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,490
I realized that experiences have emotion
attached to them and I realize as well,

569
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,650
when you relive it or you're writing
about it,

570
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,200
it goes from your subconscious mind to
your conscious mind.

571
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,710
But this whole concept,
that emotion comes out of the

572
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,660
experience,
flows through your hands into the piece

573
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:47,430
of paper.
It's planted really hard to believe.

574
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,440
I've found painted that's a little bit
too spiritual.

575
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,340
I said,
fair enough.

576
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,960
So I asked him,
do you have kids?

577
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,770
He says,
yeah,

578
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,900
I have a couple of kids,
a foil and six year old.

579
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:56,610
And I said,
on father's day on your birthday,

580
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:58,260
did he ever make you cots?
They said,

581
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,050
they do that all the time.
Can you describe the codwell?

582
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,680
They say you usually go to the back of
the house,

583
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,830
they find an old piece of cardboard draw
drawn it.

584
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,810
They stick a bunch of things on it,
stars and,

585
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,350
and a bunch of ribbons.
And then on our last day on my birthday,

586
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,240
they hand me the con and I said,
how does it look?

587
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:12,661
They going,
well,

588
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,500
it doesn't look that great.

589
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,960
It's made by a foil.
But I said,

590
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,370
do you,
let me ask you this way.

591
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:19,530
If you saw it in the store,
would you pay money for it?

592
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,340
And they go like,
no,

593
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,110
no way.
But do you keep it?

594
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,861
He says,
Hey,

595
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,990
I keep every single one.
And asked him why?

596
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:25,411
He said,
well,

597
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,790
it's so full of love.
I said,

598
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,380
wait a minute,
do you use telling me,

599
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,221
um,
your kids?

600
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:33,240
No monk magic.
Because two minutes ago I told you about

601
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,970
putting emotion and a piece of paper and
you looked at me like I was the crazy

602
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,100
person.
And now your four year old son knows how

603
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:40,980
to do this right?
Cause he's taken a piece of paper,

604
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:43,780
put his emotion in it,
a piece of paper that you don't want,

605
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,500
a cardboard that you didn't want.
Put his emotion in it and now he's given

606
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:46,920
it to you.

607
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,780
And you hold it so you can actually
transfer energy from you.

608
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,970
Emotion from insider view into another
matter.

609
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,990
How many of you have kids and have one
of those not so attractive drawings at

610
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,670
home?
Do you keep them?

611
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,520
Why you'd never be able to sell it to
anybody?

612
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,050
Nobody wants to buy it,
right?

613
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,210
You keep it because they're so full of
love.

614
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,070
It's full of emotion,
right?

615
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,390
So you can move emotion out of you.
So the exercise here is really,

616
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,260
if you ever find that you have
unresolved emotional experiences sitting

617
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,870
in your subconscious,
consuming tremendous amount of energy,

618
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,210
take a piece of paper,
write it down,

619
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,160
and then burn it.
And an ordinary fire,

620
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,320
how many times do you should do right?
Well,

621
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:28,260
depending on the emotion,
if it's an intense experience,

622
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,230
you might have to write about it three
or four times if it's not so intense,

623
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,580
maybe once or twice.

624
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,350
So just to wrap up over here,
um,

625
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,280
to know yourself is one of the greatest
gifts you can give yourself.

626
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,610
It truly is,
right?

627
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:44,920
And most people don't really understand
themselves.

628
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,570
They don't understand what they want in
life.

629
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,760
And therefore find it extremely
difficult.

630
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,980
What to focus that finite amount of
energy on.

631
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,250
I want to leave you with two quotes.
One from my group.

632
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,160
The first one is proceed with
confidence,

633
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,500
right?
Proceed with confidence.

634
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,150
Believe in your ability to manifest
something in your life because you can.

635
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:05,770
How do you manifest something in your
life?

636
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,560
You take your awareness,
you focus it on that thing.

637
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,770
You know how to develop concentration
now you keep your awareness on it.

638
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,470
When your awareness is on it,
that's where your energy is flowing.

639
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:17,950
When the energy flows that it starts to
manifest in your life and believe in

640
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:20,200
your ability to do that and proceed with
confidence,

641
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,340
confidence.

642
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,580
The next thing is life is meant to be
live joyously.

643
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,030
It truly is and if you're not happy with
life,

644
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,960
then something needs to be changed.
If you ask most people what do they want

645
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:35,140
in life,
they'll always say to most people often

646
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,820
answer,
I want it to be happy.

647
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,840
Happiness should never be pursued.
Don't pursue happiness.

648
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,140
Pursue a lifestyle that results in
happiness and that's for me what I do.

649
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:49,240
I never chase happiness.
I pursue a lifestyle where the byproduct

650
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:52,480
or the lifestyle that's happened is in
order to find out what the lifestyle is,

651
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,340
I need to know what my purpose in life
is.

652
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,640
In order to do that,
I need to spend time with myself each

653
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,130
day to find out who and what's important
in my life.

654
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,780
Take that finite amount of energy that I
have each day focusing into those things

655
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,010
that starts to manifest in my life.
The byproduct of that is happiness,

656
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,980
right?
So I want to say thank you and I want to

657
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:13,630
