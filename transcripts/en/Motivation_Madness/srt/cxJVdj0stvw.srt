1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,140
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,130
A lot of people say,
Jack,

3
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:16,210
your time is so precious and that,
no,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,400
not necessarily.
Really.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,890
Um,
if your time do not have spend on the

6
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:25,891
things that you feel important or same
thing that you are extremely love to do

7
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:30,610
it.
Oh,

8
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:33,850
you're not spending time for the future,
that time.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,110
Normally no use.
So be spending time with the students,

10
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:41,080
with the schoolmates and discussing
young people.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,050
Cause when I look at the young people,
your eyes,

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,330
he reminds me my,
my past.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,750
So I think spending time with the,
it's my honor.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,420
This is the time,
the most

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,493
validate,

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,510
discuss,
discuss about the dreams.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,310
I think like any kids,
I had a lot of dreams when I young and

18
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:06,100
most of the dreams never came true.
Now I've been trying to,

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,600
I tried the vape now when I'm 53 years
old,

20
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,180
I uh,
I've been working very,

21
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:16,630
very,
extremely hard in the pastor 30 years,

22
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:21,520
35 years now.
I think it's time to think about my

23
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:26,521
young childhood dreams,
to sing songs and being an actor and

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,030
painting everything.
I want to try everything that I go.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,610
So you have to work hard.
They can realize a lot of dreams.

26
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:36,400
That sounded stupid.
Crazy when you were young.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,070
MMM.

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,550
Let me say this.
When I started out,

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,150
well,
by the way,

30
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:48,151
I said I worked very hard when I was a
student at university in the university

31
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,740
event.
I was the chairman of the student's

32
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:54,100
Union of my university and a for my
city,

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,233
I spent,

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,550
I would say 70% of my time serving in
the student's unit,

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,290
supporting young people.
That gives me a lot of lot of experience

36
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,290
that working with the people,
the people relationship,

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,700
helping people by helping people,
I can a lot of fun and get out.

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,650
When I get them all fun,
I help you more people.

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,980
So this is why when I never got an even
one day of training to do business,

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,010
when I stepped my,
my company,

41
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,190
I know how to do with the other people.
So it's not only knowledge that as a

42
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:35,630
student they should alert,
you should learn how to serve people,

43
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,900
how to work with people,
how to team up with the people.

44
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,370
So in the future,
remember one thing that we know Iq,

45
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,850
he,
if you want to be successful to have

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,900
great q,
because econ knows how to work with

47
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,734
people.

48
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,530
If you,
no matter how smart you are,

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,910
but you never know how to,
how to work with people,

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,770
you will never succeed your dream.
We never can.

51
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,771
It's just the old dream.
And then I cue is a make you not make

52
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,220
stupid mistakes.
You wouldn't make you live longer.

53
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,510
And the other thing in the future,
if you want to be respected,

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,950
you should have l.
Q.

55
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,010
The Q of Love is also very important.
So these are the things when you have

56
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,970
these skills,
he eeq Iq and El Que,

57
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,470
most of the students pay streamline
attention to the ICU,

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,960
but they don't pay attention to the
queue.

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,020
If you don't have the El Que,
you'll go nowhere.

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,830
So all the dreams you have the based on
these things.

61
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,920
And I never know that I was a,
I will,

62
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,050
I will be jumping to the internet time.
And when I jumped in the Internet time

63
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
when I started my career are the 1995 I
started Internet China and terrible

64
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,070
years for four years,
made a lot of mistakes and you know,

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,540
stupid mistakes and partner and all in
a,

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,600
in a,
in a railway.

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,750
1999 was when I started Alibaba.
I told my team that we may not succeed,

68
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,520
but somebody will.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,880
And I never know and we never realized
after 18 years we can achieve them much.

70
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,580
So if it is your,
your dream,

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,850
you can never go for,
if it is a group stream can go further.

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,470
So I make our Alibaba dream,
not my dream is a dream of 18 founders.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Later it become a dream today become a
dream of 60,000 people.

74
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,980
And we make the dream tribe and making
sure that everybody we will try.

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,560
Our dream is to enable,
everybody can realize the intrepreneur

76
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,190
dreams through the Internet.
So young people remember,

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,770
don't worry about it,
you know,

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
you know,
is that a silly dream?

79
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,630
Now if you really believe it's a,
it's a great dream.

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,040
So believe something that you're really
passionate about.

81
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,110
Don't believe it because the other
people think it is important.

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
I never think when most people like it,
I don't like it when most people don't

83
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,670
like it.

84
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,690
I will think about it.
This is that you'll make yourself

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,500
unique.
You are you and doing business is about

86
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,280
do anything is that we,
because you are so unique,

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,520
there are about 7 billion people in the
world,

88
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,160
but there's only one you.
That's what we see.

89
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,810
So doctor Ma,
a lot of young people and a lot of

90
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:49,810
students have a harder time sort of
sticking to their dreams.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,950
So after one field glass or one field
acting audition,

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,770
they immediately get discouraged.
So what advice can you give the young

93
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,910
people so that they can continue
sticking towards their dream even in

94
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,940
spite of all the obstacles?
Yeah.

95
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,250
One thing,
why have a dream?

96
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,100
You have the same one in the treme is
great.

97
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,150
The thing behind the dream is tough,
right?

98
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,810
So when you want to dreams that you have
to ask yourself,

99
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,840
what do you want to sacrifice?
Not Say I want to do anything to get my

100
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,580
train,
but you know what?

101
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,060
What are the things you want really want
to do?

102
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,030
You have a failure.
You are mistakes people don't like you.

103
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,580
People don't team with you and all this
stuffs.

104
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,930
When you have a dream,
you have to think the backside of the

105
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:40,080
trim very clearly.
So everybody,

106
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:41,730
ask yourself,
what do you have

107
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,570
right?
And what do you want?

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,150
A very important,
what will you give up?

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,030
If you don't think about what we give
up,

110
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,730
you will not have what you have.
So

111
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,240
when I start my business,
I know Internet,

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
(990) 590-9999 nineties nobody believed
Internet in China will happen.

113
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,450
So I want to sell my products.
I know today as a salesman,

114
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,180
I go out,
can people,

115
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,650
if I talk to 10 businesspeople,
10 business people always say no.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,390
Why?
People want to help you.

117
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:21,980
People say,
nobody helping me.

118
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,450
Why?
People should help you.

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,100
People will help you.
That is extremely,

120
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,800
you're lucky people don't help you.
That's very common.

121
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,170
So when you go out,
nobody,

122
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,240
nobody would have a deal with you.
You say,

123
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,990
yeah,
I'm right.

124
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,270
Nobody do with it.
If you've got one deal,

125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,030
you should be honored,
extremely happy because you are extra

126
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,310
ordinary.
So don't be discouraged when people

127
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,890
don't help for you.
Why people should help you.

128
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,690
You should have earned the right to be
helped,

129
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,320
right?
So this is so when you have a dream,

130
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,700
you have asked what are the things you
going to pay for the trees?

131
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,190
So that's a very interesting
perspective,

132
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,880
a doctor really understanding what
you're willing to give up.

133
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,680
Now we want to talk about this role
model that you've always often talked

134
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:13,590
them rather often talked about in a lot
of your interviews,

135
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,590
forest gump.
Um,

136
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,170
often times you cite this coat from
that,

137
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,260
from that movie,
life is a box of chocolates.

138
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,160
Um,
but with that we wanted to know more

139
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:30,150
about how you stumbled upon forrest gump
and what kind of,

140
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,540
what kind of different perspective in
the world,

141
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,460
uh,
has watching that movie,

142
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,540
uh,
given to you?

143
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,690
Yeah,
that's a very interesting question.

144
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,980
The day I watched the forrest gump was
in a friend's home in Seattle and that

145
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,210
week was my most frustrated,
just made period.

146
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,300
I was so upset.
I was cheated by my friends and I failed

147
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,780
like five projects all film.
So I almost to say,

148
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,280
well,
you know this,

149
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,400
the,
the people I work with,

150
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:12,230
they're very smart
and um,

151
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,200
we know that Internet was not easy.
90 95,

152
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,310
90,
96,

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,150
907.
But when we,

154
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,220
we did not realize it's so tough.
Then I was happy to be in Seattle,

155
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,280
in my friend's home and he had a video,
the forrest gump of watch that,

156
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,600
that evening and I,
I watched the movie.

157
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:37,770
I think we have to stay foolish.
We saw a dream.

158
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,630
Don't think we are smart.
We have to stay foolish with their

159
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:46,620
dreams.
And we have to continue be simple.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,090
Like forrest gump is a very simple,
he's not smart guy.

161
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,530
He continued to do running round money.
He thinks that the sub,

162
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,200
he said nobody,
you know,

163
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,080
he will only want to make business.
Bennett from the catcher shrinks.

164
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,450
A lot of people want to make business
and make money by catch wills,

165
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,540
shocks,
you know,

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,360
you've got to do business who was a big
companies.

167
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,850
So I thought that time,
yes,

168
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,280
he's right.
We should serve normal people.

169
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,800
We should catch shrimps.
We should have supporting small

170
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:20,760
business.
So be simple,

171
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,180
stay foolish,
and no matter what,

172
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,460
you know,
just the continuum and do not complain.

173
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,900
Others only complete yourself.
Checking what's the problem was me,

174
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,360
did I change myself late?
I fall.

175
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:40,770
A lot of people feel because when they
feel they always complain about the

176
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:41,610
others.
Ah,

177
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,320
that's his fault.
That's that problem,

178
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,154
that,
that problem.

179
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,480
And only those people always check their
own problems.

180
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,810
These people survive.
These people succeed.

181
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,730
Four years for Pi,
the age,

182
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,770
18 years.
I don't think Ali Baba me complaint a

183
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:02,580
lot.
If you complain,

184
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,730
you have to have a solution.
If there's no solution for complain,

185
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,570
don't complain.
That's it.

186
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,500
So in the movie forrest Gump,
you talked about the shrimp,

187
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,250
right?
There were basically days before they

188
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:21,660
finally got that big hall of shrimp.
So forrest had to go through a lot of

189
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,350
failure before he got success.
With that,

190
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,080
you've already said the young people
that they should be able to learn more

191
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,420
from their failures rather than their
successes.

192
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,220
What do you think the types of failures
young people make that they should learn

193
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,054
the most from?

194
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Oh yeah.
Let me tell you that one day I was a

195
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,270
reading.
Yeah.

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Reading a biography of general in the
set up the Second World War

197
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,490
and I feel impressed not

198
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,580
is how much victories successful,
better that he achieved.

199
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,240
I think,
wow.

200
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,830
You know,
if I were better,

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,010
if I were John Young man at that time I
could do better.

202
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,970
But I was impressed by how many suffers,
that terrible experience that he

203
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,460
survived.
That's surprised me.

204
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,940
The grant,
the grand grandfather always tell us,

205
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,080
you know,
Jack,

206
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,660
I've been doing that much.
I made a lot of mistakes.

207
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:25,540
I still surviving as a wall that if he
say,

208
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,550
you know,
I been achieved that much and say,

209
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,100
hey,
you know,

210
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,500
if I were your age though,
at that time I could do better.

211
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,320
So people were few proud when the day
when you tell your grandson about how

212
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:43,321
much tough days you have gone through.
I think one day I share with my kids,

213
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:49,621
my grandchildren,
how much Ali Baba have gone through the

214
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,850
tough days.
The mistakes doing business.

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,530
It's just like a go to the battlefield,
the survivor wings.

216
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,770
No matter how brief you are,
your dad,

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,280
people forget or you within three days.
Yeah,

218
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,450
but if you survive,
you always have chance and go to battle.

219
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:17,451
Feud is that I experienced the soldier
know that are held to hit a himself and

220
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,270
then fight young soldiers just to go out
to fight.

221
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,040
There are a gift from the reasons for
success.

222
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,730
There are various reasons too,
for one person to be successful,

223
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,830
but there are almost the same reasons
for people who feel greedy,

224
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,910
right?
Round team round too fast with too much

225
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,150
money.
By the way,

226
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,610
you will never make big mistakes where
you don't have money,

227
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,450
but people say,
if I have the money,

228
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm going to do a big business.
No,

229
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,114
no,
no.

230
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,070
Remember that.
All the mistakes the other people made

231
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,520
you will make it
so you have to learn.

232
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,530
If you want to be successful,
learn the mistakes the other people

233
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
learn.
Learn from the mistake the other people

234
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:17,841
may not because you will avoid these
mistakes because you know how to face

235
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,820
these mistakes and troubles when these
things come

236
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,410
right.
When you serve a lot of our mistakes,

237
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,040
we see,
wow,

238
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,140
these guys coming,
these mystic come how the Jack Ma did a

239
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,640
how bill gates did it or how a Bama did
it.

240
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:35,490
You know,
when the tough day comes is it's not

241
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,520
because you can't avoid it because when
the problem comes,

242
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,120
how your face,
it was great attitude,

243
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,193
then you succeed.

244
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,903
Yeah,

245
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,350
I'm doctor are there than that.
Uh,

246
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:52,100
I think one time you also mentioned that
giving

247
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,180
up is possibly one of the biggest
failures that the other person can do.

248
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,580
But I think when it comes to the young
people,

249
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,700
oftentimes you have our crazy dreams and
we tried to seek advice from older

250
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:08,130
people or more experienced people who
sometimes tell us that's not going to

251
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:13,131
work or this is how you make it work.
How do we make it happen such that we

252
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:18,140
still continue our dreams,
but at the same time we take criticism.

253
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,680
Um,
but we don't give up because more often

254
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,870
than not,
that's what happened.

255
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,990
If you have a crazy dreams,
don't talk to her grandfather.

256
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,260
Um,
if you have a crazy dream,

257
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,330
very important is that you have to find
the people around you.

258
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,260
When,
when we invest a company,

259
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,670
I want not all looking at the founder,
I want to see the people who work with

260
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,290
the founder of whether did you believe
him.

261
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,580
If he is the only person that believe in
the dream,

262
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,490
that's very dangerous.
He's not a crazy dream is a crazy

263
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:04,870
person.
But you have to find a group of people

264
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,910
who are all believed.
They all crazy.

265
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,550
Something interesting,
right?

266
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,250
Cause it's easier to make a work person
crazy.

267
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:16,300
But if you make it the whole team crazy,
something interesting.

268
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,940
This is what I did.

269
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Early days of Alibaba,
I made a speech in America talk about

270
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:30,761
the value,
mission and management way of running an

271
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,750
internet company.
That was very early 2001,

272
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,590
two.
There is a guy in American guys sitting

273
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,280
there and say,
hey,

274
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,170
this is a crazy guy,
internet at the survivors to make profit

275
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,470
or revenue for Gabba,
Carnival Valley imaging and team

276
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,880
working.
You know this is old.

277
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,950
This is old liars.
He said,

278
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,180
you're crazy.
I say,

279
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:52,880
sir,
welcome to Ali Baba someday.

280
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,270
So he came to Ali Baba,
spend a few days.

281
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,860
The day when he left,
he said,

282
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,180
Jack,
I thought you are crazy.

283
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,430
Now I found a 100 crazy guys and your
company

284
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,070
because we believe what we are doing.
Yeah,

285
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,520
it's easiest to make you believe,
but if you can make a group of team

286
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:15,521
belief and continued to do it dancing.
So I think

287
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,680
there are,
if it's crazy or not,

288
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,820
the only testing is the idea.
If you want to make a company is sounds

289
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,800
crazy.
You're customer love it.

290
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,540
If the custom like it,
your team like it,

291
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,860
you know it's not crazy.
If the customer does not like it,

292
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,960
do not like it.
Your team don't like it,

293
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,810
forget about it.
You have to change yourself,

294
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,420
dude.
Even if you have a crease,

295
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,430
ideas don't believe you're always right.
You have to learn all the by.

296
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:53,761
By the past 18 years we have changed at
least the 18 big major changes.

297
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,710
We are not the Ali Baba last a year.
Every week,

298
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,100
every year we have different company.
Yeah.

299
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,370
Right.
So this is,

300
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,520
you have to change all the time to be
sure that we don't care about how the

301
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:12,690
other people say you're crazy.
We care about is this something really

302
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,400
different?
Really make the,

303
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,560
make the difference.
That's what we care about.

304
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,180
So a lot of the students here are young
entrepreneurs themselves and they have a

305
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:24,510
lot of crazy ideas and they wanted to
make those ideas happen.

306
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,870
Since you're the UNC,
that special advisor for young

307
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,770
entrepreneurship and small businesses,
what do you think the role of young

308
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:35,190
entrepreneurs and small businesses are
in the country and had making the

309
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,024
country grow?
True?

310
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,950
Good way of,
I do want to do it.

311
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,080
The first thing I advise give is think
about what will you give up,

312
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,280
right?
And next thing I want to give advisors

313
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,920
how many years you want to reach for
that goal.

314
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,900
A lot of people have this idea,
I want to be 16 next month or next year

315
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,650
or next two week.
Forget about,

316
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,900
there's no such opportunity in this
world that you can succeed next week.

317
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,990
There's no better opportunity that can
sit next to year cause young people,

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,480
most people like the main,
right.

319
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,880
18 years ago,
we don't have money,

320
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,650
we don't have technology,
we don't have a relationship,

321
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:18,530
we don't have any powerful person
supporting us.

322
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,940
I started my business,
18 people.

323
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:27,941
We only get the 50,000 US dollars,
18 people together in my apartment so we

324
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,940
don't have anything.
And when I started Alibaba,

325
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,480
when I started my internet business
year,

326
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,600
1995 I started with 2000 he has
daughters.

327
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,750
All of the money from my relatives and
friends.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,970
I was started.
But I know one thing people like us

329
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,600
don't have money.
Technology,

330
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,770
don't have any relationship or any
things.

331
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,980
We know we wink for the future.
I know if I,

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I started doing it 10 years later we'll
win and in the 10 years what I would

333
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,950
give up,
who our partner was,

334
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,970
what the things will be different than
me,

335
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,920
how can I live longer at instead of live
happier.

336
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,220
So the world is very interesting.
If you want to live happier,

337
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,820
you may live very shot.
If we want to live longer,

338
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:18,170
life is a bit good,
very tough.

339
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,670
You have to exercise every day,
right?

340
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,400
So this is,
this is the live balance.

341
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,070
So young people,
when you have a dream you want to do is

342
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:31,490
think about how many years you wanted to
make this thing happen.

343
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,570
If you think it's about three years,
I can be successful per pair for 10

344
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:39,020
years.
If you think I have five years to

345
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:42,770
succeed for Pepo 15 years
and they,

346
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:46,430
if you think 10 years was succeed,
Ms Succeed in eight years.

347
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,650
So you should have a long preparation
determination and these all the things

348
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,940
you have to thing about,
there is no great opportunity then make

349
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,580
you succeed next week,
next month,

350
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,900
next the year.
There is a notice this fancy great idea.

351
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,700
That's a really crazy,

352
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,433
yeah.

353
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,590
I think I speak for Mikey and everyone
here,

354
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,800
this might've been 20,
the most insight took minutes of my life

355
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,500
and our lives.
So thank you very much for sharing your

356
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:19,970
knowledge and experience with us.

357
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,470
Thank you.
Um,

358
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,530
on behalf as,
hello everyone.

359
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,410
Thank you very much.
So we'll remember that through.

360
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,120
Find out what we're willing to give up,
make sure not just Iq but he q and l q

361
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,100
as well.
And lastly,

362
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,140
never ever stopped believing in our
genes.

363
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:38,230
So thank you very much Mr Ma for your
thymine.

364
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,490
Thank you.
On behalf of the students at Delasalle.

365
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,460
Hello,
Jack.

366
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,220
Dan.
No.

367
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,410
Doctor Jack Reservoir La.
I like to think,

368
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,730
uh,
uh,

369
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,810
Doctor Jack for an insightful discussion
earlier.

370
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,440
Uh,
we were talking about a framework that

371
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,160
I've been doing with the government for
the past so many years,

372
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,490
which focuses on money.
I mean,

373
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,200
mentorship,
money and market,

374
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
the three most powerful ms in really
helping our micro and small

375
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:16,060
entrepreneurs.
And uh,

376
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,820
I invited about 50 entrepreneurs here.
Most of them from the brick and mortar

377
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:24,490
business.
A number of them are in the digital

378
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,910
economy,
three of them are quite successful and

379
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:30,070
they will share their insights and
questions with you.

380
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,790
And uh,
I think the brick and mortar are here

381
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,210
because they're scared of the changing
landscape,

382
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,800
the structure that is happening in the
way things are happening.

383
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,250
So I wanted to ask you,
uh,

384
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,080
okay.

385
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,080
During the old economy or the brick and
mortar businesses have to fear that

386
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,650
much.
What is their solution to preventing

387
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,020
themselves from disappearing?

388
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,660
Okay.

389
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,920
Yeah.
I think the,

390
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,890
uh,
the old economy should not fear,

391
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,890
but they should have it

392
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,170
change immediately.

393
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,340
The past 20 years,
Internet technology changed the world.

394
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,820
But this,
it will speed up next 30 years and every

395
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:22,620
three years,
it's just like a 30 years.

396
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,850
So if you do not stop the change,
it's going to be tough.

397
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,140
It's going to be really tough.
I'm not scaring people because I've been

398
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:41,291
doing that in China for years.
Telling people that the new business

399
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:44,660
motto.
So how it just like the older days,

400
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,870
if you using horses,
uh,

401
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:50,960
buffaloes too and the other guy use
electricity,

402
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,280
you don't have channels at all.

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If you are doing business,
do you think about idesign and I make an

404
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,170
eye cell called a,
b,

405
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:03,460
two c,
but the other guys,

406
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:07,890
because the new technology,
they become consumer to b consumer to

407
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,860
eat becomes CTB.
They become a tailor made.

408
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,520
They use using the logistic.
So there's a social justice to network.

409
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,640
They're reached the market a quicker,
faster than you are not.

410
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:22,310
Oh they using the Internet to find the
customers abroad.

411
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Cross the board.
They using data technology much cheaper.

412
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,180
You don't have chance to win.
So I think

413
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,860
please change quickly.
It's not a competitor killing you.

414
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,930
It's the future.
Kill you

415
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,180
if you kill yourself and how you can
change,

416
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,160
embrace the change.
Do not be scared about technology.

417
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,080
Technology,
I would assume today is so simple and

418
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,350
easy.
The only thing spent a time on that.

419
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,360
I think because you're an entrepreneur,
you're smart enough.

420
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,650
If you really sit down together for
three hours deep learning,

421
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,050
it would change.
A lot of people just don't like it.

422
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,680
I think.
I know the world is so deep.

423
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,170
This world is so difficult to change a
successful people.

424
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,430
That's what people have a millions of
ways to tell you.

425
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,430
I succeed yesterday.
So you guys again,

426
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,810
so let,
let us love from young people

427
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,580
today.
Technology,

428
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,510
Internet technology as so simple,
so easy.

429
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,270
And most of the Internet companies like
us,

430
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,840
we give them free technology,
free services.

431
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,740
Why not try free young people?
Because we try free to succeed.

432
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,750
So I would say don't be scared.
Don't be feared.

433
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:57,170
Fear just to go ahead.
If you don't use it,

434
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,830
it's just like last century.
You refuse to use electricity.

435
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,260
It's going to be dangerous.
And by the way,

436
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,060
it only takes about first to three
years.

437
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,740
You are totally different.

438
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,500
We talked about the three M's.
One of the three M's was mentorship.

439
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,180
Lasalle is a great school,
a great one to preschool.

440
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,650
I still have to get my diploma.
I started in Lasalle,

441
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,710
but I still should finish one more
subject.

442
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,850
That's the identity off of things and I
agree with Dr [inaudible] because uh,

443
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,990
you need the cue more than Iq in a
sense.

444
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,710
All my life,
my passion is to help many of our micro

445
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,340
entrepreneurs.
We discussed the Labor of poverty.

446
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:52,341
Here is the cost for our drug problem
and for us to enable our small

447
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:58,120
entrepreneurs.
Many of them are survival entrepreneurs

448
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,140
to lift up from poverty,
we have to create the next part of the

449
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,360
PMS,
which is the money side and the

450
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,440
marketplace.
What are you views to enable these

451
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:15,420
people to cross and be able to access
the money in the market?

452
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,380
Yeah,
I think first small business must,

453
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,740
must have big dreams and big companies
should have small steps.

454
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,600
Big Company always think a big,
you will fall down.

455
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,440
They companies should have small steps
every week,

456
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,820
every day,
every year.

457
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,700
I must have reached this small but small
dreams.

458
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,320
Small companies,
you have big dreams.

459
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I now today serve 20 customers.
How can I serve 200 customers in two

460
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,400
years?
How can a sub 2000 customers,

461
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,300
what are the ways that I can serve 2000
customers?

462
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,660
How can I make this 10 customers who
using my services that'd be happier,

463
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,610
healthier and continued to be,
we tried to make every customer of my

464
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:13,611
company to be the advertisers or
salespeople for a company because in

465
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:18,150
this way you have to making sure your,
your product's good,

466
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,823
but

467
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,340
the government should build up the
infrastructure of commerce.

468
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,270
What is the infrastructure of commerce
is at the mentorship?

469
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,300
We should have a lot of,
uh,

470
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,010
business schools,
not necessarily mbs.

471
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,940
I'm not a particular fan of the
traditional Mba.

472
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,600
The Mba,
they make people sometime very stupid

473
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,550
because business is,
you have to be flexible.

474
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,840
You have to change yourself.
To me,

475
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,310
no,
it's not.

476
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,900
It's not.
Everything can be standard,

477
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,980
right?
So

478
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,090
whipped the mentorships and we also have
the money reaching,

479
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,380
market reaching.
And also I think the technology region.

480
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,280
So what we call is that this country,
I cannot see,

481
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:15,790
I know a lot about the Philippines,
but when I see over 100 million people,

482
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,980
99% of the business of this country as
small,

483
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,730
medium size companies,
we should do it up.

484
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:28,210
The infrastructure of supporting small
business,

485
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,570
making sure that every small business
are able to reach the money and today

486
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,670
it's impossible to let the big banks to
do it.

487
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,550
We should have used a new technology to
do it,

488
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,840
which I call inclusive financing,
can be down by Internet technology.

489
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,110
Today,
Ali Baba in China,

490
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,190
Ali pay,
we serve more than half billion people,

491
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,310
young people in China using mobile phone
payment.

492
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,650
We don't have so many credit card
system,

493
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,600
crack hard China,
but people say,

494
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
Jack,
you know it's impossible.

495
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,640
Do the payment in China in the past 15
years,

496
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,620
people keep on,
criticize us.

497
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,170
Say,
how can you do payment online?

498
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,400
You don't have a check.
You'd have a credit card system.

499
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,370
You'd have a credit system.
You don't have enough banks.

500
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,870
How can you do greg?
Because we don't have the check because

501
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:24,871
we'd have the credit card system.
We make the most of the vast payment

502
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:30,350
system in the wall.
So Philip Pink,

503
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,420
I think you have the opportunity to make
the woe,

504
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,254
the best

505
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,300
texting or Fintech in the wall because
you have so many mobile phones.

506
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,540
You have set more than 7,000 islands.
It's possible for banks to have offices

507
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:51,611
in [inaudible] covering everywhere,
but mobile phone coverage everywhere.

508
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,600
We shouldn't make the pink a cashless
society when you have a cashless

509
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,660
society.
Everybody wished my wig Casio said that.

510
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:02,870
No,
no corruption and lives easier.

511
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,230
Totally agree.
We have basically two telco guys here

512
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,520
are in a school globe.
Eric Alberto smart and plap blamed them

513
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:14,660
for the slow Internet.

514
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,923
No.

515
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,040
Honestly,
honestly,

516
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,050
it's unfair to blame anybody.
Let me see this.

517
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,770
Where's the opportunity?
Opportunity exists.

518
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,140
The errors.
Most people complain

519
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,700
if you can solve the complaint,
you have the chance where we started the

520
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,870
Ali Baba,
the speed of Internet in China was

521
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,620
terrible.
Much worse than today's Philippine.

522
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,120
Oh,
much worse

523
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,460
at that time knowing even three g.
But that's not an excuse for mobile

524
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,750
phone companies too.

525
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,233
Hello.

526
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,880
Slow speed has slowed the services
faster.

527
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:17,380
Speed has fastest speed services,
but it's a great opportunity for,

528
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,360
for the telecommunication companies to
this investment guarantee.

529
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,930
You will get the written back.

530
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,790
They're going into the four g now.
So that's going to speed up the

531
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:28,624
Internet.

532
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,850
I think it's,
this is,

533
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,910
this is the opportunity for everybody.
If the four g five g's continue to,

534
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,250
it's going to the country.
Good.

535
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,620
Make everybody good.
And finally we'll be good

536
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,780
before we go to the students to ask
questions.

537
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,820
I wanted to just call to a successful
techman years Robbie Antonio.

538
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,511
Uh,
briefly.

539
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:54,370
Can you ask Jack Time question.

540
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,110
Hello morning.
Mr Ma.

541
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,160
Um,
the smartest people in the world seems

542
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:06,780
to be very divided in the issue of
blockchain technology.

543
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,020
Uh,
what is your current stance towards

544
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,060
this?
I seem to have research that you're

545
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:15,510
predisposed toward it.
And how does that conflict with the

546
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:20,490
overarching goal of China batting at the
exchange and the technology?

547
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,503
Right.

548
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,010
Say that again.
Blockchain,

549
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,320
the blockchain and bitcoins.
Okay.

550
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,590
Okay.
Bitcoins,

551
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,320
right?
Well I'm,

552
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:35,310
I'm,
I'm a believe there of the blockchain

553
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:38,820
technology
and uh,

554
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,020
we have a specific a team in the
company,

555
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:48,000
Ali and to financing focus on
researching on that because we are

556
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:52,710
believer of globalization.
We are believer of free trade in the

557
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:54,900
future.
The global trade,

558
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,880
global business,
globalization,

559
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,980
there are a lot of money transferring
what is the safe straight away,

560
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,700
what is the most efficient away that to
do that.

561
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,700
So we put a lot of efforts on that.
So I wouldn't say,

562
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,810
let me see this about technology and
otherwise

563
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,500
competent like us.
We should not the wing our market by

564
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:23,811
advertising dollars,
we should win our market by innovation.

565
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,730
Alibaba should not get our profit from
the size of the business.

566
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,620
We should get our profit from the
technology that will be invested in

567
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:38,220
side.
We invested in heavily nine years ago

568
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:42,750
studying,
I'll clock computing a big datas now for

569
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:47,751
financing.
We invested heavily on blockchain but

570
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,170
bit coin of this.
I'm not big fan of that yet.

571
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,880
Let me say this.
Um,

572
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,070
company like us,
I think last century,

573
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,700
if you have a technology,
you want to keep it to yourself

574
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,140
today in 21st century,
if you have a technology,

575
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,400
the only way to make you powerful is
enabled others.

576
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,710
Even in there we are competitors.
So we,

577
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,830
Ali Baba was spent
millions of dollars on technology and

578
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:32,130
when we spend the money on the
technology will making sure this

579
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:37,131
technology is inclusive to the others.
So block chain technology is the big

580
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:42,330
investment that we invest in all that,
but we SSA,

581
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,490
we also would love to partner with
others.

582
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,120
Others.
Got It.

583
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,730
Okay.
Um,

584
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,330
Robbie basically raised the money on his
company called revolution.

585
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,940
He,
this is the first Filipino company who

586
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,870
validated 1 billion US dollar.
So congratulations to this guy.

587
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,540
Thank you.
I have another very successful tech

588
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,840
[inaudible] surpass next.
Can you ask your question quickly?

589
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,511
Hi,
good morning,

590
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,344
Joe.
Morning.

591
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,940
Uh,
my question is around the ead WTP,

592
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,110
a initiative that Alibaba has taken a,
what are the implications of this for

593
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:25,000
Southeast Asia?
And I guess more importantly,

594
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,830
uh,
for traditional businesses and

595
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:31,831
retailers,
how should they view the ewt tp knowing

596
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:36,070
that it can be very disruptive to their
current business models?

597
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,590
Thank you so,
so much for this question,

598
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,870
but you'd governor tpe stands for
electronic world trade platform.

599
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,740
A lot of people don't like
globalization.

600
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,920
I think globalization did a fantastic
job in the past 30 years.

601
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,090
They pump up the global trade,
but it's a growing pain.

602
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,370
It's a stew,
a baby only 30 years old.

603
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,930
The thing,
the problem is that it benefit 20% of

604
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,490
the developer.
The countries,

605
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,770
80% of developing countries don't have
Charles Young people don't have chance.

606
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,940
The globalization,
the of 30 years was control.

607
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:21,941
The by 60,000 big companies we think
should at least the 16 million or 30

608
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,300
minutes or 60 minutes.
Small Business.

609
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,890
Young people should be able to sell
small business like anybody sitting here

610
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:36,891
intrepreneurs Philip Pink.
Think about how you can sell your small

611
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:40,410
business here,
can sell products to China,

612
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,460
to career,
to Europe as well as your service is

613
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:45,630
good products.
Good.

614
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,020
You should be able to compete with any
big companies.

615
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,640
This is my belief.
So he,

616
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:56,641
WTP is tried to boot up a platform,
not organization.

617
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I feel sorry for WTO where you put 200
government and ministers in their one

618
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:06,850
room to agree on something impossible,
right?

619
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,260
But if we put the 2000 business people
in a one room,

620
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,730
we can't agree on something.
The only thing do we want to do

621
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:17,640
business.
So He WTP,

622
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,690
we work with WTO is this is the two
tarts,

623
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:25,590
zero version of WTO supporting small
business,

624
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,800
young people that we encouraging every
government to set free trade or zoos or

625
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,620
small business.
There are so many of free trade zones,

626
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,220
any country,
but all of these free traders,

627
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,680
those are designed for big companies or
small business.

628
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,040
If you want to sell things outside the
country,

629
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,930
the government would never give you 24
hours customed to careers.

630
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,240
Big Company can,
you cannot.

631
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,920
So we want the beauty of a process,
a platform,

632
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,680
our way of doing business.
Then every small business you can global

633
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,500
sell,
global buy,

634
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,620
global pay,
global delivery and global travel.

635
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,840
And you can have a marketplaces online
and this is what we believe.

636
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,270
I,
we come here,

637
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,770
Ali Baba,
come here to,

638
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,980
to Philippine.
Last night I arrived like at 10 o'clock

639
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,460
we had a meeting then us,
we had the meter until later.

640
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:32,461
12 or two hours discussing how we can
build up the infrastructure of doing

641
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:37,150
business in Philippine,
the payment system,

642
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,630
the marketplace system,
the logistic system.

643
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,560
When we build up that,
the purpose is to making sure these

644
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,390
small business can sell their things to
China to do the other part,

645
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,450
to do militia.
Now the ewt be the first project we

646
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:59,551
launched is in Malaysia and we hope that
every country in South East Asia can

647
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:06,310
join the EDA blue tp.
Every country have a free trader Zos for

648
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:10,360
small business entrepreneurs,
they're a marketplace rich.

649
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,630
There are money reached logistic rich
mentorship training rich and Iq rich so

650
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:20,350
they can do business.
This is what I want anywhere in the

651
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,500
world.
Any young people in any country,

652
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,510
open a mobile phone.
You can order products from everywhere

653
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,800
in the wall and then get a product
within 72 hours.

654
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,840
And this is the goal that we want rich
in 20 years.

655
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
And ewg for today.
The first the sample we're testing a

656
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,760
militia.
Very good.

657
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,540
So far so very good.
So when we have that model where we're

658
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,280
bringing to Asia,
any countries,

659
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,270
if we are interested in

660
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,370
thank you.
And the last us should from a Mr

661
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,840
Lavista,
uh,

662
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,910
the youngest entrepreneur we have here.
Uh,

663
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,510
he uh,
he dreamed up putting in solar panels in

664
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:03,080
everybody's rooftop.
And how old are you?

665
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,150
2024,
24,

666
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,200
just 24 years old.
And he's a finish my university of 24.

667
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,610
Go ahead.
It's like your mission serta use

668
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:16,700
technology to uplift developing
countries is so inspiring.

669
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,960
And apart from the slowest Internet,
the Philippines also has the most

670
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,200
expensive electricity,
the worst traffic and many other worsts.

671
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,300
So I'd like to ask,
what are your other ideas apart from

672
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:33,620
ecommerce and Fintech,
the solve developing world problems in

673
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,280
energy

674
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,120
infrastructure and agriculture to end
poverty in the developing world.

675
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,010
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

676
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,740
Well that is this say this.
People consider Ali Baba is that you

677
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:50,330
commerce company first.
We're not economists company.

678
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,110
We are ecommerce enabler.
We do not a buy and a sell ourself.

679
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,780
This is the first well different from
Amazon.

680
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,090
Amazon,
they buy their self,

681
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,170
their ecommerce.
We make,

682
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,190
we help other company to be ecommerce.
Second,

683
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,060
ecommerce is less than 20% of our
business,

684
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,970
so I'll leave up a listing listed in New
York state stocks.

685
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,420
That's the only 20% of our business.
We ask ourselves one thing

686
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,090
18 years ago in my apartment.
Our dream is to survive.

687
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,730
Our dream is to making sure Alibaba will
survive and be us the business.

688
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,750
And today we have six close to 60,000
employees.

689
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,040
We have so much cash.
We have the greatest technology of the

690
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,520
Internet,
ecommerce,

691
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,870
we have all the results that we have,
what we want our,

692
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,010
we want to make more money.

693
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,690
We think we should have be the aging of
innovation of the world of this century.

694
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,490
We should be a company of the century,
not company of China,

695
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,320
of company of hung tool,
which are using all the resources,

696
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,440
Datas,
people.

697
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:17,300
We have to enable the,
if you want to be sent company of the

698
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,040
century,
you have to make different.

699
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,840
So we think we want to built up using
this resources.

700
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:28,760
We have to build up the infrastructure
that every young people,

701
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,210
every small business,
every woman can leverage this

702
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:35,480
technology,
this technology infrastructure to do

703
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:39,980
business to culture.
So this is our dream and this is our few

704
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:44,240
more excited about our revenue,
income or profit income.

705
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,700
Although we have revenue growth,
profit,

706
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,210
we love the things we care about.
The job creations were care about the

707
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:55,310
efficiency of people doing we care
about.

708
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:58,430
Young people have opportunities.
We care about women leaderships.

709
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,910
These things would care about.
But if you really ask us what we would

710
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:03,620
do for sustainable growth,
growth,

711
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,920
what's the meaning of life is happy and
healthy.

712
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:14,921
We think after Internet we should make
them people that be happy,

713
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,290
be healthy,
so happy and healthy industries.

714
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,120
Uh,
something that we want to do.

715
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,110
If you want to be healthier,
healthy food,

716
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,380
healthy environment,
healthy water,

717
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,420
healthy air.
If you want to be happier,

718
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,700
you should have the belief you have the
valley,

719
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,830
you have the dreams.
I don't want to make this our company

720
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,340
become a company,
a machine of making money

721
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,140
and this is how we do it and I to
sustainable growth is that where you are

722
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:55,940
healthy and happier you can be,
you can be sustainable and if you want

723
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:57,680
to be healthy,
environment,

724
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,970
water,
food and psychological,

725
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:04,100
you'll be how it should have a belief.
Religion,

726
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,600
culture and education.
These are the things that using

727
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:10,790
technology,
if we can empower these things,

728
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,120
we are the company that are few proud
for working day and night that it worth

729
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:18,660
it.
Otherwise it does not make any sense or

730
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,810
making more money.
Why can't I spend a lot of money?

731
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,420
This is a tie up I've given by,
you know,

732
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,150
I don't,
I don't dress like a,

733
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,370
I don't wear watches.
No rings,

734
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:29,300
no.
That place,

735
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:32,650
I think you know how much money can
speak and only asleep.

736
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,670
One bad.
You can only eat a suite dinners.

737
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,410
It's so that's the meaning of life.
And this is what we want to do.

738
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,900
We have a couple of questions from
students.

739
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,993
Are you ready?

740
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,410
Where are you guys?
Uh,

741
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,480
ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah.

742
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,110
So our esteemed guests,
doctor,

743
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:52,300
mine has been most kinds.
We agreed to answer some questions for

744
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,390
students so far.
The students,

745
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:58,380
please introduce yourself and tell us
your year and major are before you ask

746
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,214
your questions.

747
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,470
Okay,
next students.

748
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,663
Hi

749
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,460
Jack Ma.
Um,

750
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,080
I'm a third year industrial engineering
student.

751
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,360
Oh,
my question is,

752
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,630
what would you consider to be your
biggest failure in life and what did you

753
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:21,770
learn from this experience that you can
share to us students?

754
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,480
Thank you.
Ah,

755
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,760
the,
my biggest mistake that I don't want to

756
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:39,550
make is the date when I retired,
the company collapse,

757
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,873
right?

758
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,400
This is what I don't want to see.
Because everybody was sick.

759
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,610
Everybody would get out.
Everybody would die.

760
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,860
We'd been working hard for 18 years at
this company while the loss a hundred,

761
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:58,920
two years.
So we will never see Ali.

762
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,070
Ali Baba is successful because we only
15,

763
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,140
18 years there,
84 years to go.

764
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,080
In the last,
next 80 84 years,

765
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,160
we may have a hundred times or maybe one
minute chaz would disappear.

766
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:19,310
So my job as his fantasy you,
how can I keep this company growing when

767
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:23,430
I retire,
when I leave this company is to continue

768
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:25,590
to grow.
This is why I don't want,

769
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,020
when I'm 80 years old,
70 years old,

770
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:33,021
I'm sitting still the company I bought,
I should die on the beaches in the

771
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:38,800
Philip Ping or mopping,
not in the my office cause you don't

772
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,410
want to see an older guy said to 18
years so stupid.

773
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,870
The chairman,
that one work.

774
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,560
So every day I'm thinking about is what
if I leave the company,

775
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,800
the company can continue to grow and if
I cannot make that thing happen,

776
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,240
this is the miss [inaudible] mistake
that I would make.

777
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,990
And there are a lot of mistakes I do is
that I can share a lot of ideas the day

778
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,470
when I retire.
If I,

779
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,050
if I'm a good at the writing,
I would write a Alibaba 1000 where

780
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:17,260
mistakes,
any mistakes or for example,

781
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,390
when you have a,
when you raise money,

782
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,050
a lot of people when the risk man,
the first thing they will,

783
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,830
they will looking for a fancy office
building

784
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,890
and decorate and wonderful and stat high
greet people,

785
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,340
especially high people from
multinationals.

786
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,650
That's a big mistake I've made when I,
when I have the first of five minute

787
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:45,340
Usda our foundation,
I started to hire people who used to

788
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,130
work in the vice president of big
companies,

789
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,420
but when they came the destroyed us
because when you are attracted,

790
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,460
you Bolo a Boeing seven four seven
engine putting side,

791
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,380
they're going to destroy your tractor.
You should not find the best of people.

792
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,310
You should find right people and working
them,

793
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,030
develop them,
make your team the best of people.

794
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,860
There's no best people in the market.
The best people is always your own

795
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:18,280
company.
That's the mystique alert and I want to

796
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:20,260
share with you.
Thank you.

797
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,583
Okay.

798
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,590
Hello.
Good morning.

799
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,670
My name is [inaudible].
I'm a third year entrepreneurship

800
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,320
student.
Firstly,

801
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:39,370
welcome to our university and thank you
for visiting us.

802
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,300
My question is,
based on your experiences,

803
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,590
what are the friendships that enjoyed
time and the ups and downs in life?

804
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,270
My question,
my question is based on your

805
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:58,200
experiences,
what are the friendships that enjoy time

806
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,880
and the ups and downs in life?

807
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,960
Friendships,
the friendships,

808
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:05,794
right?

809
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,570
Well,
um,

810
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,790
I think the thing that would make me
goals for all the top days,

811
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:15,720
other friendships.

812
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,183
MMM.

813
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,650
The,
let me say it this way.

814
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:26,420
I don't invite any of my friends joined
my company from the first day.

815
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,250
But when they join my company,
I make friends with them.

816
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,860
This is the advisor give you,
don't invite your best friend to form a

817
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,860
company with you.
Dumb.

818
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,730
Totally done.
I see so many tragedies.

819
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,560
They're up cases and me succeed.
But most possibly you will fail.

820
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,010
It's better to make friends when they
join the company,

821
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,550
treat them.
But when the companies that bid,

822
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,620
you cannot make friends who,
anybody.

823
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,780
We can make colleague friends.
So friends means when I'm in trouble,

824
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,220
I talked about,
I talked to my I,

825
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,170
to my friend,
uh,

826
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:15,460
by colleagues,
troubles even to today.

827
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,120
Only days,
whatever problems I have the company

828
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:20,110
have,
I'd tell them,

829
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:20,790
oh,
frat,

830
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,480
trust them.
Right?

831
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:23,800
What's the Raul?
We don't,

832
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:25,840
we are,
we're going to run out of money in two

833
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:27,130
weeks.
So when you got to do,

834
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:34,380
don't shock them by problems.
So friendship things based on trust.

835
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:44,100
My team trusted me and I trust them.
I know my team can do better than I than

836
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:48,100
I am.
And I know they can survive.

837
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,540
They will when they're in trouble.
I spent time with them when I'm in

838
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,810
trouble,
I found many of my friends came to talk

839
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,210
to me.
They hot help to me.

840
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,910
Yeah.
Friendship.

841
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,720
Well,
the difference between,

842
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,760
let me tell you this,
business is about a friendship of

843
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,613
beauty.

844
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,043
Okay?

845
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,210
Friendship is about trust building.
Well,

846
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,800
you don't have friends.
You don't have the business.

847
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,080
We don't have trust.
You don't have friends.

848
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,910
That's all the thing.
Very simple.

849
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,200
Thank you.
Thank you.

850
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:24,220
Thank you very much.
Next.

851
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,753
Okay,

852
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,710
so hello doctor Jah.
A good day.

853
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,880
I'm g o n I am a third year psychology
majors through it then.

854
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,190
So,
and here's my question.

855
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,130
So the trend today is that there are
many young people who do things

856
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:52,310
simultaneously.
So there are,

857
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,290
they have their full time jobs while
doing their studies or doing part time

858
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:58,240
work.
Well,

859
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:03,250
there are others who also wanted to
pursue their plants or passion in doing

860
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:08,621
business and open up their businesses.
So in the perspective of prior

861
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:12,140
authorization,
what advice can you give to these young

862
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:15,950
people who wanted to pursue their dream
of doing business while doing these

863
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:17,000
other tasks?

864
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:19,843
Okay,

865
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,800
say that again.
Make it simple.

866
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,130
Okay.
So given that the

867
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
young people of the day have a lot of
things that they really wanted to do a,

868
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:34,590
what advice can you give to the young
people of the day?

869
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,460
Uh,
in terms of prioritization,

870
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:42,140
what advice can you give to them?
All right,

871
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,240
that's good.
Uh,

872
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,720
first let me say a young people have a
lot of things to do.

873
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:50,570
He wants to do a lot of things,
is better than the young people.

874
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:54,560
Was that anything he wanted to do?
Lots of things.

875
00:53:54,561 --> 00:53:57,590
You want to do.
At least you have hope.

876
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:04,030
I like these kinds of people,
but you have to focus on the things and

877
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:07,790
how to folks.
What's the priority my way if not,

878
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:12,290
maybe not correct.
You have to pick up the things that you

879
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,350
are really passionate about.
You love to do it where you do business.

880
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,210
You have to do things,
you believe in,

881
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,620
you love to do it.

882
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,750
If you're not like it,
you don't like it.

883
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,780
You cannot sustain.
So you love it or you have a passion

884
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:31,610
about it.
This is my priority.

885
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,690
Do not pick up the thing that is
important or your father said it's

886
00:54:35,691 --> 00:54:36,980
important.
You don't think so.

887
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,140
They're could go nowhere.
So Pi r e t to me is where you are tiny.

888
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,830
Pick up the things you,
oh you love,

889
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,080
you're good at,
you know that I can last long.

890
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,820
Don't pick up things that is a big,
that will never lost law and the other

891
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:00,890
people think is big.
So this is something that I,

892
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:05,891
that that was m and a by the way,
the pirate ret of your choice of doing

893
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,480
whether study or work at the same
learning way you do the business you

894
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:21,710
learn from the business way is school.
You have to put the all the knowledge

895
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:26,140
into practice.
I a lot of people wonder Rizza uh,

896
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,250
we'll,
we'll leave the school or was that a

897
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:31,700
getting a degree and then go to go to do
business,

898
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:34,970
be an entrepreneur.
They say Bill Gates succeed.

899
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,460
He did not finish a school in Harvard.
There is only one bill gates.

900
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,100
Don't do that right today it's much
easier.

901
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,010
Your school in the daytime,
in the evening,

902
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,240
open a shop online and buy it herself.
That alert is a great experience.

903
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,010
All join the students units support the
people all work in the part on the

904
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:03,010
weekend supported this entrepreneur
school companies be a uh,

905
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,191
a,
you know,

906
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:06,800
a person their work in a weekend.
You learn.

907
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,020
So,
sorry,

908
00:56:09,021 --> 00:56:12,290
I speak a lot today cause I don't think
we can speak every year,

909
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,630
but I,
I want us to tell something that is

910
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:18,350
helpful.
When you are 20 to 30 years old,

911
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:24,310
please find a good boss.
A good boss is better than a good

912
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:27,400
company.
A good boss would discipline you,

913
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:30,250
train you,
develop you where you have 30 to 40

914
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:33,340
years old,
tried to do something.

915
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:35,200
If you really want to do something
yourself,

916
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:40,260
try to do it from 30 to 40 when you're
40 to 50 years old to something you are

917
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:44,350
good at.
Don't do something you don't know

918
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:47,890
anything about.
But when you're 50 to 60 years old,

919
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,300
focusing on helping young people are
your six over 60 years old.

920
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,040
Spent time with the grandchildren.
80%,

921
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,360
right?
Not Everybody,

922
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,760
but most people doing that.
Jack,

923
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,770
uh,
there's an intermediary here.

924
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,760
Um,
yeah,

925
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,990
a woman into been near a serial
entrepreneur.

926
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,530
Her name is Molly [inaudible],
my ela.

927
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,880
You had a question for Jack.

928
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,313
Okay.

929
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:22,040
Is there a mic,
microphone and after this,

930
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,960
so we have two questions left for the
students,

931
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:25,010
so please prepare.

932
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,130
I'm good.
Good morning,

933
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:27,964
doctor.
Mark.

934
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,980
Um,
your friend,

935
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,120
Masa,
son,

936
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,700
um,
histories.

937
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:37,730
Then hand is deploying $100 billion
vision fund around companies.

938
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:39,410
Uh,
uh,

939
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,230
deploying the power of ai and the
Internet of things and talks about

940
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:48,100
singularity.
I wanted to know whether you agree with

941
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,080
them,
you talk about it and what are your

942
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:52,450
thoughts around the area?

943
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,840
Okay.
On the,

944
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,880
yeah,
I think Internet of things or the future

945
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,780
and artificial intelligence is,
is,

946
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,530
is such a hot topic.
Um,

947
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,110
this is something different from the
American way of artificial.

948
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,440
I don't think artificial intelligence is
a great,

949
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,000
is a good word.
Proper would.

950
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,210
I believe it's called a machine
intelligence.

951
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,180
I don't,
I think human being have wisdoms.

952
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,440
Machine have intelligence,
an animal have instinct.

953
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,120
Today the artificial intelligence is
tried to make machine think like a

954
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:39,790
people.
Human Beings,

955
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,060
human beings only know 80% of their
brains.

956
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,860
And how can you make machine to learn
from the 80%

957
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:54,850
and folk sample when we've judged people
using human eyes would take a pictures

958
00:58:56,321 --> 00:59:01,321
when we analyze why machine should he
take the picture and the legs that human

959
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,960
being machine should have as a machine
ways.

960
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,430
So I think today,
artificial intelligence in the western

961
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,160
is it?
Yes,

962
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,140
it's good to record but the wrong way.
And Ali Baba focus on machine

963
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:20,290
intelligence.
Machine should have do things that human

964
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:24,650
being cannot.
Well machine should learn like a human

965
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:27,980
beings are machine will never be able to
think like human beings.

966
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,010
Human beings have the belief had the
religion had the valley,

967
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,090
but she may not have.

968
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,000
So what I want to say is that all the
university,

969
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,860
especially primary school king,
the schools,

970
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:44,420
we have to be very careful the way we
teach to our kids today,

971
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,360
we'll meet,
make our kids so to use later,

972
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,510
cannot find the jobs
because machine are much smarter than

973
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:56,090
human beings.
They can calculate a faster renetta

974
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:59,240
faster.
So if we teach our kids the way we

975
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:04,241
taught in the past 100 years,
our kids were not find the jobs the next

976
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:08,570
30 years because machine would take a
lot of jobs up us.

977
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,120
What other things the machine can never
do.

978
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,870
This is something that education system,
every country should pay attention to

979
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:18,050
that though.
This is what am I view about artificial

980
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:21,410
intelligence.
And because of the date of the college,

981
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:25,610
everything,
most of the Internet of the things is

982
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:27,910
going to be meeting Internet.
Everything will be connected.

983
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,763
Internet.

984
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:30,883
And could you hear,
I'm sorry,

985
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:33,270
we only have one.
I'm sorry,

986
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:35,530
one question,
one final question from the students

987
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,100
then.
Okay.

988
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,940
And this will be the last question.
I'm sorry we don't have much time so

989
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,620
thank you.
So,

990
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,870
hi doctor Ma.
I'm Jonathan Iran,

991
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,590
third year industrial engineering from
the Gokongwei College of Engineering.

992
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,250
So my question is,
what is the one global issue that you

993
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,290
are personally passionate in solving?

994
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,493
Hmm,

995
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,740
yeah,
the global is sued that the Carson the

996
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,650
made a lot.
But I think,

997
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,370
um,
as I say,

998
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,930
sustainable growth that every young
people should have opportunities.

999
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,920
And how can we have the young people opt
to have opportunities?

1000
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,810
We should enable them

1001
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,230
by technology and we should change the
education system,

1002
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:29,290
improve the education system.
This is something worry to me if we chit

1003
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,680
do anything to control or improve the
environment.

1004
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,280
But the way we teach kids,
young people are the same way we taught

1005
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,610
in industrial time.
You'll go nowhere.

1006
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,240
So the thing I can send the most is
about education.

1007
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,320
We are okay now if we do not know enough
knowledge about what costs the

1008
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:55,370
environment problem,
what caused the ink.

1009
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,760
Now inclusive problems.
So these are the things that we teach

1010
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,860
our kids,
the education systems.

1011
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,340
That is z pie articles.
I was trained to be a high school

1012
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:11,120
teacher.
I think a good education system.

1013
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,530
Final level.
I'm the thank you.

1014
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:19,680
I'm very honored to be given the
doctorate degree

1015
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,683
that

1016
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,070
I was considered to be a bad student.
Primary School.

1017
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,660
I never passed examination for key
primary school.

1018
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,600
Never God,
good middle school.

1019
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:39,210
Never got ice spetters.
I try to three years for entitling our

1020
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:43,980
university handjob and never be the top
10 students of my class.

1021
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,750
Okay.

1022
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:50,220
Traditional way of education.
I was considered to be a failure,

1023
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,530
a loser,
but the way we do so what other things?

1024
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:57,030
Something that we can do

1025
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:00,463
for the future.

1026
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,650
This is something that I'm thinking a
lot about,

1027
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:06,980
that this is something consider me when
we have a good education system.

1028
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,390
When we change our kids better,
our kids would not make the mistakes

1029
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,570
that our ancestors and our generation
has made.

1030
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,230
This is something that I can serve.
I want to really want to put efforts on

1031
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:20,390
that.
Thank you very much,

1032
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:21,224
Mr John.

1033
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:31,120
Yeah.
