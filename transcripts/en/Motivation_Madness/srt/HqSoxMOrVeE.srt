1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,410
Maybe the thing you're most scared of is
exactly what you do.

2
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:06,220
Love what I do still have passion for
whatever it was.

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,330
I just tried to down there.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,700
What'd you just say your name and tell
me what you do.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,110
Uh,
I'm Chris Evans.

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm an actor.
If you could give yourself advice,

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,860
like look back and,
and,

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,330
and talk to the 12 year old version of
yourself.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,930
Yeah.
What advice would you give?

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,940
I'd say the sounds in my inmate might
seem okay oversimplified,

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,980
but it's profound.
I,

12
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,981
I'd say,
but a big thing for me,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,810
you know,
it's so funny how noisy my brain is.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,000
Everyone's praying,
it's noisy,

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,160
it's what it does,
it makes thoughts.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,260
And the problem is,
I think in most of our lives of root of

17
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,650
suffering is following that brain noise
and listening to that brain noise and

18
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,290
actually identifying with it as if it's
who you are.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,840
That's just the noise your brain makes,
you know?

20
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,580
And,
and more often than not,

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,070
it probably doesn't have much to say.
It's going to help you.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,193
Mm.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,380
For Captain America,
I read that you turned down the role a

24
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,850
number of times.
Can you just explain why it was because

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,040
it was a big commitment.
They wanted six movies and you know,

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,230
normally you do movies one at a time and
if one of those movies hits and his

27
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:20,400
success in your life noticeably changes,
you know,

28
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,930
your personal life,
your anonymity,

29
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:26,820
privacy is affected.
You have the opportunity to stop and

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,160
regroup and go home and just,
you know,

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,190
make a decision from then on how you
want to proceed with your life.

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,380
Worry was if this movie hits and there
is a lifestyle change and I don't react

33
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,690
well to it,
I don't have an opportunity,

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,030
the luxury to say,
you know,

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,851
guys,
I'm good.

36
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,300
I think I'm going to go back to doing
indies or maybe something else.

37
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,710
You know,
maybe in a couple of years I don't want

38
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,150
to act anymore.
I Dunno.

39
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,440
It's just six movies can be spread over
10 years and making a decision for a

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,270
decade and it's not just a decision for
you,

41
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,430
it's a lifestyle changes to a point
where your anonymity is compromised,

42
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,960
then it's really not your right to
complain anymore.

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,050
So if all of a sudden somebody in your
family ends up in a hospital and you're

44
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,120
going in and out and every day and
someone taking pictures of you,

45
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:08,830
when you complain,
everyone's going to say,

46
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,660
too bad you made this bed sleeping in
it.

47
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,190
And that's a shame and that's a decision
you have to make,

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,110
prepare for it.
This isn't,

49
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,380
this ripple effect isn't just going to
be about me.

50
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,390
And that's scary,
you know,

51
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:19,961
and you think,
well,

52
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,080
is there another way to get where I want
to get without this?

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,030
You know what I mean?
If you go with the strings attached or

54
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:29,410
six movies,
that's a scary loss of control that I

55
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,410
just wasn't ready to process them.
So I said no.

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,320
And uh,
I asked every human being in my life

57
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,570
what they thought and you know,
everyone said I should do the movie.

58
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,770
And um,
I did,

59
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,670
I said,
I've gone to therapy.

60
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,720
I went to therapy.
I was like,

61
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:41,554
fine,
I'll talk to,

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm a therapist.
Who would they have to say?

63
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,014
And,
you know,

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
uh,
you know,

65
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,260
cause I do struggle with,
I get anxiety about certain things and

66
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,840
press and things like that.

67
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,560
It's,
you know,

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,560
all those things were tied into marvel
responsibilities and it kind of started

69
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:56,940
to shift on me.
It's,

70
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,960
it's,
it started to feel like maybe the thing

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,730
most scared of is exactly what you
should do.

72
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,420
Maybe this is actually what you should
push yourself into.

73
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,530
And it just started to make sense to me
that way.

74
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,880
And I said,
let's go for it.

75
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,180
And uh,
you know,

76
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,210
it was a bumpy acclimation.
It was certainly a nerve wracking first

77
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,400
couple weeks of shooting as to whether
or not I made the right choice.

78
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,390
But in retrospect it certainly was,
oh my God,

79
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:24,391
can you imagine him kicking myself?
And my agent's got

80
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,140
a lifetime supply and I told you since
off that one,

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,040
the Times that I felt my best are the
moments that I've been able to pull that

82
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,030
plug and say,
Chris,

83
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,440
Shh,
Shh,

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,693
shh.

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,420
And it's not quitting.
It's not giving up.

86
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:46,040
It's not washing your hands of the
thought.

87
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,890
It's rising above it.
It's operating on a separate plane.

88
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,650
It's,
it's,

89
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,790
you can't dissect why that works because
of the reason it works doesn't speak the

90
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,610
same language that the brain speaks.
Can't try and say,

91
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,160
well why Shush?
Cause the shush is,

92
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,720
you know,
it's different,

93
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,220
it's different.
And when you just

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,671
just feels good,
you know,

95
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,990
like that's better,
that's better.

96
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,150
And I think back to all the time I've
probably spent suffering as a result of

97
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:18,520
brain noise,
hours of my life wasted.

98
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,250
So that's what I'd say.

99
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,780
Where are you from?
I'm from Boston.

100
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,210
You still consider that your home?
You said you were walking up there?

101
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,930
Yeah,
yeah.

102
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,130
I got a place back there.
I mean,

103
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:33,480
like I said,
I got nothing against that law.

104
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:38,481
I just prefer these coasts.
I'm one of six.

105
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,110
Uh,
I have three brothers and sisters,

106
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,890
the oldest sister and myself and younger
brother and younger sister.

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,880
We're really close now.
Very tight knit family.

108
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,680
We did everything together.
We're all actors,

109
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,960
so we're all very melodramatic and all
very young,

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,210
you know,
imaginative.

111
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,820
And we play a lot of games together just
in our backyard.

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,050
I had a great childhood.
I had a great youth and my family was a

113
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,240
big part of,
that's why I loved him,

114
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,250
but going home for me is kind of where I
just reconnect to that part of my mind,

115
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,940
you know?
And you just come out here for too long

116
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,330
and things that shouldn't matter.
Start mattering.

117
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:17,331
And Lisa recharge.
Initially I was really big into art,

118
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,660
drawing,
painting and art school is going to be a

119
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,940
path I was going to take.
I didn't start acting until I was about

120
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,120
maybe 1314 my older sister was doing
plays.

121
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,340
She was having a ball so you can,
I try it.

122
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,763
And it was a good time

123
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,030
because I kept doing it.
Probably had much bigger balls than I do

124
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,690
now.
Now I sit,

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,850
you know,
terrified before I additions.

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,010
I probably couldn't wait to get in the
room.

127
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,940
I mean,
I think back to some of the things I did

128
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:45,774
it,
you know,

129
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,290
acting camp and things like that.
Just the,

130
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,090
the Gusto,
the willingness.

131
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,750
God,
who led the yearbook?

132
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,400
Were you in the virtuous burglar or the
bald soprano that was in the virtue of

133
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,870
suburb.
And what role did you play?

134
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,670
I don't remember.
I mean,

135
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,990
I did a lot of plays.
I couldn't tell you that.

136
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,410
I mean,
I have nightmares about this.

137
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,940
Were you backstage?
And all of a sudden they're like,

138
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,840
all right,
we're doing the Virgin's book.

139
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,561
You get a call.
It took,

140
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,680
I don't remember my lines.
Just get out there.

141
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,670
They'll come to you and you've come out
onstage with a play you did 15 years ago

142
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,170
and you're forced.
This is,

143
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,350
this is what happens when I sleep back
in the good old days.

144
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,900
Good old days.
97 what a time.

145
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,580
Where did that change?
I mean,

146
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,310
when,
when did the anxiety starts hitting you

147
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,571
matters?
You know,

148
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:34,180
when you're like auditioning for,
you know,

149
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,220
for your work,
your career,

150
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:36,941
your life,
you know,

151
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,560
you're an adult.
It's not just fun and games.

152
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:41,080
You're actually trying to build
something and when it doesn't work out,

153
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,500
you start to kind of get,
you know,

154
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,380
so heady game acting,
you know,

155
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,000
for any movie you book,
there's probably right,

156
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,330
you know,
dozens of projections and that that can

157
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:52,840
play on you.
So you start to kind of put pressure on

158
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:53,674
yourself.
You know,

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,590
sometimes you go through stints of
having really good auditions,

160
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,420
really solid additions being like,
I'm good.

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,780
Every time I go in the room and I feel
centered and present and ready at the

162
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:02,620
times you're like,
man,

163
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:06,010
I feel like I forget how to act.
And then you're on shaky ground every

164
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,420
time you step in a room.

165
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,740
You said that there's a search to be in
the moment.

166
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,180
Does that only apply to acting?
It's everything that reality looks and

167
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:20,660
feels and smells and sounds like,
but you know it's not and,

168
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,170
and you're completely in control of that
unfolding.

169
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,070
And that's the time where I really feel
the most present.

170
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,340
And I think that's part of my addiction
to acting because I struggled to find

171
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,760
that in life.
It's a bit harder when there's no script

172
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,270
and this is just happening in a chaotic
form,

173
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,030
but the hunt for the moment,
you know,

174
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,240
the hunt to be present,
that's the goal.

175
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,300
You know what I mean?
Acting is like temporary artificial

176
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,840
substitute that it's like a drug.
It's great.

177
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,660
My goal in life is to find that to be
present like that in life.

178
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,510
It's hard.
