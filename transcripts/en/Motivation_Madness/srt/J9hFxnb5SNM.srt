1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
How do you rate yourself on a scale of
one to 10 in terms of your physical

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:10,470
appearance and turns of your hell?
Do you take care of yourself?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,800
Are you allowing yourself to get
overweight and out of shape?

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,570
Are you conscious of your health?
Are you watching the food that you take

5
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:21,510
into your body?
Do you make a deliberate effort to

6
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,240
exercise?
You know it was George Burns is that we

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,590
cannot help getting older,
but we don't have to get old and many of

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:33,240
us get old before our time because we
don't take time to take care of

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,020
ourselves.
Your environment is a very good

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,980
indicator.
On a scale of one to 10 is it what you

11
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,350
want it to be?
Do you find it desirable?

12
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:46,010
Are you satisfied the job or career that
you're involved in?

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,660
Someone said that 85% of the American
public are unhappy with their jobs.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,780
Are you spending eight hours a day just
doing time,

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,200
doing something that you don't find
challenging,

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,590
that does not make you stretch mentally,
but does not stimulate you?

17
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:03,850
That does not inspire you?
Something that you don't find a sense of

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,890
fulfillment in it.
If you're doing that day in and day out,

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,560
it has to affect how you feel about
yourself,

20
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:13,760
your level of motivation,
your relationships.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,110
What kind of impact is that having on
your life?

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,410
Is it nourishing or is it if toxic
relationship,

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,870
does it drain you or does it build you
up?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,940
Ask yourself that.
How motivated are you to do something

25
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,760
about it?
Your contribution,

26
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,940
your actions?
What are you giving?

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,000
Many people will leave the universe
without a trace.

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,740
No one will know they were here and in
fact under their name we can put under

29
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,570
there not used up.

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,120
Yeah.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,310
Well,
anybody know that you came this way?

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
What contribution are you giving?
What will you leave?

33
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,030
What will be different because you came
this way.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Someone once said that life is our gift
to us that God has given us and how we

35
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:08,220
live our lives is our gift to God.
What kind of gift are you formulating?

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,890
Is this a gift that you like to take
back and do something else before you

37
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,830
turn it in?
Think about that.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,040
What can we do?
What are some of the keys that we can

39
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:25,030
begin to use to motivate ourselves when
our battery's running low?

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,050
Because I don't care who you are.
I don't care what you do at sometime you

41
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:33,460
are going to get tired at certain time.
You're going to get in a Rut,

42
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,950
seem like nothing you do works out
right.

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,270
And sometimes it just seems like you
just don't have the wherewithal or the

44
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,200
will to do anything.
That's,

45
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,930
sometimes you act like you're punch
drunk.

46
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,270
You're just wading through life.
Just doing time,

47
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:49,330
day in and day out,
looking at nondiscriminatory television,

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,510
anything that's all just looking

49
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,343
okay

50
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,200
and depress,
feeling powerless,

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,360
feeling useless and both.
What do you do?

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,700
How do you get yourself out of a Rut?
How do you,

53
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,760
when you know you can do more of and
what you've been doing and you're not

54
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,890
doing it and you're discontent with
where you are,

55
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,560
you get angry at yourself.
How do you get out of that Rut?

56
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,590
How do you motivate yourself?
One of the things that we must do is

57
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:26,631
that we must be involved and working on
achieving self mastery.

58
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,370
You must work on yourself continuously.
Never be satisfied with yourself.

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,100
Always know that as you invest the
effort and time on you,

60
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,310
that's the greatest ability that human
beings have above animals.

61
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,440
See,
a dog can be anything but a dog.

62
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,440
Three can be anything but a tree.
Human being.

63
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:49,550
You've got unlimited potential.
You can put effort on you and by

64
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:54,440
concentrating on you and developing you,
you can transform your life wherever you

65
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:58,430
are right now.
So you want to work on yourself.

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,370
You want to read books that inspire you
and motivate you.

67
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,340
You want to listen to tapes over and
over and over again,

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,550
and I suggest that you listen to tapes.
When you first get up in the morning,

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,650
you want to control the spirit of your
day.

70
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,490
When you first wake up in the morning,
your mind is operating at 10.5 wave

71
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,840
cycles per second.

72
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,690
That's when the subconscious mind is
most impressionable.

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,270
Whatever you hear in the first 20
minutes when you wake up,

74
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,590
that will affect the spirit of your day.
When you're listening to tapes,

75
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:29,591
listen with relaxed belief,
believing that this can happen for you

76
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,430
and by listening to them,
listen to them over and over and over

77
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,360
again and you'll get a breakthrough.
You can listen to the same tape for

78
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,600
months and all of a sudden you're here.
Something you'd never heard before.

79
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,680
It have a special meaning for you or
read the same book over again and you'll

80
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,840
find some special inside.
You said,

81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,880
I can't believe I didn't see that the
first time.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,990
So you want to be involved and
developing yourself.

83
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:58,710
Most people won't do that.
Most people won't take that kind of

84
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:03,630
effort and invest that kind of energy in
themselves because they will fall prey

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,310
to that conversation within,
Oh,

86
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,630
don't do that.
You don't have time.

87
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,750
You're too busy.
You're too caught up in the rat race.

88
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,800
Most people won't do that.
What?

89
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,700
They won't take time to go to lectures.
They want to take time to go to

90
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,610
seminars.
They won't take time to go to classes to

91
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,990
improve themselves,
and as you continue to work on yourself,

92
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,660
you will begin to expand your vision of
yourself.

93
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,720
You begin to work towards self mastery.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,210
Yeah.

95
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,450
And you will begin to see it reflect
itself in all the dimensions of your

96
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:33,410
life,
your mental life,

97
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:36,260
your physical life,
your social life in your relationships,

98
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,350
your monetary life.
Concentrate on developing yourself.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,410
Okay.

100
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,810
Because if you don't,
I guarantee you that you will make a

101
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:47,790
settlement.
And most people have,

102
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,630
and most of us already have.
What kind of settlement have you made

103
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,190
with your life?
You know,

104
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,020
when we make settlements out of court
settlements,

105
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,980
you've heard them.
That means that you to take something

106
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,070
less than what you originally wanted to
get had you gone into court.

107
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,880
And the reason that you settle outside
of court is because you didn't believe

108
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,330
that you can get it.
So you made an out of court settlement.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,370
Many of us I'm making in life settlement
with settling for less than what we

110
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,430
actually deserve.
We don't feel good about it,

111
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,300
but we make it work in our minds.
We'll come up with some kind of excuse

112
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,590
to make it all right.
What kind of settlement have you made

113
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:28,070
with your life?
Many of us settle for less than what we

114
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:32,210
want out of relationships because we
don't have the courage to change them.

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,920
I had a seminar I used to do call.
Are you living together or dine

116
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:40,550
together?
Many people are just dying together.

117
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,390
Gladys Knight used to have a song that
says neither one of us want to be the

118
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,230
first to say good

119
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,123
bye.

120
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,350
The next thing is in order to begin to
find some keys to self motivation to

121
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,930
drive yourself.
In addition to working on yourself and

122
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,570
as you work on yourself,
you feel good about yourself and as you

123
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,210
feel better about yourself,
you treat yourself differently.

124
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,330
Develop a health plan so you can't feel
well and do well.

125
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,570
If you don't have good health,
you can't perform.

126
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,350
If you don't have your health,
your health is valuable.

127
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,540
Develop a health plan,
a plan that you will follow because this

128
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,380
is the only vehicle that you have to
carry you through this experience called

129
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:35,120
life and you want to take good care of
it because you love you or not.

130
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,150
You care enough about you and that's not
easy.

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,860
It is not easy.
Having a health plan and sticking to it,

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,810
but you're worth it.
Doing it again and again and again.

133
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:51,650
I have lost 22 pounds several times.

134
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,183
Yeah,

135
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,130
separate.
It's,

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,860
I'll always do it.
I love potato chips.

137
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,830
People who know me know I love m and M,
peanuts.

138
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,380
I love peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.

139
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,040
I love my mother Sweet Potato Pie.
I love this.

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,540
It's not always on my health plan,
but I put it on there sometimes.

141
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,660
I said,
life is too short to go without sweet

142
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,661
potato pie.
If I go to night,

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,070
I want you to slip on supplies and sweet
potato pie.

144
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,480
My cats get up and watch the smile.
Oh,

145
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:30,481
by phase
maximizing is as you take care of

146
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,900
yourself.
The next key is keys to motivation to

147
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:39,890
self motivation.
You want to live life with energy and

148
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:43,370
passion.
You want to make a conscious effort to

149
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,670
be lively.
See Him live.

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,490
You either saying hello or goodbye.
You either own the way or in the way

151
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,190
lead that people alone.
Some folk just walking around looking,

152
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,430
how are you doing honey?
Stay away from these people that has

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,440
gone away from them and affects you.
You want to smile,

154
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,320
you want to be happy.
You got a lot to be thankful for,

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,710
but you watch some of the faces around
you every day

156
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,150
and I tell you some of these faces,
they will put you in a depressed state

157
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:31,100
of mind,
so you want to avoid these kinds of

158
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,280
faces when you see them coming.
Turn your head.

159
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,630
Next thing is that you want to monitor
your inner conversations.

160
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,530
The things that you say to yourself.
You want to watch them and then watching

161
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,520
them.
You want to take charge.

162
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,760
Friend of mine told me this evening as
she did it excellently,

163
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,650
she said,
I didn't want to come tonight.

164
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:58,530
I was feeling so depressed and I said,
I'm going in anyhow.

165
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,010
See if that was the conversations that,
oh,

166
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:04,040
you really don't feel like it.
You really don't need to do it.

167
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,730
You don't really need to read anything.
Forget all that.

168
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:09,770
That's that inner conversation.
Oh,

169
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:12,680
you don't need to worry about trying to
go into your own business.

170
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,740
Forget that you can't do that.
What have you lose everything.

171
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:20,360
You've got that in the conversation that
stopped you from doing the things you

172
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,250
want to do less.
Don't do that.

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,670
How can you possibly think about being a
motivational speaker?

174
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,980
You don't have the contacts.
You don't have the money.

175
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,590
You don't know the right people.
You're going to get up there and your

176
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:33,380
mind's going to go blank.
Forget all that.

177
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,030
You remember that time you got up before
some people and you're panicked.

178
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,250
You stood up in your mind,
set down,

179
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,120
don't you remember?

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,310
And I said yes.
And then I said Shit Up.

181
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,300
So you got to learn to stand up to
yourself inside yourself and short

182
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:56,900
circuit override that conversation.
That's always going on.

183
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,130
85% of what that conversation will tell
you is negative.

184
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,110
It's negative.
It will tell you you're tied.

185
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:09,260
When you really are not tired.
It will tell you you can't do it.

186
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:13,850
It will fill you with fear.
So you've got to watch that conversation

187
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,210
and when you find that going on,
you've got to stand up to it and said,

188
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,670
I'm going to do this anyhow.
I'm afraid,

189
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:24,110
but I'm afraid not to do it and I'm not
going to let you stop me.

190
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,890
The biggest challenge that you will have
in life is you.

191
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,230
It's an old African proverb that says
this,

192
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,550
there's no enemy within the enemy
outside can do us no harm.

193
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,310
The next thing that is a key to self
motivation is that you've got to ask

194
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:46,400
yourself,
what do I want out of life?

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What do you want out of life?
What do you want out of a job?

196
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,490
What do you want out of career?
What do want out of a relationship?

197
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,640
What do you want?
What gives you your life?

198
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,140
How many of you know when you got it,
what will make you happy?

199
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,790
You'll need to know.
You need to start asking yourself some

200
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,830
questions.
What do I really,

201
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,210
really,
truly want?

202
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,030
Okay?

203
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,750
Do you need to be exact about that?
Don't be vague.

204
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,040
Oh,
I just want to be happy.

205
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,460
That's too vague.
What will make you happy?

206
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,630
How will you know when you got it?
Zero in on it.

207
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,790
Be Exact.
Be specific.

208
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,390
And as you do that,
that will stimulate that superconscious

209
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,060
mind or the reticular activating system
of your mind that will begin to find

210
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,460
those things to identify with it.

211
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,200
Yeah,

212
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,840
and once you begin to determine that
which you want,

213
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,250
take the time to write it down.
Don't just think about it.

214
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,040
Write it down.
That is a subjective process that

215
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,860
engages the subconscious mind.
Write it down.

216
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,810
Once you write it down,
read it three times a day,

217
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,030
morning,
noon,

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,040
and night was that important because
what it will do,

219
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:10,960
it will cost you to focus.
It will cause you to concentrate when

220
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,530
that other conversation is going on,
telling you what you cannot do,

221
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,530
telling you all of the impossibilities
and all of the obstacles you're

222
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,040
concentrating will begin to create a
larger vision within yourself and you'll

223
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,810
start looking for and seeing some new
opportunities.

224
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,790
You start creating some openings for
yourself as you begin to read that

225
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,140
everyday,
everyday,

226
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,290
day in and day out.
That will make you focus,

227
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,010
that will discipline your Thanki and
you'll get all kinds of creative ideas.

228
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,500
As I talked to you right now,
being involved in this immersion

229
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,960
process,
you're going to create some openings for

230
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,090
yourself.
You're going to get some ideas,

231
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,700
you've got to feel your gym and flowing,
and you're going to think about

232
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,350
something.
Some idea you had,

233
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:54,970
you said,
I want to go back and I'm going to look

234
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,610
at that again from a different vantage
point.

235
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Not from the level of the problem of the
obstacles that I encountered,

236
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,030
but if from a higher vantage point,
because what?

237
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,290
You will begin to see him to know as I
have talked to the higher consciousness

238
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,890
within you,
but you are powerful that you are a

239
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:15,880
miracle worker.
And that inner conversation has

240
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:20,380
conditioned you to believe that you not.
And as you begin to discover the truth

241
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,200
of who you are,
whatever challenge that you're facing in

242
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,610
life,
and if you're living,

243
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:27,940
you're facing some challenge,
you'll begin to know that you are

244
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,941
powerful and that your America maker.
So as you begin to write down exactly

245
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,560
what it is that you want,
read it every day.

246
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,140
The next thing is see yourself there.
How will you feel once you get there?

247
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,490
What will the experience be like for
you?

248
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,300
What will be different?
What kind of person do you have to

249
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:52,190
become in to get there?

250
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,790
Visualize yourself there.
Living the experience.

251
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,880
I remember when I ran for state
representative in Columbus,

252
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,290
Ohio and I had a lot of people telling
me,

253
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,590
and you got to watch not only the
conversation within,

254
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,430
but the conversation without telling me
less.

255
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,590
You can't possibly when you can't do
that,

256
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,250
and I went down to the legislature and I
saw myself.

257
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,760
I knew what I wanted.
I saw myself in the chair.

258
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,190
I pointed out the chair that I wanted.
I used to go in and set up in the

259
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:23,880
galleries and watch the legislative
process.

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,540
I used to go to the committee meetings
and listen to legislation being

261
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,990
introduced.
I learned how to write legislation,

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,750
how to amend legislation.
I start thinking like a legislator.

263
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,850
Got Up everyday dressing,
thinking like that,

264
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,060
selling myself on it,
seeing myself in the legislature.

265
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:41,880
Mr Speaker,
I'm the gentleman from the 29th house

266
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:43,590
district.
I'd like to introduce the bill.

267
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,500
I went into the legislature,
walked around,

268
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,950
I have the experience of it,

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,640
okay?

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,250
And when I ran and won against
overwhelming odds,

271
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,550
they were shocked.
I won the election even before it was

272
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:59,551
hell because I was living it in my mind.
You want to see yourself beyond your

273
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,300
circumstances.
You got to challenge.

274
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:05,200
See yourself beyond your challenge.
See yourself with a challenge already

275
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,100
resolved

276
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,960
and knowing that all is well.
Seeing yourself in control and in charge

277
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,750
of your destiny,
being healthy and happy.

278
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,010
The next thing is it is important in the
area of motivating yourself.

279
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,630
It's important to know why you're doing
it,

280
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,480
because that mine will say,
why bother?

281
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,050
Why go through all this?
This is too hard.

282
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,240
No,
throw in the towel.

283
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,110
It's not worth it.
It has it ever said that to you before.

284
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,400
Here's how you can handle that.
Here's how you override that.

285
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,400
Write down five reasons why you deserve
it.

286
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,700
Why do you deserve what you want?
Why are you

287
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,070
okay?

288
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,940
Why do you deserve it?
What meaning and value will it bring to

289
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:55,760
your life?
What's so different about you that you

290
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,761
deserve your goal or this goal and when
you write down those five reasons,

291
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,940
when you have some down moments and
you're going to have them,

292
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,900
when that conversation started talking
to you and it's going to talk to you,

293
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,100
what you will do is you can pull that
out and read it and it will build you

294
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,100
up.
It will be your rod and your staff to

295
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,640
conferences you through some challenging
moments because you're going to have

296
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:22,730
some life will knock you between the
eyes.

297
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,700
It will catch you on the blind side.
Come out of nowhere,

298
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,480
Steph,
you can't anticipate that will knock the

299
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,460
wind out of you.
You want to give up.

300
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay?

301
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,910
That's why it's important for you to
work on yourself,

302
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:36,890
listening to tapes,
building yourself up,

303
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,650
talking to yourself with power,
feeling and conviction.

304
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,490
Building yourself up day in and day out
because it's coming.

305
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
I guarantee you life is just,
oh,

306
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,670
he's doing good now,
Huh?

307
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,610
Very good.
I've never had an experience.

308
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,410
I was pursuing my dream and that's why
you have to work on yourself.

309
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,500
You don't know what's going to happen
and I was telling people,

310
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,550
I had this big rally I had to do with
5,000 people there and I said,

311
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,250
you must work on yourself if you want a
larger vision,

312
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,250
you've got to empower yourself
continuously because life,

313
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,210
we'll catch you on the blind side.
And after I finished my speech,

314
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,560
I got a rousing standing ovation and I
wouldn't call the young lady that I was

315
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:21,040
dating at the time.
I said,

316
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,480
hey,
guess what?

317
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,010
I said,
they love me.

318
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:26,080
I got a standing ovation and they were
chanting,

319
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,570
we want the motivator.
We want the motivator.

320
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,613
I say,
listen,

321
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,730
we want to motivate everyone.
Do your hair.

322
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
She said,
yes.

323
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,400
Well that's what I need to talk to you.
I put one item in it.

324
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,610
You're talking about the 12 hours and
I'll be all filled less.

325
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,290
I heard a voice in the background.
Hurry up and tell him who's that

326
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,080
last time you've been gone a lot in then
somebody else and they came in last.

327
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:56,200
Come on mister motivator.
They want you back out there.

328
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,061
Wait a minute,
hold it.

329
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,570
Hold on.
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,860
There's someone else in the heard of the
say,

331
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,740
hang the phone up.
I said,

332
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,160
why don't they just say,
hey,

333
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,911
hey,
motivated.

334
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:05,990
Come on.
They want you to catch it.

335
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,270
Ham
share.

336
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,890
When you work it on a larger vision,
I say you,

337
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,270
you got to really work on yourself.
Can Light.

338
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,280
We'll catch you on the blind side.
You Bet.

339
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,330
Show
this.

340
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
Nobody said the spirit is on.
In fact,

341
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:46,641
if I define device,
I was told to tell us not blinking the

342
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,760
lights.
They had the cup put me off,

343
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,470
but I said,
you got to have a larger,

344
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,330
you make show you work.
I said,

345
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,590
come on.
Listen Brown Chabot.

346
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,100
Yeah,
I would to my hotel room and loneliness

347
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,780
and heartbreak was sitting on the bed,
said,

348
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:05,800
are you coming in now?
Huh?

349
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Do you have your larger vision now?
How's your positive attitude they get on

350
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:19,710
in yet?
Are you still breathing shut?

351
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,200
Shut up.
Nope.

352
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,500
You want your gold?
[inaudible] gold,

353
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:28,050
Donald
[inaudible].

354
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,993
Well,
you out.

355
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,390
You'll be said,
no,

356
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:34,610
I didn't know how hard
you try to read it.

357
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,251
Get C.
Dot.

358
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:39,510
Do the tiers.
I would plug in through the draws in his

359
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:43,360
hotel trying to find a Gideon Bible.
Anything I said,

360
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,370
somebody,
anybody,

361
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,220
he'll be y'all where y'all who entered
by flow.

362
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,600
That's why you got to work on yourself.
Could live.

363
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,170
We'll send you some curves you cannot
anticipate.

364
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,010
The next thing is that whatever you do,
you want to develop technical mastery.

365
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,390
You want to be the best at what you do.
You want to master it.

366
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,720
See,
part of of of self motivation is you've

367
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:14,230
got to find something that gives you a
strong sense of competence.

368
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,640
When you've become known for that,
you develop a reputation of being good

369
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,080
at doing that.

370
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,110
You set some high personal standards for
yourself.

371
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,460
You're not competing with anybody else.
You're just unfolding yourself to be the

372
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:31,300
best person that you could be,
that you want to give the best quality

373
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:35,920
service that you can give because that
is a statement about who you are.

374
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,300
The other thing that's the key to self
motivation is recognize the fact that

375
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:46,840
you're going to get into some slumps.
Recognize the fact that you're going to

376
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:51,100
encounter a great deal of failure in
life and goes with the territory,

377
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,590
but in the face of that,
you want to be relentless and when you

378
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,500
want something,
you can don't expect everybody to say,

379
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,191
oh,
come on in.

380
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:00,731
We've been,
Oh,

381
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,230
you want this?
Oh great,

382
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:05,650
we want to give this to you.
You're such a nice person.

383
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,350
You're doing it for your family.
Aren't you gray?

384
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,880
I don't like this.

385
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,140
And like that,
no many doors will be closed in your

386
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:17,390
face.
Many loans that you will want and they

387
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:18,550
say,
no,

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,160
you don't have enough collateral.
You don't have enough credit,

389
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,440
and most people will give up,
but you've got to decide that I'm going

390
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:31,060
to be fearless.
I refuse to be tonight and I'm going to

391
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:34,240
go all out.
I'm going to be relentless.

392
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,430
I don't care how many no's I
encountered.

393
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,850
I liked something.
Isaiah,

394
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,060
as Thomas said,
when it's getting ready for a basketball

395
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:40,894
game,
he said,

396
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,810
I'm going to either shoot us in or shoot
us out,

397
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,480
but I'm not going to not do anything.

398
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,080
And that's the way to go.

399
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,340
You can't make a basket unless you shoot
the ball.

400
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,100
You can't hit a home run unless you take
a swing at it.

401
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,120
Most people won't even take a slang.
Well,

402
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:07,350
I probably won't make it anyhow.
That's the conversation with him.

403
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,350
They probably won't give it to me
anyhow.

404
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,560
If you want something,
you've got to be relentless.

405
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,960
You've got to decide I deserve this and
I'm going to have it,

406
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,190
and you go all out to get it.
That drives you.

407
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,810
The next thing is that when you want
something out of life,

408
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,230
you've got to be willing to go into
action.

409
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,040
Don't wait around for things to be just
right.

410
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Don't wait for things to be perfect.
Don't wait for the ideal situation.

411
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,830
It will never be ideal.
There will always be a reason.

412
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,680
As soon as the children grow up,
oh,

413
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,610
soon as I pay my bills,
well soon as I get my divorce time,

414
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,270
as soon as I get enough money together,
do what you can,

415
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,100
where you are with what you have and
never be satisfied.

416
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,520
A lot of people never take a chance in
life.

417
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:07,960
They don't want to take any chances.
They want the situation to be ideal.

418
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,400
That would say that's not walking by
faith.

419
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
That's walking by sight.
If I can see it,

420
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll do it.
No,

421
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:15,861
no,
no,

422
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:17,090
no glass.
A lot of people say,

423
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,770
if I can see it,
I believe it.

424
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,231
No,
no,

425
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:19,700
no,
no.

426
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,890
If you believe it,
you can see it

427
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:28,890
and

428
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,560
don't be disturbed because no one else
can see it.

429
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,210
That's not unusual.
That is ordinary,

430
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,980
but because you want some different
kinds of results in your life,

431
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,590
you've got to be willing to be
unreasonable.

432
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,430
If you weren't on reasonable results in
your life,

433
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,390
you've got to be willing to be on
reasonable pot of being unreasonable.

434
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,250
You don't judge according to
appearances,

435
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,340
Potter being unreasonable.
You can see it because you believe it.

436
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,470
That's part of being unreasonable.
Potter being unreasonable.

437
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,770
You're like Paulo said,
you must have the faith to call forth

438
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:09,771
those things that be not as though they
were as part of being unreasonable.

439
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,530
Most people won't do that.
Most people say,

440
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:18,531
call me when you get it together,
then I'll support you.

441
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,220
The other thing is that what are the
keys to stuff?

442
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:31,221
Motivation that empower you is that you
want to find a cause larger than

443
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:35,610
yourself.
Find something that you can contribute

444
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,370
to.
Find something that you can make a

445
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,960
difference because you can,
part of what feeds your larger vision,

446
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,330
part of what gives you a reason for
being part of what gives you your life

447
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,540
is being able to give something back so
I can't afford to give anything you

448
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:57,750
can't afford not to give.
Give your time,

449
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,530
give your talent is nothing just to go
over and lick envelopes.

450
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,110
I don't know exactly what I'm going to
do,

451
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,370
but I'm going over there.
It's part of my tithing in the universe.

452
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,910
Once you develop that,
that special sense of mission and that's

453
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:14,440
what you develop when you're part of a
larger cause,

454
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,680
then yourself,
it drives you.

455
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,200
You don't need an alarm clock to get up
in the morning.

456
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,920
You have special power.
You'll go places and folk will like to

457
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,960
be around you.
They will know there's something

458
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,600
different about you.
When you go in there say,

459
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,310
hey,
that's somebody important.

460
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,980
I want to know who you are.
I just want to be near you.

461
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,590
That energy that you have,
that consciousness that you will embody

462
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,280
will affect everybody around you.
The next thing is is that you want to

463
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,970
create a home court advantage for
yourself.

464
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,600
You've got to be aware of who you have
around you,

465
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,530
so you want to be selective.
Have friends that will enable use of

466
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,420
grow.
I have friends that help me to grow

467
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,000
spiritually.
These are my spiritual friends.

468
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,960
I talked spiritual stuff with them.
I have some other friends who are just

469
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,650
intellectual friends.
They make me grow intellectually.

470
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,980
They make me stretch.
I have some professional friends.

471
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,410
I'm a member of the National Speakers
Association.

472
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,490
I get together with other speakers and
we learn from each other and we grow

473
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,940
from each other.
I have other friends who are just social

474
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,160
friends.
All we do just socialize together.

475
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,340
We are looking at a basketball game
together or go out dancing,

476
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,620
but that's all we can do.
We don't talk anything serious,

477
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,450
nothing spiritual,
nothing intellectual.

478
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,780
That's not that kind of relationship.
Nothing heavy up in here.

479
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,380
Have other friends.
We walked together,

480
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:42,830
that's all we can do.
Walk together talking about it.

481
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,420
We're going to lose weight one day,
buying vine for good.

482
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:46,860
All right?
That's all we do.

483
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,170
Nothing else.
So according to the relationships that

484
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:57,120
you develop,
we grow from people and projects and the

485
00:27:57,121 --> 00:28:01,590
relationships that you develop.
Kenton Hanson can enrich your life or

486
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:06,120
they can drain you.
I know many talented people who had a

487
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:09,120
great deal of potential,
but because they didn't surround

488
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:13,110
themselves with other people that will
inspire them to transcend themselves,

489
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,310
they never realize that greatness and
they will end up going to their grave

490
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,200
with all their good stuff still in him.

491
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,810
So you want to look at your
relationships,

492
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,200
the people that you're involved with,
the people that you communicate with

493
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,780
most often,
and you want to ask yourself the

494
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:31,270
question,
what am I becoming because of this

495
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:33,640
relationship?
Does it inspire me?

496
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,150
Am I motivated?
Am I encourage?

497
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,770
Am I driven to develop myself?
Am I seeking my own greatness?

498
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,420
What kind of person am I becoming
because of this relationship?

499
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,760
Okay?

500
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,480
Am I becoming more cynical and negative
about life?

501
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:57,110
Ask yourself that.
The next thing is you've got to say yes

502
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:02,541
to your life.
You've got to say yes.

503
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,360
Okay?

504
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,500
Yes to my dreams,
yes to me.

505
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes,
I can make it.

506
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,700
Yes,
I can.

507
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,640
Doesn't matter how many failures I've
made,

508
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,650
doesn't matter how many mistakes I've
been endured.

509
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,780
Doesn't matter about my defeats.
Doesn't matter about what I've done.

510
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,600
Yes.
Yes.

511
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,400
Okay.

512
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,410
I don't care about the fact that I'm in
a hole now.

513
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,980
Doesn't matter about where I am.
Yes.

514
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,760
The last chapter to my life has not been
written yet.

515
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,000
If you judge me now,
your judge Mi prematurely,

516
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,360
I haven't exposed all my stuff yet.
I'm still in the process of transforming

517
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,210
my life.
I'm still in the process of becoming.

518
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,640
Okay.

519
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,120
Yes.
I had somebody in my life at one time

520
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:56,220
told me,
you are never made,

521
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,590
and I said,
I'll show you what energizes me.

522
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,990
What motivated me was something that
Frank Sinatra said.

523
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,820
He said,
the best revenge is massive success.

524
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:15,130
[inaudible]

525
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,670
you just watch my smoke as old folks
still say yes.

526
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,690
Stand up for your dreams.
Stand up for what you want in your life.

527
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,870
Decide that your life is so meaningful
to you,

528
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,740
that you love you and you love life so
much,

529
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,460
you're going to stand up for something
you want.

530
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,480
I used to have a saying when I was on
the radio stands up for what you believe

531
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:52,481
in because you can fall for anything.
So when I say to you this evening that

532
00:30:55,911 --> 00:31:00,230
you are powerful,
you have miracle working power in your

533
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,500
life right now,
but you've got to work on yourself.

534
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,120
You've got to develop yourself.
You've got to talk to yourself day in

535
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:11,150
and down,
selling yourself on you and on your

536
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:14,050
potentials,
and you've got to know that,

537
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,400
that you are worth all of your effort
and that the key to your motivation as

538
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:24,941
you'll get a larger vision of yourself,
is to know that you have something to

539
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:29,120
give,
is to know that you have a reason for

540
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,100
being in the universe at this point in
time.

541
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,310
I want you to stand up for your life
right now.

542
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:38,300
Anybody want to stand up for your up?
Be Your dream standing up for your

543
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:38,750
dreams.
