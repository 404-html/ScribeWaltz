1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,070
What are the major secrets of success is
always knew more than you're paid for

2
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,680
and then you will always be paid more
than what you're getting now.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,830
And number six,
you must use your time well every

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,431
minute,
every hour,

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,390
every day.
Remember,

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,720
this life is not a rehearsal for
anything else in life.

7
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,370
This is the real thing.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,530
The purpose of this course is not to
make you an expert,

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,170
but to give you the tools of all
experts,

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,910
all successful people in business.
I'm going to hit these points reasonably

11
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:44,120
rapidly.
I've made a decision that what you want

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,930
is the greatest amount of practical,
usable information in the shortest

13
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:50,600
period of time.
You are quite capable in your own

14
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:54,740
business and in your own activities to
take this material away and select from

15
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:57,530
it what you need at the moment.
You must have a very,

16
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,790
very strong desire to be successful in
business in order to attempt the

17
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,970
business enterprise.
It's like embarking on a journey across

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,050
an uncharted ocean because no matter
what you start off with as a compass or

19
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,420
a destination,
the tides and the winds are going to

20
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,950
change your direction very,
very quickly.

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,840
It must have very,
very strong desire.

22
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,630
You must really,
really want to be independent.

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,330
You must really want a ton of me.
You must want the freedom.

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,960
You must want the success because you're
going to be buffeted by the storms of

25
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:26,420
business life and without a very,
very intense desire.

26
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,330
You're going to be washed overboard.
The second thing that you have to have

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,440
is you have to have very clear burning,
compelling goals to which you're

28
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,750
committed.
You have to be able to determine exactly

29
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,940
what it is you want to accomplish in
terms of income,

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,250
in terms of business growth,
where you want to be in one,

31
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:40,881
three,
five,

32
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,480
10 years and you have to make sure that
everything you're doing on a day to day

33
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:49,481
basis is consistent with your goals.
One of the things we have found is that

34
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,080
if you are not doing something that
contributes to achieving your aim,

35
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:58,010
then what you're doing probably detracts
from achieving your aim and one of the

36
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:03,011
major reasons for failure in life is the
inability to focus single mindedly on

37
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,250
one thing at a time.

38
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll talk about this over and over as we
go through the course.

39
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,980
As a matter of fact,
everything in this course is aimed at

40
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:14,540
giving you the targets,
the pinpoint targets for you to focus on

41
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,460
in each area of business development.
What are the key things that you have to

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,610
hone in on and concentrate on in order
to be successful?

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,610
The next thing is belief.
You must absolutely believe yourself to

44
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,550
be capable in this field.
One of the things that we find is that

45
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:31,460
in business,
some people are unique and have

46
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,400
remarkable talents and couldn't do
phenomenal things in a short period of

47
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,080
time,
but the great majority of business

48
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:41,120
people,
80 or 90% are of primarily average

49
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,030
intelligence.
They are not great geniuses.

50
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:48,980
They don't have extraordinarily high Iq
is but they do have a very strong belief

51
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,960
in themselves and their ability to
succeed.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,160
They don't believe themselves especially
to be inferior to anybody else and they

53
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:58,280
don't believe that other people are
especially more talented or more capable

54
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,070
and they are.
In my years of experience,

55
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,430
I have sometimes heard about business
organizations and heard about business

56
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:07,330
people running these organizations and
how phenomenally talented they must be

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,080
and then when I go to work to consult
with these organizations and I spent

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,900
hours with these same people that you
read about in the newspapers,

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,390
I sit down and I find that really quite
ordinary people,

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,680
they just happened to be focused or
specialized along a particular line and

61
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,260
happen to be doing things a little bit
different than other people are doing

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,720
and we can think of all kinds of
examples of that.

63
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,830
John D Rockefeller said that the two
most important requirements for business

64
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,370
success or patients and foresight,
but especially patients,

65
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,400
and we'll talk about this a few times,
if you do not have patients,

66
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,010
you can't be successful in business
because almost everything in business is

67
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,760
timing.

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,110
There's a too soon and there's a too
late.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,680
And sometimes as business people,
we always want things to soon,

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,760
we always want things to happen at least
a year in advance of their scheduled

71
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,700
time.
And very often we push and we press to

72
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,490
make things happen early and it causes
nothing but difficulties.

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,920
And of course the ability to delay
gratification.

74
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,620
We live in a society where everybody
wants everything.

75
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,870
Now.
We live in a society where we have been

76
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,510
raised on television,
which means that they're 30 60 and 90

77
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,610
minutes solutions to all the great
problems of life.

78
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,380
And we have a tendency as adults having
grown up with 20 or 30 years of

79
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,470
television to always be looking for
quick solutions.

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,520
We see all our life that the most
fundamental and complex problems of

81
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,970
human existence are solved in those
short TV segments.

82
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,100
And they're very most we're willing to
bear as a miniseries.

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,640
We have to realize that sometimes people
problems,

84
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,960
market problems take a long time.
I remember I was in a very,

85
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,870
very tight fix in business.
We had over ordered,

86
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,810
we had bought too much of a particular
product.

87
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,380
We had overextended our lines of credit
and the person that I was working for,

88
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,750
we we're talking about whether or not we
had,

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,000
if you like,
ruined the possibilities of the company.

90
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,040
I never forget him saying,
Brian,

91
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,230
it's too early to tell.
I said,

92
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,580
well,
we've been in business for six months.

93
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:54,760
He said,
six months is not enough in the

94
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,080
marketplace.
He said,

95
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,780
we have to wait.
Let's give it another few months.

96
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,740
Now.
Interesting enough,

97
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,290
as a young person,
as an aggressive impetuous person,

98
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,090
another few months seemed like a
lifetime,

99
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,320
but as it happened another few months
was the difference between failure and

100
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,130
tremendous success for that business.
It just took a little bit longer for the

101
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,810
business to get into the marketplace.

102
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,780
One of the things that we always make a
mistake with is we think when we

103
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,730
introduced a new product,
because we know it's a great product,

104
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,270
everybody's going to buy,
everybody's gonna recognize the same

105
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,890
thing.
We recognize however,

106
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,880
people change their opinions and their
ideas toward products very,

107
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,220
very slowly.
Sometimes you have to be in the

108
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,050
marketplace for three months,
six months,

109
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,950
nine months,
a year,

110
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,800
two years,
three years before the product finally

111
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,530
takes off.
Home computers is a perfect example.

112
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,190
Like Ibm decided there was no future in
the home computer market and so they

113
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:46,180
decided to stay out of it completely,
but suddenly the market exploded and

114
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:49,960
everybody came to different conclusions.
And finally you'll find that one of the

115
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,930
keys to success in business is what is
called method.

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,050
Working systematically,
patiently doing the right things,

117
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,010
right?
Dotting the i's,

118
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,930
crossing the t's,
and then doing them as quickly as

119
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,820
possible are the basic elements.

120
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,770
And if you keep doing the right things
in the right way,

121
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,230
over time,
you must be successful over time.

122
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,390
You put all the odds on your side.
And believe me,

123
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,310
every single thing we talk about in this
course,

124
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,280
I have either done wrong and it's cost
me a lot of money,

125
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,920
or I've worked with corporations who
have done them wrong,

126
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,610
and many of those corporations have gone
bankrupt as a result and lost

127
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,440
everything.
And when I used to hear some of these

128
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:21,831
things,
I'd say,

129
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,330
well,
I don't particularly like that.

130
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,280
That's not convenient.
That doesn't fit with my schedule.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,080
So I would ignore that point.
I would say,

132
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,720
well,
I'll ignore that point and the rule

133
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,320
won't apply to me.
Just this once.

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,310
And when you've ended up selling your
house and selling your car in order to

135
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,940
pay your bills because the market didn't
allow you to get away with it,

136
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,130
even once,
then you learn the lesson next time you

137
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,090
say,
wait a minute,

138
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,373
wait a minute.

139
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,150
So finally,
the final analysis,

140
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,090
it's not what you do,
but who you are that makes the

141
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,400
difference in success.
So those are the internal,

142
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,680
the personal qualities,
intense desire,

143
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,990
intense goals,
intense belief in your ability to

144
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,420
succeed,
continuing drive patients and the

145
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,240
ability to delay gratification.
The opportunity area that we're in

146
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,220
today,
and this is the one of the greatest

147
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,310
areas of opportunity in the history of
the world is that we have entered into

148
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:08,240
the age of the entrepreneur as well as
the age of the intrepreneur if you like,

149
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,270
which we'll talk about in a second,
but there are more corporations being

150
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:15,590
formed now in our country than at any
other period in history and the rate of

151
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,810
company formation is accelerating
dramatically and this is only the

152
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:22,580
registered corporations.
The number of sole proprietorships and

153
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,520
partnerships that are forming that don't
even get registered in the corporate

154
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,620
registries is absolutely astronomical.

155
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,220
It's up something like 500% over the
last 20 years.

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,340
Today in North America,
there are something like a million

157
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,310
businesses alone being incorporated
every year.

158
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,810
20 years ago it was 200,000 businesses a
year.

159
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,640
Now,
of all those businesses,

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,970
80% will fail in the first four to five
years.

161
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,450
This is a part of a dynamic economy.
One of the purposes of this course is to

162
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,450
make sure that your business doesn't
fail and that if you're in business and

163
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,790
your business is not as prosperous as
you'd like it to be,

164
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,500
that it become more prosperous rather
than less prosperous of over 800,000

165
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,770
millionaires in North America,
over 80% of them are self made.

166
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,700
Over 80% of those millionaires started
off with nothing penniless,

167
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,010
with an idea,
a product or a service,

168
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,470
and they built their business to the
point where it is today.

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,450
And we know by examining the careers and
the lives of most self made millionaires

170
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,840
that there are certain things that they
did and they're all in this course.

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,200
We find that there are three major
reasons why so many businesses fail.

172
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:25,190
Number one is lack of knowledge.
People don't know how to run a business

173
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,890
successfully.
Number two is lack of support.

174
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,860
They cannot get the support they need
from their suppliers,

175
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,480
from their creditors,
from their bankers,

176
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,790
from their friends,
from their customers and so on.

177
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,190
And number three is lack of capital,
lack of money.

178
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,380
They cannot get enough money to tide
them.

179
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:42,860
Over the inevitable tough times.
The purpose of this course,

180
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:46,880
the key objective of this course is to
give you the knowledge necessary to be

181
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,760
able to get the support and the capital
that you require.

182
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,240
We know that it is not a terribly
difficult matter to borrow funds for a

183
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,840
good business idea.
If you know how to put together a

184
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,540
business plan,
every single commercial bank in our

185
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,330
society is there for one specific
reason,

186
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,920
which is to make loans to business.

187
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,400
They'd like to make loans to consumers
that like to make loans on homes.

188
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,580
But basically their reason is to make
good business loans.

189
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,000
And if you have the knowledge necessary
to put together the right business plan

190
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,700
and the right business program,
you will be able to make the

191
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,290
applications to raise,
uh,

192
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,810
the various finances.
And not only that,

193
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,200
it is the knowledge of doing the right
things and doing right things right.

194
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,650
That gets you the support necessary in
order to generate the markets,

195
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,530
to get the suppliers to back you in
order to get the capital in order to

196
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,090
produce the product or service and so
on.

197
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,570
So they all tie together,
but the knowledge must come first and

198
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,360
more people fail from lack of knowledge
and for any other reason.

199
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,190
All right.
What are the key requirements for

200
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,570
business success?
As we say,

201
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,370
business is an art as well as a science.

202
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,500
It's a matter of practical experience,
judgement,

203
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,770
foresight,
and luck.

204
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,150
Really successful in business.
You must never forget the basics.

205
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,340
I was thinking last night that a
business is like a child.

206
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,070
Every single child is unique and
distinct.

207
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,400
It has unique and distinct influences
working on it.

208
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,810
It develops a unique personality and no
matter how many children you have and

209
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,490
have two children in the same and you
only have two people the same in the

210
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,920
world,
businesses are exactly the same.

211
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,680
They all require a certain amount of
nurturing,

212
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:11,550
caring,
support,

213
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:12,990
consideration,
growth.

214
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,820
They all have phases that they go
through from infancy through to

215
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,780
adolescence and adulthood and so on.
And interestingly enough,

216
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:23,280
because business is so big and so
important in western society,

217
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,830
hundreds of millions,
if not billions of dollars have been

218
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:29,850
spent studying of businesses.
There are enormous faculties and some of

219
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:33,830
the most intelligent men and women in
the world are working simply fulltime,

220
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,410
40 50 hours a week studying what makes
successful businesses work.

221
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,190
And so it is possible just like there
are many thousands of psychologists,

222
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,800
nurses,
doctors and so on working on studying

223
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,810
what makes healthy children healthy,
happy,

224
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,570
confident.
There are ways to raise healthy

225
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,100
children.
There's waste to retail the business.

226
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,230
So what are the basics of business
success?

227
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,760
Number one role of business in a free
society is to organize and coordinate

228
00:10:56,761 --> 00:11:00,840
the factors of production to produce the
goods and services that people want at

229
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,880
prices.
They are willing and able to pay the

230
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:05,940
role of business,
especially the role of the business

231
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:09,090
leader,
the entrepreneur is to combine resources

232
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,560
to take men materials,
labor,

233
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,130
capital and so on.
Combined them into products and services

234
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,580
and get them to the market in size and
shapes,

235
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:19,620
qualities and quantities that people
want to buy,

236
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,440
are willing to buy.
All businesses that are successful are

237
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,190
doing that,
right?

238
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,050
All businesses that are unsuccessful are
doing it wrong.

239
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,000
The second thing is that that it is the
wants,

240
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:30,450
needs and desires of the customers that
determine all business activity.

241
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,070
It is not what producers produce,
but it is what customers want.

242
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,710
That determines business activity.
In other words,

243
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,580
if a company is producing what customers
want and producing it in a cost

244
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,060
efficient and effective way,
then it will grow and prosper.

245
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,540
If a company is not growing and
prospering and that's the first corolla

246
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,050
rate and it means it is not producing
the goods and services that people want.

247
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,730
In other words,
it's always us.

248
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,520
We are always personally as business
people responsible for the success or

249
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:00,640
lack of success of our enterprise.
Either we're doing it right and if we're

250
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,260
doing it right,
the marketplace will tell us if we're

251
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,000
doing it wrong.
The marketplace will tell us,

252
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,650
and it's always like people in the
marketplace that know what's right,

253
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,700
don't know what's best as customers for
the same services we want at the very

254
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,860
most for the very least,
and we are also ruthless,

255
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,810
selfish,
demanding and this oil.

256
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
In other words,
if anybody can offer it to us cheaper,

257
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,874
better,
faster,

258
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,520
we'll buy it from them.
We have people who will work for a

259
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,910
company or work with a company,
buy from a company for 20 years and a

260
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:31,180
new company will spring up on the block
and they all transfer their business

261
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,840
across the street to that company.
I remember when I was doing some work in

262
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:38,230
the financial industry,
I found that if one financial

263
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,890
institution raised its deposit rates by
an eighth of a percent,

264
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,620
it would be like tilting a big tub of
water.

265
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,850
That money and deposits would start to
flow to it from all other financial

266
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,490
institutions.
That's why even an eighth of a percent

267
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,130
makes a big difference.
A person could deal with a bank or a

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,350
trust company or a savings and loan for
20 years.

269
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,380
The instant that another savings and
loan offers an eighth of a percent more,

270
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,810
they'll walk right across the street
with their money for that eighth of a

271
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,750
percent and this is just the way we are
as human beings.

272
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,630
We all want to be better off in the
future.

273
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,250
Then we are in the present.
Therefore,

274
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,200
every action we take is to improve our
condition.

275
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,140
Very important.
And since we are always acting to

276
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,090
improve our condition,
we always want to improve our condition

277
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,340
in the very most possible.
If somebody is buying from us,

278
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:22,840
it's because they have come to the
conclusion that all things being equal,

279
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:27,460
what we are offering is at that moment
and at that time better than what

280
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,310
anybody else is offering.
If they are not buying from us,

281
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,570
they have made the decision that what we
are offering is not as good as what

282
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,520
somebody else is offering.
Very important.

283
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,560
We'll talk about this in marketing.
Well,

284
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,030
we know that,
uh,

285
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,370
customers always make rational
decisions,

286
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,870
which means that customers are always
right.

287
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,790
I'm always,
always find it interesting when I talked

288
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,680
to business people and business people
say,

289
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,041
well,
you know,

290
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,340
these customers just don't understand
what they're missing.

291
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,440
They don't understand.
Customers are stupid.

292
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,130
They don't see that what we're offering
them is the very best they could get

293
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,960
through the very finest quality,
the very cheapest.

294
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,050
No,
no customers or very smart customers are

295
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:02,890
brilliant.
In fact,

296
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,190
customers are geniuses.
Customers can discern the right

297
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,380
differences every single day of the
week,

298
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,540
and it is never the customer who is
wrong.

299
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,450
It's always the businessperson.
This is one of the hallmarks of

300
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,770
successful businesses.
They say,

301
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,320
if we're not selling enough,
if we're not doing enough business,

302
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,300
it's because of something that we're
doing.

303
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,790
It's certainly not the marketplace.
We all,

304
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,050
we know in a dynamic market,
there are always opportunities for those

305
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:27,400
who can find new,
better,

306
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,950
faster,
cheaper ways to serve customers with

307
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,860
what they want.
Many of the largest firms in the world

308
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,980
today did not exist 10 years ago.
There are many billion dollar

309
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,460
organizations that they were not even in
a person's mind 10 years ago,

310
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,910
and there are many billion dollar
organizations of 10 and 20 years ago

311
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,480
that don't exist anymore or that exists
in greatly reduced form.

312
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,890
We live,
if you like,

313
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:50,260
in a dynamic market,
there are always companies and

314
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,250
individuals coming up.
There are always companies and

315
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,410
individuals going down.
It's always happening.

316
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,810
We see it with changing economy,
changing demands,

317
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,660
change and trends and so on.
As long as they're a customer needs

318
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,870
unmet or better or cheaper ways to meet
them.

319
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,420
There are money making opportunities for
the creative and rt,

320
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,160
which means that as long as people don't
have everything they want in life,

321
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,790
there are always opportunities to start
and build successful businesses.

322
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,710
The only question is do we take the time
to find out what it is that people want?

323
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,190
They're always business opportunities
for those who are willing to lower their

324
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,600
prices.
In other words,

325
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,690
to offer new products or services or to
change your customers.

326
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,853
We've had,
uh,

327
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,550
done a lot of research on employment and
we find that one of the things that

328
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:35,540
stops individuals who are unemployed
from getting reemployed on of the major

329
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,840
things is they keep insisting that they
want to do what they were doing before

330
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,050
they got laid off or before their
industry collapsed and they want to keep

331
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:42,680
on doing that.

332
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,610
And then when somebody to hire them to
do that here in this place where they

333
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,140
are living because it's convenient for
them,

334
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,680
they don't realize that in order to get
reemployed as an individual,

335
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,280
if your industry is changing,
if your skills are becoming obsolete for

336
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,320
one reason or another,
in order to become reemployed,

337
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,850
you have to restructure what you're
offering.

338
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,890
You have to either offer it to new
markets,

339
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,040
you have to change your wage levels.
You have to demand less.

340
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,190
I've counseled with people who said,
I was already $30,000 a year and I got

341
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,500
laid off and I cannot find another job.
I said,

342
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh,
do you mean you cannot find another job?

343
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,100
So I've been everywhere.
I can't find another job.

344
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,660
I said,
therapeutical hiring in your industry.

345
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,190
Oh yes,
they're hiring,

346
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,410
but they're only paying $20,000 a year.
I said,

347
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,210
do you know why?

348
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,580
I said,
what has happened is that the market

349
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,780
value of the service you offer has
dropped to $20,000 a year.

350
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:30,500
It's no longer 30 you may have been paid
30 under unique circumstances,

351
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,760
but where do you have a better
opportunity to earn $30,000 trudging the

352
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:38,540
streets looking for a job that's not
there or taking a job at $20,000 and

353
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:43,220
increasing your value with companies?
We often find that we offer our products

354
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,550
and services at the very most that we
can get for those products and services,

355
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:50,780
but sometimes the market will take a
Kaboom and the price will drop out of

356
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:55,190
our products and services if we continue
to demand the same prices where we

357
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,800
continue to try to sell the same
products at the same price as to the

358
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,040
same markets.
Very often the market was saying,

359
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:00,920
I'm sorry,
I'm not interested.

360
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,900
Often we have to lower our prices.

361
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,380
Often we have to change our customers.
One thing I'd like to point out is that

362
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:11,381
a business enterprise is like a bundle
of resources as a bundle of resources.

363
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,260
It can be turned in any direction.
It is a bundle of capabilities,

364
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,690
talents.
It can be turned to manufacturing and

365
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,150
selling dolls.
It can be turned in another direction to

366
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,770
manufacturing,
producing computers.

367
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,100
It can go into real estate development.
It can market food products.

368
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,520
In something like 70 or 80% of all the
businesses that we surveyed,

369
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,790
we found that the people who achieve the
greatest success in entrepreneurial

370
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,090
activities did not achieve them in the
areas where they first started.

371
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,600
They achieved them in areas different
from what they started.

372
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,690
The most important single skill in
business is the ability to get the goods

373
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,540
out of the woods and move them to the
end.

374
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Consumer accompanied can absorb mistakes
in every single area of endeavor,

375
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,330
but it cannot absorb mistakes in
marketing because if marketing stops,

376
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,960
the company stops to profits are always
a result.

377
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,070
Profits are not the objective.
People who start into business with the

378
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:06,120
goal of serving customers well by giving
them the products or services they want

379
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,900
or usually successful and and the
profits follow customers pay all wages,

380
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,930
not corporations and everyone has at
least one customer.

381
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,780
One of the things that we have to ask
over and over again is who is our

382
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,520
customer?
Who is your customer?

383
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,720
Who do I have to satisfy in order to be
successful?

384
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,000
And then as you'll see as we go on a
little bit later,

385
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,480
who is my biggest customer?
Who do I have to satisfy the most in

386
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,480
order to be the most successful?
I used to work for the chairman of a

387
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:33,780
large conglomerate,
which I mentioned before and very early

388
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,930
in my career with the chairman,
even though I was doing about five or

389
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:40,770
six things simultaneously,
I made the decision that I had only one

390
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,800
customer and that organization and that
customer was the chairman.

391
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,080
And as long as I satisfied that
customer,

392
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,770
I could be slow or slack or make
mistakes in any area.

393
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:53,130
But as long as this chairman was happy,
everything would be fine.

394
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,430
If I did brilliantly in every area,
but I didn't satisfy the chairman,

395
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:59,670
I was going to be in serious trouble and
I'd suggest that has a very,

396
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,060
very good strategy or your success will
always be determined by what you do,

397
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,510
the demand for your product or service,
and the difficulty of replacing you.

398
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,350
The most important thing is how valuable
is your service to other people?

399
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,790
How valuable is it?
You can tell how valuable it is by how

400
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,260
much people are willing to pay you for
it.

401
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,530
And the same strategies adhere here
inside a corporation,

402
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,970
doing everything possible to increase
the value of what you do for your

403
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:26,610
company makes you a more valuable
person.

404
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,840
Xerox had an advertisement that came out
some years ago and the advertisement

405
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:33,840
showed I sort of a little cartoon.
At the first cartoon,

406
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,340
there was a little boy with the lemonade
stand,

407
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,040
said lemonade,
5 cents a glass scrawled on a sign.

408
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,550
And he's sitting there with a picture
and some glasses and it's shows on

409
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:45,810
another little boy walking up and
setting up his own lemonade stand next

410
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,290
door to compete.
And his little sign said lemonade,

411
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,210
5 cents a glass.
And then it shows the two of them

412
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:53,820
looking at each other.
So here they have the identical product

413
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,150
with the identical stand.
And then the last little caption showed

414
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,810
the second person who had entered the
lemonade market with a rose in each

415
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:07,470
glass.
And it says when people compete products

416
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,470
and get better.
So in other words,

417
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:15,120
he had added a little bit of something
special and it was the little bit extra

418
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,350
that made all the difference.

419
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,900
Well,
if you wish to earn more,

420
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,980
you must concentrate on increasing the
value of your services that you will

421
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:27,870
always be rewarded in direct proportion
for what you do and the value of what

422
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:31,050
you do.
Your whole job in life is simply,

423
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:34,890
this is to increase your value,
do everything possible to increase your

424
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,890
value.
Listening to tapes like this is a very,

425
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,570
very important investment in your
future.

426
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,540
Well,
the market only pays superior rewards

427
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,410
for superior goods and services.
It pays average rewards for average

428
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:52,411
goods and services and it pays inferior
rewards for inferior goods and services.

429
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,670
And it's a very,
very important,

430
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,300
and we talk about this in the session on
strategic marketing,

431
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,930
it's very important to identify what is
it that you do in an excellent fashion.

432
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,270
What is it that you would do that is so
good,

433
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:07,600
that's so special that you're better
than anybody else was doing it because

434
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,060
unless you can answer that question,
you're not ready to go into business.

435
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,120
Well.
The next is that it's business success

436
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,870
comes from direct developing excellence
in a particular market related area.

437
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,330
I give you a perfect example of
developing excellence.

438
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,270
Ibm and one of my favorite examples is
one of the most successful companies in

439
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,580
the world.
IBM has developed excellence in a

440
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:28,000
particular area and that is service.
They've developed excellence in a key

441
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,940
area and the market pays them a premium
year after year,

442
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,790
makes them one of the most profitable
and most successful companies on earth

443
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,230
and it's because they recognize very
early in business that service was a a

444
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:43,231
key consideration to the marketplace.
Everybody would rather have leisure than

445
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,150
hard work.
There is a great demand,

446
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:49,510
a great desire within the human soul to
take it easy to put up your feet,

447
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:50,800
to retire,
to relax,

448
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,300
to just take it easy.
However it is the successful people who

449
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,370
pay the extra price,
go the extra mile,

450
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:00,490
do the extra little things,
make the extra habits to get up extra

451
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,710
early in the morning,
go to the extra courses,

452
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,240
read the extra books and so on.

453
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,820
Those are the keys to success in
business.

454
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,470
It's always doing the little bit extra
and you always know that if you are

455
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,130
contributing greater value than you're
taking out,

456
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,710
then you know that you are always
growing in success and you're always

457
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:23,590
growing in income.
If you're only contributing exactly as

458
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,330
much as you're taking out,
that means you're staying.

459
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:28,120
Even if you're contributing less than
what you're taking out,

460
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:31,780
it means that you're falling behind.
So the master key to riches is self

461
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:34,180
discipline.
What are the seven personal qualities

462
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,900
that assured success in business?
Number one,

463
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,520
you must know yourself and know exactly
what it is you want in life.

464
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Goal orientation is an essential
requirement of all successful people and

465
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,830
as we'll talk about later,
we know lack of goal orientation goes

466
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,380
hand in hand with failure and every
single walk of life,

467
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,290
somebody should be able to wake you up
at three o'clock in the morning and

468
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,150
asked you what is your major definite
purpose in life?

469
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,430
What is your number one goal?
What do you want to accomplish more than

470
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:02,080
anything else in the next three to five
years?

471
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,810
And you should be able to wake up out of
a sound sleep and tell that person

472
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:07,150
instantly.
You must know it crystal clear.

473
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,990
We know that our goals always determine
the direction that we go in life.

474
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,660
I was reading something by thorough last
night.

475
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,020
It says that you should go confidently
in the direction of your dreams.

476
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,390
It says that try to live the life that
you have imagined for yourself and you

477
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:28,840
will be astonished at how far and how
fast you actually go in life if you

478
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:32,800
always tried to live consistent with
your dreams about yourself for the

479
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,950
future.
And Conrad Hilton said that you've got

480
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:40,210
to have a dream if you want to make a
dream come true.

481
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,710
Most self made millionaires compare
themselves to billionaires.

482
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,280
Most people starting their businesses
compare themselves to millionaires,

483
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,720
but once they get to be a millionaire
status,

484
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,370
they start to compare themselves to
billionaires.

485
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,980
And I think Jesus,
look how poorly I'm doing in comparison

486
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:57,170
to the billionaires,
but in every case,

487
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,290
it's the vision that is the activating
force.

488
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,060
The greater,
the more compelling,

489
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:05,630
the more burning that division,
that idea of where you want to go and

490
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,080
what you want to do.
We find that companies that achieved

491
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:11,180
great things always have somebody in the
company who has a mission,

492
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,070
the wants to do something really
important.

493
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,290
I was talking to a gentleman at the
university and not long ago who spent 25

494
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,560
years from the time he entered
biochemistry in his late teens.

495
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:26,150
He spent 25 years and his whole dream in
life was to make a major contribution to

496
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,700
DNA research,
the basic molecule of all of human life.

497
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,780
That's all they wanted to do.
And for 25 years he had that as a vision

498
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,320
and as a mission and in the 25th year he
made a major breakthrough,

499
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,520
which is now put him in line for a Nobel
prize and you'll probably go down in

500
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,690
history as one of the great biochemist
of the century and this is what kept the

501
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,400
person going for 25 years was the
mission,

502
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,310
the ability to focus,
very important.

503
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:53,870
The ability to focus as we've said and
we'll say over again is the absolute

504
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,400
critical requirement for success in
business to set targets and to aim at

505
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,870
those targets.
People say,

506
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,610
Jeez,
I don't know if I can be as successful

507
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,520
as other people are because they have
more advantages and more benefits and

508
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:07,130
more intelligence and so on.
Don't you believe it?

509
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,230
A person who is focused of average
intelligence can run circles around a

510
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,930
person who is a genius,
doesn't have the focus.

511
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,920
That is why people come out of the
universities with phd degrees and with

512
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:23,921
master's degrees and with sometimes five
10 15 years of advanced education and

513
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:28,460
they can barely make a living and other
people quit school in grade 10 and grade

514
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,820
11 and they come out of school and five
or 10 years later they have their own

515
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,760
successful businesses.
It's not the basic talents,

516
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,310
although talents are important and
education is important.

517
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,160
It's the ability to focus the talents
that you have,

518
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,200
like a an arrow,
if you like,

519
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:46,550
like a sniper to be able to hit specific
targets and that's why you don't have to

520
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,620
think of yourself in terms of
limitations.

521
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,360
Many of us hesitate about going ahead in
business because we think that somehow

522
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,610
we lack the talents and abilities.
We look at other people who are

523
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,430
successful in their businesses and we
think those people must have unique

524
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,264
capabilities.

525
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
It's only when you get to know these
people and meet these people that you

526
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,550
begin to realize that they're no
different from you or I.

527
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,210
The only difference between a successful
business person or let us say a person

528
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:09,770
who was launched the business in one who
is not,

529
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,380
is what is the person who launched the
business has done it.

530
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,800
A person who has not has not,
and I've seen this by studying,

531
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,960
if you'd like hundreds if not thousands
of entrepreneurs.

532
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,390
All right.
The next personal quality that assures

533
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:23,810
success as you must determine the price
that you will have to pay in order to be

534
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:27,710
successful and then resolve to pay that
price for every single thing you want in

535
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,850
life.
There's a price,

536
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,660
there's a price to has to be paid and
nature always demands of the price to be

537
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:37,661
paid in advance and the price in
business success is invariably hard,

538
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:38,600
hard work.

539
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,930
In order to be successful in business,
you have to work hard.

540
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,490
In order to be very,
you have to work harder.

541
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,090
In order to be even more successful,
you have to work harder.

542
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,060
Still,
there is no substitute for hard work in

543
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,170
business.
Many people say,

544
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:52,440
well,
these,

545
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,110
look at that person.
They got the right to sell or distribute

546
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,320
a product or service and they made it in
three or four or five years.

547
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,600
You never realize that behind the
scenes,

548
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:05,340
that person was probably working 1618
hours a day probably for five years

549
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:08,010
before they got their break in five
years after they got their break.

550
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,040
All you see at the end result is the
Nice House and a nice car.

551
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,230
I reason I mentioned this is sometimes
people start a business,

552
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:13,651
they think,
well,

553
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,630
I'm sure I'll have to work a couple of
extra hours a day.

554
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,460
Uh,
and as somebody once told me,

555
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:21,540
when you start your own business,
you only have to work half the time.

556
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,230
You only have to work half days from
then on and you can decide which 12

557
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:26,640
hours it's going to be.

558
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,450
In a recent study,
they found that in our society you work

559
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,830
eight hours a day for survival and
everything over that you work for

560
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:40,230
success.
If you're only working eight hours a

561
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:43,740
day,
you won't do anything more than survive

562
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,070
every additional hour.
Whether you're working for yourself or

563
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:52,071
someone else is for success.
And so it's very important that you keep

564
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,510
putting in those additional hours,
whether it's extra reading,

565
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:55,890
extra study,
extra work.

566
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,720
There are many universities and many
psychologists and professors who have

567
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,000
studied millionaires.
They make this a business.

568
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,920
I've studied millionaires,
interviewing them,

569
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,430
bringing them together,
uh,

570
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,850
looking at their lifestyles,
looking at their habits to find out what

571
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,820
they have in common.
One thing they all have in common is

572
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:16,821
that they are always thinking about
business and they work extremely hard.

573
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,270
Number three characteristic is self
responsibility.

574
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,830
You have to accept a hundred percent
responsibility for your life and for

575
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,990
everything that you are or ever will be.

576
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,290
Our great old saying if it's to be,
it's up to me,

577
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,870
very important.
The acceptance of personal

578
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:33,960
responsibility for everything that
happens too is the hallmark of the truly

579
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,900
mature,
truly successful peak performing

580
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:39,570
individual.
And the opposite of accepting full

581
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:44,040
responsibility is making excuses.
And many people have said that making

582
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,700
excuses is a disease that is faithful to
success.

583
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,000
No matter what difficulty or handicap
you may have,

584
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,020
there is somebody else who has had far
greater difficulties or handicaps than

585
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:57,660
you who has gone on to be very
successful.

586
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,870
And there are probably thousands of
people who have had difficulties in

587
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,850
handicap,
is far greater than any you will ever

588
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,460
imagine in life.
And they've gone on to be successful in

589
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:06,330
life.
So remember,

590
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:08,750
there's no excuses.
That's the key to maturity is that

591
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,790
there's no excuses.
You must make a total commitment to your

592
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,480
success.

593
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,810
Burn your bridges.
Total commitment is absolutely essential

594
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,350
in order to be successful in anything.
My friend Charlie Jones,

595
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:23,460
the great humorous says that the two
keys to success are simply this set

596
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,250
goals he says,
and then make a total commitment to

597
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:29,730
achieving those goals and then that
nothing dissuade you.

598
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,110
Burn your bridges behind you and let
nothing dissuade you from going for that

599
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:35,760
goal.
Don't try to straddle.

600
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,810
I've seen many people who have started a
business on the side and then what they

601
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,120
tried to do is they tried to stay with
their main line of work and they've

602
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:45,640
tried to make their business successful
too and do you know what happens?

603
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:49,630
Almost invariably their work
deteriorates to the point where their

604
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,180
employment is threatened and they lose
their money and their business.

605
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,250
One of the things that I found over and
over again,

606
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,990
and I've been told this by hundreds of
people,

607
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,410
is that businesses required tremendous,
tremendous,

608
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,930
total commitment and full time
commitment.

609
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,890
Number five,
you must be willing to work hard to go

610
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,380
the extra mile and to always do more
than you're paid for.

611
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,510
One of the major secrets of success is
always do more than you're paid for and

612
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,000
then you will always be paid more than
what you're getting now.

613
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
And number six,
you must use your time well every

614
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,721
minute,
every hour,

615
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:22,720
every day.
Remember this life is not a rehearsal

616
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,660
for anything else in life.
This is the real thing.

617
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,670
And all successful business people,
all self made millionaires look upon

618
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:33,730
their time as a resource and they're
very careful with it.

619
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,490
They spend their time the way they would
spend money.

620
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,020
And finally,
number seven,

621
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,160
back your plans with determination and
persistence and resolve in advance that

622
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,730
you'll never give up experiment and to
develop new products and processes

623
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:47,710
within the company.
And if they come up with something,

624
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:51,280
they can often become the head of the
division to manufacture that particular

625
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:51,970
product.

626
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,300
Three m will actually create a business
around people who come up with new

627
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:59,470
products and services.
Every single company today needs men and

628
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:04,450
women who are talented and who will stay
within the company with their talents

629
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,580
and skills,
but the same requirements that are

630
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:09,070
necessary for entrepreneurship,
innovation,

631
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,190
daring risk taking.
And so on are also required for

632
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:15,340
entrepreneurship.
Many of the people that we have studied

633
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:20,200
who have become extremely successful and
become extremely wealthy in business are

634
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,330
people who never started a business on
their own.

635
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,070
Seven common characteristics of 83 self
made millionaires in a 20 year study of

636
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:30,580
1500 men and women.
They followed them for something like 20

637
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,850
years to find out how well these men or
women would do in life.

638
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,840
Good question.
And they found at the end of the 20

639
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:41,890
years,
83 of the 1500 men and women had become

640
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:45,040
millionaires and they went back and they
studied the millionaires and they found

641
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,390
these qualities and characteristics.

642
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,730
They found out.
Number one is that none of them ever set

643
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,550
out simply to make money or to become
rich.

644
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,870
Many of the others who did not become
millionaires set out and they had one

645
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,090
goal in life and that was to make lots
of money.

646
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,860
I made it everything humanly possible in
that 20 years to make lots of money and

647
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:06,370
not one succeeded.
The ones who didn't set out to become

648
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:09,310
rich,
just set out to do something that they

649
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:13,750
really enjoyed and they became totally
absorbed in their work and the word that

650
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,790
they use throughout the study is
absorption.

651
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,080
And I pass this on to you because in
every case where I've seen a successful

652
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:23,440
man or woman in business,
they have been totally absorbed in what

653
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,080
they're doing.
They've just been completely involved.

654
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,660
They were not speculators or risk
takers.

655
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,070
There was not one investment scheme,
not one speculation,

656
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:35,590
not one gamble,
not one stock market method.

657
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,040
The only people who made money
consistently and became wealthy

658
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,770
consistently were the ones who are doing
an excellent job making a lot of money

659
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,320
and then holding onto the money when
they made it.

660
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,950
Sometimes they say success has a bigger
destroyer than failure.

661
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,890
We suddenly have successes and we
started throwing the money around and we

662
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,170
get into things that we don't know
anything about and then we get into

663
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,470
those things and they start sucking up
additional funds that we have,

664
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,500
but we can often go broke going down a
side road.

665
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,900
Most became millionaires almost
unknowingly.

666
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,370
One year their accountant said,
by the way,

667
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,080
do you know how much you're worth this
year for it?

668
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,501
And said,
no.

669
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,870
They said,
you're worth a million $100,000 it

670
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:11,840
couldn't believe it,
and finally they did not make their

671
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:15,080
money investing.
They made their money doing their work

672
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,650
and if they invested,
they invested their money in their work,

673
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,840
in their business,
in their own companies.

674
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,380
They didn't invest it outside.
The conclusion the researchers reached

675
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:26,570
after 20 years of study was simply,
this is it.

676
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,150
You'll always be most successful doing
what you most enjoy.

677
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,810
This is the greatest barometer doing
what you most enjoy.

678
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,310
Whenever you think of a business or if
even if you're in a business now and

679
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,140
we'll do some testing on this in a few
minutes,

680
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,480
you ask yourself this question,
do I really enjoy what I'm doing?

681
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,471
People say,
well,

682
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:44,150
I don't enjoy it,
but I'm going to stay at it till I make

683
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,630
a lot of money.
I remember a woman came to me and she

684
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,520
was having great trouble in the real
estate industry.

685
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,331
She said,
Brian,

686
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:52,250
I've done everything that you said.
I've set goals.

687
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,160
I've worked toward those goals.
I managed my time well and and so on and

688
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:57,260
said,
but I'm still not achieving anything

689
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,310
near what I want.
She said,

690
00:33:58,311 --> 00:33:59,660
I haven't sold the house in three
months.

691
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,531
I said,
well,

692
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:01,281
what is your goal?
She said,

693
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:04,520
I want to win the million dollar award.
I want to be the very top of the

694
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,770
multiple listing service.
I want to win that price.

695
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,621
I said,
well,

696
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:10,160
what would you do if you did win that
million dollar award?

697
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:10,971
She said,
Oh,

698
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:13,250
I'd quit this lousy business and get
into something I really liked.

699
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,251
I said,
well,

700
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,360
that's the problem.
She said,

701
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,260
well,
I hate this.

702
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,170
I hate real estate.
I hate selling house.

703
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,560
I hate the hours.
She said,

704
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,300
but I'm determined to stay in if I'm
successful,

705
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,450
and I explained to her that in every
single case,

706
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,910
if you don't love what you're doing,
you're not going to be successful at it.

707
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,100
The three keys are know what you're
doing,

708
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:35,060
become excellent in your chosen field,
believe in what you're doing and love

709
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,380
what you're doing.
Those three,

710
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:38,780
we'll guarantee you success more.
Sure.

711
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,870
Faster in life than any of the three
keys that I've ever seen in all the

712
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,160
literature.
Okay?

713
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,500
Five key abilities of successful
business people.

714
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:50,501
Number One,
judgment and judgment comes simply from

715
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,080
making mistakes and learning from them.
They say that every single wise,

716
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,230
intelligent,
mature individual was once young and

717
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,720
impetuous and foolish and did wicked,
senseless,

718
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,130
brainless,
cruel,

719
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,000
idiotic things.

720
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,150
That's how they became wise and mature.
It's scars and pain that make you wise

721
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,520
and put the little crinkles in your
corners.

722
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,120
So the key thing is not avoiding making
mistakes because you're going to make

723
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,100
mistakes,
but to learn from every mistake.

724
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,270
This is the hallmark of leaders.
They never use the word failure.

725
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,700
They'll use the word mistake though you
back.

726
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,600
They'll use glitch and they find that
the people who move ahead the fastest

727
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,160
are the ones who make the most mistakes
the earliest and learn the most lessons

728
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,620
from them.
Now the something about nature and the

729
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:40,080
business world,
it is very unrelenting in that if you

730
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,210
make a mistake in business and you don't
learn from it,

731
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,770
nature will enable you to make that
mistake again and if you don't learn

732
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,770
from it the second time in nature,
we'll keep putting you through that

733
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:53,700
hurdle or over that hoop and throwing
you flat on your face until you learn

734
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,050
the lesson and you say,
okay,

735
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:55,650
I got it.

736
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,900
I finally learned it.
I'm not going to do that anymore.

737
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,110
And then you have judgment,
then you have wisdom.

738
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,360
Then you go on to the next hurtle.
Remember,

739
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,870
the hurdles never stop.
The most successful multimillionaires

740
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,380
and billionaires that you read about in
the newspapers and the magazines have

741
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:11,670
fights,
struggles,

742
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,900
battles,
setbacks,

743
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,470
obstacles,
defeats disappointments every single

744
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,910
day.
The difference between winners and

745
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,130
losers is that winners pick themselves
up,

746
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:24,060
learn what they can salvage the very
best they can from it and carry on.

747
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,060
And losers think that these mistakes,
these setbacks,

748
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:30,090
these heartaches are happening to them
for the first time in history.

749
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,170
Watch for the trends.
Many successful business people say that

750
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,020
trend analysis is the most important
single skill of the business person,

751
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,410
which means foresight to think what's
likely to happen in the future as a

752
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:47,610
result of what is happening today.
Leadership is the ability to inspire,

753
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,460
to elicit extraordinary performance from
ordinary people.

754
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,970
Leadership is a key quality,
uh,

755
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,930
of successful business people.
And remember,

756
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:58,890
you can only inspire others to the
degree to which you are yourself

757
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:01,410
inspired and others,
you must be really excited about what

758
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:03,600
you're doing.
If you expect to inspire others to be

759
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:08,400
excited about helping you do what it is.
And all great businesses have inspiring

760
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:11,730
leaders at the head of the businesses.
Communications ability is absolutely

761
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,910
critical for successful business people,
which means three things.

762
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:17,220
The ability to interact effectively,
one on one,

763
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,940
the ability to make presentations,
to stand up in front of groups or to

764
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:25,740
make presentations to lenders or to make
presentations to customers and the

765
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:30,150
ability to write effectively.
Peter Drucker says the three key tools

766
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:33,660
of the executive are the report,
the presentation in the meeting.

767
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:36,180
And if you are poor at any one of those
areas of communications,

768
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,010
you owe it to yourself to become better.

769
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,330
Finally,
sales ability,

770
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,520
the ability to influence,
persuade,

771
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:46,170
motivate people to act in a certain way.
I'm always astonished when people come

772
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,490
to me and they say,
I want to start a business,

773
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,290
but a,
I need to get somebody who could sell

774
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,150
the product for me.
I tell them,

775
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,550
if you don't have somebody who can sell
the product for you,

776
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,040
don't put a penny into the business.
There's a thousands,

777
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,100
a million products out there that are
not moving because there's nobody to

778
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:01,770
sell them.
The ability to sell is one of the rarest

779
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:06,450
qualities in all of business enterprise
and all the big successful companies in

780
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,810
the world spend millions of dollars a
year training their salespeople.

781
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,320
So if you are not good at selling and
you want to start a business or you want

782
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:16,500
to build a business,
you owe it to yourself to become good at

783
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,110
it.
You owe it to yourself to back off and

784
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:22,950
take the time to practice because all
sales ability is learned.

785
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:23,911
Some people say,
well,

786
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,250
I've just don't have the gift of Gab or
I'm not a good salesman.

787
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,830
Nobody was a good typist when they
started.

788
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,480
Nobody could ride a bicycle when they
started.

789
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,130
Nobody could drive a car when they
started.

790
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,780
Nobody can run a computer when they
started.

791
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,770
Nobody could sell when they started
either.

792
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,230
They all learned.
The key is this,

793
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,020
is that if there are skills that are
essential for success,

794
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,350
your job is to learn those skills,
not to deny it,

795
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,141
not to delay it,
to,

796
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,000
not to put it off,
not to find excuses,

797
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,830
but if you want to be successful,
you have to do it.

798
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,020
Okay.
Career advancement strategies,

799
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,770
what do we call the niche?
Strategy is terribly important.

800
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,280
It's based on an enormous amount of
research I did at the university and

801
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:01,990
that other people had done and it is
looking at your business environment and

802
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,060
saying,
what are the critical parts of your

803
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:04,960
business environment?

804
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,110
What are the areas that represent your
areas of strength,

805
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,770
but especially what are your areas of
weakness in a business?

806
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:15,250
You will find that it's like a chain of
business always collapses,

807
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
always breaks.
At its weakest link,

808
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,020
the business always collapses at its
weakest point.

809
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,560
And in looking at the purpose of a
business,

810
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,470
we know that the purpose of a business
to create a customer is to serve a

811
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:30,040
customer efficiently and economically.
Cashflow is the lifeblood of an

812
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,990
enterprise.
So if you're working for a company,

813
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:35,110
one of the things you have to decide is
if I want to move ahead rapidly in this

814
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,390
company,
I have to get myself into an area in the

815
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,940
company that is vital to the survival of
the company.

816
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,670
Does that make sense?
Because if you're in an area of the

817
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,980
company that is irrelevant to the
survival of the company,

818
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,340
you can never become valuable and
important and highly paid and

819
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:49,174
responsible.

820
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,210
So what we do is we know that any
interruption to cashflow threatens the

821
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,910
survival of the enterprise.
So we look at where is the biggest

822
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,220
interruption to cashflow likely to come
from.

823
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,220
Now,
usually the most important function is

824
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,800
marketing.
The most important single function in an

825
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,560
organization is marketing.
If sales stop,

826
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,610
the business collapses.
60 to 80% of all businesses that run

827
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,440
into trouble run because sales slow
down.

828
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,110
If marketing is the key area in your
company,

829
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,660
you owe it to yourself to become great
at marketing,

830
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,030
to get into the marketing area,
get into sales,

831
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,610
get into strategic market and get into
the part of the company.

832
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,820
It's important.
The second part that may be important is

833
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:28,480
finance.
If the organization that you're with is

834
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:32,380
dependent upon financial institutions,
it has to borrow a lot of money.

835
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:34,360
It has to raise capital in the stock
market.

836
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,820
If that's the key to its success and
growth,

837
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,510
then you owe it to yourself to get into
that area because the company's growth

838
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,110
will be determined by how successful
they are and if you can be fundamentally

839
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,110
important in that area,
you can really dramatically increase

840
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,280
your value in a short period of time.
The production area is very interesting

841
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:55,180
and I read a study actually done by the
University of Alberta where they went

842
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:59,290
into a brewery and they were looking at
this idea of critical environments and

843
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,950
they found that in the brewery,
the most important single function in

844
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,980
the brewery was the production area that
the breweries,

845
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:08,680
customers,
we're pretty largely fixed they delivery

846
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,570
system.
The distribution system was pretty much

847
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:13,050
established.
Its market share was established it

848
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,390
manufactured beer and sold it on a
regular systematic basis.

849
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,050
The only thing that could cause the
shutdown of the organization and the

850
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,600
cutoff of cashflow was if the equipment
broke down.

851
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,460
Now the equipment was maintained by the
maintenance engineers had meant that the

852
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:30,220
head maintenance engineer,
it was the most important single person

853
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,080
in the company.
He was more important than the president

854
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,260
and the who was the head engineer was
the highest paid next to the president.

855
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,500
He had the greatest perks because if he
didn't do his job properly,

856
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,920
the whole company came to a halt.
And this is often the case in

857
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,530
organizations that depend on production
distribution.

858
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,630
Food distribution is very,
very important.

859
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,560
If it doesn't get to the stores on time,
you know if it gets to the store is a

860
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,930
week late,
sometimes it's too bad you have to throw

861
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,730
it away.
Another example is fashion.

862
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,330
The people in the fashion industry who
are in control of the distribution,

863
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:01,010
the outlets,
the stores that sell,

864
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:03,770
the fashions,
moving the fashions from production to

865
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,820
the stores as quickly as possible are
the people who are key in the fashion

866
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:08,150
industry.

867
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,940
Why is that?
Is Fashions are timely?

868
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,240
If you don't get it to the right source,
get it there six months later in perfect

869
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,490
condition is not quite good enough,
isn't it?

870
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,440
If it,
how about record distribution?

871
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,810
How about distribution of books or
anything else?

872
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:24,670
Anything that can become dated?
The distribution function is vital that

873
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:28,010
people who are essential in distribution
become the most valuable people in the

874
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:30,020
company.
Research is important.

875
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,630
Look at Silicon Valley.
What is the most important single

876
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,030
function in Silicon Valley?
There's making people millionaires.

877
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,970
It's research coming up with new
products and processes.

878
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:41,750
They know that the market will gobble up
all the new products that they can come

879
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:44,060
out with if the products will serve a
market need.

880
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,610
It is coming up with the products,
so it's the engineers,

881
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,800
the technicians,
the research and development specialists

882
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:49,880
that are getting paid.
One,

883
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:50,211
two,
three,

884
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:53,990
four,
$500,000 a year and of course regulatory

885
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,710
environment.

886
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,290
If you have to work with government,
look at in Washington DC,

887
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,200
jam with lobbyists,
Jim with representatives,

888
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:04,280
senior representatives of major
industries and industrial groups because

889
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,130
they require protection,
they require a tax benefits,

890
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,890
they require relaxation of environmental
controls and so on.

891
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,710
Those become absolutely vital elements
within a business and finally labor and

892
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:18,110
the people who are superb at dealing
with Labor are critical.

893
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,940
Now.
I only reason I point out these points

894
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,840
by the way,
marketing,

895
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:21,740
finance,
production,

896
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:22,670
distribution,
research,

897
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:27,590
regulatory and labor is that in every
business you will find by checking one

898
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:29,870
of these,
that if you're having troubles in your

899
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:31,730
business,
the weaknesses in one of these areas,

900
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,340
if it's in your own business or any
other company,

901
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,170
that you can use this as a checklist and
say,

902
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:38,600
where are we falling down?
Remember,

903
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:42,230
the company always collapses on the side
of the weakest pillar.

904
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,510
All right?
Knowledge is power,

905
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,060
specialized knowledge or skills and a
vital area.

906
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,930
Enhanced promotability control of vital
information is power.

907
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,050
The more I learn that makes me important
to that company,

908
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,510
the better off I am and I learned a very
good lesson.

909
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:59,870
Very early is learn all you can.
Never tell all you know.

910
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,740
If you tell all you know,
then what happens is they don't need you

911
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,660
anymore.
Strive for excellence.

912
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:09,710
Be the most knowledgeable person in your
chosen area within the organization.

913
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:13,940
Do it quietly and pretty soon the
rewards will start to flow to you.

914
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,740
Okay?
What are the reasons for business

915
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:18,860
failure?
In my estimation there are 14 major

916
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:20,930
reasons for business failure.
Number one,

917
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:23,750
reason for business failure,
lack of direction,

918
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:27,260
the failure to establish specific goals
and plans to achieve them.

919
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,740
If you don't have specific goals,
what you do is you become reactive.

920
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,230
You are either acting on your
environment or you are reacting.

921
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,950
Most companies in my estimation,
95% are in a reactive mode in that

922
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:45,930
they're not acting at all.
They're just simply reacting to what

923
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:50,010
happens every single day because they
don't have clear goals and plans to

924
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:53,220
achieve them.
Lack of a complete business plan is a

925
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:56,430
major reason for failure.
You know why that is is because the

926
00:44:56,431 --> 00:45:00,810
ability to put together a business plan
is a major act of business competence.

927
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,520
The reason people don't put them
together,

928
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,050
it's primarily because they don't know
how.

929
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,360
The reason that they fail is because
they don't know how.

930
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,970
When they develop the competence to put
together a business plan,

931
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,250
they also develop other competencies
that go with it.

932
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,310
Impatience is a major cause of business
failure.

933
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,870
Trying to do too much too soon,
trying to cover too much greed is a

934
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:20,430
major cause of business failure.

935
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,640
A very good friend of mine,
very successful consultants that Brian,

936
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,270
the secret to success in business is to
get rich slowly.

937
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,140
Don't try to get rich all at once.
Get rich a little bit at a time.

938
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,240
Do it slowly.
If you're going to get rich,

939
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,490
waiting an extra year isn't going to
hurt you.

940
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:40,170
More people lose their shirts because
they get involved in what you might call

941
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,600
a get rich quick scheme,
something that's going to make them rich

942
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,380
in hurry and they're not going to have
to do a lot of work so they plunge and

943
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:50,400
the plunge sets them back sometimes five
and 10 years in terms of their savings.

944
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,620
Number four,
action without thinking,

945
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,340
as Peter Drucker says,
is the cause of every failure.

946
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,660
Action without thinking impetuousness is
the cause of every failure and

947
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:03,480
especially not listening to your
intuition,

948
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,030
not listening to your gut feeling.

949
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,090
One of the most important things that
you have is intuition.

950
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,540
If you listen to your gut feeling,
it will almost always give you the right

951
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,580
answer,
especially with regard to people.

952
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,700
Do not ignore your intuition with regard
to other people.

953
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,910
Five for cost control,
overspending,

954
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,030
especially at the beginning,
almost invariably when people start a

955
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,040
business,
they will buy things that they would

956
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,290
never think of buying if they'd been in
business for six months.

957
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,700
Basic rule at the beginning of a
business is save every single penny.

958
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,310
The basic rule is simply this,
conserve cash,

959
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,040
conserve cash,
conserve cash every day.

960
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,440
Get up in the morning and say,
what can I do today to conserve cash?

961
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,220
Biggest mistakes that I've ever made in
business are plunging into two and three

962
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:47,100
and five year leases right at the
beginning of a business and then finding

963
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:49,770
that the business won't sustain it.
Poor quality of product,

964
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,720
nothing will sink of business faster.

965
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,570
It's difficult to sell and it's
difficult to get repeat business.

966
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,680
Many people think,
well,

967
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:57,180
if it's,
it may not be a very good product,

968
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,370
but uh,
I'll sell lots of it and then I'll make

969
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:00,750
some money and then I'll do something
else.

970
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,350
The fact is that the more you advertise
a poor product,

971
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,680
the less it works.
The more you advertise a good product,

972
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,920
the better it works.
So don't ever handle a poor quality

973
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:13,710
product.
Don't ever justify trying to sell a poor

974
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:17,100
quality product because it's going to
come back to haunt you in sufficient

975
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:19,920
working capital,
which means an expectation of immediate

976
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,870
cash flow.
The biggest mistake that people make is

977
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:25,470
they think that they're going to have
positive cashflow in 30 to 60 days.

978
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,690
They talked to people and people
reassure them.

979
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,180
I think it's going to be all right.
And the key there to remember is that if

980
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,860
you set a break even point,
you need six months capital in order to

981
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:36,340
open up.

982
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,570
If you don't have six months of capital,
then open up on a smaller scale and

983
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:43,480
second of all take whatever you consider
to be your break even point.

984
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,340
So you think you're going to break even
in three months.

985
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,610
Multiply that times three.
The law of three comes out in every

986
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:55,270
single study of business,
in every single product or process.

987
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,230
Always take your most conservative,
most reasonable break even point and

988
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,890
multiply it by three is that far more
realistic and make sure you have enough

989
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:06,670
capital to last that long.
Number eight is bad or nonexistent.

990
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:09,400
Budgeting,
failure to develop pro formas and

991
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:13,450
budgets for operations.
Many people actually start a business

992
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:17,740
and embark upon what we call guaranteed
losses because they haven't done

993
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:20,290
budgeting and they haven't worked out
how much it's going to cost and how much

994
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,470
they're going to have to pay.
They haven't worked out that they're

995
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,940
making a loss on every single item that
they're selling.

996
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,620
You've heard the old saying of the
phone,

997
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:28,330
he says,
I lose money on every item I sell,

998
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:32,710
but I make it up on the volume.
Do you know how many business people

999
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,750
actually operate on that and because
instead of sitting down and doing a pro

1000
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,700
forma working out all their costs,
all their expenses and how much they're

1001
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:45,790
likely to have at the end in terms of
profits,

1002
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,240
they find that in many cases they don't
have any profits at all and yet they're

1003
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:50,980
working their heart out.
They can't understand they're doing so

1004
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:53,590
much business but they're going broke
day by day.

1005
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,120
So just the fact that you draw up
budgets and pro formas is a very,

1006
00:48:58,121 --> 00:48:59,980
very good discipline and we'll show you
how to do that later.

1007
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,400
Inadequate financial records,
most accountants will tell you surest

1008
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:05,830
way to go broke is to treat your
bookkeeping as though it were an

1009
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:09,670
irrelevant sideline through all your
receipts in a box and get to them at the

1010
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,503
end of the year.

1011
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,890
One of the things which I do recommend,
by the way,

1012
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:14,020
if there's,
if you're not good at bookkeeping,

1013
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,280
don't do it.
Hire somebody else.

1014
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,040
Number 10 major reasons for business
failure,

1015
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,130
loss of momentum in the sales
department,

1016
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,660
which leads to a loss of cashflow and
the collapse of the business venture.

1017
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:27,670
So number one reason for business
failure.

1018
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,100
Yes,
people get too busy doing other things

1019
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,670
and they think that sales will just keep
on coming in and Lo and behold,

1020
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,950
sales are like watering a pump.
You're going with that.

1021
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:38,410
You keep pumping the pump and the water
keeps flowing.

1022
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,030
What happens if you stopped pumping the
pump?

1023
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,420
The water stops flowing with sales and
marketing,

1024
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:44,890
you have to be pumping that pump all the
time.

1025
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,760
The instant that the strong executives,
the most important people take their

1026
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:50,890
hands off that pump.
The sales and marketing effort just

1027
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:53,380
burns to a halt and the whole company
falls apart.

1028
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,330
I worked for two companies now that got
so carried away with their success that

1029
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:02,350
they became administrative companies and
they felt that sales but just come to

1030
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:05,080
them because they had established
themselves in the marketplace.

1031
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,730
Now,
it was a matter of setting up

1032
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:09,070
administrative systems within nine
months.

1033
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:13,320
One company that went from zero to $3
million in business in four years that

1034
00:50:13,321 --> 00:50:15,490
men are worked all their lives for that
opportunity.

1035
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,680
They built their company.
They had made it in life.

1036
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,740
Nine months later they were dead.
I business consultant came in and told

1037
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:21,910
them,
what you have to do now is where do you

1038
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:24,580
work on administration?
Set up your internal systems,

1039
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:26,680
your internal controls.
I got so carried away with it.

1040
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,490
Nine months later,
the company was dead.

1041
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,940
All the top salespeople left and the
market has turned their back on them and

1042
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,530
walked away.
Well,

1043
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,740
failure to anticipate market trends,
changes in demand,

1044
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,860
changes in customer preference,
changes in the economic situation.

1045
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,100
When gasoline prices go up,
what's that going to do when interest

1046
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:44,630
rates go up?
What's that going to do when the real

1047
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:48,200
estate industry increases or decreases?
What does it going to do to your

1048
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,390
business?
Watching economic trends is very

1049
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:53,360
important.
Number 12 lack of managerial ability or

1050
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:55,700
experience.
People just simply don't have the

1051
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:57,530
experience or the ability to be in
business.

1052
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,680
People don't know what they're doing.
They don't understand about pro farmers.

1053
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:02,900
I don't understand about budgets.
They don't understand about selling or

1054
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,210
marketing or advertising and long
behold,

1055
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,370
most cases,
they won't take any advice either.

1056
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,600
So you can always get experience or
ability if you do it slowly,

1057
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:16,010
but if you try to do it all at once,
what you do is instead of accelerating

1058
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:18,170
your career,
you set yourself back five or 10 years

1059
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,490
didn't decisiveness is a major reason
for failure.

1060
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,340
The inability to make decisions in the
face of difficulties.

1061
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:28,580
Things start to go wrong and what do you
do is you put off making hard decisions.

1062
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,580
Another thing is inability to make
decisions,

1063
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,820
delaying decisions because of fear of
hurting people's feelings,

1064
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,610
keeping on incompetent people,
staying in business.

1065
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:41,870
Relationships that aren't working for
fear of hurting somebody's feelings is

1066
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:45,770
one of the major causes for failure in
small and medium sized businesses.

1067
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,920
Isn't that interesting?
Interesting statistic came out of some

1068
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:52,250
very large consulting studies that were
done a few years ago is that if we

1069
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:56,030
cannot immediately cut off the deadwood
and keep working with only people who

1070
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,300
can do the job,
chances are they'll drag a sender and

1071
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,440
afterwards you know what they'll hate
you for having kept them on for so long.

1072
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,170
Bad human relations with staff,
suppliers,

1073
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:08,720
creditors,
95% of all business failures come from

1074
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:11,090
an inability to get along with other
people.

1075
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,750
Number 14 which underlies everything is
diffusion of effort,

1076
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,990
lack of priorities,
going off on tangents and the inability

1077
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:21,590
to concentrate on doing the right things
and doing things one at a time.

1078
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,360
Now,
what are the reasons for business

1079
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:24,830
success?
So there's 10 reasons for business

1080
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,690
success,
many of which are the converse of the

1081
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:30,560
reasons for business failure.
Number one is the product or service is

1082
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:33,590
well suited to the needs and
requirements of the current market.

1083
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,440
Very important.
Number two is there is a complete

1084
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:39,680
business plan developed before
commencing business operations.

1085
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,190
The development of a business plan,
although it is laborious,

1086
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,620
is a sign of managerial competence.
It tells you and it tells the world that

1087
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:52,190
you're qualified to start a business.
The inability or unwillingness to

1088
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:54,740
develop a plan tells the world that you
are not competent.

1089
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,090
Number three,
a complete market analysis is followed

1090
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:02,360
by a development of an advertising,
promotion and sales program.

1091
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,820
In other words,
you sit down and you determine who is

1092
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:06,260
your competitor,
who is your market,

1093
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:07,910
where do you sell,
who buys,

1094
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,740
why they buy,
what benefits they buy,

1095
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:12,050
what you do better,
where you're going to sell to and so on,

1096
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,000
which we'll talk about in a subsequent
session.

1097
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,700
Uh,
and then you design your sales programs

1098
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:18,230
and work it out.
Let me give you an example.

1099
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,820
I went,
sat down with a person who was going to

1100
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,630
open a store in a shopping center and we
went through the financial analysis.

1101
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:25,350
I was trying to lease them in the space.
As a matter of fact,

1102
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,070
I went through the financial analysis
and it turned out that that person would

1103
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:33,330
have to have something like 38 customers
a day,

1104
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:38,331
spending an average of $25 per person in
order to survive selling the products

1105
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:41,280
that they were selling.
And their average sale was $12 per

1106
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:41,940
person.

1107
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,180
And it was a small rural shopping center
and they would never be able to survive.

1108
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,730
I just worked him through it based on
what you have to sell in order to

1109
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,080
survive.
You're not gonna be able to do it in

1110
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,820
this location.
And he said,

1111
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:51,511
no,
no,

1112
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:51,931
no.
He said,

1113
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,600
you don't understand.
And he opened the store anyway and he

1114
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:57,630
lost five years to say it went broke six
months later.

1115
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,900
So the financial analysis and the
marketing analysis is important.

1116
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,240
Tight financial controls,
good budgeting,

1117
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,810
accurate bookkeeping and accounting.
The basic rule to remember and running a

1118
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:09,780
business and I've worked with some of
the most successful business people in

1119
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:12,660
the world is frugality,
frugality,

1120
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,580
frugality,
cheap,

1121
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,690
cheap,
cheap,

1122
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,530
pinch every penny until it screams,
be very,

1123
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:21,090
very careful.
As we said before,

1124
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,740
conserve cash.
Go cheap,

1125
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,950
every single penny that you possibly can
buy used equipment,

1126
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,750
used furniture,
use carpeting,

1127
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:29,280
rent,
youth space and so on would be very,

1128
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,480
very careful about expenses.

1129
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,920
A high degree of competence,
capability and integrity on the part of

1130
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:36,960
the key staff.
Very important.

1131
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,220
Hire only the people you need and hire
people who can do what you need them to

1132
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:44,190
do.
Don't try to train people on the job,

1133
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:46,200
especially in a small and medium sized
business.

1134
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,080
Good internal efficiency,
good time management,

1135
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,960
clear job descriptions,
clear and measurable output

1136
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:53,460
responsibilities.
In other words,

1137
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:55,560
everybody knows what they're supposed to
do,

1138
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,040
knows the most important things they're
supposed to get done and manages their

1139
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:02,730
time well in order to do it.
Number seven is determination,

1140
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:06,030
persistence and patience on the part of
the business owners,

1141
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,450
the business principles.
Number eight is good communications

1142
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:13,140
amongst the staff and open door policy.
The better.

1143
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:15,630
The communications,
the more everybody knows within an

1144
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:18,480
organization they better that
organisation functions.

1145
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,600
We find that in every single case where
you have a problem organization,

1146
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:25,110
you have secrecy,
you have poor communications amongst the

1147
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:26,370
staff,
poor communications,

1148
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:27,204
up and down.

1149
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,480
People are playing it.
Cool and your big companies like IBM and

1150
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,970
Hewlett Packard,
everybody's on a first name basis.

1151
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,270
Everybody can have any information they
need in order to do their job well.

1152
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:40,080
Number nine,
strong momentum in the sales department

1153
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:45,081
and an emphasis on marketing.
Everybody thinks marketing all the time,

1154
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:50,670
which leads us to number 10 a concern
for the customer at all times is a top

1155
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:53,430
priority.
Every single successful company that

1156
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:57,300
I've ever seen has one characteristic
amongst all the people in that company.

1157
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,320
It's love for the customer,
love for the customer.

1158
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:04,320
They love their customers.
They are very concerned if a customer

1159
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:06,210
has a problem or a complaint or a
difficulty,

1160
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,940
they're are very,
very concerned about it and you'll find

1161
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:11,280
that right from the switchboard all the
way through.

1162
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:14,610
When you call a good company,
they treat you like you're really,

1163
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:15,444
really important.

1164
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,480
I used to work for a large department
store chain that subsequently had a lot

1165
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:22,590
of financial problems.
The clerks would be so busy doing their

1166
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,660
busy work behind the counters that when
a customer actually came along,

1167
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:28,870
they'd be irritated.
They look up as though you were actually

1168
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:31,750
interrupting them.
They had lost all sight of the fact that

1169
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,910
all of the arrangement of the counters
and the mirror,

1170
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,710
today's and everything else was for the,
when the customer came in and what

1171
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,690
happens is they treat customers in
differently.

1172
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,580
They'd say,
oh Geeze,

1173
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:43,240
well I can't do that now.
I'm going on coffee,

1174
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,730
or could you hurry up?
It's almost my lunch break.

1175
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,750
I was doing some consulting with a firm
just last week where the manager was

1176
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:52,540
appalled.
Somebody came in to buy $800 worth of

1177
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:56,380
merchandise at a quarter to five that
had to be installed and it took about 20

1178
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:58,360
minutes to install it and the person
says,

1179
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:00,580
I'm sorry we can't take the business.

1180
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,810
You'll have to come back tomorrow
because we shut down at five o'clock and

1181
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:08,390
it takes 20 minutes to install it.
They turned an $800 customer or ways

1182
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,960
that we never know,
never knew where that customer ever came

1183
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,730
back or not.
But uh,

1184
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,580
it was certainly disconcerting to find
that there are people doing that.

1185
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:18,970
We spend a fortune advertising to get
them to come in and they come in and

1186
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:22,330
they want to buy and we tell them to go
away because it's just not convenient

1187
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,550
right now.
Do you know what the person had to do?

1188
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,870
They had to go drinking at five o'clock
with their buddies and they didn't want

1189
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:32,350
to be late.
So be very careful about that.

1190
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:34,000
Those are the reasons for business
success.

1191
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,790
Now what we're going to do is a very
brief exercise.

1192
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:40,210
I'm going to ask you to answer some
questions and these questions are very

1193
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:40,690
important.

1194
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,550
They're important for now.
They're important for tomorrow,

1195
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:46,810
they're important for the future,
and they enable you to focus on the very

1196
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:50,770
most important things that you could or
should be doing within your business.

1197
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,240
And I'm going to give you one minute to
answer each of these questions and I

1198
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:56,950
want you to write them as fast as you
can.

1199
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:58,930
Write the first things that come to your
mind.

1200
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:02,320
Don't think about it.
The first number one question is list

1201
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:07,710
five jobs or fulltime activities paid or
unpaid that you have done in your life.

1202
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,380
Let's the first five that come to mind.
Just five jobs or full time activities.

1203
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:14,290
Anything that you've done,
whether it's been paid charitable,

1204
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,110
whether it's been in school,
whether it's been a with a social

1205
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:21,250
organisation politically right.
The first five fulltime activities that

1206
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,080
you have engaged in since you left high
school,

1207
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,710
however many you have now go quickly to
question number two and write down the

1208
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:34,210
one thing that you enjoy most about each
job or fulltime activity and the order

1209
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,200
that you wrote the jobs.

1210
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,740
Write down what you enjoyed the most.
What parts of the work did you enjoy?

1211
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:41,890
What Park gave you the greatest amount
of satisfaction in that work?

1212
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:44,050
When you look back on it,
what makes your heart glow,

1213
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:47,170
if you like or makes you happy when you
remember that particular activity?

1214
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,650
I go to question number three again,
thinking back over the jobs,

1215
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,350
what did you do best in each job or
activity?

1216
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,640
What were you best at?
What part of the job or activity did you

1217
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:02,920
do the best for you,
the most capable?

1218
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:04,930
And if you were doing five or 10
different things,

1219
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,980
what part of it did you excel at?
But part of it where you at the very

1220
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:10,690
best at your performance,
your skills,

1221
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:13,000
your capability,
where the very finest and that

1222
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:16,000
particular area of the job.
Now go to question number four.

1223
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,140
What was your major accomplishment in
each of those jobs are fulltime

1224
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,033
activities?

1225
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,530
What one thing did you accomplish?
Why is it a technical thing?

1226
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:27,500
Was it an interpersonal thing?
What thing did you achieve that you

1227
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:30,650
remember the most as being the highlight
of that job?

1228
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,880
Uh,
or activity?

1229
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,220
Just think through if in in retrospect
the one thing that you did or the one

1230
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:40,640
thing that you accomplished or achieved
successfully in that job.

1231
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,600
Even if it was just learning the lesson,
uh,

1232
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:45,680
learning something important,
something of value that you got

1233
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:47,330
additional training,
whatever it happens to be,

1234
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,620
write it out as quickly as you can.
All right,

1235
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,380
go on to the next question wherever you
are going to the next question.

1236
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:57,560
Now list five activities,
experiences,

1237
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,750
events,
or situations in your life that have

1238
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:04,460
given you immense personal satisfaction,
a feeling of importance of self liking

1239
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,800
and self worth.
It could have been getting married.

1240
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:08,570
It could have been getting a degree or
graduate.

1241
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,660
It could've been anything,
right?

1242
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,960
The first five that come to mind as
quickly as possible.

1243
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,140
My question number six if you could have
any job or be in any business,

1244
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,330
what do you think you would enjoy the
most?

1245
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,440
Imagine a billionaire who control a
variety of organizations came up to you

1246
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:27,620
and said you could have any job you
wanted or be in any business in the

1247
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:29,840
world.
Which one would you choose?

1248
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:31,970
What job would you want?
Would you want to work for someone else?

1249
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,970
Who would you want to work for yourself?
If you wanted to work for yourself,

1250
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:37,940
what business would you want to be in?
What sort of position would you like to

1251
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:39,170
have in that business?
Right?

1252
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:42,260
The very first thing that comes to mind.
All right,

1253
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:45,500
question number seven.
How much do you want to be earning in

1254
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:48,110
one year?
In three years and five years?

1255
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,820
In 10 years.
Very,

1256
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:54,050
very important that you have an idea of
what these figures are and don't be too

1257
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,320
concerned about how correct or how
accurate you are.

1258
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,120
Just write down what you consider to be
a reasonable goal to achieve in the next

1259
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:02,954
one,
three,

1260
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,980
five,
10 years.

1261
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:08,360
The wonderful thing about that is that
95% of people walking around,

1262
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,780
we'll never write down a financial goal
and their whole life and they cannot

1263
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,270
understand why they did not improve
their financial conditions.

1264
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:19,100
The very taking of that exercise that
you just did moves you into the top 5%

1265
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,240
in the world in terms of future planning
and you will be astonished.

1266
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:26,750
I've had people take that exercise and
never look at it again till two years

1267
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:29,210
later and then open it up and look at it
and say,

1268
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:32,360
by dog gone it.
They have achieved those financial

1269
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,310
goals.
Just writing it down,

1270
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,340
programmed it into the brain and over
the previous two years,

1271
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,920
the opportunities to achieve the
financial goals came to them.

1272
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,440
All right.
Question number eight and the final

1273
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:43,460
question in this session.

1274
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:49,120
Imagine that we had a bottle of pills
that guaranteed you against failure and

1275
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:53,990
the question is this,
what one great thing would you dare to

1276
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:58,610
attempt if you knew you could not fail,
each of you would get one of these

1277
01:01:58,611 --> 01:01:59,720
pills,
you can take this pill,

1278
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:04,750
you'd be guaranteed of success 100% of
any one thing that you attempted in your

1279
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:08,150
world,
especially in your business and your

1280
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:11,870
career world,
like one great thing would you aim for

1281
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,840
if you absolutely knew beyond a doubt
that you could not fail,

1282
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,610
right?
The first thing that comes to mind,

1283
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:22,990
the answers to the on what jobs you did,
what you accomplished in those jobs,

1284
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:27,720
what you enjoyed most will be a very,
very good indicator of what you should

1285
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:30,810
be doing in terms of your work,
in terms of your career,

1286
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:34,440
in terms of your future planning.
Very often we find ourselves doing

1287
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:37,590
something later in life,
which is very different from all the

1288
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,830
things that gave us joy and satisfaction
at earlier periods in our life.

1289
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,650
And we wonder why we are not excited
when they get up in the morning.

1290
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,000
The key is to go back and look at the
things that you've done before that

1291
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:51,000
really made you happy.
They really made you feel great about

1292
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,740
yourself,
that gave you a feeling of importance

1293
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,130
and self esteem and try to structure
your activities.

1294
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,840
So you're doing work,
uh,

1295
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,900
kind of work with the kind of products
and the kind of people in the kind of

1296
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:05,730
environment that recreates those
experiences that for you are unique and

1297
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:07,920
that will enable you to achieve
everything you're capable of achieving

1298
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:08,370
in business.
