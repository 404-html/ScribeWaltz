1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,280
All results.
Reasons don't count.

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,200
Parks will always point out reasons on
why they are not living their dream on

3
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,540
why they are not manifesting their
greatness.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,620
They will always be able to point those
things out,

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,730
but none of those things count.
The only thing that counts or results

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,790
and results don't lie.
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,660
they tell it all judge a tree by the
fruit that it bears,

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,650
not the ones that it might talk about,
not the ones that it might wish for,

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,680
but the fruit that it actually bears.
The people that are committed are busy

10
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,350
doing it,
but I think that some of us are

11
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,960
producing results in our lives that that
level of commitment brains that we

12
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,890
particularly don't like or find is
tasteful.

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,460
You want to take care of yourself.
I don't think that as a participant in

14
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,070
life,
you cannot be committed.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,320
You either committed to mediocrity or
you're committed to greatness.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,800
You're either committed to being
productive or you're committed to being

17
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,900
nonproductive.
You committed to being happy,

18
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,901
or you're committed to being unhappy.
Once I look at how you commit your time

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,760
one time doing an evaluation on how you
spend your time.

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,710
I can tell you exactly what you're
committed to.

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,430
People that say they have dreams or one
open a business or want to do something

22
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:37,070
differently than what they're now doing.
They don't like their jobs.

23
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,510
They're unhappy,
they're unfulfilled.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,300
People said they want to improve their
income level.

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,260
Look at how they spend their time.
Commitment shows up in your life and

26
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,094
what you do.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,703
Yeah,

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,160
you can make the commitment to your
life,

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,550
but you don't like the results that you
have and that you're going to do

30
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:56,480
something about it.
See,

31
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:01,481
that power is available to all of us.
People who look at life and decide,

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,580
I want something different for myself.
So most people like them using the

33
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,480
language,
they don't want to commit themselves

34
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,240
because commitment means among many
things.

35
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,910
No,
it's stills is acceptable.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,400
You decided that you want to Jill this
if it becomes pop and then do it if it

37
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,880
difficult,
if it's inconvenient.

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,760
So what?
What would your life be like if you

39
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,450
decided to keep your commitments?
What we'll all have our lives be like if

40
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,410
we decided to keep our commitments that
we decided to do the things that we said

41
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,170
that we were going to do,
but we wouldn't even speak it unless we

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,130
were going to do it
right.

43
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,170
I will do anything unless I'm going to
do it.

44
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,830
At the end of the seven days,
you'll feel strong and powerful.

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,480
There's nothing as powerful as the human
spiritual,

46
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,410
Qantas,
it.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,710
When you are committed,
you're dancing to the beat of a

48
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,250
different drummer.
Don't expect people to understand.

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,620
Don't expect it to make sense to
anybody.

50
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,340
Why you got to do this?
Why do you have got to go?

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,180
Why did you leave this as a good job?
They take you away

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,290
from retirement.
I'm going,

53
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,550
why?
I don't understand.

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,570
You don't have to

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,880
look to this day for it is life.
The very life of light in its brief

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,580
costs lie,
all the realities and their of

57
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,230
existence,
the bliss of growth,

58
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,070
the splendor of action,
the glory of power for yesterday is but

59
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,320
a dream.
And tomorrow is only a vision.

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,740
But today,
the day well lived makes every yesterday

61
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:52,360
a dream of happiness.
And every tomorrow a vision of hope.

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,090
Look well.
Therefore to this day.
