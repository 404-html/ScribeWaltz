1
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,910
A messenger of Satan
to buffet

2
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,470
me less.
I should be exalted above measure.

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,500
I want to talk to you from the subject
sparring partner.

4
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,150
You know what a sparring partner is.
It's somebody that you box with in

5
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:41,980
preparation for a fight,
and if you are a fighter,

6
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,030
a sparring partner is a gift
because if you don't have a sparring

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,350
partner,
you won't be ready for the real fight.

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,290
But as foreign partner may hitch made
hurts,

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,590
made challenge.
Just because you got hit doesn't mean it

10
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:06,424
was the devil.

11
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,450
I want to pray.
Let me let me and then I've jumped on

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,700
it.
Hose figured out.

13
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,630
Thank you for this opportunity to share
the word and speak to your people today.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,050
I thank you for what to keep Matt
Tracer,

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,380
which again,
I respect what she gave out on her.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,650
When you get me,
I'm blessed because he said anything to

17
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,550
me.
Give me the ability to articulate

18
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:42,220
effectively what you have shared with me
in such a profound,

19
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:46,330
at that didactic way,
the people's lives are better because

20
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:51,331
they have shared this moment with Uli.
Speak Lord for that servant heareth in

21
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,070
Jesus' name.
Amen.

22
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,623
You may be seated.

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,390
So I went to the movies the other day
and uh,

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,360
I went to see cream.
I know I'm late,

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,680
but I went to see Craig,
you know,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,650
with Sylvester Stallone and Michael B.
Jordan and it,

27
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,750
and,
and,

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
and it was really,
really,

29
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:20,890
it was really,
to me,

30
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,650
it was a great movie,
just unbelievable movie,

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,930
but the movie's scissors around a young
man with potential

32
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,490
and trying to get semesters stallone's
character to train him to continue the

33
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,680
excellence and the legacy of his
predecessor,

34
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:45,280
his father.
In the process of training,

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,480
he is facing a daunting task of being
trained in adverse environments so that

36
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,780
when he gets to the stage,
nothing that is thrown at him,

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,130
we'll toss him away from the victory,
but will enable him to accomplish what

38
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:08,260
he was set out to do.
I wanted to bring it up because

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
I thought of it when I read what Paul
wrote because Paul is coming to the end

40
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
of a summarization of how blessed he is,
how much God has done for him,

41
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,370
the depth of revelation that he has and
how much God has spoken into his life.

42
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,650
And right on the heels of a dissertation
about whether in the body or in the

43
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,090
spirit.
I cannot tell us.

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,620
I knew a man who saw things that were
not lawful to be uttered and mostly

45
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,570
alone.
Just think that he actually is referring

46
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,050
to himself,
but to cast the light off of himself.

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,250
He speaks in third person.
But in reality he's saying the abundance

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,480
revelation was given to me.
It was given to me.

49
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,690
Look at the abundance that was given to
you.

50
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,130
I was ministering to somebody the other
day and it was a young man kind of

51
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,120
depressed over his relationship with his
father.

52
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,760
And when I begin to talk to him,
I said,

53
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,400
you talk to me about what you don't
have,

54
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,640
but you say nothing about what she's
doing.

55
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,810
Look at the infrastructure that God put
all around you to subsidize and replace

56
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:20,170
what you didn't get.

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,250
Look at all the people who love and feed
and care for you,

58
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,300
and maybe we will never be your father,
but we,

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,190
we represent the sum total of God's
commitment to get love to you.

60
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,890
Even if he had to bring it in another
way.

61
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,730
And when I got to tell him all of his
assets,

62
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,640
it balanced against his liability.
See,

63
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:46,900
life is a combination of assets and
liabilities.

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,190
And we see and we want,
and we crave the assets,

65
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,040
but we are not prepared for the
liabilities.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,710
Every advancement will cost you
everything you've accomplished.

67
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,210
You pay the price for it,
for every accomplishment that exist in

68
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,210
your life.
And every victory and every revelation

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,530
and every,
uh,

70
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,860
economic blessing,
every kind of physical blessing,

71
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,861
every type of emotional blessing there.
There's always something that balances

72
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,430
it out,
lets you be exalted above measure.

73
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,090
I want you to understand that it is not
just God.

74
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,470
When the blessing comes,
it is also God.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,250
When the buffet or the enemy cubs,
Paul says,

76
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,720
this was a gift to me,
a messenger of Satan

77
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,170
take with me a messenger of Satan was a
Gif to me.

78
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,820
My problem,
and everybody's got one.

79
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,150
Everybody's got something to kick.
Kick.

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,410
Everybody's got something.
You be,

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,570
everybody's got something that you
struggle with,

82
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,270
it let you wrestle with.
It can be insecurity and can be an

83
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,710
intimidation.
It could be.

84
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,970
Fear is,
it'd be about,

85
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,220
it can be low self esteem.
It could be anger,

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,400
it could be everybody has their uniquely
designed devil,

87
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,710
but Paul says,
this was given to me.

88
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,800
Why wouldn't God gives you or sin a
messenger of say the first of all,

89
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,950
let me stop there and talk about how I'm
glad to know that if he access me,

90
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,510
God had to allow it.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,423
Okay?

92
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,670
The good news is he couldn't just come
at me all his old,

93
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,340
the very fact that he came at me,
men that he had to get permission to get

94
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,860
near it.
Now that's good for me because it lets

95
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:53,861
me know that God is in control,
that the devil has not been able to do

96
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,831
whatever he wanted to do in my life,
but I live in a controlled environment

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,820
and soda.
You are controlled environment,

98
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,160
a controlled environment.
God controls how hot it gets,

99
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,720
how cold it gets,
how much suffering you go through,

100
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,030
how many blessings you have.
He control.

101
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:22,031
You will not let allow your haters,
your [inaudible],

102
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,430
your lace,
eight years to get their hands on the

103
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:33,380
control switch of your life.
If it I accessed you,

104
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,740
be it good or bad,
right or wrong,

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
up or down,
evil or card.

106
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,520
If it got to you at all,
it had to have permission because you

107
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,354
are kept.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,510
Oh,
you are?

109
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,630
Look at some ads up and kept.
I been,

110
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,390
I been framed it.
I,

111
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,230
I,
I'm a gated community.

112
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,970
You can't just drive up on me.
You have to ring a bell and get

113
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:14,430
permission.
I'm David.

114
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,550
I got boundaries.
I got walls around me.

115
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,930
Don't you remember how when in the book
of job does,

116
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,580
the Bible said when the subject,
God came around the throat,

117
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,930
a Muslim came Satan and he said,
where have you been trading going to and

118
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,970
fro,
in and out throughout the earth.

119
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,820
And God said,
have you considered my servant job?

120
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,960
And say,
they said,

121
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,630
now you know you got
a hedge around.

122
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,400
Do you not know all the sisters?
My sisters make some noise.

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,940
All the to tell somebody I'm going kep
lover.

124
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,920
I'm a kept woman.
He got fences around me.

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,040
He's got various around his trophy wife.
I've reserve well taken care of.

126
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,560
He opens doors.
He makes ways he controls who comes in,

127
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,600
who goes out.
I'm a kept woman.

128
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,690
What my brothers at make some noise.
He's keeping me too.

129
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,780
He kept the gun from board off.
He kept the car from crashing.

130
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,090
He kept me from losing my mind.
He kept me from throwing in the towel.

131
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,790
He kept me from being locked up in a
jail cell.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,630
He kept it from being at this stage and
age in my life.

133
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,620
I wouldn't be here right now if God
hadn't kept me,

134
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,550
I no,
but

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,800
whatever
access this lead has to give permission

136
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,010
because I know I look gay.
Community.

137
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,820
I'm a gated community.
You can't just walk up on this

138
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,493
trade.
Just walk

139
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,820
trouble.
Jane's doing sickness.

140
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,460
Can't do it.
The Preston kid blew it.

141
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,540
Fear of kate do it.
You can't just walk up on this property.

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,440
This is God's property from the crown of
my head to the soles of my feet.

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,290
This is God's property.
In fact,

144
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,060
if you 5 million,
not even

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,970
the Mama lists the Lord because I'm
Kevin.

146
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,460
If the enemy comes,
he has to have permission to do it and

147
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,890
Paul says,
it was given to me

148
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,460
a messenger of Satan,
thorn in my flesh,

149
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,880
a messenger of Satan
to buffet me.

150
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,680
If God says the Messenger of Satan to
buffet me,

151
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,810
whatever he is trying to do in my life
is bigger than what he use to buffer it.

152
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:11,561
Lead
I am saying the big tree,

153
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:16,781
then it's not in.
Getting rid of the for the colon is a

154
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:21,981
blessing to keep you from some enemy
that is worse than the corn.

155
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,330
The thorn is how God treats you to
balance you,

156
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,590
to stop you from getting too impressed
with yourself.

157
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,410
He's an to bless you so that if I didn't
break you anywhere,

158
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,560
the blessing would go so far in your
head that you would give besides

159
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:51,561
yourself,
because I hate pride above everything

160
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:55,840
else in the world.
Yet I want to bless you.

161
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm going to bless you,
but to stop you from being proud of

162
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:01,870
yourself.
I'm going to give you something that

163
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,070
makes you drop your head.

164
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,840
I want to talk to you this morning about
the thing that makes you drop your head.

165
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,010
When people compliment you,
the thing that stops you from really

166
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,520
taking it all live,
something that you know about yourself,

167
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,050
realize about yourself,
some deficiency,

168
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,190
some area of brokenness in your life
that humbles you may not be spiritual

169
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:32,000
warfare.
It may in fact be a gift from God to

170
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,990
control your character,
to give you common control,

171
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,860
to stop you from being judgmental about
other people,

172
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,100
to get rid of your arrogant demeanor.
God will send a messenger from Satan to

173
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:49,040
buffet your flesh.

174
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
Who in the world would think that the
apostle Paul,

175
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,800
who was healing the sick and raising the
dead and writing most of the epistles

176
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,810
for the New Testament church,
the Bible sees he was getting beat up

177
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,180
all the time,
getting beat up,

178
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,190
writing,
preaching,

179
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,560
laying hands,
healing the sick,

180
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,720
raising the dead,
but secretly,

181
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,600
secretly,
somewhere in your life.

182
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,920
You can punch right now somewhere in
your life.

183
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,580
You're getting hit right now somewhere
in your life.

184
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,390
You're up under attack right now.
Have some of you think the victory is

185
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,330
stop the attack,
but the Lord gave me a message this

186
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:43,410
morning to tell you that the attack is
your blessing.

187
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,410
I'm going to mess with you that I'm a
mess with here today.

188
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,410
I'll go left.
Tell your neighbor the attack is my

189
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,230
blessing.
Yeah.

190
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I want you to see that
it was sent

191
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,120
to buffet me.

192
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,160
The word buffet means to be big lift
fist,

193
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,870
something big shoe.
With this I never will forget.

194
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,120
It was probably the highlight.
I don't know if I should say that.

195
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,660
It seems like one of the highlights of
my life and ministry church was

196
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,970
exploding.
Muslim ministry was exploding,

197
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,300
going five servers.
Oh,

198
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,134
Sunday.
Here,

199
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,940
people getting saved.
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

200
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:42,590
people getting saved every week.
Thousands more over the television.

201
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,010
People get healed.
People being delivered,

202
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,240
people coming out of crutches and
wheelchairs and getting touched by the

203
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,720
power of the Holy Ghost.
Casting demons out of witches,

204
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,110
screaming and hollering and yelling,
running out the door,

205
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,810
rebuke in the powers of the enemy.
They tried to curse me.

206
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,040
There's frequent chicken blood out in
front of the building.

207
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,900
Y'All remember what I'm talking about?
We rebuke.

208
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,340
The trick is I remember standing in an
old church and I told them they should

209
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:11,370
have fried them chickens.

210
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,570
The bands top off shit that toe.
Hallelujah.

211
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,380
Yeah,
the the,

212
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,080
the trick of blood everywhere.
I told her to shut a fried them.

213
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,960
I went to Babson over top of him and
check right old preaching

214
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,320
and that was amazing.
It was amazing.

215
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:35,110
Every time you turned on the TV set it
was when the show opened up.

216
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,221
Get Ready,
get ready,

217
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:36,911
get ready,
get ready,

218
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:37,744
get ready,
get ready.

219
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,620
It was amazing,
but when I came home,

220
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,830
my mother in law died and before I could
get over it,

221
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,880
my mother developed Alzheimer's and so
in between the get ready,

222
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,570
get ready,
get ready,

223
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,560
get ready.
I was coming home trying to get her to

224
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:02,550
swallow,
to remember love to whole food in her

225
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:07,551
mouth and then having to clean the food
out of her mouth with my hand.

226
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,150
I remember vividly,
vividly a great anointing service we had

227
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,840
over here.
I was running my own robot.

228
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,680
I was running my own revives people were
all backed up on the highway to come to

229
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,950
the providers.
I remember one service is the holy ghost

230
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,570
move.
People would get healed and delivered.

231
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,480
I left here,
I ran him to the hospital,

232
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:35,481
wet,
wet with sweat cloud low top of my

233
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:40,851
mother's bed and told God to heal her.
How could I be this powerful?

234
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,380
How could I call fly up down from a
habit over here and come over here and

235
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,810
whole somebody who's truly with it?
Wow.

236
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,390
Everything else.
What's going on?

237
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,500
Number one,
we need economic support and supporting.

238
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,840
The Bible says if we don't support
economically,

239
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,020
we are less than an infidel that we need
to provide,

240
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,050
but we also understand now that this
support is more than money.

241
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,120
So we want to talk about number two,
we want to talk about social support.

242
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,240
We want to talk about your social
support around you,

243
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,074
your family,
your,

244
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,840
your family needs social support.
Does it have support?

245
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,680
Everything in this room needs support,
support.

246
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:44,620
That gets a little boring,
but it's very important.

247
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,110
You came in,
you saw the carpet and you didn't see

248
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:49,030
the concrete,
but the carpet means nothing without the

249
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,790
concrete
support.

250
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,130
Have you gotten support around you for
what you're trying to do?

251
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,050
You're trying to build a career,
do you have support?

252
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,390
You've been telling God you're ready for
the next level.

253
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,510
Is Your family wedding?
Have you built it a love support to

254
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,750
support you getting ready to run for
Congress can have your kids handle it?

255
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,030
Have they got the right kind of friends
and support,

256
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,690
but he surrounded this wife had the
right support for your next move.

257
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,800
This is why God has given you this at
the first of the year because you're

258
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,240
getting ready to go to another level

259
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,650
and for the level that you can read it
and horn.

260
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You can't take old support and to new
levels for the level that you're getting

261
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,260
rid of the coin.
You're going to need some social support

262
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,100
to undergird you.
It's not enough to have the vision and

263
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:40,090
have the dream if you don't have the
support and it's not just about you.

264
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,550
It's about everything that's connected
to you.

265
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,510
You want to build a great work for God,
but can the kids handle it?

266
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,060
Is it the right time,
the right season?

267
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,270
Do they have friends around them that
support your phone use or are you the

268
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:58,750
only sane voice in the life of your
family?

269
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,070
So what number two,
we got to have social support.

270
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,350
What?
I'll give you a couple of things I have

271
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,240
learned in life.
The higher you go,

272
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,710
the smaller your circle.

273
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,670
People who've got all kind of friends,
they know everybody and they run them

274
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:16,840
up.
All kind of the people.

275
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,920
I ain't going very high

276
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,870
because if you get too big of a circle,
you're going to have to stay low.

277
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,080
If you're going to be like a pyramid and
come up,

278
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,050
the higher you get,
the smaller your circle.

279
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,460
Now to take the permit and turn it
upside down and the soul gets bigger as

280
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,230
it goes up,
it's going to fall over.

281
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,510
That means you can't take everybody with
you.

282
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
You gotta be careful who you're trying
to take with you.

283
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,780
The higher you go,
the more discriminating you have to be

284
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,450
and who you got to give your time too
because we now understand that provision

285
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,640
is blocked just money.
It's attention,

286
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,220
it's time,
it's interest,

287
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,580
it's affection,
nothing that you have,

288
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,610
we'll run right without you.
So everything that you have requires

289
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:08,621
more of you and you can afford to fund
every situation you.

290
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh,
it's not that they're not good people.

291
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,190
It's just said that you are a limited
resource and some of you are wore out

292
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:22,130
now cause you aren't too many things to
too many people.

293
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,340
You got to bring your circle for work.
God is getting ready to take you to,

294
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,493
yeah,

295
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,410
high five somebody said,
Lord,

296
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,530
that man is talking in the mood.

297
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,610
The third area that you need is
spiritual support.

298
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,910
Maybe he'd come home and support.
You need social support,

299
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,660
your social environment.
You need spiritual support.

300
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,480
Let me tell you why you need spiritual
support

301
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,070
because when you let me tell you
something until you let me tell you,

302
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,050
you would continue.
Who can I tell

303
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,910
every family is dysfunctional in some
way?

304
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,030
Maybe
they would believe that they believe it.

305
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,290
They didn't believe me.
Someone who,

306
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,860
but the frustration that we hear,
we always think everybody got something

307
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:26,694
that we didn't get.

308
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,690
It's not a only been raised by my mother
had been so much better if my father

309
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,610
would have been there.
It didn't hit on a good people with

310
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:35,250
mothers who are crazy.
There are people with fathers who are

311
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,960
crazy.
There are people with mothers and

312
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:39,150
fathers who are crazy.
There are people were mothers and

313
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,010
fathers who live in big houses that are
crazy.

314
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,890
There are people with mothers and
fathers who live in big houses and have

315
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,800
phds who are still crazy.
There are people who are fine,

316
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,320
who had mothers and fathers and have
phds.

317
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,740
They are good looking crazy.
Let me tell you something.

318
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,900
Every body,
light skin,

319
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,140
dark skin,
white folks,

320
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,840
but folks,
Brown folks,

321
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,330
everybody has secrets,
effort,

322
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,370
everybody,
potluck.

323
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Everybody has issues.
Now when my comic queasy Mary go kind of

324
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,210
crazy,
I live,

325
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:14,760
we have five kids with five new flavor
of a crazy.

326
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,400
The whole house looks like baskin and
Robbins.

327
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,160
Have you ever notice how old are your
kids get?

328
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,440
The harder it is for them to be in the
house,

329
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,540
very easy.
When they're small,

330
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,390
they don't have no pagan put on the blue
dress,

331
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,140
put on the blue pants wearing a red
shirt.

332
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,700
Then one day they say,
I don't write that check.

333
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,100
The more premium native,
they give them more difficult to get it

334
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:44,910
and the more that the functions begin to
show and the most secrets the family has

335
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,310
because secrets are equal opportunity
and experiences that we all can share.

336
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,380
The young people today say they all had
little secrets.

337
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:55,050
They say they keep it real.
They are hilarious,

338
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,210
hilarious.
Then they put real on facebook and

339
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,340
commit a new crime because people are
talking about it.

340
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,930
There are some things,
if you keep it real,

341
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:14,764
you will lose it

342
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,440
and the reality is you get on my nerves
because just standing there staring at

343
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:23,990
me like you don't like if you said
everything you talk to people,

344
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,100
it would be the third World War.
Keeping it real is destructive.

345
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,160
You don't want to keep it real.
You want to keep her the woman.

346
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,463
Yeah,

347
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,720
I live on the Cape up woman.
Sometimes you got to such a mouth,

348
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,890
sometimes you've got a whole your pitch.
Sometimes you've got to be still and let

349
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:47,120
the Lord fight for battle.
Sometimes you got to say,

350
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,180
I take sis,
this is a job.

351
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,110
Fuck God.

352
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,460
I believe your husband,
but I can't be your daddy.

353
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,710
Your grandpa had the childhood.
I couldn't text you when,

354
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,910
how crazy itself,
but I'm talking to y'all and I'm lifting

355
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,950
you up to God and if God Paul Fritz and
it can't be done,

356
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,790
you're the spiritual support though.
You hear them say,

357
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:15,650
I'm calling for backup.
I love somebody I can't fix.

358
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,690
I love somebody.
I came straight out.

359
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,250
I love somebody.
I can heal my or this is driving me

360
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,160
crazy and loud.
They're crazy and this is on top of that

361
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,030
drives it.
Now the kid's crazy.

362
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,380
It's mixed it with the crazy

363
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,280
have holes

364
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,730
probably is at a time that I am the most
tired.

365
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,630
I have no place to lay my head
cause there's this just I treat lid on

366
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,340
my son because I can't let him otherwise
because there's issues.

367
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,380
I can't live at home.
My husband cause there's this was,

368
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,530
and you wonder why you're falling apart
and why you can't sleep and why your

369
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:06,890
food doesn't digest well and you're
wondering why you had mood swings.

370
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,230
The reason you're having problems in
spite of all of your was is that you

371
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:16,850
have a place to work.
You have a battle to fight,

372
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,630
you have a job to kill,
you have a mission,

373
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,320
but you have no place
too late.

374
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,273
Okay?

375
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,363
Oh,

376
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,413
okay.

377
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,840
The reason you are physically sick,
right?

378
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,480
The reason who are hypertensive,
diabetics stressed out eating disorders,

379
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:04,550
the reason you have migraine headaches,
the reasons that you're getting

380
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,570
cancerous tumors is years and years and
years of being a tough guy,

381
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,960
crawled woman.
Reality is you had no place to lay your

382
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:16,960
head.
You can't even wash up in the service

383
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,920
because you felt worried about your
image that when it's time to wash up,

384
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,600
you're so busy trying to look masculine.
That to miss a one place.

385
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,700
He's got
to take the weight up off of your phone.

386
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,370
Hey,
I've got to stop there,

387
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:36,590
but it's been a real joy to share the
word of the Lord with you.

388
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,220
I believe the best is yet to come in.
I pray that the word you heard today

389
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,500
will produce fruit in your life
tomorrow.

390
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,820
In Jesus' name.
Be Blessed.

391
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,470
I want to thank our partners for helping
us make a difference in the lives of

392
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:52,590
hurting people.
No partnership has provided food,

393
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,270
clothing,
clean water,

394
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,860
medicine,
distribution.

395
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,830
It's so much more at home and abroad.
In fact,

396
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,970
to the mega care,
we are establishing medical camps and

397
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:07,710
health clinics to increase the rate of
survival while giving hope and healing

398
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,130
to a hurting community.
If you are not a partner,

399
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,430
I encourage you to become one today.

400
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,120
God wants to give you the grace to be
grounded in every aspect of your life.

401
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,790
You are a limited resource.
Oh,

402
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,800
blow out loud.
God.

403
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,210
It's getting rid of

404
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,460
for your gift to the Ministry of any
size you will receive grounded in faith

405
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:40,070
on cd from Bishop Jakes,
mind renewing series,

406
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,120
grace to be grounded.

407
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,200
It's basically a sub because it knocks
it down to your knees

408
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,560
and when your gift is $110 or more,
you'll receive grace to be grounded in

409
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:56,160
its entirety on 70 days,
your very own walk through the grace to

410
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:00,660
be grounded series with Bishop Jakes,
28 day devotional and unique grace to be

411
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,160
grounded art desk display.

412
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,993
Wow.

413
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,850
Don't be stuck in in fertile territory.
Get the grace to be grounded.

414
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,910
Have you seen him as responsibility?
You have turned salvation,

415
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,930
the work I'm coming to the Lord.
You are so performance oriented.

416
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,230
You think you have to perform for God
who can see your thoughts so far off?

417
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,800
There's nothing about you.
The Bible says that is not method before

418
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,970
him with whom we have to do and the one
chance you have to keep it real.

419
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,490
You been keeping it moving
with the one person that's safe to keep

420
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:58,910
it real with and when they can find
nothing else wrong with it.

421
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:05,770
Then they attack his methodology.
They kept asking this guy over and over

422
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:13,280
and over again to tell the story.
He said,

423
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,400
it's just like I just told you.
Then they took him to the first day.

424
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,500
Tell him again.
Yeah,

425
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,460
I'm telling it again.
It's interrogation.

426
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,880
They weren't,
they weren't even interested in whether

427
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:27,881
he could see or not.
They were using him to attack Jesus.

428
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,990
Some of you are up in the battle right
now and the battle is even about you.

429
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,470
They are using you to attack somebody
else around you.

430
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,070
You might be going through a battle
that's not even yours,

431
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,180
okay?

432
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,640
Because it's like you're getting the say
the right thing.

433
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:58,390
They could use his mouth
to kill his master

434
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,420
and when the enemy is out to assassinate
someone who was a gifted or noise or

435
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:11,970
promising,
he will always try to use somebody's

436
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
mouth.
Are y'all going to talk to me?

437
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,110
I'm not.
They don't care whether he's blind or

438
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:26,800
whether he could see they don't care
whether he got a job but doesn't have a

439
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,960
job.
They don't care whether he has a future.

440
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,320
I doesn't have a future.
They have to keep asking them the same

441
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,610
thing,
a different way.

442
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,200
Trying to get him to say something that
they can use to attack Jesus.

443
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,670
They don't care that he's blind or that
he can see that he's not here.

444
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,490
They are trying to get him to say
something and then the Bible mentions

445
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,190
that Jesus did it on the Sabbath Day.

446
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,460
Yeah,
and from the fact

447
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,020
then he healed him on the Sabbath Day.
They concluded he is a sinner,

448
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,850
a center.

449
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,360
It's not like Jesus was washing clothes
or mended fences.

450
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,280
Oh,
working on the Sabbath Day.

451
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Jesus had a conversation and he spit.
That's all he did on the Sabbath Day and

452
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:26,640
from that

453
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,540
they said he is
a sinner.

454
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,473
He is a sinner.

455
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,850
Once people put a name on the how they
hate you,

456
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,840
once they give that hate our name and
the name is hateable,

457
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,400
they want to find a category to put you
in so that they can hate you better.

458
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,520
When I came here,
the pastor of this church,

459
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,450
the Lord told me to call it the Potter's
house in the early days of the church.

460
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,050
You know what I'm about to say?
In the early days,

461
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,740
the church,
new members are coming to me and they

462
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,260
say they want to know what kind of
church it is,

463
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,350
is a potter's House Baptist Potter's
house.

464
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:13,640
Hey,
ame Potter's house,

465
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,060
Church of God in Christ Potter's House
happened style church.

466
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,370
What kind of church is it?
So I went to God and I prayed about it.

467
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,980
I said,
the people want a name for the Potter's

468
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,110
house they want.
They want to know what kind of church it

469
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,580
is.
And the Lord spoke something to me.

470
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:27,120
I will never forget.
He said,

471
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:29,650
son,
don't give him no name because it's a

472
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,080
cage fight.
You know,

473
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:36,081
fight the name you gave her
once they got amazing that they could

474
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:40,300
say

475
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,250
that Jesus wasn't God,
they couldn't hate Jesus.

476
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,520
But when they said Jesus is a sinner,
no people who wouldn't have hated him,

477
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,000
no hates him off the label that they put
on him.

478
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,020
Let me tell you something,
and all of a sudden Jesus is up under

479
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:09,021
this cloud of suspicion that the
pharisees have created around something

480
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:12,450
that he set out to do.
That was good.

481
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,270
Now I'm really going to dig down and
some of Y'all with me.

482
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,790
Have you ever been doing something good
with good intentions,

483
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,513
right?

484
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,170
Really prime.
It helps somebody and got kicked in the

485
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:36,171
face for doing something good.
It's not like you've never done anything

486
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:40,830
bad.
You go things bad before and got away

487
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:45,831
with it and then did something good and
all of a sudden all hell breaks loose.

488
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,310
As you were saying,
how in the world could you attack me?

489
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,660
Okay,

490
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,660
you attack me after I paid your rent.
Talk for you to get a job opened up a

491
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,430
door.
You Go,

492
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,020
I'm off.
I don't mind being a time

493
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,300
when they found out it was the sabbath.
They said he is a sinner.

494
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,960
When they called him a sinner,
the blind man said,

495
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:15,440
I don't know.
He's,

496
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,340
I don't know whether he's the center
now.

497
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,530
I don't know anything about his
doctrine.

498
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,470
I don't know anything about his
theology.

499
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,830
I don't know anything about that.
I don't know what you're all talking

500
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,290
about it.
I've never read the book of revelations.

501
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't know what his stance is.
I don't know whether he democrat or

502
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:37,710
Republican.
I don't know whether he's got two wives

503
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:39,030
or dog or billy goat.

504
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,910
Oh No.

505
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Can I get a witness up in here?
Can I get a witness?

506
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,770
Oh No.
Okay.

507
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,350
Here's our one.
I met him.

508
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:00,351
I was blind and
not the rest of it.

509
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:05,730
Y'All can fight all day long,
but all I know is that it works for me.

510
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,430
Touch your neighbor.
Tell them it works for me.

511
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,010
You are in a season in your life that
you don't have to prove anything to

512
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,790
anybody.
Oh,

513
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,850
you got to do is tell him.
Oh,

514
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:33,540
is that it works for me.
I don't know about your God.

515
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm not gonna argue with you about your
religion.

516
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,690
I don't tend to wash up Buddha.
I don't serve the moon and the stars

517
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,243
huddled,
carefree,

518
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,490
prayed to pluto

519
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,760
is that it works for me.
This man Jesus,

520
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,830
this man,
Jesus set me free.

521
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,830
This man,
Jesus,

522
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:04,310
Rog said my wife
stopped me from killing myself.

523
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,100
This man,
Jesus picked me up off the ground.

524
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,860
This man,
Jesus gave me a second chair.

525
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,230
I want somebody give yes.

526
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,230
How far somebody told him it works for
me,

527
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,230
my faith,
my faith,

528
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,500
my faith,
my faith,

529
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,270
my faith,
my faith,

530
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,250
my faith,
my faith,

531
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,563
my faith.

532
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,250
Cause whenever I start praising the name
of Jesus,

533
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,380
then the tremble.
Because if I can't do that by the

534
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,180
holiday,
broken bow wellbeing,

535
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,440
I want somebody to throw your head back
in the Holler.

536
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Sure
does he live in that night?

537
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Somebody out of place
that turns water into wine.

538
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,380
What are the goodness of Jesus and it
all that is done for me.

539
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,740
Wow.
Radical.

540
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Open your mouth
so people don't like y'all Bible

541
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,130
Church.
When you think about what God has done

542
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:18,630
in your life,

543
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,680
mules to the way we wash them,
they don't think it takes all of that.

544
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,460
They think that you should come the
church and the pastor says speech and

545
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:46,921
you should sit there and be quiet.
But the problem with that is as long as

546
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:53,050
I speak and you don't say anything,
it's a sign.

547
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,310
You're not of age.
They came to the boy's parents,

548
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,280
parents to speak for him,
but the parents said he's away.

549
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,170
He can speak for himself.

550
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,720
You don't need this.
Some shakes trump praise

551
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,260
y'all,
Lord.

552
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,400
If he he'll do,
he doesn't limit you.

553
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Bless you.
Hallelujah.

554
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,580
Hallelujah.
For the lamb

555
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,430
shank somebody by the hand and tell him
something that

556
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,400
know
he did.

557
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,470
You
hear that?

558
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,610
A wax,
you're in Hawaii

559
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,970
works for
me.

560
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,770
It works for me.
You can laugh at me.

561
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,830
You can make fun of me.
You can say it doesn't take all of that,

562
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,380
but you want the one that was blind.
You want the one that was down.

563
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,530
You weren't the one that was suicidal.
You weren't the one that was that job.
