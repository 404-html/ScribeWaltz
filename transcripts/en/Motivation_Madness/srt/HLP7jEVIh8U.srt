1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
The next best predictor of lifetime
success is conscientiousness.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,143
Well,
so,

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,770
and I've though of the two aspects of
conscientiousness say orderliness and

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,040
industriousness.
The better predictor is industriousness.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,240
So the question is,
well,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,070
what can you do about your
industriousness?

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,640
And the answer to that is,
well that's Kinda rough too because

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,910
there's a strong genetic component,
but you can work on micro habits with

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,700
regards to your conscientiousness and I
think the best micro habits.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,150
This is partly to do with this future
authoring program processes.

11
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:42,180
I think the best thing you can do with
regards to your conscientiousness is to

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,160
set up some aims for yourself.
Goals that you actually value and the

13
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,350
future authoring program helps people do
that.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,850
And basically it does a situational
analysis of it helps you do a

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:58,110
situational analysis of your life more
than a psychological analysis I would

16
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,240
say.
And so the questions are something like,

17
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,440
well,
all right,

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,040
you're going to have to put some effort
into your life and you need to be

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,210
motivated to do that.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,090
And so what are the potential sources of
motivation?

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,410
You could think about them in the big
five manner.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,500
You know,
if you're extroverted,

23
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,790
you want friends,
if you're agreeable,

24
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,370
you want an intimate relationship.
If you're disagreeable,

25
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,410
you want to win competitions.
If you're open,

26
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,610
you want to engage in creative activity.
If you're high in neuroticism,

27
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,810
you want security.
Okay?

28
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,380
So those are all sources of potential
motivation that you could draw on that

29
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,120
you could tailor to your own,
you know,

30
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,940
your own personality.
But then there are dimensions that you

31
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:35,670
want to consider your life across.
And so we asked people about,

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,991
well,
you know,

33
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,660
if you could have your life the way you
wanted it in three to five years,

34
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,730
if you were taking care of yourself
properly,

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,470
you know,
what would you want from your

36
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,330
friendships?
What would you want from your intimate

37
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,190
relationship?
How would you like to structure your

38
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:47,850
family?

39
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,550
What do you want for your career?
Well,

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,190
how are you going to use your time
outside of your job and how are you

41
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,930
going to regulate your mental,
physical,

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,100
mental,
and physical health,

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,170
and maybe also your drug and alcohol
use.

44
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,390
Because that's,
that's a good place to Auger down,

45
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,440
you know,
because alcoholism,

46
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,490
for example,
wipes out,

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,290
you know,
five to 10 percent of people,

48
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,710
so you want to keep that under control
and then,

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,470
and then so maybe you know,
you,

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,750
you,
you develop a vision of what your life,

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,130
what you would like your life to be and
that associates the,

52
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,070
so the goal,
once the goal is established and then

53
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,270
you break down the goal into micro
processes that you could implement the

54
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:29,271
microprocesses become rewarding in
proportion in relation to there a causal

55
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,620
association with the goal and that
tangles in your,

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,340
your incentive reward system.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,020
You know,
we talked about the dopaminergic

58
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,180
incentive reward system,
but that's the thing that keeps you

59
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,880
moving forward.
And the way it works is that it works

60
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:46,881
better if it produces positive emotion.
When it can see you moving towards a

61
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,690
valued goal,
okay,

62
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:52,680
well what's the implication of that?
Better have a valued goal because

63
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,680
otherwise you can't get any positive
motivation working out.

64
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,290
And so the more valuable the goal in
principle,

65
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,410
the more the micro processes associated
with that goal start to take on a

66
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,440
positive charge.
And so what that means is while you get

67
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,450
up in the morning and you're excited
about the day,

68
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,730
you're ready to go,
and so as far as I can tell,

69
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,150
what you do is you specify your longterm
ideal.

70
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,990
Maybe you also specify a place you want
to stay the hell away from them so that

71
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,950
you're terrified to fail as well as
excited about succeeding because that's

72
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,790
also useful.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,670
You specify your goal.
You do that,

74
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,790
you do that in some sense as a unique
individual.

75
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,160
You want to.
You want to specify goals that make you

76
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,180
say,
Oh,

77
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,060
if that could happen as a consequence of
my efforts,

78
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,600
it would clearly be worthwhile because
the question always is,

79
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,150
why do something?
Because doing nothing is easy.

80
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,530
You just sit there and you don't do
anything.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,230
How it's real easy.
The question is why would you ever do

82
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,660
anything?
And the answer to that has to be because

83
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,930
you've determined by some means that
it's worthwhile.

84
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,970
And then the next question might be,
well,

85
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,010
where should you look for worthwhile
things?

86
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,910
And one would be,
well,

87
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:57,700
you could consult your own temperament,
and the other would be,

88
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,200
while you kinda look at how,
look at what it is that people accrue

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,170
that's valuable across the lifespan.
Look what,

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,980
look what.

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,290
So you do a structural analysis of the
subcomponents of human existence and

92
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,630
already good that you need a family.
You need friends,

93
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,100
like you don't need to have all these
things,

94
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,110
but you better have most of them.
Family,

95
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,100
friends,
career,

96
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,760
educational goals,
plans for time outside of work and

97
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,000
attention to your mental and physical
health,

98
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,490
etc. You know those are,
that's what life is about.

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,220
And if You don't have any of those
things,

100
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,800
well then all you've got left is misery
and suffering.

101
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,180
So that's,
that's a bad,

102
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,220
that's a bad deal for you.
So,

103
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,160
so once you,
once you set up that goal structure,

104
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,040
let's say,
and that's really in many in many ways,

105
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,130
that's what you should be doing at
universities is that's exactly what you

106
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:52,300
should be doing is trying to figure out
who it is that you're trying to be,

107
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,410
right,
and you aim at that and then use

108
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,160
everything you learned as a means of
building that person that you want to

109
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:00,440
be.

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,390
And and I really mean want to be,
I don't mean should be even those

111
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,880
things,
those things are going to overlap and

112
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,700
it's important to distinguish between
those because that's partly,

113
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,890
and this is back down to the micro
routine analysis.

114
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,641
So I started saying,
well,

115
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,350
you're going to try to make yourself
more industrious.

116
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,311
Okay?
Number one,

117
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,490
specify your damn goals because how are
you going to hit something if you don't

118
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,410
know what it is that isn't going to
happen.

119
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,680
And often people won't specify their
goals too because they don't like to

120
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:27,220
specify conditions for failure.
So if you keep yourself all vague and

121
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,830
foggy,
which is real easy because that's just a

122
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,580
matter of not doing as well,
then you don't know when you fail and

123
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,331
people might say,
well,

124
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:36,820
I really don't want to know when I fail
because that's painful,

125
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,160
so I'll,
I'll keep myself blind about when I

126
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:39,940
fail.

127
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,830
ThAt's fine,
except you'll fail all the time.

128
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:45,670
Then you just won't know it until you've
failed so badly that you're done.

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,310
And that can easily happen by the time
you're 40.

130
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,850
So.
So I would recommend that you don't let

131
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,890
that happen.
So that's willful blindness,

132
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,150
right?
You could have known,

133
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,200
but you chose not to.
Okay?

134
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,150
So once you get your goal structure set
up,

135
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,721
you think,
okay,

136
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,200
if I could have this life looks like
that might be worth living,

137
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,160
despite the fact that it's going to be
anxiety provoking and threatening,

138
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,740
and there's gonna be some suffering and
loss involved in all of that.

139
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Obviously the goal is to have a vision
for your life such that all things

140
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,130
considered that justifies your effort.
Okay?

141
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,090
So then what do you do?
Well then then you turn down to the

142
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,320
micro routines like,
okay,

143
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:28,460
well this is what I'm aiming for,
how does that instantiates itself day to

144
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,330
day,
week to week,

145
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,490
month to month,
and that's where something like a

146
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,530
schedule can be unbelievably useful.

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Google calendar.
It's like make a damn schedule and stick

148
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,060
to it.
Okay,

149
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,330
so what's the rule with the schedule?
It's not a bloody prison.

150
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,760
That's the first thing that people do
wrong.

151
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,620
He said,
well I don't like to follow a schedule.

152
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,930
Was like,
well what kind of schedule are you

153
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:48,870
setting up?
Well I,

154
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,960
I have to do this,
then I have to do this,

155
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,490
then I have to do this,
you know,

156
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,400
and then I just go play video games
because who wants to do all these things

157
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,320
that I have to do?
It's like wrong.

158
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,550
Set the damn schedule up so that you
have the day you want.

159
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,590
That's the trick.
It's like okay,

160
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,930
I've got tomorrow.
If I was going to set it up so it was

161
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:10,520
the best possible day I could have
practically speaking,

162
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,090
what would it look like?
Well then you schedule that and

163
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,940
obviously there's a bit of
responsibility that's going to go along

164
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:20,120
with that because if you have any sense,
one of the things that you're going to

165
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,460
insist upon is that at the end of the
day,

166
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,360
you're not in worse shape than you were
that then at the beginning of the day,

167
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:26,660
right?

168
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,960
Because that's a stupid day.
If you have a bunch of those in a row,

169
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,940
you just dig,
dig yourself a hole,

170
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,650
and then you bury yourself in.
It's like,

171
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,780
sorry,
that's just not a good strategy.

172
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,130
It's a bad strategy.
So maybe 20 percent of your day has to

173
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,950
be responsibility and obligation,
or maybe it's more than that,

174
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,830
depending on how far behind you are,
but even that you can.

175
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,240
You can ask yourself,
okay,

176
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:51,110
well I've got these responsibilities.
I have to schedule the damn things in.

177
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,680
What's the right ratio of responsibility
to reward?

178
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,010
And you can ask yourself that just like
you'd negotiate with someone who is

179
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,910
working for you.
It's like,

180
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,960
okay,
you gotta work tomorrow.

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,660
Okay,
so I want you to work tomorrow.

182
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:03,441
And you might say,
okay,

183
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,310
well what are you going to do for me
that makes it likely that I'll work for

184
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,830
you while you could ask yourself that,
you know,

185
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,670
maybe you do an hour of,
of responsibility and then you play a

186
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:14,960
video game for 15 minutes.

187
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,970
I don't know,
whatever turnS your crank man,

188
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,090
but you know,
you have to negotiate with yourself and

189
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:24,650
not tyrannized yourself like you're
negotiating with someone that you care

190
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,590
for that you would like to be productive
and have a good life.

191
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,570
And,
and that's how you make the schedule.

192
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,070
It's like.
And then you look at the day and you

193
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,401
think,
well,

194
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,930
if I had that day,
that'd be good.

195
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,760
Great.
You know,

196
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,290
and you,
you're useless and horrible.

197
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,170
So you'll probably only hit it with
about 70 percent accuracy,

198
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,350
but that beats the hell out of zero.
Right?

199
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,990
And if you hit it even with 50 percent
accuracy,

200
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,250
another rule is well,
aim for 51 percent the next week or 50

201
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:53,660
and a half percent for god's sake.
Or because you're going to hit that

202
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,020
position where things to loop back
positively and spiral you upward.

203
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,500
And soul,
so that's one way that you can work on

204
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:05,880
your conscientiousness is a plan,
a life you'd like to have and and you do

205
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,330
that partly by referring to social
norms.

206
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,330
That's more or less rescuing your father
from the belly of the whale,

207
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,630
but the other way you do that is by
having a little conversation with

208
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:19,740
yourself about it as if you don't really
know who you are because you know what

209
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,210
you're like.
You won't do what you're told.

210
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,610
You won't do what you tell yourSelf to
do.

211
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,570
You must have noticed that.
It's like you're a bad employee and a

212
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:31,350
worse boss,
and in both of those work for you,

213
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,960
you don't know what you want to do.
And then when you tell yourself what to

214
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,010
do,
you don't do it anyways.

215
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,530
You should fire yourself and find
someone else to beat.

216
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,110
But,
but you know what my point is,

217
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,560
is that you have to understand that
you're not your own servant,

218
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,150
so to speak.
You're someone that you have to

219
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,140
negotiate with and that's.
And you're someone that you want to

220
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,110
present the opportunity of having a good
life too.

221
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,960
And that's hard for people because they
don't like themselves very much,

222
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,960
so you know,
they're always like cracking the whip

223
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:01,440
and then procrastinating and cracking
the whip and then procrastinating and

224
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,274
it's like,
god,

225
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,760
it's so boring and such a pathetic way
of spending your time.

226
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:08,640
And you know what that's like because
you probably wasted like six hours a day

227
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,850
and I think we did an economic
calculation about that a while back,

228
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,830
right?
Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an

229
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,300
hour,
something like that.

230
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,250
I mean,
you're not getting paid that now,

231
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,120
but you're young.
And so this is investment time and what

232
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,880
you do now is going to multiply its
effects in the future.

233
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,100
So,
so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,

234
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,250
which is perfectly reasonable.
So if you waste six hours a day and you

235
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:32,010
are,
then you're wasting about $2,000 a week

236
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,480
or about $100,000 a year.

237
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,720
So like go ahead.
But that's what it's costing you every

238
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,340
hour.
and you need to know what your damn time

239
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,650
is worth.
So let's say it's not 50 bucks,

240
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,360
it's 30,
whatever.

241
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,580
Maybe it's 100,
it's somewhere in that range.

242
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,570
One of the things you should be asking
yourself is when you spend an hour was

243
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,404
that,
well,

244
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,410
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to
have had that hour,

245
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,270
and if the answer is no,
it's like,

246
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,800
well,
maybe you should do something else with

247
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,230
your time,
and it depends on whether or not you

248
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:02,190
think that your time is worthwhile.
But the funny thing about not assuming

249
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,410
that is if you assume your time isn't
worthwhile,

250
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,400
what happens is you don't just sit
around sort of randomly in a state of

251
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,050
responsibility list bliss.
What you do is you suffer existentially

252
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,380
and so that seems like a stupid
solution,

253
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,660
so okay,
so anyways,

254
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,510
as far as I can tell,
that's how you can improve your

255
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,030
conscientiousness,
hannah,

256
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,440
outline and goal that you actually would
like to hit and even better,

257
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,470
here's something else you can think
about when you're negotiating in your

258
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,304
life.

259
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,110
You could say if you're kind of
pessimistic,

260
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:34,801
you'd say,
well,

261
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:38,850
we have to negotiate an agreement.
I'd like to walk away not miserable and

262
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,380
resentful.
okay,

263
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,500
let's call that a baseline and that's
how you're going to negotiate with your

264
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,200
wife or your husband.
That's a good thing to know.

265
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,280
You want to negotiate so that you don't
walk away miserable and resentful

266
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:55,281
because that makes you hostile and then
you'll to hurt them and I would say that

267
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,900
unless you want to hurt them and then of
course they'll happily return the favor

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
unless you.
If you want to exist in a place where

269
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,810
you're basically hitting each other in
the head repeatedly for 30 years,

270
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,940
you go right ahead.
But I wouldn't say that that's a

271
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,310
particularly good way of living.
So you might say,

272
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,020
well,
the minimal precondition for a

273
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,130
successful negotiation is that you don't
walk away resentful and angry.

274
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,780
And so that's also how you know when you
have something to say to someone because

275
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,480
the rule has to be.
If you're going to walk away resentful

276
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,730
and angry,
you've got something to say.

277
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,300
It doesn't mean you're right by the way,
but it does mean that you have something

278
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,760
to say,
but it's kind of a low bar.

279
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,580
You know,
like if I wanted to live with you for 30

280
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,690
years,
maybe we should say,

281
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,390
how about we walk away from our mutual
negotiations?

282
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,960
Thrilled.
Well why not?

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,750
You know,
you got to aim for something you could

284
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:47,210
aim for that you want to negotiate with
your boss for a new seller.

285
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:48,070
You might think,
okay,

286
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,220
I've got this damn job,
how much would I have to be paid?

287
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,960
So I'd be so bloody excited to go to
work.

288
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:57,280
I could hardly stand it while you can at
least know what that number is.

289
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,650
And then you could go there and say,
well look,

290
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,840
you know,
you like to have me around.

291
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,110
I've been doing some thinking.
I think if you paid me this amount of

292
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,050
money,
I'd be so thrilled to go to work that

293
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,740
you could hardly even keep me away from
here.

294
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,370
And your boss might think,
wow,

295
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,880
I'd actually really like to have someone
around who would be so thrilled to work

296
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,330
that I can't get rid of them.
so like maybe I'll,

297
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,220
well I can't give you all of that.
I'll give you 75 percent.

298
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,010
Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year.
It's like,

299
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,390
hey,
good deal,

300
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,630
or you can be some weasley coward and go
in there and snuggle about how awful

301
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,620
your life is and walk away,
barely able to tolerate outcome of the

302
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:36,280
negotiation.
So like I wouldn't recommend that and

303
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:40,360
it's funny because I've watched people
do this repeatedly in my clinical

304
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,760
practice because I do,
we do.

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,850
We plan all the time because the rule is
you're can come and see me.

306
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,910
I'm going to try to help you figure out
how to have the life that you want to

307
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,100
have and we're going to think about that
strategically.

308
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,530
So you're making $50,000 a year right
now.

309
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,550
Maybe you should be making $150,000 in
three years.

310
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,770
And they think,
well that couldn't happen.

311
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:03,550
It's like not with that attitude.
That's the first thing.

312
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,180
It's like,
no,

313
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,020
that's not going to happen if you,
if you don't ask people for the damn

314
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,730
money,
if you don't look for a better job,

315
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,940
but they're going to come along and just
shovel a boat full of money at you.

316
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:13,481
It's like,
no,

317
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:17,770
that's not going to happen,
but if why is that impossible?

318
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,350
Look at you,
you people in here.

319
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,760
it's like,
what the hell is wrong with you?

320
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,953
Nothing.

321
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,650
So you probably have what you want.
If you could figure out what the hell it

322
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,590
was and then you know,
you diligently pursued it.

323
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,020
So.
and then maybe you wouldn't whine about

324
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,600
being alive.
That'd be good because people who whined

325
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,510
about being alive or dangerous to
themselves and other people.

326
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,550
So you might think I can have what I
want,

327
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,750
but you better well figure out what it
is and you can't just wait for the like

328
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,320
have what you want fairy to show up at
your doorstep and granted because

329
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,900
obviously that's not going to happen.
So.

330
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,390
So conscientiousness,
while we talked about how you could

331
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,150
improve that social networking,
that's another big deal.

332
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,030
It's one of the advantages that older
people have over younger people.

333
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,120
And so for example,
now that I'm in my fifties,

334
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:04,250
roughly speaking,
I know a bunch of other people who are

335
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,240
relatively well positioned in the
dominance hierarchy and they know all

336
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,140
sorts of people.

337
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,520
and so when I go to one of them and say,
can you do x or do you know x?

338
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,620
They say no,
but I know someone who cat.

339
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,350
And that's a huge advantage.
So another thing that you want to think

340
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,990
about as you move through life and this
is,

341
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,860
is that use your ability to network
properly.

342
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:27,920
And that doesn't mean schmooze and it
doesn't mean go out and impress people.

343
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,700
That's all just complete bloody rubbish.
It means you,

344
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,110
you,
you try to surround yourself with people

345
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:36,680
who are competent in multiple different
dimensions and you maintain your

346
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:39,040
relationships with them.
And that's a trading relationship to

347
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,420
right?
It involves research,

348
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,160
reciprocity,
but it's a huge advantage.

349
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,790
A social network is a huge advantage and
that's something extroverted people can

350
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,870
be really good at because you know they
have that sort of social ability and

351
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,490
that goes along with the ability to
sell.

352
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,510
So another place that you can pick up
power and power for the good,

353
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:01,511
for the right things is to,
is to consciously develop and maintain

354
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,090
your social networks.
And that also means,

355
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,190
well,
let's talk about friendships for a

356
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,840
minute.
Here's how you know,

357
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,610
if someone's,
your friend A you can tell them bad news

358
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,180
and they'll lIsten.
They won't tell you why you know you're

359
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:20,650
stupid and why that bad thing happened
to you and how something worse happened

360
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,540
to them once and you know,
derailed the whole conversation.

361
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,810
you can actually tell them bad news and
they'll listen.

362
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,810
So that's a good thing.
And then this is a weirder thing.

363
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,670
You can tell them good news
and they'll help you celebrate.

364
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,090
And that's a really good way of deciding
who you should have around you.

365
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,160
Because if you have someone around you,
you know somethIng good happens to you

366
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:43,820
and you're kind of afraid to even admit
it because you know god,

367
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:44,720
something good happen to you.

368
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,200
It's like you let that be known and will
certainly be taken away.

369
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,360
So you know,
you come out and you sort of tell

370
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,900
someone halfheartedly that something
good happened to you,

371
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,040
they give you a whack and then talk
about,

372
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,350
you know,
the great thing that happened to them

373
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,170
three years ago or worse,
the great thing that happened to someone

374
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,570
that they knew three years ago,
you know,

375
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:06,560
it's like go away from that person.
They're not helpful to you and they're

376
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,760
not helpful to themselves either.
And so you want to surround yourself.

377
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,620
You've got to think about this.
You've got to surround yourself with

378
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:15,830
people who want the best for the best
part of you.

379
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,730
You can hang around with weasels and
losers that are trying to pull you down

380
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,580
to justify the fact that they're
spiraling downhill as well.

381
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,040
And you know,
the upside of that is you don't have to

382
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,190
have any responsibility and he can all
whine about how wretched life is,

383
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:28,430
you know.

384
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,150
So that's pretty attractive.
But I would say it's also a bad medium

385
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,310
to longterm plan.
And so it's,

386
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,490
it's acceptable and desirable to try to
surround yourself with people who were

387
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,970
facilitating your development.
You know when you might say,

388
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,260
well,
I've got people around,

389
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,740
I know them well,
you know they're,

390
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,660
they're,
they're not doing that well and and

391
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,390
there and they don't fit into that
category.

392
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,840
It's like,
what's your point?

393
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,030
What are you going to do with them?
Exactly.

394
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,900
You feel if they'll listen and cooperate
with you and move towards a better

395
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,160
future,
great.

396
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,820
If they don't pay any attention and they
keep doing the same damn things over and

397
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,040
over and they're not going anywhere and
is painful,

398
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,560
then maybe the proper thing to do is
say,

399
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,850
you just have your misery.
I'll go off and have my life and maybe

400
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,970
you'll wake up at some point in the
future and think that's a better way of

401
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,840
being because just putting up with it is
while they call that enabling,

402
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,674
right?

403
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,270
You put up with that sort of behavior.
You're providing tacit consent for it

404
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:30,480
and even tacit approval.
It's like it's bad idea.

405
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,660
You have,
I would say both the right and the

406
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:38,280
responsibility to surround yourself with
people who are good for the best part of

407
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:43,281
you and that's not the same as you know.
I don't have to elaborate on that.

408
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,930
You can figure out what that means.
Skills,

409
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,320
that's another thing you can do and if
you want to increase your probability of

410
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:53,820
success every time you have an
opportunity to take an opportunity that

411
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,910
would provide you with a new skill.
Do it right.

412
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,650
Learn to program,
learn to write,

413
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:00,180
learn to read,
read new things,

414
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,850
learn to public speak.
Learn how to introduce yourself to

415
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,500
people.
Learn how to social network,

416
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,540
learn how to go talk to your boss in a
matter.

417
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,910
This is the right way to go.

418
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,910
Talk to someone who's supervising you.
I see this problem and here's the

419
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,490
solution and so I'm coming to talk to
you about the problem and the solution.

420
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,690
It's like that person is going to want
to talk to you a lot site because the

421
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,430
other people they're talking to,
you are going to come and say,

422
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,620
I've got a problem.
Can you do something about it?

423
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:27,990
It's like they don't want to do
something about it.

424
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:29,910
They already got 50 things to do,
you know,

425
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,360
so if you're the person who constantly
brings forth a problem,

426
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,840
even if they're accurate problems,
is why are they going to want to have

427
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,750
you around?
It's you're just,

428
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,840
you're just another problem.
Don't be a problem for the people who

429
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,450
want to give you money.
That's a good rule of thumb,

430
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,650
man.
You know,

431
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,220
if someone wants to give you money,
then help them do that.

432
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,380
And if they want to give you status and
success,

433
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,880
then help them do that.
Right?

434
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,510
And you do that in part by bringing them
solutions and partly you do that by

435
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:00,600
developing your skills.
And so if things aren't going very well

436
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,030
for you,
this is also a good way of evaluating an

437
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,580
opportunity.
Should you take an opportunity.

438
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,930
Well,
here's the rule,

439
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,970
take the opportunity if it will teach
you something that you can use for other

440
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,160
opportunities because then even if it
fails,

441
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,420
which it probably will,
it doesn't matter because you've accrued

442
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,350
something of value that you can bring
forward to the next situation.

443
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,110
so you know,
there's this old union idea that I told

444
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:28,140
you about the sharp cathedral,
for example,

445
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,090
the cathedrals made in the form of a
cross and the cross signifies the center

446
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,770
of the world and the dome signifies the
sky and so right below the dome at the

447
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,740
center of the world,
and it's a cross because the cross is

448
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,930
the place of suffering.
So that's the center of the world

449
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,360
because that's what you are.
You're the place of sufferIng,

450
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:47,040
right?
You're the place of conscious suffering.

451
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,340
that's the center of the world.

452
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,270
And so inscribed on the floor is a maze
and you,

453
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,150
and it's a big maze and it's a mandela
and,

454
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,920
and there's a kind of a flower shaped
resting place right in the center.

455
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,450
And what you're doing is walking in the
maze and you walk all four quadrants and

456
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,580
you get to the middle,
which is where you want to be.

457
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,390
You want to be in the middle.
Well,

458
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,200
how do you get there?
You walk everywhere and what does that

459
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,000
mean?
It means every bloody time you're

460
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:18,001
offered an opportunity,
take it and develop your skills.

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,100
And that's better than wealth by the
way,

462
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,170
in fact,
it actually constitutes wealth because

463
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:26,380
wealth constitutes what you have when
someone takes all your money away,

464
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,600
right?
That's real wealth.

465
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,840
And so the way that you build up that
sort of wealth is you turn yourself into

466
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:36,250
someone who's competent in multiple
directions and you can be doing that all

467
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,210
the time,
right?

468
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
Especially with the kind of technology
that you people have access to.

469
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,550
I mean,
you can learn anything you want whenever

470
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,590
you want.
So what a good deal that is,

471
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:46,480
man.
And so there's,

472
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,900
there's easy fruit hanging that you
could pick and I would recommend that

473
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,880
you do that.
So here's an example.

474
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:55,060
Let's say you're not doing too bad,
so maybe you're in the middle of the

475
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,950
normal distribution,
then you lose your job.

476
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay?
And so let's say you're a conscientious

477
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:04,180
person and we can say just for the sake
of argument,

478
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,640
that you lose your job because of mass
layoffs in your company.

479
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,100
so it has nothing to do with you.
It's fundamentally,

480
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:10,900
it's just like luck Of the draw
basically.

481
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,850
But then what happens to you?
Well,

482
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,730
if you're conscientious,
you're gonna,

483
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,100
you're gonna,
go after yourself pretty hard so you're

484
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,560
gonna add,
especially if you're also high in

485
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,280
neuroticism.

486
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,070
It's going to depress you to lose your
job and maybe you're in a situation

487
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,110
where you just for one reason or
another,

488
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,760
you don't have that many other
opportunities.

489
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:31,150
Now maybe you should look for them,
but maybe you're in a depressed strata

490
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,750
of the economy or you're geographically
located somewhere that makes moving

491
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,520
difficult or so on and so forth.
You know,

492
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,580
so,
but you lose a job and then you start to

493
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:43,420
get depressed because of that.
Well then as you start to get depressed,

494
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,600
you know it decreases the probability
that you're going to look for a job,

495
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,710
but it also maybe starts to put stress
on your family and it also starts to

496
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:53,770
decrease the probability that you're
going to engage in positive social

497
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,890
interaction.
So now not only are you unemployed and

498
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,530
suffering from economic stress,
but you're married just starting to

499
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,650
suffer and you're starting to isolate
yourself from your friends.

500
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,780
And then of course,
as your marriage suffers in the stress

501
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,610
builds up,
then that's going to make you more

502
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:09,340
depressed and that's going to keep you
even farther away from your friends and

503
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:11,950
that's going to decrease the likelihood
that you're going to have enough

504
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:14,740
positive emotion and enthusiasm to look
for another job.

505
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,020
And then you know,
maybe you want to add a bit of a

506
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,990
drinking problem too,
that just for fun and you can see that

507
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,870
you can get a spiral going that's just
taken you down.

508
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,510
Right?
ANd there's all sorts of things because

509
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,020
lots of times people conceptualize,
let's say,

510
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,510
you know,
you're unemployed guy and you go to

511
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:35,860
counseling and you get a diagnosis of
depression.

512
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,900
And the thing about a diagnosis of
depression,

513
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:40,720
it's sort of like the assumption is
there's something gone wrong with your

514
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,810
psychological structure.
It's like if you're unemployed and

515
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,890
you're,
you're depressed,

516
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,390
it isn't obvious at all that the problem
is in your head.

517
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,970
You know what I mean?
It's,

518
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,810
it doesn't.
If it isn't even obvious that it's a

519
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:54,560
psychological problem,
it's just a problem and problems can

520
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:56,890
take you out.
And so you know,

521
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,490
if you're unemployed and you're under
economic stress and your marriage just

522
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:04,280
starting to shake and you're isolating
yourself from your friends and you're

523
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,470
less likely to be motivated to go look
for a job,

524
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,230
you can sort of think about that as a
depressive spiral,

525
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:13,550
but you can also think of it as a
conspiracy in some sense of external

526
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:17,120
forces that are arguing you into the
ground and we don't tend to

527
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:20,000
conceptualize psychological disorders
that way,

528
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,620
but we should because lots of times when
people are suffering from something that

529
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:28,400
you could describe in psychological
terminology and depression is a very

530
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,950
good example of that.
it isn't obvious that there's something

531
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,300
wrong with them psychologically.

532
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,510
Often they just are in trouble and there
isn't a category in psychological

533
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:42,731
diagnosis for client in serious trouble.
But my experience has been almost

534
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,880
without exception,
that the people that come to see me come

535
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,520
to see me because something's gone wrong
with their life.

536
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,110
Not because they have a psychological
problem.

537
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:52,040
Now you could say,
well,

538
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,300
there are psychological inadequacies
such as they might be,

539
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:59,930
are interfering with their ability to
recover or maybe even served as

540
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,760
precursors to,
you know,

541
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,740
increase the probability of the
catastrophe,

542
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:07,700
but it's still not exactly the
appropriate way to conceptualize it and

543
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,860
you know,
because you're,

544
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,950
there's you inside you and as a
personality psychologist in,

545
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,710
as a clinical theorists,
most of what I've talked to you guys

546
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:20,711
about is your psyche and its structure
as if it was like a soul that inhabited

547
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,330
you and,
and there's some real utility in that.

548
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,460
You know,
you're an individual demarcated from the

549
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:28,160
community.
You can be set up in a healthy manner

550
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,150
road,
not unhealthy manner.

551
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,790
The problem with that is that you're not
just an individual,

552
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,810
you're connected to all these external
network dynamic networks that are

553
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:38,150
really,
really important and it isn't even easy

554
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,250
to separate them from you.
You know,

555
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:43,610
like you might say,
well this is especially true once you

556
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:47,030
become a parent is like,
is your child more you than your arm?

557
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,090
You know,
you think it's pretty obvious that parts

558
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:53,840
of you that are physically linked.
Our more key to you to you as an entity,

559
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:57,860
but it's by no means obvious.
I think many people would much more

560
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:00,290
happily sacrifice at arm than a child
you know,

561
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,820
and so your boundaries are not where
your boundaries are located are not

562
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,640
precisely isomorphic with the outline of
your body.

563
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,430
It's not that simple at all,
and so you're embedded in all sorts of

564
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:14,780
networks that can pull you down rapidly
or elevate you because the other thing

565
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,830
that happens is that,
well,

566
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,870
let's say I've never traded with anyone
and I go up to someone and I say,

567
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:21,890
well,
do you want to trade?

568
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,030
And they say,
well,

569
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,060
why?
How?

570
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,930
How can I trust you?
And the answer to that is,

571
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,880
well,
you have take my word for it with that's

572
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,920
not.
That's not a very good argument.

573
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,720
You might say,
instead,

574
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,810
well here's what I have to offer and you
can evaluate it,

575
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,430
but the person's likely to say,
well,

576
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,550
I don't know how to evaluate it,
and so I'm still stuck with taking your

577
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,260
word.
So that's a bad problem.

578
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:46,080
And you'll see that if ever try to sell
a product in the marketplace is if you

579
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,420
don't,
if if the product is new and it's

580
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:51,000
complex,
then you're forcing the person that

581
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,540
wants to buy it to evaluate it and then
you're forcing them to take the risk of

582
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:58,350
being wrong as well as the time it would
take to evaluate it and they don't like

583
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,100
that.

584
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,740
WhAt they want is what's often called
social proof,

585
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:02,730
which is,
okay,

586
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,860
well you want to trade with me.
Who else have you traded with?

587
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,790
And if the answer is zero,
then they are going to say,

588
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,560
well,
you're an interesting person and all

589
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,270
that,
but I've got these other people over

590
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:16,560
here who've already traded with a bunch
of people and therefore the risk is

591
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:21,561
lower in part because let's say I have a
supervisor and I'm going to make a

592
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:25,650
decision and my primary concern is that
my supervisor will not hate me for

593
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:28,560
making the decision.
It's not my that my primary concern is

594
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:31,470
to make the best decision.
It's not the same thing.

595
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,070
It's that I want to make a decision that
I'm not going to get in trouble for,

596
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,740
okay,
so how do I do that because I need a

597
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,070
post hoc justification so I buy
something from you and it turns out to

598
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:44,460
be terrible and,
and I get called for it,

599
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,840
called on the table for it.

600
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,220
And what do I say?
I say,

601
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:48,250
well,
you know,

602
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,390
that person was buying from it and that
person was buying from,

603
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,520
from,
from him and that person was buying from

604
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:56,010
him like all these other people were
doing the same thing.

605
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,690
So it's not like the error is localized
in me and that's often a very credible

606
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,850
story.
But if the answer is,

607
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:03,451
well,
you know,

608
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:04,510
I,
I have held you waited,

609
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,210
it took,
decided to take a risk.

610
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:09,360
It's like out the door with you sunday
because you know,

611
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,790
that's just,
that's an indication that you're not

612
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,750
capable of doing that sort of thing.
So I think part of the reason that

613
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,760
people's spiraled downhill into zero is
because po positive feedback,

614
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,380
positive feedback loop is a loop that
increases the probability that the loop

615
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:26,880
will continue,
right?

616
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:29,670
A positive feedback loop is you've
experienced this when you hear

617
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:34,671
microphone feedback in an amplified
system so you know the microphone sends

618
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:40,050
a message to the speakers and then the
speakers send out the message amplified

619
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,590
and then the microphone picks up the
message and it gets amplified again and

620
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:46,980
you get this howling occur,
which is can be deafening but can also

621
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:50,850
destroy the system because it'll keep
amplifying upward until the speakers

622
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:51,990
blow,
for example.

623
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,400
That'S a positive feedback loop and a
positive feedback loop can spiral you

624
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,401
upward or it can spiral you downward.
And so a virtuous circle,

625
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,660
a virtuous positive feedback loop is
weird.

626
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:05,640
Well,
I've traded with him and I've traded

627
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:08,550
with him and I've traded with him and
now I can say to you,

628
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,790
I've traded with these three people and
you go talk to them and they say good

629
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,960
things,
and so then you say,

630
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:13,980
well,
I'll trade with you,

631
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,710
and then because of that,
then you're even more likely to trade

632
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:19,170
with me.
And it's like the thing starts to spiral

633
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,290
uphill and it does that,
I think in a nonlinear form.

634
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,010
and so because one of the things you
guys are going to be asking yourself as

635
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:29,070
you mature,
because what's happening is that income

636
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,810
inequality is increasing,
right?

637
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,591
And you might ask,
well,

638
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:32,670
why that?
Why is that?

639
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,510
The first thing you need to know is that
that's what income does.

640
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,120
So it's not like you need an explanation
for it.

641
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,710
This is the explanation.
It's like a rule.

642
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,220
If you run a trading game to its logical
conclusion,

643
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:48,880
one person ends up with all the money
and everyone else ends up with zero.
