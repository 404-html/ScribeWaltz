1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,690
I want you to got gathering information
from outside yourself.

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:06,830
Oh,
start gathering it from the answer.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,190
He made a mistake
and he paid for his mistake with a lot

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,940
of pain,
a lot of tears,

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,040
and there came to a point where he knew
he should have gotten a divorce,

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,510
but he was stuck.
He was stuck in something called

7
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,250
revenge.
He said,

8
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:32,830
she's made me so miserable,
I'm going to pay him back.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,710
He was stuck and he stayed in there
longer than he should have because it

10
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,790
began to attack him.
It began to affect them psychologically.

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,020
He took that same attitude to other
relationships looking for something to

12
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,690
go wrong.
He was burned so badly.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,400
He did not want to risk pain again.
He was going in relationships trying to

14
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:05,410
avoid pain.
When it became two calls,

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,080
he would do something to make sure the
relationship did not work.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,530
He would always try and find something
wrong.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,680
The person,
because they're not perfect people,

18
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,330
so if you look forward,
you can find it.

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,943
He was stuck

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,513
in revenge.

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,940
Is he difficult?
Sure isn't.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,580
Anything that's worthy of character
building.

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,420
Sometimes I have to forgive the same
people over and over and over again.

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,540
However,
forgiveness is a practice worth

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,000
cultivating,
worth experiencing.

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,870
When you forgive somebody for something
that you perceived that they've done

27
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:41,380
wrong to you,
you are releasing that animosity,

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,410
that energy that ill will,
that you're harboring inside and it's a

29
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:49,390
lot more difficult than just merely
saying,

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,420
I'm sorry.
I once heard somebody say that,

31
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,240
I never met a critic that's doing better
than me.

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,290
I never met a hater that's doing better
than me in that.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,790
That's the truth.
I love my haters.

34
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,620
I love my critics.
You know,

35
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,820
it would be amazing.
It'd be amazing if motivation on the

36
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,280
Cape and positive places engine.
A lot of people say that.

37
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,470
A lot of people speak on that.
I don't,

38
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,810
I don't think that's true and I strongly
disagree.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,850
Truth is,
I don't think people understood what it

40
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,780
was I was doing at Schafer.
I wasn't there to conduct when you

41
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:36,540
fucking moron can wave his arms and keep
people in tempo.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,440
I was there to push people beyond what's
expected.

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,880
I believe that is
an absolute necessity.

44
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,560
I think you become more motivated when
you're able to transform it and it into

45
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,530
a positive and sometimes our best
motivation.

46
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,710
Sometimes I'm my most motivated by my
critics,

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,070
but people who are negative,
but people told me,

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,990
who told me I'm too young for people who
told me I can't do what I'm not cut out

49
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,570
for it.
That drives me.

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,730
Find out the reasons that will make you
stronger.

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,240
Make you walk by faith and not by sight,
and will make you pursue your dream when

52
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:29,050
everybody is against you or don't
believe in your number and let me tell

53
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,140
you something that's a lonely feeling,
lonely feeling,

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,430
particularly people that you're doing it
for or people that stand to benefit the

55
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,500
most.
Or people who should be the number one

56
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:43,501
members in the encouragement club,
but they end up saying you can't do it,

57
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,460
and they become members of the
discouragement.

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,280
Oh,
it hurts very badly.

59
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,910
I know what that's like.
Have people that you love close to that

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,850
look at you with that look and say,
why don't you try something else?

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,290
Why don't you give up?
But this is my life.

62
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,340
I have got to do this.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,870
Everyone tells you what to do,
what's good for you.

64
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,540
They don't want you to find you all the
answers.

65
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,060
They want you to believe that.
