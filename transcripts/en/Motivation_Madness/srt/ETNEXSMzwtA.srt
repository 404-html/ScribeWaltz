1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,870
When you start thinking about Alexa and
all these other things,

2
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:13,810
one of the things that my career has
been completely predicated on is the

3
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:17,650
fact that I am willing to take chances
on things that aren't mainstream yet

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:21,030
because I understand that if I go after
social code and I,

5
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:25,500
if I go after vine and if I go after
Mick Mack and if I go after Yak and all,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,040
if I go after all these things that I
only need one of those seven to actually

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,370
hit snapchat,
instagram to win that bet.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,550
We have enormous fear in this room to I
have to wait or let's wait to it's big

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:43,390
or what if I waste my time right?
Will I waste my time on these platforms

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,380
if it doesn't become big?
And so one of the other themes that I

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,820
really wanted to leave here with
tonight,

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,800
knowing the demo of this room is we have
to have a lot more risk tolerance on new

13
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,400
platforms.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,820
If you're not playing back to details
that I know you're taking notes.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
If you're not playing with Marco Polo
and afterschool and House party,

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,830
then you're not there potentially at the
platforms.

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,620
That can become the next things at the
top of our tongue.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,810
How many people here?
Let's be really honest.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,400
Let's be really,
really,

20
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,140
really honest with ourselves.
Inbound,

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,290
please raise your hand if this is true.
How many people in this room,

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,230
and I want everybody look around,
said two and a half years ago,

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,120
three years ago,
maybe even a year ago,

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,230
that they would never be on snapchat.
That was stupid and now have a snapchat

25
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,520
account.
Raise your hands,

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,270
raise it high,
higher this.

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,340
This is where all the action is.
This is where all the action is.

28
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:41,260
This is the opportunity in this room,
but we continue to downplay.

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,360
We continue to downplay the upside
because we feared the risk of being on

30
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,010
there and wasting time.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,660
If you have not achieved what you want
to professionally or in life,

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,070
time is the number one thing you've got.
You need to deploy as much of that as

33
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:00,520
humanly possible.
That is the asset when you have not

34
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,310
achieved the things that you want to
happen in life,

35
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,520
and it is because of time that you ever
wanted to put into these platforms and

36
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,460
worlds.
That is a massive mistake.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,420
It's the one asset you have.
Not Everybody in this room has money.

38
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,180
It's true.
You agree?

39
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,520
Right?
So are you going to work in fucking face

40
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,050
off?
Thank you.

41
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,600
It's the one thing we have.
It's the one thing we have because

42
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,630
everybody wants to come up with excuses.
I'd spend my life reading excuses on

43
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:34,960
social media and my inbox of this.
I wasn't born that way.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,790
I wasn't born here.
This,

45
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,190
I'm a female,
I'm an immigrant,

46
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm a minority.

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,380
I'm a transgender ix excuses reality.
By the way,

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,250
I truly believe those are disadvantages.
I'm not naive to the shortcomings of

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,160
this country.
The problem is nobody cares.

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,340
The market doesn't care.
So we sit and we dwell and if so,

51
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,870
what do you think we've been doing for
the last month and what we're going to

52
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:02,080
do morning,
we're going to dwell and complain and

53
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,800
that's utter defense instead of going on
the office.

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
And so we spend unbelievable amounts of
time dwelling and wasting our time on

55
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,550
dumb shit.
Like peop.

56
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,790
People literally email me and say,
you're so lucky and I wish this was

57
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,820
happening to me.
And then the third tweet or the third

58
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,580
instagram post is awesome.
Saturday stayed home and watched and

59
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,510
tighter season of fucking game of
thrones.

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,123
Yeah.

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,860
We need to start understanding how big
this opportunity is because it's for

62
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:35,430
everybody in this room.
You will sit back in 2030 years and

63
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,740
regret if you didn't execute in this
era.

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,470
And by the way,
I don't want to hear that this is for 20

65
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:45,471
and 30 year olds,
40 50 60 70 it's an equal playing field.

66
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,590
If you're willing to be a practitioner
and understand the ecosystem that I've

67
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:52,080
been speaking about tonight,
there's never been a better time.

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,490
Look,
it's very obvious,

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,870
these kind of characters.
There was no respect for 20 year olds in

70
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,940
the business world 20 years ago when I
came out.

71
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,210
But now because of technology,
there's a lot of organizations that

72
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,700
apple solutely respect 20 and 30 year
olds.

73
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,000
Also,
what is happening is I'm spending so

74
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:13,080
much time with 40 to 60 year old
executives who are dwelling and are

75
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:18,081
upset and tell me dumb shit like Gary,
I didn't grow up with this shit.

76
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,460
Neither did I.
Alice

77
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,460
I was 20 before I even was on a
computer.

78
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,480
I think grow up with this shit.
I figured it out and so I sit there and

79
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:36,481
see completely capable operators that
have made it happen for the last 2030

80
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:41,950
years being crippled by,
I don't understand how snapchat works.

81
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,940
It's so confusing.
Were just filled with excuses.

82
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,670
We are,
people are just losing their hunger and

83
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,600
then,
and then by the way,

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,870
let me get really mad for two seconds
with my fancy rich friends.

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,820
The thing that I'm completely blown away
by that I had no idea was going on in

86
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,660
capitalism and meritocracy is once you
get rich,

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,730
you actually try to spend your dollars
to create laws that allow you not to

88
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:11,731
work and still hold onto your money.
100% right?

89
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,670
I mean I'm blown away by this.
You were benefit,

90
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,390
you were benefited because in your
twenties to 60 for 40 years you grinded

91
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,120
and out executed somebody and you were
able to make lots of money.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,240
But now that you're tired and you're
finished and you're older and don't want

93
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,190
to put in the work,
you don't want the next young buck to

94
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,520
come along and eat your lunch.
That's not how capitalism works.

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,660
True.
It's just not.

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,690
And so we have all these trends and we
have the great fortune of living in an

97
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,990
era where things have been really good
for a very long time.

98
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,590
And so I walk around the world and I
told my wife,

99
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,371
Lizzie,
I'm like Lizzie,

100
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,950
listen to me.
I don't care clearly cause I was such a

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,180
shit student with the kids do with
school.

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,450
But please,
they can't be in programs where we give

103
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:07,451
away seventh place trophies.
I have no idea who wins the election

104
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,560
tonight,
but we need to fucking band seventh

105
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,030
place trophies and America.

106
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,660
So we have all these macro situations
going on and not to mention for a lot of

107
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:25,740
people here are under 30 you haven't
been in the game during an economic

108
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:29,070
downturn because things have been very
cushy for the last seven years where if

109
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,350
you're 23 years old and you have an
idea,

110
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:34,560
your company's miraculously worth $4
million.

111
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,030
And so we're living in a very intriguing
time and I think that the passion and he

112
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,660
anx and the energy that I bring tonight
are predicated on a couple of tried and

113
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,100
true things.
Number one,

114
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,970
if you're not making longterm decisions,
you will be vulnerable.

115
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,330
The market's changing very quickly and
anybody who's looking for short term

116
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,630
stuff gets short term stuff and then
gets hurt in the long term.

117
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,210
Things like Airbnb,
guys,

118
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,270
airbnb shouldn't have been invented by
Brian and Joe.

119
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,760
Airbnb should have been invented by
Merriot.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,350
But merriot is looking short term and
isn't creating business models to put

121
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:11,880
themselves out of business.
Uber should have not been created by

122
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,840
Garrett and they shouldn't.
They should have not been created by

123
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,810
Garrett and Travis.
They should have been created by the guy

124
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:23,130
or girl that owned the most medallions
in New York City or by Grey Hound.

125
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,920
If you sit here tonight and you're doing
well,

126
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,630
you're in danger because there's
somebody young and hungry that has the

127
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,290
Internet,
which is a platform that creates a zero

128
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,710
cost to get into the game that's coming
after your shit.

129
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,980
So if you don't do what I do,
which is wake up every single morning,

130
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,300
every single morning and try to put
yourself out of business,

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,870
somebody else is gonna do it for you.
It is much more fun,

132
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,300
my friends,
to put yourself out of business than

133
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:54,150
have somebody else do it for you.
And so please,

134
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,600
if your cushy who's cushy,
raise your hand if shit's going real

135
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,434
well.

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,750
Jesus Christ.
Three people raise their hand.

137
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,360
I think you need to shut down this
fucking,

138
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,253
you don't.
Good.

139
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,260
Awesome.
What was that?

140
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,841
I was like,
you're doing good.

141
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:13,291
You're like,
yeah,

142
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,160
we're doing okay.
You know,

143
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,040
he always,
so you've got to understand.

144
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,640
The only thing that's interesting to me,
and the only thing I have,

145
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:28,641
I always say that basically my career is
predicated much more similar to Mariano

146
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,330
Rivera than anything else that I can
think of.

147
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,690
If you're a baseball fan.
He was a very good closer for the New

148
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,690
York Yankees where basically his entire
career was predicated on one pitch.

149
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,110
He had one pitch for 17 years and nobody
could hit it,

150
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,410
and that's basically my business career.
I've got one pitch,

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,770
which is the following.
I know what you're going to do before

152
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:52,650
you know you're going to do it.
It's the thing that I was gifted with.

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,000
Just like if you can sing just like it's
you.

154
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,700
I've always had the intuition I was made
fun of and aggressively made fun of for

155
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:04,530
launching a website in 1996 because just
like people sit here and think that vine

156
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,320
or snapchat is a fad.
There's people in this room that

157
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,080
remember where the whole Internet was a
fad,

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,280
but I bet on it and I built a big
business and then I was made fun of

159
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,090
because this thing called Youtube came
out and I took a chance on that cause I

160
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,640
thought it was going to be big and
started a wine show in Santa in front of

161
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,970
a camera and drank four bottles of wine
for 20 minutes and hundreds of thousands

162
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:28,971
of people watched it
and then that worked and then twitter

163
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,670
worked and then I invested in twitter
and facebook and things of that nature.

164
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,850
But I had so many losses along the way.
One thing that's never talked about with

165
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:41,880
my genius career was that I was on
youtube super early,

166
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,680
but I left six months in and started
producing wine library TV exclusively on

167
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,500
viddler.
I was wrong.

168
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,080
One thing that's not talked about is
that I thought that the biggest startup

169
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:01,220
in the world in 2010 was going to be Yo
Bango.

170
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,220
I was wrong
and I continue to be interested in being

171
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:14,170
wrong for the rest of my life because I
am a pure bred entrepreneur because I'm

172
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:19,171
not scared of trying things and wasting
my valuable time because I want things

173
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,180
and most of all,
and this is the most of all the whole

174
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,970
thing.
I just genuinely don't give a fuck about

175
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:29,971
what you think about me
balanced with,

176
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,780
I really care about what everybody says
about me

177
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,520
and in that friction,
I mean that you have to deploy real ego

178
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,150
and real humility around this course
because we live in that world.

179
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,060
But if I could inspire anything in the
time that I was here today,

180
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,030
it's very simply this,
please do me one favor.

181
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,820
I'm going to wrap it up with this and
this matters so much to me.

182
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,500
Please,
whatever it takes,

183
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,610
call your grandmother,
go to your great grandfather's burial

184
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,980
spot.
Go back to the old country,

185
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,280
go to a shelter,
do something,

186
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,670
do something that recalibrates your
perspective on what is actually going on

187
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,180
here.
We have never had it better.

188
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,180
My friends.
I'm going to leave you with a very

189
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,130
interesting data point.
You guys like data.

190
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,170
Who likes data?
Great.

191
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,790
Let me give you some fucking data.
More people in America will die from a

192
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,090
coconut falling out of a tree and
hitting you on the head and killing you.

193
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,350
Then terrorism.

194
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,653
Yeah,

195
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,590
I see you tentative like is he fucking
serious?

196
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm dead fucking serious.

197
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,010
Kids seven to 11 watch more twitch east
sports than all the four major sports

198
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,180
combined.
That's data we are living through a

199
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,410
totally different type of 10 years ago,
the weirdest thing in the world was your

200
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:04,411
friend dated people online.
Now every single person's swipes to the

201
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,030
left and right,
24 seven

202
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,890
and so the trends and our society have
changed and either you're going to sit

203
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,470
here and binary.
This is a black and white conversation.

204
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,180
Either you're going to leave here and
understand how fucking awesome it is and

205
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:26,530
you're going to take full advantage of
it and be a winner or you're going to

206
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:31,420
sit and dwell on all the negatives of it
and be a losing player.

207
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,270
It's just the truth.
It's not complicated.

208
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,090
It's not fun for me to say,
I don't want you to lose.

209
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,480
I desperately want you to win,
but this is on you.

210
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,900
Nobody else is in control.
There are people who deal with things

211
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,170
like the loss of their children or real
diseases.

212
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,020
We're sitting in dwelling about not
getting enough likes on fucking

213
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,410
instagram.
We're sitting in dwelling about forces

214
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:58,411
that don't really have impact on us.
It is time that this collective room and

215
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,430
our space understands.
This is the greatest golden era of not

216
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,550
only business but life.
And you're really,

217
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,070
and I mean really need to fucking grab
it.

218
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,060
Thank you.
