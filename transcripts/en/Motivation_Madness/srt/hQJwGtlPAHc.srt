1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,780
We all have this negative self talk that
goes in our head.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,440
Guess what?
There's enough people that are telling

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,440
us we can't do it,
that we're not good enough.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,860
Why do we want to tell ourselves that we
know for a fact that thoughts influence

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,620
actions?
We sat there with the,

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,920
um,
with the video sheldon,

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,460
Dr Levy,
so right.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,340
We know that our thoughts influence
actions.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,370
Why do we want to see that negative self
talk to ourselves?

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,420
We need to get our own self affirmation,
Muhammad Ali.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,500
What was his self affirmation?
I am the greatest.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,290
Who else is going to tell you they need
to be quiet moments in your bedroom,

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,350
quiet moments when you're brushing your
teeth,

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,740
that we need to reaffirm I am the
captain of my ship and the master of my

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,240
fate.
That is my affirmation and looking

16
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,340
forward to a time that I would feel good
again,

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,530
helped me to keep moving forward.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,000
And sometimes I had to be brave and it
wasn't always easy.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,390
Sometimes I faltered,
I had bad days,

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,020
but I realized that being brave isn't
supposed to be easy.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,590
And for me,
I feel it's the key way to keep moving

22
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:17,340
forward.
So all at all,

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,360
I don't waste energy feeling bad for
myself.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,270
I surround myself,
people that I want to be with,

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,260
and I keep moving.
So with this philosophy,

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,950
I hope that all of you,
regardless of your obstacles,

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,080
you can have a very happy life as well.
When I am the captain of my ship,

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,080
I don't see it.
If no one else will

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,290
get away,
there's enough of that Muhammad Ali,

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,890
I am the greatest.
There is no one better than me.

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,850
It's a difference between Hubris and ego
and false pride.

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,600
It's just reminding yourself and quiet
silent moments.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,870
I put it down on the list.
It's right beside my mirror

34
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,960
in
Russia.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,780
Ever mainland Japan ever met in your
pyramid in America,

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,370
the whole world.
Big Deal.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
So I kept working to
be champion of the world,

38
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,490
but better than all of those before me,
I'm not going to argue with you.

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,340
You're going to be just like that in
some of your already there.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,530
Well,
you don't know how you're going to make

41
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,364
this happen,

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,820
but you just feel within yourself some
way somehow with the help of God,

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm going to make it happen.
Repeat after me please.

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,400
No matter how bad it is.
Oh,

45
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,410
how bad it gets.
I'm going to make it.

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,570
I'm going to make it
shakes his hand on your right and left

47
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:30,641
and say you got the right stuff.
Yes,

48
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,040
it's possible for you to live your dream

49
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,120
because it's not about where you come
from.

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,620
It's about hormones.
That's number one.

51
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,330
What's number two?
Number two,

52
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,830
test number two.
I want to make sure you got it.

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,170
This has to be
the important thing.

54
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,860
Is this like what I'm saying?
Listen,

55
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,040
to me,
the most important thing is this.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
To be able
to sacrifice what you for.

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I have wrestled with alligators
out of handcuffs,

58
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,290
lightning and in jail.
Last week I'm murdered.

59
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,100
Angelo's stone hospitalize a brick.
I'm so mean.

60
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:41,550
I make medicine sick,
dude,

61
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,510
man.
Fast,

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,350
fast.
Cut The light off in my bedroom.

63
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,740
It switched.
Was in the band for the room was dog

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,240
fast.
You George Foreman.

65
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,980
All you chumps about.
When I up in all of you,

66
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,230
I know you get him.
I know you got him picked,

67
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,380
but the in trouble.
I'm going to show you how great I am.
