1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,720
Sitting on the same football field,
1993

2
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,950
and I made a quilt.
Okay.

3
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,580
There's some people call concert versus
I called the confidence.

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,350
I said that I might be the greatest
player that ever woke up out of the

5
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:41,351
University of mine.
I did not say that because I thought I

6
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:46,990
was better than everybody else.
I see it there simply because I was

7
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:51,991
willing to put into work to now be back
here 18 years later,

8
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,060
my asking nobody for nothing today I'm
not.

9
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,620
I'm just sharing my story to tell y'all
every time you'd think somebody got a

10
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:16,621
good man and always good
as you guys said in man,

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,180
I sat around the greatest athletes in
the world.

12
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,960
There's no other man out there willing
to give up what I'm willing to give up.

13
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,370
I said that in 1993 when I said I wanted
to be degraded as hurricane and the only

14
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,130
thing that I got in the middle of all of
that,

15
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,680
this is the only thing in the father's
work,

16
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,740
this results,
there's no other blue.

17
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,960
I ain't got no other secrets to tell
y'all.

18
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,270
I ain't come here with nothing else but
to tell you if you want to do something

19
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,910
for
you,

20
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:09,911
want a better relationship with God,
there's not a person on my team is 16

21
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:27,610
years that is consistently beat me to
the ball every play.

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,990
Then again going to do a town
as it's got everything to do with

23
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,050
effort.
Nothing else.

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,740
15 straight years,
12 four bowls late.

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,260
And the only thing that's kept me around
as much effort.

26
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,240
So when you put on this all I ever knew,
what's the effort we'll get me scene,

27
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
I won't take efforts will get me noticed
to get to the league effort to one day

28
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:13,801
take care of my mom and my key effort,
which is which one you and

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,270
nobody else can give you their
efforts with the side.

30
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,730
And I'm still granted because the next,
let's talk about begin to all keep

31
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,000
watching me.
If I ain't

32
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,160
nobody ain't got convinced me of what I
do,

33
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,310
I'd do what I do because I do what I do.
Focus on heal from some

34
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,120
unmanned in creative.
Every one of you mean and here I have

35
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,820
that opportunity man.
But ask yourself the question,

36
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,170
personally,
I'm a Sam.

37
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,180
You really
question is,

38
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:12,280
what are you going to do with your time?
What drives,

39
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:17,281
you
know,

40
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,490
what you carry?
You carry a

41
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,620
legacy.
Greatness.

42
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,350
Greatness is a lot of small things done
when they after day,

43
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,860
workout after workout.
Obedience after will be the day

44
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,770
greatness as a lot of small things done
well.
