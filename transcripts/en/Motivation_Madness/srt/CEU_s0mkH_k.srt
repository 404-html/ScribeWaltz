1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,060
What happened with me with this film,
so I accepted the film and I was really

2
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,840
excited to,
to take this and I love the idea and I

3
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:20,841
was reading it and I've gotten probably
two weeks into my preparation for the

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,981
film and my father was diagnosed with
cancer and I was like,

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,150
you know,
first it,

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,160
it stunned me and then it was the
magical work of the universe.

7
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,881
I could not believe that this was the
film I was working on and I was,

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,960
you know,
forced to face,

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,880
you know,
my father is mortality.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,290
So it was,
it was rough for about a week and I got

11
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:56,640
it together and I decided that we would
use the process of the character who was

12
00:00:56,641 --> 00:01:01,641
suffering a loss.
And I would share my preparation with my

13
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,720
father.
And so we just started talking about

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,210
love,
time and death.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,373
And we,
we,

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,530
it was some of the most open and
powerful conversations that we,

17
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:16,734
you know,
we,

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,830
we'd ever had.
And um,

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,520
they,
they gave him six weeks and he actually,

20
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:28,521
he lived for four months.
So about three months into the six

21
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,800
weeks,
you know,

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,650
I go to see him one day and he said,
man,

23
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,880
this shit is embarrassing.

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,261
And I said,
what?

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,100
Daddy said,
man,

26
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,660
you tell everybody you will be dead.
Okay.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Six weeks later you still hanging around
ms dot right.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,390
It was so beautiful.
He got,

29
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,180
we got to a place that we were talking
open and,

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,360
and comedically yet.
And really I think I was able to embody

31
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,361
the ideas of the loss and also the
redemptive quality of the pain.

32
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:03,224
You know,
the,

33
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,350
the loss is bound to joy.
Like pain and suffering are bound to

34
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:11,970
joy.
The,

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,500
the,
being able to survive something is

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,560
actually a big part of being able to
find that next wave of joy.

37
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:25,850
You appreciate the smaller things,
right?

38
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:29,690
Like it was so magnificent for me.
Um,

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,150
you know,
my,

40
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,940
my father died on a,
on November seventh,

41
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,220
um,
but it was so powerful for me to be

42
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:45,221
cleansed of box office.
Like I don't need the box office to be

43
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,640
huge on this film.
I don't need to win any awards,

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,910
you know,
I don't care.

45
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,970
It was the film that I worked on it,
I was actually able to comfortably and

46
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,690
beautifully say goodbye to my father and
I hope that this film embodies a bit of

47
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:05,680
that.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,830
So other people who are experiencing
things like that,

49
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,831
we'll be able to use it in that,
in that way and it can potentially be

50
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:16,930
helpful and help someone else.
So it was,

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,080
it was powerful to be cleansed of the
foolishness of the game of numbers and

52
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:27,130
awards and all of that type of stuff to
actually be able to be able to create a

53
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:32,131
piece of art that legitimately I just
want people to see and hope it can be

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,020
helpful and transformative in their
lives.

55
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,240
You're talking about perspective
perspective?

56
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,320
Absolutely.
Yes.

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes.
How much is fair play into preventing us

58
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:45,040
from grasping perspective though?
Oh,

59
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,730
no,
fears.

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,780
Everything.
Yeah.

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,610
Like if,
if there's,

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,380
if there was one,
a concept that I would

63
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,940
suggest to people to take a daily
confrontation with his fear.

64
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,000
Um,
the,

65
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,260
the,
the problem with fear is that it lies,

66
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,380
right?
So fear tells you,

67
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,700
hey,
you know,

68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,460
if,
if you say that to that girl,

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,400
she's going to know he has you,
you know,

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,110
and she'll never really be attracted to
you if she knows how much you attracted

71
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,480
to her.
Don't say that.

72
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,300
No.
How we get her is when she walks by.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,380
Ignore her.

74
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,750
You know,
it's like,

75
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,660
fear tells you dumb shit like that,
you know.

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,170
So for me,
the,

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,290
the daily confrontation,
um,

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,970
we're with fear has become a real
practice for me since about three,

79
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,870
three years ago,
um,

80
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,310
I went,
uh,

81
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,470
I went skydiving in Dubai,
right as skydiving,

82
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,200
skydiving.
Really interesting.

83
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,580
Confront with fear,
right?

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,890
So I gotta I gotta stand up.
All right,

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,780
so,
so all your friends,

86
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,250
what happens?
You go out how you.

87
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,060
Oh,
sorry,

88
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,060
dropped my thing.
So what happens is you go out the night

89
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,590
before and you,
you know,

90
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,020
you take a drink with your friends and
somebody says,

91
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,030
yeah,
we should go skydiving tomorrow.

92
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,950
And you go,
yeah,

93
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,090
we'll go skydiving.
Well,

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,580
yes.
Everybody goes,

95
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,110
yeah,
right.

96
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,260
And you go home and you're by yourself.
You're like,

97
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,340
right.
You're like,

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,821
well,
yeah,

99
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,420
I mean they,
they was drunk too,

100
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,580
right?
So,

101
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,990
so maybe,
maybe they not,

102
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,710
maybe,
maybe.

103
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,960
I mean we don't have to go,
we don't have to do it.

104
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,470
So then that night you're laying in your
bed and you just keep,

105
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,720
you're terrified.
You keep imagining over and over again

106
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,650
jumping out of an airplane and you can't
figure out why you would do that.

107
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,720
Right.
And you're laying there and you have the

108
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,990
worst night's sleep of your life,
but you still have to hope that your

109
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,580
friends were drunk.
Right?

110
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,920
So you wake up the next day and you go
down and you said where you were going

111
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,010
to meet and everybody's there.
You're like,

112
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
ah,
shit.

113
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,380
Alright,
alright,

114
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,861
cool.
Cool,

115
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:07,371
cool,
cool,

116
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,204
cool,
cool.

117
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,840
Right.
So you get in a van and you don't know

118
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,000
that your friends had the same night
that you had.

119
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,470
Cause they're pretending like they
didn't.

120
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,340
They were like,
yeah man,

121
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,760
my uncle's a navy seal and you know,
it's going to be great.

122
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm looking forward to this.
And you're like,

123
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,030
oh my God,
Oh my God.

124
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,790
And your stomach is terrible.
You can't eat.

125
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,240
And everything,
but you don't want to be the only punk

126
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,930
who doesn't jump out of this airplane.
So you get there and then you have the

127
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,990
safety brief and you're standing there
and the guys will tell you what the

128
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,970
chute doesn't open.
What's going to happen is you're doing,

129
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,980
you will help with while working out

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
the shoe.
The shoe wouldn't open,

131
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,000
right?
So you do a thing and what you do is

132
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,940
your first jump.
You're attached to a guy who,

133
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,560
you know,
he's going to walk you out.

134
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:54,561
So you go and you get there and there's
an airplane and nobody's stopping.

135
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,620
Everybody's still going.
So you get onto the airplane and you're

136
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,910
sitting there and,
and you know it's extra because you sit

137
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,630
in on some dude's lap,
some stranger,

138
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,930
you sit on his lap and it's,
you know,

139
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,850
you're trying to make small talk.
Yeah man.

140
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,721
So you deal,
you'd be,

141
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,070
you'd be jumping with people all the
time,

142
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,904
Huh?

143
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,990
Right.
You know,

144
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,090
so,
and then you just want to make sure you

145
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,851
got,
you've got kids,

146
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,230
right?
You got people you need to see.

147
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,800
Just want to make sure he series right.
So you get in there,

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,530
so everything's normal.
So you fly and you go up,

149
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:30,430
you go up and you go up and you go up to
14,000 feet and you notice there's a,

150
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,450
a light is red and it's yellow and
green,

151
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,550
right?
So right now the light's red.

152
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,790
So then you start thinking at some point
the light's going to go green if you

153
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,800
don't know what's going to happen,
right?

154
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,240
And you wait and it goes yellow and the
light goes green and somebody opens the

155
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,580
door.
And in that moment you realize you've

156
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,100
never been in a freaking airplane with
the door open,

157
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,143
right?

158
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,740
Right.
Terror.

159
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,251
Oh,
sorry,

160
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,960
I'm speeding.
Oh,

161
00:07:58,961 --> 00:07:59,990
sorry,
go.

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
Terror,
terror,

163
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,470
terror,
terror.

164
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,880
Right?
So you go and then you know,

165
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,290
if you're,
if you were smart,

166
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,480
you sat in the back so you don't go
first,

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,880
right?
And then people start going out of the

168
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:17,881
airplane and you go and the guy walks
you up to the end of the thing and

169
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:24,631
you're standing and your toes are on the
edge and you're looking out down to

170
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,560
death.
And they say,

171
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,453
Oh,
I'm three.

172
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,800
And they say one,
two,

173
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,040
and he pushes you on to,
because people grab one three,

174
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,800
right?
And you go

175
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,510
and you fall out of the airplane and in
one second you realize that it's the

176
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:55,191
most blissful experience of your life,
your flying right?

177
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,470
It doesn't feel like falling,
right?

178
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,940
It's like you actually are Kinda held a
little bit by the wind and then you

179
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,940
start and you start falling,
you fallen,

180
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,410
and you.
There's zero fear.

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
You realize that the point of maximum
danger is the point of minimum fear.

182
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,140
It's Boulez,
it's bliss and you're flying,

183
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,040
right?
Or you're doing it.

184
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,430
And then 20 seconds,
25 seconds,

185
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,610
40 seconds,
and you have enough time to just kind of

186
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,930
be like,
oh shit.

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,070
That's that building.
I sound like.

188
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,090
Right,
right.

189
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,740
You start doing all of that.
And the lesson for me was,

190
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,680
why were you scared in your bed the
night before?

191
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,440
Why did you,
what do you need that fear for?

192
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,280
Just don't go.
Why are you scared in your bed?

193
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:53,570
Sixteen hours before you jump.
Why are you scared in the car?

194
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,170
Why could you not enjoy breakfast with
what,

195
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:01,250
what?
What did you need to fear is fear of

196
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:04,100
what?
You're nowhere even near the airplane.

197
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,190
Everything up to the stepping out.
There's actually no reason to be scared.

198
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,460
It only just ruins your day,
your,

199
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,910
you don't have to jump.
And then in that moment,

200
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,960
all of a sudden where you should be
terrified is the most blissful

201
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,050
experience of your life.
And God placed the best things in life

202
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,170
on the other side of terror,
on the other side of your maximum fear.

203
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,830
All of them.
The best things in life.

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,020
So that was that.
Sorry.

205
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,420
Was that?
Yeah,

206
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,860
that was,
that was my experience with,

207
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,700
uh,
with sky diving and fear and practically

208
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,200
speaking,
but I didn't like that take.

209
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:45,270
I'm going to do it again.
Back to this.

210
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,870
I can sell that better.
I can sell it back.

211
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,260
When you decide to do something like
that,

212
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,140
like how does it work practically?
Do you call your wife and be like,

213
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,010
I might be dead tomorrow right now,
but that's just the promise.

214
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,860
I made a drug promise you here.
How about this?

215
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:06,630
So I jumped.
I had such a mystical,

216
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,670
powerful spiritual experience.
I flew home and got my sons and I went

217
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:17,041
back and 10 days later my son's jumped
right now.

218
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,640
That was a little different.
I want to say it.

219
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,030
It makes me stand out because I'm
scared.

220
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,310
I'm scared
it was one.

221
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,260
So Jayden went first,
right?

222
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,170
Jaiden wants to do everything first,
so I'm sitting there and I'm like,

223
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,820
yeah,
my sons are going to have this crazy

224
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,850
experience.
And then Jaden went out of the airplane

225
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,713
that was like,
Hey,

226
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,350
no.
My oldest son Trey goes up and he goes

227
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:46,351
out of the airplane and I was like,
this could potentially be the worst.

228
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,340
I have African American parenting in
history.

229
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,940
It was like both my sons just fell out
of an airplane.

230
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,700
Right?
Because I told them to.

231
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,340
But again,
the fear again,

232
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:01,630
I was like,
oh my God.

233
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,920
So I told the dude,
I was like,

234
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,540
listen,
I want to see them go out,

235
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
but I also want to see them land.
And he's like,

236
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,434
no,
it's cool.

237
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,730
So this time we went out and we did the
straight bullet and I just went straight

238
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,440
down,
pass them.

239
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,873
Right.
It was

240
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,583
good.

241
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,780
Right?
Did the bullish straight past,

242
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,010
pulled his shoot late,

243
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,543
sorry,

244
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,710
pull the shoot late,
landed and then videoed them coming

245
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,440
down.
But it was like they had the same thing,

246
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,260
the same experience with the fear,
but that I'm telling you,

247
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,020
the confrontation with fear is an
absolute,

248
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,910
a magical way of facing the things we
have to do in this life,

249
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,010
you know,
forget security live for.

250
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,510
No.
You say you learned that three years

251
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,344
ago.
Yeah.

252
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,520
Amazing.
Um,

253
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,290
what about the small things that we get
a freedom of?

254
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,770
Right.
So you are the funny guy.

255
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,890
You come along and everybody expects to
be entertained in some muscle.

256
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,620
Are you ever afraid that

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,533
you're like,
you know what,

258
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,840
today I'm really not feeling Jazzy Jeff.
I got to just,

259
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't want to be that guy today.
So this whole movie,

260
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,000
that guy,
right?

261
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,040
Yeah.
Do you have fear of that?

262
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,090
Of like disappointing people because
like,

263
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,700
you're supposed to be funny and cool.

264
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,431
Yeah.
You know,

265
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:27,020
the thing that,
that's been one of the,

266
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:32,021
the major conference for me and my life
over the past three or four years,

267
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,700
like,
um,

268
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,920
there's a,
there's a will smith is an idea,

269
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,830
right?
So there's parts of that that's me,

270
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,380
but that character from the fresh prince
of Bel Air was who I was 26,

271
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
six years ago
this month.

272
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,160
He's talking about evolve,

273
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,010
but that,
that's the thing to be able to,

274
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,280
um,
to boldly be able to move and grow and

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,170
create and hope that the things that
I'm,

276
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,470
you know,
able to deliver at this point.

277
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:19,080
You know,
I was,

278
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,130
I was 20 during the fresh prince,
you know,

279
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,890
so I'm,
I'm a 48 now,

280
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:26,960
so it's a,
it's a,

281
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,820
it's a really different time in my life.
Yeah.

282
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:30,810
That got less of a chair.

283
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,013
Yeah.
Like,

284
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,160
tell us what that's like.

285
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,570
Um,
but yeah,

286
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,260
you know,
you have a fear of being completely who

287
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,220
you are because it may disappoint some
people just want to see that 28

288
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,500
year olds.
No,

289
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,640
I definitely,
I definitely,

290
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,520
um,
have difficulty with that.

291
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,780
You know,
there's a certain,

292
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,800
you know,
when you,

293
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
when you've created things that are so
iconic,

294
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,020
it becomes healing for people.
Nostalgia as healing,

295
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,010
you know,
to the fresh prince theme is healing to

296
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:13,970
hear that,
you know,

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,060
it just hearkens back to a time and a
feeling and an energy,

298
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:19,040
you know,
that is,

299
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,220
um,
a,

300
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,570
a beautiful way to help relieve,
uh,

301
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,180
some,
some little touch of suffering,

302
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,510
you know,
so when people see me or the fresh

303
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,320
prince and even during that time,
the movies that I made while I was

304
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:37,340
making the fresh prince.
So it was the fresh prince during the

305
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,660
winter and then the summers were bad
boys

306
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,173
pendants,

307
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,510
you know,
so it was like,

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,460
it really captured a time.
Um,

309
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:49,000
so it,
it,

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,890
it's,
it's very difficult.

311
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:55,891
I wouldn't have it any other way.
I love being able to make people smile

312
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,000
and sheer,
you know,

313
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,950
over that.
But I also am going to boldly go to new

314
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,080
creation.
Um,

315
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,320
you know,
even something,

316
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,770
something like the decision,
um,

317
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,560
you know,
I had the two screenplays in front of me

318
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,330
for the independent state two and for
suicide squad.

319
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:20,650
So I had to choose between the two of
those and even the choice of going to

320
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,010
suicide squad,
know nothing about the qualities of the

321
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:27,520
movies,
but the choice of trying to go forward

322
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,700
versus clinging and climbing backwards,
you know,

323
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:34,420
so I,
I do want to aggressively go forward and

324
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:37,790
do new things and create and hopefully,
uh,

325
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,350
be able to stumble upon a new hay day.
Amazing.

326
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,250
Now you have an incredible cast.
Oh God,

327
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,084
yes.
Yeah.

328
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,780
How does that happen to like how does so
many big stars this and then how does

329
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,520
that work between you?

330
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,491
You know,
it's the,

331
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:54,960
it's the,
the ideas,

332
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,310
the screenplay.
Allan Loeb,

333
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,920
the screenwriter,
he just wrote a brilliant screenplay.

334
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,950
Everyone related to the ideas of love,
time and death as a powerful tools to

335
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:11,841
try to put your life back on track.
So everyone related to the journey,

336
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,560
but it's,
I mean,

337
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,140
I mean look at that group,
that's like a,

338
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,970
it was like a superhero movie,
but did your,

339
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,490
did your father get to see any of it?
No.

340
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,530
He came to set a once but he didn't,
he didn't get to see the film.

341
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,360
And y'all are close that we were very
close.

342
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

343
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,580
My,
my father,

344
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,310
um,
I uh,

345
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,810
put my life together and I look at my
father and my mother and grandmother

346
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:41,811
were the most influential people in my,
my life and in my mind when I draw it,

347
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,540
always draw a triangle.
And My,

348
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,570
my father was the base.
Uh,

349
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,940
my mother was the left side and my,
my grandmother was the right side and I

350
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,950
always put discipline as the bottom.
My father hard work,

351
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,420
discipline.
Endurance was really the foundation of

352
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:03,600
creating my life.
And My mother was education and my

353
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,940
grandmother was loved.
So you know,

354
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,900
the combination of that discipline,
education and love was a,

355
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,140
I'm really grateful for you

356
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,940
sharing with us that part of you and
also the struggle with his death.

357
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,450
Because the other thing is that we live
in a time where people show these

358
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,610
curated sides of them because I think of
the same fair,

359
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,420
right?
You just want to be this piece and all

360
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:27,960
the rest of it.
Yeah.

361
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,030
It's a struggle,
but he wants to hear all of that.

362
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:31,590
You know,
it's facebook.

363
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,410
Come on,
let's have fun,

364
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,910
Dude.
It's a bummer.

365
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:39,870
Your Dad's gone.
No,

366
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,920
no,
no.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,433
Come on.

368
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,360
No,
no.

369
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,710
You know,
for me is laughing is the elixir and

370
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,670
that was another thing that my father
taught me.

371
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:02,090
He was,
he was joking all the way up to the end,

372
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:06,470
like laughing.
You have to be able to laugh at

373
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,650
everything.
And for me the beautiful part is that

374
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,770
that's my natural.
I'm a color on the spectrum.

375
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,290
I naturally go to comedy,
you know,

376
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,310
and when,
when,

377
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,460
when I'm looking at something,
I'm always trying to find why that's

378
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,890
funny and it's been really,
really helpful in,

379
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,950
in this experience and you know,
even just a this point in my life,

380
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,970
keep remember to laugh,
remember to laugh and,

381
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,760
and spend time with people that make you
laugh.

382
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,360
Like that is hugely important.
Laugh.

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,690
Connect.
Yes,

384
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,670
absolutely.
It was a good messages.

385
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,010
Yeah.
I love this,

386
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:46,600
this idea,
you know,

387
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,381
it's,
it's,

388
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:48,640
um,
you know,

389
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:52,150
a guy tried to put his,
put his life back together and he just

390
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,290
gets furious and rants and writes
letters to love,

391
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,250
time and depth.

392
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,980
And then love time and depth.
Respond,

393
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,150
you know,
so it's,

394
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,043
it's,
you know,

395
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,650
a really that beautiful Christmas flavor
was know,

396
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,850
just a little touch outside of reality,
you know,

397
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:14,851
so you get to,
you get to deal with real subjects and

398
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,340
real topics and real loss,
but because it touches just that New

399
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,320
York Christmas,
just a little bit outside of the,

400
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,230
you know,
how excruciating it would be if you

401
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,390
dealt with it,
you know,

402
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,260
straight,
hard rated our loss,

403
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,051
you know.
So I,

404
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:35,100
I just love going into that realm of,
uh,

405
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,550
of um,
uh,

406
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,980
the mystical to be able to take a good
look at,

407
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,820
at,
you know,

408
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:42,900
real human issues.

409
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,140
So you're talking about real.
I felt it was the most related.

410
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,410
You be really

411
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,780
like I felt there was no filter there
and I wondered for somebody who could

412
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,660
choose to do anything.
Was that something special that drove

413
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:59,494
you to this?

414
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,590
You know,
when I,

415
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,300
when I first read it,
you know,

416
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:03,500
when I,
when I first read it,

417
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,240
every once in a while you,
you know,

418
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:10,241
you read a screenplay and the,
the most important thing in a movie,

419
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,141
I guess the,
you know,

420
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:12,974
the,
the,

421
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,210
the two most important things that I
look for is one is the universally

422
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,640
relatable concept,
right?

423
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:23,120
So just at its core,
when you first say it,

424
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,330
when you say one line about it,
can you connect to people you know,

425
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,841
and what,
you know,

426
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,770
one of the,
one of the best ones I've ever had with

427
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,260
something with like I am legend,

428
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,120
the last man on earth.
Yeah.

429
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,860
Yeah.
Security

430
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,650
is actually right here,

431
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,680
you know,
but it's like when you,

432
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,480
when you just have that one thing,
you know,

433
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:50,420
and with this it was a,
it was a little bit heavier,

434
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,480
but it was a guy trying to put his life
back together after an extreme loss.

435
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,180
Right.
So people can relate to that.

436
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:01,580
That's a,
that's an extremely relatable idea.

437
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,620
And then I flipped to the last 10 pages
and the ending,

438
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,070
it's like,
you know,

439
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,580
this is a movie that has lots of twists
and turns,

440
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:14,960
but then even within the last 10 pages,
there's still another surprise when you

441
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:18,890
can send people out of the,
out of a movie theater with another

442
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,690
surprise.
You know,

443
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,170
and you know,
historically there's been times I've

444
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:28,100
sent people out of the movie theater and
the surprise in the last 10 minutes is

445
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:29,180
that the movie wasn't good,

446
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,710
right?
So you just want to avoid that surprise.

447
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,840
You want to avoid that one.

448
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,520
Uh,
you know,

449
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,790
but with this one is,
it has such an interesting turn in,

450
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,220
in the end of it.
And it was,

451
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:43,054
it was,
um,

452
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,340
you know,
one of the most fun screenplays I've

453
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:45,980
ever read.

454
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,990
Why are you doing movies at all?
Still?

455
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
Like,
you're rich.

456
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,190
You could,
as we say,

457
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,170
cock up your foot back,
cock up my foot and rock back,

458
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,210
getting you out of bed to still go and
do this thing.

459
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,230
Uh,
I,

460
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,840
um,
I enjoy

461
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,400
connecting with people and ideas.
And you know,

462
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,730
it,
it's,

463
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,460
I have a mission statement.
So every year,

464
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,640
for probably the past 10 years I've
worked out a mission statement for

465
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:24,140
myself and for the last few few years
the mission statement has stayed the

466
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,030
same and it,
you know,

467
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,120
it's been improved lives,
right?

468
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,490
So when,
when I go into something,

469
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:36,491
I'm looking for how the quality of this
piece could potentially improve lives,

470
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,820
but it's all along the way.
It's when you make the movie and how

471
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:43,400
you're interacting with people in the
process and you know,

472
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:44,091
at the,
the,

473
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:48,560
the concept of lives runs through the
center of everything I do.

474
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,160
And then I realized that the,
the,

475
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,670
the way to improve lives is to
continually improve yourself.

476
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,950
Right?
So with that,

477
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,600
every,
every morning when I,

478
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,820
when I get out of the bed,
you know,

479
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,060
I,
I haven't fixed everything in the world

480
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:05,270
yet.

481
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,440
So there's always something to do.
And in this film I read an interesting

482
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:12,340
quote for the,
uh,

483
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,380
sit hearth,
a Gotama,

484
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,620
the Buddha.
He said,

485
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,000
um,
that,

486
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,110
um,
good people have to get out of the bed

487
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,850
every day and try to empty the ocean
with a ladle.

488
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,360
Right?
And I thought that was a new,

489
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,240
that was profound.
And I paused for a second and I said,

490
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,220
all right,
what the hell is a ladle?

491
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,920
Right,
right.

492
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:37,690
So then,
you know,

493
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,860
I just,
I touched it on my ipad is later.

494
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,870
Oh,
it's like a big spoon,

495
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,580
spoon,
spoon,

496
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,590
a soup spoon.
And I was like,

497
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:49,550
why you assume smell.
So try to empty the ocean with a soup

498
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:50,690
spoon,
you know,

499
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,870
as the,
the mentality of how you,

500
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,510
you wake up everyday to try to do good
in the world.

501
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,301
So for me,
I'm,

502
00:24:57,301 --> 00:25:01,730
I'm a,
I'm really driven by continually trying

503
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,830
to,
um,

504
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,450
elevate my,
elevate my mind and elevate my spirit

505
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:13,451
and care for my body and to be able to
love as many people as effectively as,

506
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,290
as possible with this mystery of life
that I've been given.
