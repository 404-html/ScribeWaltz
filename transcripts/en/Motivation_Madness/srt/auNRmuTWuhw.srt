1
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,790
You know,
I never want to be that nine to five

2
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,550
person that just lives my entire life
working the nine to five and just be

3
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,790
happy with a modest lifestyle.
Um,

4
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,670
you know,
being secure.

5
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,350
A lot of people,
that's all they want and they just want

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,030
a secure lifestyle,
um,

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,800
you know,
own a house,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,880
you know,
and be able to retire and that makes him

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,501
happy,
you know?

10
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,350
And I just believe that we should always
be,

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,640
always be pushing,
you know,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,760
to achieve more.
It's become more,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,230
you know,
and sit at a job.

14
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,920
The same job for 30 years is not
something I would ever choose to do in

15
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,320
the society.
You know,

16
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:47,550
we,
we are tied to go to college and get a

17
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:48,990
job.
That's what we're taught.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,130
If you become a doctor or a lawyer,
you're successful,

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,250
you know,
but most of the time still have a boss,

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,120
so have someone you know Tony what to do
and you still have the schedule and you

21
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,500
have to stick to,
um,

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,080
you know,
so it's not much different than working

23
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:05,920
at Mcdonald's.
I mean,

24
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,650
it's just you're making more money,
but you're still on the same exact

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,600
situation.
And you know,

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,430
working at Mcdonald's is not sinking or
same scenario,

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,880
making more money,
you know,

28
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,020
to me,
you got to enjoy what you're doing and

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,020
you know,
to have the lifestyle freedom,

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,030
do what you want,
when you want the most incredible thing.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,230
People don't understand it.
You got to work hard at whatever you do,

32
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:28,240
whether you're working for someone else
or working for yourself.

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,700
And if you want to put that in,
you know you're going to end up being

34
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:33,010
successful.
You can't be satisfied.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,570
But that's what keeps us going.
You know,

36
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:37,390
when you become content,
then life's over.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,433
Okay?

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,010
I did.
The mentality is what's going to make

39
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,470
things happen.
You know,

40
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,100
was having that mentality of never give
up,

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,460
keep pushing forward and trying to
accomplish your goals and hopefully you

42
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:51,580
have more goals,
constantly trying to move on to bigger

43
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,710
and better things and trying to improve
ourselves in every area.

44
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,060
You really have to believe what you're
doing is working.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,480
And I was very important to believe you
have to believe to achieve.

46
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,280
If you're doing something,
you're not hundred percent confident

47
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,840
what you're doing,
you're going to fail.

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,610
You know,
someone who is doing something,

49
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,940
maybe not 100% correctly,
but they truly believe in their mind

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,240
that they're doing the best they could
possibly do and they believe what

51
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,040
they're doing is the best possible
scenario.

52
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,550
I think they're going to have a lot more
success than someone that is doing it in

53
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:22,580
100% right but aren't positive than what
they're doing.

54
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,500
You know,
the mind is the most powerful tool we

55
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:27,320
have and in order to be a winner you
have to lose.

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,570
You know,
that's,

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,810
that's,
that's how you learn.

58
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,620
You know,
one day I may is telling me,

59
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,850
you better get out there and start
busting your ass,

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,210
you know,
going forward and never stopped.

61
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,570
Don't miss a day.
You know,

62
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,610
one day miss is they can't get back.

63
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,510
Always.
Always look at the positive,

64
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,040
you know,
the glass is always half full.

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,610
Okay.

66
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,980
If you think positive and you look at
the positive,

67
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:49,460
you know,
you're,

68
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,510
you're only going to continue to get
better and it's being positive in every

69
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,610
area.
Is is the secret.

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,790
It's a secret to life.
If you're negative about anything,

71
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,850
you're going fail.
No matter what it is,

72
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,330
you're not happy,
you want to be better.

73
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,950
But that's one in every aspect.
Like you want to better yourself in

74
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:12,951
every way possible.
You know,

75
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,100
all work hand in hand.
A lot of people realize when you help

76
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,400
somebody else you're helping yourself
and it feels good,

77
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,661
you know?
And it just,

78
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,990
what comes around goes around.
The most important thing is light in

79
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,780
life to not give a shit what other
people think.

80
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:30,980
You know?
That's the most important thing.

81
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,360
And to have that kind of an attitude and
mentality is rare.

82
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,780
You know,
people are always concerned about what

83
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:41,690
other people think,
no matter who they are.

84
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,980
It really doesn't matter what other
people think,

85
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,670
you know?
It really doesn't matter if you can have

86
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:50,180
that kind of mentality is so much
further in life.

87
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,850
People don't like to think they like to
ask.

88
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,830
No,
they don't like to think and they don't

89
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:59,000
have enough confidence in their
decisions that they make on their own.

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,480
When they get advice from someone else,
that gives them more confidence to

91
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:06,960
believe that that's going to work.
We should always be trying,

92
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,510
you know,
to be better at every aspect in life.

93
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,920
I mean,
you know,

94
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,230
are you a good husband?
Are you a good wife?

95
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,120
Are you a good son?
You know,

96
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,390
are you a good,
you know,

97
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,990
you know,
whatever it could be.

98
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,910
You know,
there's a million things in life that we

99
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,050
are,
we,

100
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,740
I think we should constantly be trying
to be better in every area.

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,430
I kind of liked to just,
you know,

102
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:32,940
relax,
you know,

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,230
enjoy life and that's kind of what I do.
Um,

104
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,400
and being able to,
to not stress and do what I want to do

105
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,440
when I want to do it is just a great
feeling.
