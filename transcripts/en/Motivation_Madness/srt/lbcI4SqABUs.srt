1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,370
Cause if you're going to blame people
for all the Shit you've been her blaming

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,800
them for all the good too.
If you're going to give them credit for

3
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,320
everything that's fucked up,
even credit for everything,

4
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:20,321
that's great
because life is not so simple at black

5
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,420
and white.
My mother beat the shit out of me.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,870
She loved me.
She was freaked out.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,820
I was going to leave.
I was a source of everything.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,670
I blamed her for all the beauty in my
life.

9
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,100
I blame her,
but I have one have in my life because I

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,220
cherished my wife cause I know what the
opposite is.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,270
I blame her for the capacity to feel and
care.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,780
I blame with my insatiable hunger to end
suffering for any of you,

13
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,900
but I can't
because I suffered a ton.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,410
If you'd been the mother I had wanted,
I would not be the man I'm proud to be.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,580
If we can realize that life is always
happening for us,

16
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:01,581
not to us.
Game over all the pain and suffering

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,510
disappeared.
You know any success program that I've

18
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:08,390
ever had the good fortune to go through,
whether it be a good book,

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,580
a good set of tapes,
a good seminar.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,180
Almost every single one talks about the
power of goal setting.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,150
Why?
Because it's a fundamental key to all

22
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,910
lifelong success plans you could
possibly imagine.

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,640
The challenge of course is we hear it so
often,

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,800
we tend to take it just a little bit for
granted,

25
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:25,730
don't we?
I mean,

26
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,650
you get yourself in a point where you've
heard it so often.

27
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:30,440
You're going,
please don't talk about goal setting and

28
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,820
I know all about it.
Yes,

29
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,250
I should make sure my goals are stated
in the positive.

30
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,780
Yes,
I should write them down.

31
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,820
You know I didn't know all that stuff.
Come on,

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,880
but you know what?
You gotta be careful not to get caught

33
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,160
in that trap called the law of
familiarity.

34
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,430
You know where he gets so used to it,
you begin to take it just a little bit

35
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,790
for granted because fundamentals have to
be practiced daily.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,610
Hey,
think about the greatest coaches that

37
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:56,180
you can think of and sports history,
names that come up for me or it names

38
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:58,910
like Vince Lombardi for example,
or John Wooden.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,100
What were they known most for teaching
fundamentals to people that were already

40
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,930
the best at what they do?
I mean,

41
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,240
think about it.
John Wooden would take a basketball

42
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,490
player.
A kid was the best in the world at what

43
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,830
he does virtually,
at least for his age group,

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,140
and he can make a shot from virtually
anywhere and you go,

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,930
that's really cute kid.
Get over here and I want you to shoot

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,810
400 free throws and gets this.
I can do that.

47
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:21,201
He said,
yeah,

48
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:24,830
well let's see you do it or come up here
and I want to see you shoot 500 bank

49
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,630
shots from five feet.

50
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,280
While I can do that again would say,
it goes,

51
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,570
yeah,
I know you can do it and you're going to

52
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:33,860
do it every day this many times so that
you do it and the key clutch moments.

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,800
You've got to practice fundamentals
every day.

54
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,130
He went 11 consecutive national
championships.

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,180
Unlike any team in history,
that's the power of fundamentals.

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,570
So anytime I do a workshop,
anytime I try and do tapes,

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,470
usually I put a goal setting workshop in
there and some of them have some

58
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,330
similarities.
If you've done one with me before,

59
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,990
he has a chance to do it again and do it
even more effectively.

60
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,700
And variably when I hear people say
something like,

61
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,000
well,
teach me something new.

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,650
I know they aren't into mastery because
repetition again is the mother of skill.

63
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,000
You've heard me say that over and over
again.

64
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,010
It's because if you want to master
anything,

65
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,740
you've got to do it over and over and
over again.

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,320
And every time I do a goal setting
workshop myself,

67
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,130
I obviously make new distinctions.
I set up some new goals they change.

68
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,200
So don't take it for granted and say,
well,

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,490
these two tapes are on goals and they're
short and they're simple and I can do

70
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,870
that some other time.
I already know my goals.

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,740
Don't get caught in that hook.
The bottom line is do the exercises.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,870
If you're setting goals brand new and
fresh,

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,510
and for most people they don't have a
clearly defined set of goals.

74
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,950
Anyway.
Again,

75
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,230
you know,
I'm now taking taekwondo and I had the

76
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,920
good fortunate of training with the
grand master of taekwondo and the United

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
States.
His name is grandmaster June Reed,

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,710
and the interesting thing about jewelry
as a master,

79
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:50,410
as he taught me something,
you taught me to go from the frame of

80
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,290
mastering simple things over and over
again,

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
everything he teaches to become a black
belt breaks,

82
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,410
Bam has seven simple moves.
Isn't that interesting?

83
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,770
Now what's interesting is he says that
most people never make it to black belt

84
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,540
because they kept coming in and say,
show me something new.

85
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,320
He said,
none of them.

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,800
You have to master the fundamentals,
and if you do those and you do them over

87
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,050
and over again,
you'll be a black belt easily and

88
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,780
consistently.
So don't get caught in those traps.

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Breakthrough the bonds of your past and
look at

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,730
world and a whole new way where you
understand fundamentals must be

91
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,650
practiced daily and you'll do whatever
it takes.

92
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:27,060
You're not bored by fundamentals.
You get excited about doing the daily

93
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,930
things that create the ongoing level of
happiness and joy you want for a

94
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,400
lifetime.
Now,

95
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,770
let's take a quick look.
What is the power of goals?

96
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:37,830
Why do we talk about him so much?
Why do we want need to use them?

97
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:41,070
Why are they important?
Answer with goals.

98
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:45,210
We create the future and advance.
We create our destiny.

99
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,250
We shape our lives.
Hey,

100
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,900
we all have goals,
whether we know it or not.

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,220
The problem is some people have really
lousy goals and whatever your goals are,

102
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:56,520
they're affecting you.
Maybe your goals are to get through this

103
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,140
day.
Maybe the goal is or how to pay the

104
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,770
lousy bills.
The problem with goals like Vat is they

105
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,950
don't exactly inspire you and get you to
jump out of bed early in the morning

106
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,840
saying,
I can't wait to go out today and pay my

107
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,674
lousy bills.

108
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,220
Rarely does that really create emotion
and drive inside of you.

109
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,530
Goals can create the power to make us
grow and expand and develop our success,

110
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,220
but we've got to have something out
there that's compelling enough to draws

111
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,610
forth,
done properly and specifically they

112
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,180
transform our lives.
One of my best and favorite examples is

113
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,270
a study that was done in 1953 at Yale
University.

114
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,760
What they did,
there was an intensive study where they

115
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:37,160
interviewed the graduating class just
before they left school and they asked

116
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,750
them a whole series of questions.
But the one that was most interesting

117
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:43,170
for me was they asked him,
how many of you have a clear,

118
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,950
specific set of goals with a written
plan for their achievement?

119
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,600
Well,
interestingly enough,

120
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,650
as you might guess,
less than 3% how to set of written goals

121
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,740
with the plan.
20 years later in 1973 they

122
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
went back and interviewed the surviving
class members of the class of 53 and

123
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,080
they interviewed these people to find
out what were their lives like.

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Well,
the interesting thing was the 3% that

125
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,880
had written goals that specifically at a
plan for their attainment appeared to be

126
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,860
happier,
more well adjusted,

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,530
more excited about their life as a
whole,

128
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,450
but see,
those things are subjective.

129
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,600
The one thing that's very measurable is
this.

130
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
The group of people who had written
goals were worth more in financial terms

131
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,000
than the entire other 97% that didn't
have goals combined.

132
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,300
Think about that.
That's the power of goal setting.

133
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,260
I can tell you in my own life,
it has transformed me that you can know

134
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,870
all the techniques of how to condition
yourself to succeed,

135
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,370
but if you don't know why you're doing
it,

136
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,620
if you don't know what it is you're
moving towards,

137
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,260
then it's rare that you're going to get
the most out of yourself.

138
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,200
Years ago,
I had the unique good fortune.

139
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,070
As I began to study some of these
technologies for optimum performance,

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,270
I was invited to go to Russia and I
spent over there approximately two

141
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,890
weeks.
During that time,

142
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,980
I got a chance to explore many aspects
of Russia.

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,890
We've got to go to the universities that
got to chance to meet with some of the

144
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,760
people who were involved in optimum
performance technologies and in the

145
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:17,150
process of doing that,
I found myself on one stretch where I

146
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:21,320
was on the Trans Siberian railway.
Where's going literally from Moscow all

147
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,980
the way to Siberia and then back to
Leningrad again.

148
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,820
We're talking about

149
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,870
about a large stretch of land and a lot
of time to just think.

150
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,580
During that time I was just starting to
develop some my personal power.

151
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,010
I really hadn't created my life the way
I wanted it,

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,890
but I felt like there was some
possibilities out there for me.

153
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,950
I was still living in my 400 square foot
bachelor apartment.

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,760
I was still overweight.
I was still in a position where I really

155
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,340
didn't have my life where I wanted it in
terms of my relationships.

156
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,760
But on that trip for two and a half
days,

157
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,440
all I did was set goals and then for
another two or three days,

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,320
all I did was design plans and how it's
going to achieve them.

159
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,280
And I set goals that were well beyond my
present ability or skill.

160
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,690
I had no idea how I was going to make
them happen and that's important.

161
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,670
But I operated from a principle that's
talked about and every religion known to

162
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:14,740
man.
So regardless of what you believe

163
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:19,300
religiously or spiritually,
it's a common law and that is the power

164
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:24,301
of absolute total belief and faith.
I operated from the frame that if I

165
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,760
could get inspired enough,
if I found a goal that it was exciting

166
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,830
enough for me,
I would figure out how to make it

167
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,630
happen.
Even though right now it might seem

168
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:34,900
impossible.
I would pull it off and I laid out goals

169
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:38,050
for my life in virtually every area,
personally,

170
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,790
emotionally,
socially,

171
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,350
spiritually,
physically,

172
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,950
financially,
and I chunk down what do I want my life

173
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,700
ultimately and what do I want right now
and a lot of areas.

174
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:49,241
I thought,
well,

175
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,580
I can make it happen.
I figured I can get control of my

176
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,580
emotions and so I set goals about how I
want it to be,

177
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,240
how I wanted to communicate,
how much joy I wanted to have,

178
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,760
how much passion,
how I would live every single day,

179
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,820
the kind of person I wanted to be as a
human being.

180
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,840
I described my relationships.
I described the woman of my dreams in

181
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:10,380
detail.
I took six pages to describe exactly the

182
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,700
kind of person,
mentally,

183
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,540
emotionally,
socially,

184
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,890
and spiritually I want in my life and
physically describe her in detail in

185
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,080
addition to describing how I wanted my
kids to be.

186
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,910
I described everything.
Now he might say,

187
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,451
well,
Gosh,

188
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,500
you know,
you're really creating a lot of

189
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,740
limitations.
I set goals and I look at them and then

190
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,510
I review them and see if they still make
sense to me,

191
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,960
but I did it in detail.
I also did it in the area of finances

192
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,310
and I said some pretty absurd goals.
I decided I want to make a quarter of $1

193
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,250
million a year in personal income.
At the time I was making less than

194
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:41,250
$3,000 a month.
3000 was a good month.

195
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,010
Guess what happened?
I came back.

196
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,270
I laid out this plan.

197
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,060
In fact,
I did the plan on the back of a map,

198
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,110
but I bought them Russia have it to this
day where I broke down the whole thing.

199
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:56,220
I show it oftentimes to people in my
seminars so they get an idea where I was

200
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,640
and what I actually created.
Just by designing the roadmaps necessary

201
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,440
for success.
I came back and began to implement it.

202
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,050
A lot of my plans,
I have to tell you,

203
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:08,250
it did not work out,
but I achieved over 80% of my goals and

204
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,920
less than 12 months.
I mean massive change.

205
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,410
I went well beyond anything I dreamed
of.

206
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,080
I changed myself physically.
I lost all the weight.

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,590
I changed myself emotionally and develop
the confidence that was necessary.

208
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,890
I changed myself and my relationships
massively.

209
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,600
I attracted the,
one of my dreams,

210
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm married,
or about a year after that I had decided

211
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,350
I wanted to have four kids.

212
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,420
I got three instantly.
What a deal.

213
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,350
I was on a roll.
I took myself from totally broke

214
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:39,180
financially to over a million dollar net
worth and lasts than 12 months.

215
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,260
You're talking about massive change.
My life changed in every level.

216
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,360
I mean,
I can tell you how much my confidence

217
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,021
changed,
but you know,

218
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:46,531
you might go,
oh,

219
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:49,050
big deal.
But it did my level of confidence,

220
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:52,260
my level of faith,
my ability to create rapport changed

221
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,640
radically.
I mean,

222
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,570
and I also said finger goals besides my
personal development goals because I'd

223
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,000
felt confident that I could probably
accomplish some of the development

224
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,760
within myself,
but I felt like I can control that.

225
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,990
I can't control the outside world or my
economics or the ability to get things.

226
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,340
That was my hang up at the time.
I set goals for things like I was going

227
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:11,940
to have a limousine,
a stretch limousine.

228
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,810
I mean,
how absurd.

229
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,260
I had a car that was breaking down
continuously at a stretch limousine

230
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,670
within six months.
I mean,

231
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:21,210
I'm talking about massive,
massive change.

232
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,610
Let me,
you can't imagine the kind of miracles

233
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:26,040
that happen.
I know this sounds fluffy and bizarre,

234
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,160
but it really works.
I remember when first time I went to

235
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:31,080
Fiji,
and this is my favorite place in the

236
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,070
world,
I thought,

237
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,180
you know,
I've been everywhere.

238
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,130
I've been to meet most of the major
countries in the world.

239
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,490
This is the most beautiful,
amazing land I've ever been to.

240
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,800
You know,
I got to own a piece of property.

241
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm this specific island,
you know,

242
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,370
I never would have thought in a million
years.

243
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,410
The two years later after setting that
goal,

244
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,970
I don't an island,
you know,

245
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:51,150
aren't that owned the resort namaly and
it's one of the top three resorts in

246
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:51,790
Fiji now.

247
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,900
I go there four times a year with 20 of
my best friends and we all have a blast

248
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,560
and we set our goals there.
We,

249
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,770
we look at our lives and balance it and
have fun.

250
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,860
I mean it's amazing,
but there's just,

251
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,180
if you were to try to tell me that two
years earlier,

252
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,190
I would have said,
you are absolutely insane.

253
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,840
You're nuts.
There's just no way.

254
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,291
I mean,
you know,

255
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,140
get real and I'm here to tell you don't
get real,

256
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,570
get intelligent because what's real to
you today is based on your past,

257
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,080
based on your past experiences.
And if you limit your future based on

258
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:23,170
your passion are going to go anywhere.
You got to get the goals that are big

259
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,410
enough to drive you to excite you.
So don't stop and go,

260
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,060
how do I do it?
That's not the first step.

261
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,860
The first step is get it down.

262
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,840
And if you do that,
you can create your island,

263
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,000
your paradise,
whether that be something emotional

264
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,920
inside of you.
You want to create like a character

265
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,950
change or,
or a behavior or habit or whether that's

266
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,770
a business you want to start or whether
that's some kind of money you want to

267
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,630
earn or something you want to do for
your children.

268
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,010
And I'm telling you it can happen.
The magic that you've heard about and

269
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:52,450
dreamed about is real and it starts with
a simplistic process of taking these

270
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:56,680
generalized impulses of desire and
starting to define them with more

271
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:00,250
precision.
This is the power of goal setting and we

272
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:04,180
don't understand totally how it works.
There's something beyond just what we

273
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,440
understand.
If we're writing something down,

274
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:09,370
something happens.
You become a creator when you write down

275
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,970
goals and you get clear as to absolutely
while you make them happen.

276
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,950
And by the way,
that's the key that we're going to touch

277
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:17,770
on here in detail.
We've got to make sure that you not only

278
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:22,000
set goals,
but you get absolutely clear why you

279
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,000
want them,
because there's a fundamental key to

280
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,100
goal setting that changed my life and
that is,

281
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:32,101
this purpose is stronger than outcome.
What do I mean?

282
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,320
Well,
I think that the purpose of goals is not

283
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:38,500
so you get things the purpose of any
goal,

284
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:42,160
the real reason to set goals is what
they will make of you as a person.

285
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,740
Hey,
look at the end of your life,

286
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,030
all the things that you accumulate are
not going to make you happy at the end

287
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,100
of your life.
All you're going to have is who you

288
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:54,280
become as a person,
the moment you've created in your life

289
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:57,130
that you'll never forget.
So some people in life,

290
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,860
they go out and set goals and they do it
blindly.

291
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,340
They say,
these are all things that I want to have

292
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,290
in my life and I focus,
let's say on things.

293
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,970
And there's nothing wrong with focusing
on things.

294
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,530
I want you to have as many things as you
want.

295
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,130
That's part of life too.
That's part of the manifestation process

296
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,430
of creating results.
But if all you do is focus on getting

297
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,220
things,
it may cost you some people in their

298
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,280
desire to get things,
have given up their own integrity of who

299
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,710
they want to be,
of what they want to create in their

300
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:22,090
life.
And you gotta be careful of that.

301
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,350
You got to make sure when you set a
goal,

302
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,230
you know why you're doing it.
Hey,

303
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,250
you might work real hard,
for example,

304
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,750
to do something.
I a thing oriented,

305
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,400
let's say you want to make $1 million
but see $1 million only motivates you so

306
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,520
much.
Becoming the kind of person who is able

307
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,660
to manifest total abundance financially
and physically for themselves and the

308
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,820
people around them.
That's rather exciting.

309
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,840
Having the freedom that you think the
money we'll give you or having the

310
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:51,080
ability to give or having the ability to
do things that you think that money will

311
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,370
give you are having more time.

312
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,200
That will motivate you a lot more than
just the money.

313
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,950
Does that make sense?
The problem was setting goals is one.

314
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,010
Most people take them for granted,
they don't do it seriously and they

315
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,460
don't do it consistently.
They do it once a year and I do it at

316
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,770
New Year's.
They were run under the New Year

317
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,180
Syndrome.
They set a goal and they don't even look

318
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,770
at it until a year later and they go,
whoops,

319
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:12,320
I kinda screwed up.
And they set a new one so they have no

320
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,030
power.
Secondly,

321
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,390
they don't realize the power of goals.
They take it lightly,

322
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,171
you know,
they go,

323
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:18,891
well,
you know?

324
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,030
Yeah,
I got these goals,

325
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,330
but they don't make sure that they get
it inside their head where it's

326
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,780
absolutely real for them.
They don't realize that when they set a

327
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,970
goal,
they're now creating something in life.

328
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,640
And finally,
the biggest challenge I think,

329
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:35,330
is that these people don't know why
they're going for their goals.

330
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,610
So the object,
the goal itself,

331
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,070
and again,
through the asset for a while.

332
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:39,904
And yeah,

333
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,060
again,
why is different for everyone?

334
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:47,740
But you got to find out the reasons I
believe this reasons come first,

335
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,610
answers come second.
If you get a big enough reasons to do

336
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:55,030
something to accomplish something,
you can figure out how to do it.

337
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,250
But if all you do is set up a goal and
say,

338
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:58,540
oh Gosh,
how am I going to about it?

339
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,630
You're not going to be inspired enough.
It's not going to be compelling enough

340
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,910
for you to really create longterm
results.

341
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,040
Every great success I know has figured
out the why behind their goals and

342
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,490
that's their power.
So in our process on the next tape

343
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:13,271
tomorrow,
what we do,

344
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,780
the goal setting workshop itself,
we're going to spend a good deal of time

345
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:21,100
focusing on why do we want these goals
after we've identified them.

346
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,830
And secondly,
how are we going to go about making it

347
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:24,160
happen?

348
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,740
But that's secondly,
we're going to start from the frame that

349
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,990
we can achieve anything.
As soon as we think of it.

350
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,450
Somebody wants pointed out to me a long
time ago,

351
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:36,451
that desire in its Latin form means of
the father desire or thought.

352
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,610
That's interesting.
In other words,

353
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,780
anything that I desire,
that thought process has been given to

354
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:48,730
me and with the ability to have a goal,
I believe instantly comes the ability to

355
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,520
achieve it.
That ability is built within us or we

356
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,350
wouldn't have the desire in the first
place.

357
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,210
So come from that place and watch what
you can do to create a new reality of

358
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:00,880
success in your life.
Now I've got a question for you.

359
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,060
Do you know why goals really work?
Well?

360
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,220
There are lots of theories,
but I'll tell you what a few of mine

361
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:07,330
are.
Number one,

362
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,620
I believe that thoughts are things that
whatever we focus on consistently,

363
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,150
we experience in our life.

364
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,670
You and I know that's true from what
we've talked about earlier in this tape

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,550
that if I pay attention to one area of
my life and I focused on it,

366
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,650
that's what's going to be real for me.
That's what I'm going to feel.

367
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,530
I also believe that whatever we focus on
consistently,

368
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:26,320
that our thoughts are things that as you
think so you create,

369
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,990
so your manifest,
so part of goal setting is just by

370
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,590
having that focus and again having a
consistent focus.

371
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,860
You can't just set goals one time and
they never look at them again and really

372
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:37,600
expect longterm results.
Although,

373
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,340
hey,
that's better than not having any target

374
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,320
at all.
At least your subconscious mind knows a

375
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:45,010
general direction to move in,
but the power is doing it consistently

376
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:48,280
reviewing them,
but point number one is I really believe

377
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,340
that if you focus something,
you'll experience it.

378
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,380
Secondly,
when you set a goal,

379
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:56,940
there's an interesting dynamic that
happens and that is when you set a goal,

380
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,410
basically you're acknowledging to both
your conscious and subconscious minds

381
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,090
that where you are right now is not
where you want to be,

382
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,560
which is you begin to notice the
distinctions between where you want to

383
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,740
be and where you are and as you feel
that distinction,

384
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,100
your brain becomes dissatisfied and part
of what motivates human action is a

385
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,820
sense of dissatisfaction.
I mean,

386
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,380
hey,
when you're totally comfortable and

387
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,060
relaxed,
feeling pleasure,

388
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,630
you're not super motivated and do
whatever it takes to make things happen.

389
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,630
Generally as a generalization.
However,

390
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,690
when we get dissatisfied,
that's what we got some real power back.

391
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,080
I tell most people in life,
one of the biggest traps that most

392
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,010
people fall into is called success.
For a lot of people,

393
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:43,530
success is a trap because what happens
is when they get successful,

394
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:46,080
oftentimes they tend to party.

395
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,500
When they fail,
they tend to ponder and our that

396
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,150
pondering.
Sometimes they make some new

397
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:54,690
distinctions.
Dissatisfaction is a power that you want

398
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,840
to take advantage of,
not something for you to try and hide

399
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:01,950
yourself out from there is real power
and find some things you want to move

400
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,030
away from.
Because look,

401
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,470
pressure is what creates human behavior,
pressure intention,

402
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:10,500
our primary drivers of our actions.
I mean,

403
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,540
think about it,
I never ridiculously simple level.

404
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,960
What makes you want to eat?
Is it not a certain level of pressure or

405
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:19,560
tension?
What does it makes you want to eliminate

406
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,180
during the day?
Pressure or tension you're buying.

407
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:24,390
It makes you want to get up and take
that action.

408
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,390
What makes you want to make love and be
with somebody?

409
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,120
There's a certain amount of pressure
that creates that feeling.

410
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,370
Learning to manage pressure and tension
in your life is probably one of the

411
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:39,210
basic fundamental lessons we all must
master if we really want to have a

412
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,390
balanced life where we really feel happy
and successful,

413
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,190
but learning use pressure and goal
setting is absolutely critical with

414
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:49,110
literally no pressure to go for it.

415
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,550
We have no motivation and so a certain
amount of pressure is generated.

416
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,900
When you clearly define what it is you
want and you see that you aren't there,

417
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,390
it creates a gestalt where your brain
says,

418
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,201
Hey,
I want that.

419
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,380
I'm not satisfied where I am,
and you begin to have that derive.

420
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,020
Don't hide out from it.
Welcome it.

421
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,670
Look at it every single day.
Pressure isn't necessarily negative.

422
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,440
It can be very positive.
Again,

423
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,300
if you look at it as a tool for
influencing yourself to take consistent

424
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,180
action towards your success,
you all know the metaphor,

425
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,860
don't you?
I mean pressures,

426
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,530
how diamonds are created,
they're just rocks a gun under intense

427
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:29,910
pressure and now the turned into a gym.
You need to use that same metaphor for

428
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:32,700
yourself and use goals as a way of
pressuring yourself cause see,

429
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,710
I know a lot of people,
when I think about goal setting,

430
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,510
I said,
well,

431
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,110
you know,
I don't want to like commit to somebody

432
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,690
else about this thing because then I'll
feel all this pressure.

433
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,780
That's great.
That is fabulous.

434
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,150
That means you're not going to back out.
I mean,

435
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:46,620
Hey,
when I decided a year ago,

436
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,090
I was going to work out every single day
I was going to exercise.

437
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,690
I realize the best way to make sure I
kept that commitment was number one,

438
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:55,050
understand why I was doing it,
not just salmon,

439
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,610
exercise to exercise.
And I realized in order to accomplish

440
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,530
the level of goals that I have in my
life,

441
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,010
I need an abundance of physical energy
vibrancy,

442
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,340
so I have something to communicate with
so I have something that can drive me

443
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,740
without that.
I've ended up running out of emotional

444
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,950
gas while I'm continually driving up
this mountain called success.

445
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,310
So I didn't want to float down running
out of fuel and I decided I'm going to

446
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:18,340
keep that up every day.
And being physically violent requires a

447
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,570
certain level of exercise.

448
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,530
So I understood why and I linked it to
having better relationships.

449
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,930
I linked it to having more energy for my
kids.

450
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,320
I linked it to how it feel emotionally.
I linked it to my level of physical

451
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,870
vibrancy.
I linked it to my business success.

452
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:33,790
I linked it to my ability to contribute
to others,

453
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,070
but we had a lot of motivation going on
there.

454
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,780
But in addition,
what I also did is I use pressure and I

455
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:42,940
went around and on several of my
programs,

456
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,350
specifically on one I do for business
people especially called the power to

457
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,200
influence one for salespeople.
I'm not burger.

458
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,920
I made it really clear that the only way
to succeed was demand more from yourself

459
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:58,480
and other people would expect and that I
had decided and what absolutely exercise

460
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,420
every day of this year.
I might reevaluate in the future,

461
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,960
but I'd do it this year and I've kept it
and I'm telling it to you do so I have

462
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,010
to commit even more.

463
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,200
I don't have a way to turn back.
Do you follow me?

464
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,460
Use pressure to your advantage.
Use committing to certain people,

465
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,800
to your advantage.
People that will not let you off the

466
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,440
hook.
That's part of the why sometimes you

467
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,660
don't feel like doing anymore and the
only why is hey,

468
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,400
because I don't want to not keep my
word.

469
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,190
That's okay.
Whatever it takes to get you to follow

470
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:28,180
through and create results.
So this tape today is designed for

471
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,181
primarily only one purpose and that is
to get you clear on the power of goal

472
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:36,430
setting,
what it can do to change you and the

473
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:41,020
critical element to success and goals.
And that is creating a strong enough why

474
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,980
and enough pressure to follow through.
One of the ways we can create a strong

475
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:45,910
enough why,
by the way,

476
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,980
is not just to write down the positive
wise.

477
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,090
In other words,
Gosh,

478
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:52,270
I want this goal because it'll give me
this and this in my life or I'll be able

479
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,180
to contribute this and that.
But in addition,

480
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,090
I've learned to create some of the quote
unquote negative wise,

481
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,830
something I would never would have done
years ago.

482
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:00,341
I'd say,
God,

483
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:04,090
that's been a negative person.
But what I mean specifically is when I

484
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,900
set goals now I not only write down why
I'm absolutely committed to making that

485
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:12,901
goal a reality,
but I also now write down why am I going

486
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:16,240
to get this and I do it from the frame
of if I don't achieve this,

487
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,710
what would it cost me?
And I get a list of whys of prices I'd

488
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,920
have to pay not to have the goal.
Cause see what we want to do to get

489
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:28,000
ourselves to succeed is link pleasure to
getting the goal and pain to not getting

490
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:28,780
the goal.

491
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,040
That way our brain will be driven to use
all of our resources to make it happen.

492
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,490
Does that make sense to you?
So I know for some of you it may sound

493
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,800
negative to say,
well what would it cost me if it didn't

494
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,540
happen?
But I think if you understand how the

495
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,360
human brain works,
we want to use the carrot and the stick.

496
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,730
Hey we're in charge,
we do this with anything with ourselves

497
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,130
and if we don't like her goals we can
change them at any time.

498
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,110
Part of the power of goal setting is
flexibility,

499
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,020
not just getting stuck.
Cause a years ago you set a goal

500
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:56,780
reevaluating and saying,
based on where I am and now my wife,

501
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,570
is that still the right goal for me?
Is that the right direction?

502
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,900
I encourage people to set goals no less
than twice a year.

503
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,490
And I have them review their goals in
detail at least once a month and review

504
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,230
their top goals daily.

505
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,670
It is that kind of consistent review
that'll keep you on track and produce

506
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:18,590
those results that you're committed to.
So right now the purpose again today is

507
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,930
to get you clear and how to unleash this
power.

508
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,870
And part of that power is the power of
why.

509
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,380
Why do you want things on the positive
and the power of being dissatisfied?

510
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,960
So here's your exercise for today and
then tomorrow we're going to actually

511
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,850
unleash you into a goal setting
workshop.

512
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,920
And you might want to review and listen
to the tape again.

513
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,200
So you're inspired when you go to do
that exercise.

514
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:42,170
Because I want you to really come to
life and know you're about to create

515
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,840
real results.
When you start that workshop today,

516
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:47,090
they'll pull out your success journal.
And here's your assignment.

517
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,440
What I'd like you to do is I want you to
write down two things.

518
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,530
Number one,
what are some of the areas of your life

519
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,410
you are dissatisfied with?
Now,

520
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,840
I don't want you to feel bad negative
about it,

521
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,620
but just be honest with yourself.
What are some of the areas of your life

522
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,270
that are not enough?
It's not good enough.

523
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,680
It's not well,
you deserve it to be,

524
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,270
if not where you're committed to having
a b.

525
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,700
Take a look at yourself physically,
emotionally,

526
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,440
spiritually,
intellectually,

527
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,480
financially,
and your relationships.

528
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,970
So the question I want you to ask
yourself is,

529
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,850
what's not good in my life?
What am I not satisfied with?

530
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,400
And get inspired as you write it down
because whatever you write down,

531
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,160
you're going to be able to change.
And that's number one.

532
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:28,460
And make a good list of things you're
dissatisfied with that will create some

533
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,190
pressure inside of you to create some
powerful new goals.

534
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,150
And number two,
write down what kind of beliefs,

535
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:37,810
what I have to have.
What are a couple of additional beliefs

536
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:41,990
since we've talked about that earlier,
what are two or three other beliefs that

537
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:45,380
I would probably need to have in order
to really set goals and achieve them?

538
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,040
What are two or three new beliefs I'd
need the live by in order to really

539
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,520
start achieving my goals?
That's your simple assignment for today.

540
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,300
Just leave today with a focus on getting
big enough wise.

541
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,080
The power of why is the power to achieve
your dreams.

542
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,890
I'll see you tomorrow.
Remember live with passion

543
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,330
I did and what absolutely exercise every
day of this year.

544
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,380
I might reevaluate in the future but I'd
do it this year and I've kept it and I'm

545
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,600
telling it to you do so I have to commit
even more.

546
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,790
I don't have a way to turn back.
Do you follow me?

547
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,050
Use pressure to your advantage.
Use committing to certain people,

548
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:43,410
to your advantage.
People that will not let you off the

549
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,190
hook.
That's

550
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,730
part of the why.
Sometimes you don't feel like doing it

551
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,980
anymore and the only why his hey cause I
don't want to not keep my word.

552
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,770
That's okay.
Whatever it takes to get you to follow

553
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,790
through and create results.
So this tape today is designed for

554
00:26:56,791 --> 00:27:01,791
primarily only one purpose and that is
to get you clear on the power of goal

555
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:05,010
setting,
what it can do to change you and the

556
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:09,600
critical element to success and goals.
And that is creating a strong enough why

557
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,560
and enough pressure to follow through.
One of the ways we can create a strong

558
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,490
enough why,
by the way,

559
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,590
is not just to write down the positive
wise.

560
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,670
In other words,
Gosh,

561
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,850
I want this goal because it'll give me
this and this in my life or I'll be able

562
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,730
to contribute this and that.
But in addition,

563
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,670
I've learned to create some of the quote
unquote negative wise,

564
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,410
something I would never would have done
years ago.

565
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:28,921
I'd say,
God,

566
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,670
that's been a negative person.
But when I mean specifically is when I

567
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:36,480
set goals now and only write down why
I'm absolutely committed to making that

568
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:41,481
goal a reality.
But I also now write down why am I going

569
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:44,310
to get this?
And I do it from the frame of if I don't

570
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:45,900
achieve this,
what would it cost me?

571
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,610
And I get a list of whys of prices I'd
have to pay not to have the goal.

572
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,210
Cause see what we want to do to get
ourselves to succeed is link pleasure to

573
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,910
getting the goal and pain to not getting
the goal.

574
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,620
That way our brain will be driven to use
all of our resources to make it happen.

575
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,070
Does that make sense to you?
So I know for some of you it may sound

576
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:07,380
negative to say,
well what would it cost me if it didn't

577
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:07,740
happen?

578
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,110
But I think if you understand how the
human brain works,

579
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,990
we want to use the carrot and the stick.
Hey we're in charge,

580
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,440
we can do this with anything with
ourselves and we don't like her goals.

581
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:18,990
We can change them at anytime.
And part of the power of goal setting is

582
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,090
flexibility,
not just getting stuck.

583
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:24,450
Cause a years ago you set a goal where
you evaluating the same based on where I

584
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,760
am and now my wife,
is that still the right goal for me?

585
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,570
Is that the right direction?
I encourage people to set goals no less

586
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,450
than twice a year.
And I have them review their goals in

587
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,830
detail at least once a month and review
their top goals daily.

588
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,240
It is that kind of consistent review
that'll keep you on track and produce

589
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:45,270
those results that you're committed to.
So right now,

590
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,440
the purpose again today is to get you
clear and how to unleash this power.

591
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,560
And part of that power is the power of
why.

592
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Why do you want things on the positive
and the power of being dissatisfied?

593
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,510
So here's your exercise for today and
then tomorrow we're going to actually

594
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,390
unleash you into a goal setting
workshop.

595
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,490
And you might want to review and listen
to this tape again.

596
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,770
So you're inspired when you go to do
that exercise.

597
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:10,770
Because I want you to really come to
life and know you're about to create

598
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,410
real results.
When you start that workshop today

599
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,090
though,
pull out your success journal and here's

600
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:18,240
your assignment.
What I'd like you to do is I want you to

601
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:20,790
write down two things.
Number one,

602
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,050
what are some of the areas of your life
you are dissatisfied with?

603
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,330
Now,
I don't want you to feel bad,

604
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,850
real negative about it,
but just be honest with yourself.

605
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,280
What are some of the areas of your life
that are not enough?

606
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,250
It's not good enough.
It's not what you deserve it to be,

607
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,780
if not where you're committed to having
it be.

608
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,270
Take a look at yourself physically,
emotionally,

609
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,010
spiritually,
intellectually,

610
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,040
financially,
and

611
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,530
your relationships.
So question,

612
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:46,750
I want you to ask yourself,
is what's not good in my life?

613
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,870
What am I not satisfied with?
And get inspired as you write it down

614
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,970
because whatever you write down,
you're going to be able to change.

615
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,110
And that's number one and make a good
list of things you're dissatisfied with

616
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,770
that will create some pressure inside of
you to create some powerful new goals.

617
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,730
And number two,
write down what kind of beliefs,

618
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,390
what I have to have.
What are a couple of additional beliefs?

619
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:10,560
Since we've talked about that earlier,
what are two or three other beliefs that

620
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,960
I would probably need to have in order
to really set goals and achieve them?

621
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,920
What are two or three new beliefs I'd
need to live by in order to really start

622
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:21,130
achieving my goals?
That's your simple assignment for today.

623
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,880
Just leave today with a focus on getting
big enough wise,

624
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,660
the power of why is the power to achieve
your dreams.
