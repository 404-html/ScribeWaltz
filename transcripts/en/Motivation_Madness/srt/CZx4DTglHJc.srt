1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,170
I had the chance to meet with some of
the kids in the program today.

2
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:14,370
Where are you screaming at?
There you go.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,730
I love those kids.
And so when I thought I would do,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,200
because they gave me a little bit of
time to say whatever I want,

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,860
um,
is offer you a little bit of

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,620
some observations for your future.
I have five little rules that you can

7
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:37,370
follow as you find your spark and bring
your spark to life.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,260
The first is to go after the things that
you want.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,010
Let me tell you a story.
So a friend of mine and I,

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,130
we went for a run in central park,
the roadrunners organization,

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,800
uh,
on the weekends.

12
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,520
They host races and it's very common at
the end of the race they'll have a

13
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:59,540
sponsor who will give away something
apples or bagels or something.

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,600
And on this particular day when we got
to the end of the run,

15
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,990
there were some free bagels and they had
picnic tables set up.

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,050
And on one side was a group of
volunteers on the table were boxes of

17
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:15,200
bagels.
And on the other side was a long line of

18
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,520
runners waiting to get their free Bagel.
So I said to my friend,

19
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,690
let's,
let's get a Bagel.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,050
And he looked at me and said,
uh,

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,880
that line's too long.
And I said,

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,270
free Bagel.
And he said,

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,930
I don't want to wait in line.
And I was like,

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,890
free Bagel.
And he says,

25
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:38,540
Nah,
it's too long.

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,440
And that's when I realized that there's
two ways to see the world.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,690
Some people see the thing that they want
and some people see the thing that

28
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,060
prevents them from getting the thing
that they want.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,110
I could only see the bagels.
He could only see the line.

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,270
And so I walked up to the line.
I leaned in between two people,

31
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,420
put my hand in the box and pulled out
two bagels and no one got mad at me

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,140
because the rule is you can go after
whatever you want.

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,700
You just cannot deny anyone else to go
after whatever they want.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,600
Now I had to sacrifice choice.
I didn't get to choose which Bagel I

35
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,130
got.
I got whatever I pulled out,

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,150
but I didn't have to wait in line.
So the point is is you don't have to

37
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,370
wait in line.
You don't have to do it the way

38
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,250
everybody else has done it.
You can do it your way,

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,400
you can break the rules.
You just can't get in the way of

40
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,730
somebody else getting what they want.
That's rule number one.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,220
Rule number two,
I liked this one

42
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,350
in the 18th century,
there was something that spread across

43
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:53,900
Europe and eventually made its way to
America.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,980
Fever,
also known as the black death of child

45
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,770
bed.
Basically what was happening is women

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
were giving birth and they would die
within 48 hours after giving birth.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,340
This black death of childbirth was the
ravage of Europe and it got worse and

48
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,130
worse and worse over the course of over
a century.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In some hospitals,
it was as high as 70 percent of women

50
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,980
who gave birth,
who would die as a result of giving

51
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,830
birth,
but this was the renaissance.

52
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,760
This was the time of empirical data and
science,

53
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,210
and we had thrown away things like
tradition and mysticism.

54
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,230
These were men of science,
these were doctors and these doctors

55
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,290
that men of science,
I wanted to study and try and find the

56
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:49,291
reason for this black death of child bed
and so they got to work studying and

57
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:55,201
they would study the corpses of the of
the women who had died and in the

58
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,800
morning they would conduct autopsies and
then in the afternoon they would go and

59
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,510
deliver babies and finish their rounds
and it wasn't until somewhere in the mid

60
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,260
18 hundreds that Dr Oliver Wendell
Holmes,

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,070
father of Supreme Court justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes,

62
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:16,450
realized that all of these doctors who
are conducting autopsies in the morning

63
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,930
weren't washing their hands before they
delivered babies in the afternoon and he

64
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,510
pointed it out and said,
guys,

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,160
you're the problem.

66
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,270
And they ignored him and called him
crazy for 30 years until finally

67
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,460
somebody realized that if they simply
washed their hands,

68
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,510
it would go away.
And that's exactly what happened when

69
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,390
they started sterilizing their
instruments in washing their hands,

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,600
the black death of child bed
disappeared.

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,880
My point is,
the lesson here is sometimes your the

72
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,714
problem.

73
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,320
We've seen this happen all too recently
with our new men of science and

74
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:07,321
empirical studiers and these men of
finance who are smarter than the rest of

75
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:15,040
us until the thing collapse and they
blamed everything else except

76
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,560
themselves,
and my point is,

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,680
is take accountability for your actions.
You can take all the credit in the world

78
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:27,841
for the things that you do right as long
as you also take responsibility for the

79
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,060
things you do wrong,
it must be a balanced equation.

80
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,430
You don't get it one way and not the
other.

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,690
You get to take credit when you also
take accountability.

82
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,230
That's lesson two.
Lesson three,

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,100
take care of each other.
The United States Navy seals are perhaps

84
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,321
the most elite warriors in the world,
and one of the seals was asked who makes

85
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:01,171
it through the selection process,
who is able to become a seal?

86
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,920
And his answer was,
I can't tell you the kind of person that

87
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,790
becomes a seal.

88
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,700
I can't tell you the kind of person that
makes it through buds,

89
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,170
but I can tell you the kind of people
who don't become seals.

90
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,560
He says,
the guys that show up with huge bulging

91
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,460
muscles covered in tattoos,
who want to prove to the world how tough

92
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,430
they are,
none of them make it through.

93
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,220
He said,
the preening leaders who like to

94
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,120
delegate all their responsibility and
never do anything themselves,

95
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,090
none of them make it through.
He said,

96
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,530
the Star College athletes who've never
really been tested to the core of their

97
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,860
being,
none of them make it through.

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,440
He says,
some of the guys that make it through

99
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,500
are skinny and scrawny.
He said,

100
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:53,480
some of the guys that make it through
you will see them shivering out of fear.

101
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,000
He says,
however,

102
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,750
all the guys that make it through,
when they find themselves physically

103
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,010
spent emotionally spent,
when they have nothing left to give

104
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,740
physically or emotionally,
somehow some way,

105
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,890
they are able to find the energy to dig
down deep inside themselves to find the

106
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,670
energy,
to help the guy next to them.

107
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,060
They become seals.
He said,

108
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,020
you want to be an elite warrior.
It's not about how tough you are.

109
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,070
It's not about how smart you are.
It's not about how fast you are.

110
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,250
If you want to be an elite warrior,
you better to get really,

111
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:38,240
really good at helping the person to the
left of you and helping the person to

112
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:42,200
the right of you because that's how
people advance in the world.

113
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,830
The world is too dangerous in the world
is too difficult for you to think that

114
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,950
you can do these things alone.
If you find your spark,

115
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,340
I commend you now who you going to ask
for help and what are you going to

116
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,780
accept?
Help when it's offered.

117
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,250
Learn that skill.
Learn by practicing,

118
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,460
helping each other.
It will be the single most valuable

119
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:06,200
thing you ever learned in your entire
life to accept help when it's offered

120
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,040
and to ask for it.

121
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,880
When you know that you can't do it.
The amazing thing is when you learn to

122
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,250
ask for help,
you'll discover that there are people

123
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,560
all around you who've always wanted to
help you.

124
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,650
They just didn't think you needed it
because you kept pretending that you had

125
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,380
everything under control and the minute
you say,

126
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,020
I don't know what I'm doing,
I'm stuck.

127
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm scared.
I don't think I can do this.

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,090
You will find that lots of people who
love you will rush in and take care of

129
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,790
you,
but that will only happen if you learn

130
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,620
to take care of them

131
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,453
first.

132
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,420
Less than four.
Nelson Mandela is a particularly special

133
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:57,381
case study in the leadership world
because he is universally regarded as a

134
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,960
great leader.
You can take other personalities and

135
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,870
depending on the nation you go to,
we have different opinions about other

136
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,080
personalities,
but Nelson Mandela across the world is

137
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:12,081
universally regarded as a great leader.
He was actually the son of a tribal

138
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:17,511
chief and he was asked one day,
how did you learn to be a great leader?

139
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,740
And he responded that he would go with
his father to tribal meetings and he

140
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,830
remembers to things when his father
would meet with other elders.

141
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,250
One,
they would always sit in a circle and to

142
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,250
his father was always the last to speak.
You will be told your whole life that

143
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:45,180
you need to learn to listen.
I would say that you need to learn to be

144
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,290
the last to speak.

145
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,260
I see it in boardrooms everyday of the
week.

146
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,740
Even people who consider themselves good
leaders who may actually be decent

147
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,620
leaders will walk into a room and say,
here's the problem,

148
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,540
here's what I think,
but I'm interested in your opinion.

149
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,580
Let's go around the room.
It's too late.

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,800
The skill to hold your opinions to
yourself until everyone has spoken does

151
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,270
two things.
One,

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,960
it gives everybody else the feeling that
they have been heard.

153
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,350
It gives,
gives everyone else the ability to feel

154
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,380
that they have contributed,
and two,

155
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,680
you get the benefit of hearing what
everybody else has to think before you

156
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:23,490
render your opinion.
The skill is really to keep your

157
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:26,160
opinions to yourself.
If you agree with somebody,

158
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,550
don't nod yes.
If you disagree with somebody,

159
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,490
don't not know.
Simply sit there,

160
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,570
take it all in and the only thing you're
allowed to do is ask questions so that

161
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:40,620
you can understand what they mean and
why they have the opinion that they

162
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:44,220
have.
You must understand from where they are

163
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,430
speaking,
why they have the opinion they have,

164
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,490
not just what they are saying and at the
end you will get your turn.

165
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,740
It sounds easy.
It's not practice being the last to

166
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,440
speak.
That's what Nelson Mandela did,

167
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,590
number three,
number five,

168
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,070
monty python,
one,

169
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:08,611
two,
five,

170
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,390
three
for all the other nerds in the audience.

171
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,940
There's one.
Number five,

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,960
my favorite.
One of all,

173
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,090
true story.
There was a former under secretary of

174
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:31,170
defense who was invited to give a speech
at a large conference about a thousand

175
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:36,171
people and he was standing on the stage
with his cup of coffee in a Styrofoam

176
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,991
Cup giving his prepared remarks but his
powerpoint behind him and he took a sip

177
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:46,470
of his coffee and he smiled and he
looked down at the coffee and then he

178
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,810
went off script and he said,
you know,

179
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:53,500
last year I spoke at this exact same
conference last year.

180
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:57,970
I was still the under secretary and when
I spoke here last year,

181
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,680
they flew me here business class and
when I arrived at the airport there was

182
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,820
somebody waiting for me to take me to my
hotel and they took me to my hotel and

183
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,540
they had already checked me in and they
just took me up to my room and the next

184
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,560
morning I came downstairs and there was
someone waiting in the lobby to greet me

185
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,020
and they drove me to this here,
same venue.

186
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,280
They took me through the back entrance
and took me into the green room and

187
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,360
handed me a coffee,
a cup of coffee in a beautiful ceramic

188
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,250
cup.
He says,

189
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,950
I'm no longer the under secretary.
I flew here,

190
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,950
coach.
I took a taxi to my hotel and I checked

191
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:36,430
myself in.
When I came down the lobby this morning,

192
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,610
I took another taxi to this venue.
I came in the front door and found my

193
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,670
way back stage and when I asked someone,
do you have any coffee?

194
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,660
He pointed to the coffee machine in the
corner and I poured myself a cup of

195
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:53,080
coffee into this here,
Styrofoam Cup.

196
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,480
He says,
the lesson is,

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,900
the Ceramic Cup was never meant for me.
It was meant for the position I held.

198
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,310
I deserve a Styrofoam Cup.
Remember this,

199
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,240
as you gain fame,
as you gain fortune,

200
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,770
as you gain position and seniority,
people will treat you better.

201
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,580
They will hold doors open for you and
they will get you a cup of tea and

202
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:22,240
coffee without you even asking.
They will call you sir and Ma'am and

203
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:26,050
they will give you stuff.
None of that stuff has meant for you.

204
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,290
That stuff has meant for the position
you hold.

205
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,330
It has meant for the level that you have
achieved of leader or success or

206
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:39,331
whatever you want to call it,
but you will always deserve a Styrofoam

207
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,820
Cup.
Remember that?

208
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,330
Remember that lesson of humility and
gratitude.

209
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,690
You can accept all the free stuff.
You can accept all the perks.

210
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,070
Absolutely you can enjoy them,
but just be grateful for them and know

211
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:59,071
that they're not for you.
I remember getting off the Esella.

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,450
I took the Esella from New York to
Washington DC and I got off the train

213
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:08,830
like everybody else and I was walking
down the platform like everyone else and

214
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,831
I walked past general nordies Schwartz
who used to be the chief of staff of the

215
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
United States air force,
the head of the air force,

216
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,120
and here I did you see a guy in a suit
schlepping his own suitcase down the

217
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:29,611
platform just like me and just a couple
months ago he was flying on private jets

218
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,890
and eight an entourage and other people
carried his luggage,

219
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,510
but he no longer held the position and
so now he got to drag his own suitcase

220
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,673
and never did it.

221
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,670
Sort of remind me more that none of us
deserve the perks that we get.

222
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,700
We all deserve a Styrofoam Cup.
It was a pleasure meeting you guys this

223
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,030
afternoon.
I was blown away by your honesty and

224
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:58,031
your curiosity and your poise,
and I am confident that the future is

225
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:01,850
bright despite the fact that America
looks like an absolute mess right now.

226
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,860
I am confident that the future is bright
for one reason and one reason only

227
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,220
because you will grow up and you will be
our future.

228
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,810
Thank you very,
very much guys.

229
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,830
You're wonderful.
