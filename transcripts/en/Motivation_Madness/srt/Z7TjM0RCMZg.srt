1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,140
Right now is that we have a lot of
people who want to build brands who want

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:13,930
to become influencers,
who want to start companies,

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,580
but they're not putting in the pieces
that actually allowed them to weather

4
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:20,080
the storm.
You know,

5
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:23,110
the thing that I'm most proud of is the
two biggest businesses I've ever built.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,460
I basically started them during very
difficult times when I first got

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,110
involved in my dad's liquor store
business.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,100
It was the late nineties and just about
a year and a half into my journey,

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,760
I guess two years into my journey.
The stock market crashed and all the

10
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,060
Internet companies folded and all the
people that were making money that I was

11
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:44,100
targeting to sell wine,
stopped having money to buy wine and Ip

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,530
and then right behind that,
because most of my business was New York

13
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,450
and New Jersey based.
Even though we were building an internet

14
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:52,630
company was only about a year later that
nine slash 11 happened.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,410
And not only,
you know,

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,190
changed.
I mean for anybody that lived in New

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,881
York,
New Jersey area.

18
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:01,330
It was much more compounded for us
because we lost loved ones.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,070
And I remember I lost 100 employees from
one organization in one day,

20
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,920
I had to go in the hand by hand and take
their emails out because everybody

21
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:13,550
passed away from Cantor Fitzgerald that
worked in that office so and that.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,990
So I persevered through that because I
was practical because I didn't have a

23
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:19,360
lot of overhead.
And because I wasn't romantic,

24
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,360
I wasn't dreaming.
I knew that I had a buy and sell wine

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,350
and liquor and beer and I had to make
sure that my expenses weren't greater

26
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:31,351
than the money I was bringing in.
Vaynermedia started in the actions of

27
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,500
the economic meltdown of the U.
S when I started Vaynermedia,

28
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,820
people didn't want to pay $5,000,
let alone the 50 or a hundred thousand.

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,340
They pay us a month now for our
services.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,100
And,
and when I started vayner media,

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,090
you know,
it's funny,

32
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,250
I watch everybody watched my journey
now.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,500
And you know,
there's that cliche thing of like

34
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,910
overnight success,
right?

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,870
I'm going to have this TV show come out
this June and it's going to change my

36
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:56,501
profile,
right?

37
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:59,250
I'm going to sit on the stage with will
I am and Gwyneth Paltrow,

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,750
Jessica Alba for this apple show that
I'm about to do,

39
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,030
and everybody's gonna say,
where do you come from that happened

40
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,260
overnight and you know,
and it's even really happened in social.

41
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,700
I'm sure a lot of you,
for a lot of you,

42
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:13,150
you've only really even have known about
me for the last six months or so even

43
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:16,900
though I had been putting out content
online for 10 years every single day.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,280
And so the thing that I've been really
thinking about is practicality,

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,870
like vayner media.

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,150
Even though I had already built a nice
size business,

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,450
it wasn't like I was extracting a lot of
money out of wine library.

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,840
And so when age and I started vayner
media seven years ago,

49
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,470
we started it out of a company called
Buddy media is conference room.

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,170
For the first two years that I ran
vaynermedia.

51
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,920
We had no rent.
We first worked out of a conference

52
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,150
room,
a conference room.

53
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,840
We then worked out of a coworking space
before the whole.

54
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:51,841
We work in coworking space revolution
and I bartered my time to help that

55
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,930
company in exchange for a very small
space.

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,770
We didn't buy furniture we scrapped and
I'd already made it.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,240
I was already rich and we scrapped.
And so the biggest thing that I want to

58
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,100
implore everybody here today to do is to
take a step back and think about how

59
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,300
fancy are they?

60
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you willing to be really,
really,

61
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,560
really ghetto?
Do you really need that chair?

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,930
Do you really need that piece of
technology?

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,430
Do you really need to fly that class?
Like I just think that we're living

64
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,330
through an incredibly fancy culture of
entrepreneurship,

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,780
entrepreneurship and CEO Status is quite
sexy.

66
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:33,250
People are selling a lifestyle that is
filled with lots of fun and trips and,

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,440
and champagne and bikini's and bling,
bling and all sorts of horse shit.

68
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Right?
And,

69
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,320
uh,
and I just think that that era of this

70
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,770
era is going to come to an end somewhere
within the next five years.

71
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,230
And very honestly,
I just don't want a lot of people in

72
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,160
this room that dream to build their own
businesses to have to go work at a bank

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,720
or go work at a retail store.
And so I would highly recommend

74
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,380
something that I think is stunningly not
talked about enough,

75
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,890
which is if you're building a business,
you have to be making money.

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,410
And so I know that's like a funny thing
to say,

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,640
but I think it's important.
I think the other thing that's important

78
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,430
is to shift the context completely the
other way,

79
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,620
which is what is really winning,
right?

80
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,980
Like what is the definition of winning?
And I think we all have different

81
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,330
definitions,
right?

82
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,930
And I think that one of the things that
I also want to say is that I'm getting

83
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,930
scared that a lot of people that are
following my journey here,

84
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,280
me talking about buying the New York
jets and I do aspire to buy a

85
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,700
$3,000,000,000 sports franchise.
I do.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,850
It is what I want.
It's.

87
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,540
You can look at my fifth grade yearbook
long before business was cool.

88
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,090
It's what I want to do,
but I'm awfully scared that it's

89
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,500
pressuring the people that follow me
into trying to achieve things that they

90
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,550
don't necessarily want.

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,670
They just think it's the thing you do if
you're trying to be a successful

92
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,710
businessperson.
Let me promise you something.

93
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,610
I know tens of thousands of people.
I know thousands of people extremely

94
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,740
well.
I know hundreds of people deeply.

95
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,770
Well,
there is no correlation between how much

96
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,680
money someone makes and their level of
happiness.

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I have friends who make $47,000 a year
and are the happiest people I know their

98
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:23,920
work life balances on point.
They're part of two soccer teams.

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,590
They play video games.
They watch every show they want.

100
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,710
They take two vacations that they
scrapped together and they're freaking

101
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,650
happiest.
Hell and I know tons of people who I

102
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:36,880
grew up within the silicon valley boom
who have hundreds of millions of dollars

103
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,110
in their bank account and are as
miserable and as lonely and as broken as

104
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:45,520
you'll ever see.
So I implore all of you to please

105
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:50,230
reverse engineer and figure out who you
are and figure out what level of

106
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,100
monetizing and stuff you need and what
level of creativity needed.

107
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,250
I promise you one thing,
one thing that will catch you off guard

108
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,980
my should be way more rich.
I leave money on the table every day.

109
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,310
I've left ungodly amounts of money on
the table.

110
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I spend tons of times spending sending
dms and engaging with people and meeting

111
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,760
people randomly and not cashing in.
I actually believe the statement I'm

112
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,420
about to make.
I think that I love the journey and the

113
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,421
game of entrepreneurship so much that I
have subconsciously sabotaged my

114
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:30,080
financial upside to make sure I can play
this a little longer because I fear if

115
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,770
the numbers keep getting too big,
eventually it will take the fun out of

116
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,700
it.
When you were lucky enough like I am to

117
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,690
actually do something that you love so
much,

118
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,830
do something that puts pressure against
the one thing you care about besides it,

119
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,840
which is the time I spend with my
family,

120
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,930
my family is my whole life and being
this and doing this is the only thing

121
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:57,500
that cuts into that I couldn't breathe
if I wasn't an entrepreneur.

122
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,650
I didn't breathe when I wasn't an
entrepreneur.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,750
That's the reason I got d's and f's in
school because I just couldn't be me and

124
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:10,751
I'm not capable of that.
And so I think being here excites me

125
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,570
because I think coming to not la,
San Francisco,

126
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,670
New York,
London is always more fun for me.

127
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,790
It always feels a little more practical.
It always feels like there's a little

128
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,130
bit more chips on the shoulder,
which is what I have,

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,360
but I want to remind everybody just
because you didn't grow up with a trust

130
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,460
fund,
just because you don't live in silicon

131
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:32,300
valley,
the market doesn't care if you're good

132
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,210
enough,
you will win and I hope that you don't.

133
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,250
Thank you.

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,920
And if you sit around and ponder,
well,

135
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:48,921
if I didn't live here or if my mom
wasn't an alcoholic or if I just learned

136
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:52,050
about this earlier,
or if I had been following this person

137
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,200
earlier,
or if I wasn't born a woman or if I

138
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,810
wasn't born a minority,
if you sit and do that,

139
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,590
you are losing.
You're not wrong.

140
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,760
It's just that business and marketing
and all this doesn't care.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,070
They're just no emotion in the market
like.

142
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,920
And that's it.
And so I think we need to start having

143
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,890
much deeper,
much more serious conversations of

144
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,990
practicality.
You know,

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,440
it's fun and I love this space the most,
but I loved it long before it was sexy.

146
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,320
I loved it long before people want to
take selfies with me.

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,670
I loved it long before athletes and
celebrities and rappers want it to be

148
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,890
entrepreneurs.
I loved it long before that,

149
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,410
it was my destiny.
It was who I was.

150
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,170
It was how I was wired.
It was the only thing I knew.

151
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,030
That's why the four year old me ripped
flowers out of yards and sold it.

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,920
You don't read about being an
entrepreneur at five,

153
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,551
six,
seven,

154
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,384
eight,
and nine.

155
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,580
I didn't jump on this because it's cool
now and it makes me money and I did it

156
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,850
because it's all I ever was and I
implore you,

157
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,870
if you came here to be an entrepreneur,
but this talk allows you to realize

158
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,890
you're really an artist or you're really
a number three in a company because you

159
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,160
bring this level of energy and you don't
want to be a number one because let me

160
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,840
promise you something about being a
number one.

161
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,350
I'm not an entrepreneur.
I'm a firefighter.

162
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,400
My entire life is taken care of.
Crap.

163
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,860
Putting out fires.
Twenty four slash seven,

164
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,270
three 65.
My whole life is this is a problem.

165
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,490
Fix this,
and guess what?

166
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,450
When you're the last line of defense,
there's no blaming your boss.

167
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,850
There's no blaming the logo.

168
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,510
There's no blaming the government.
It's all my fault,

169
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,370
all of it,
and so it's super sexy,

170
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,070
but what's not being talked about is the
friends and acquaintances I have who've

171
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,220
committed suicide in the entrepreneurial
and the last four years because nobody

172
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:56,370
talks about the downside.
Everybody thinks they're going to be

173
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,770
zucks.
Everybody thinks they're gonna.

174
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,260
Build snapchat.
Go look at the data.

175
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,150
The data shows that the far majority of
this room will not succeed,

176
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,550
not even close to building an actual
business,

177
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,290
and I don't come here to be somber.
I come here to remind you that there's

178
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:18,291
only one thing you can do.
The only thing you can do that can trump

179
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,850
the moment,
mommy and daddy had sex to make you the

180
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,450
only thing that can trump that.
The only thing that can trump your dna,

181
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,570
the only thing that is controllable if
you want it,

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,480
if you want.
This is work.

183
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,130
Thank you.

184
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,800
Only tangible and by the way,
I don't know if you guys have noticed.

185
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:48,280
I've stopped even funny given the name
of the conference I've started.

186
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,050
I've started using the word work more
than the word hustle just because I want

187
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,720
everybody to understand what we're
really talking about here.

188
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,840
If you've got a big mouth and a lot of
you do here,

189
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,720
search the Hashtag and a lot of you say
ceo,

190
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,800
founder,
owner.

191
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,150
I call that big mouth.
If you've got the audacity to do it,

192
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,780
and,
and so many of you've heard this from me

193
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:14,140
when I audit you and I do because I'm
curious.

194
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,050
It's how I learn.
People talk a big game.

195
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,360
I especially loved when somebody hits me
up on social,

196
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,550
like Gary V,
you're gonna buy the jets.

197
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,150
I'm going to buy the rams.
You know,

198
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,800
everybody is buying a sports team and I
love and I love to look at what that

199
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:33,730
person does and then I'll dm that person
and be like,

200
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,320
Yo bro,
nobody,

201
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,040
nobody.

202
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,220
Unless they were a trust fund baby,
ever bought the rams.

203
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,250
When they go skiing for a week when
they're 24,

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,120
nobody,
you know,

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,840
nobody you know,
nobody you know has become successful

206
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,200
outside of it being given to them from
their family.

207
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Nobody you know has actually created
success without working their face off.

208
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,620
It doesn't exist.
So you can sit and talk about luck and

209
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,290
you can sit and talk about this,
that,

210
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,390
or the other thing.
But I promise you,

211
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
the only controllable thing you have is
your work ethic.

212
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,290
So going back to the beginning of my
talk,

213
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,190
you need to deploy serious,
serious self awareness and figuring out

214
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:30,790
who you are.
I implore you to start matching your

215
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,030
work ethic and your actions to your
mouth.

216
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,340
If you're going to be a billionaire,
you need to realize that most people

217
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,341
that create billion dollars worth of
wealth don't do anything besides work

218
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,980
every single day of their twenties and
thirties.

219
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,780
All of them,
every person that works at Vaynermedia

220
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,110
has taken more vacations in the last 13
months than I did in my entire twenties

221
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,670
and early thirties.
My family went on to family vacations my

222
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:07,120
entire childhood.
I was married to my wife for five years

223
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,180
before we had a family.
We took two vacations.

224
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,930
It's the price you have to pay if you
want it at the level that I wanted at.

225
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,960
And by the way,
I advise nobody to want it at that

226
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,750
level.
I'm being dead serious.

227
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,600
This is a very true statement.
I think most of you will not believe,

228
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,190
but I'm telling you,
it's the goddamn truth.

229
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,350
If there was a drug that could take some
ambition out,

230
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,010
I would take it.
It is so extreme.

231
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,270
It is all in.
The reason I started daily Vee was to

232
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:44,800
remind you that I'm out working you,
that when you talk and you're trying to

233
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,750
figure it out,
when you're trying to say,

234
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,730
you're going to be like me,
I want you to see it.

235
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,240
I want you to see every other day,
5:00 AM,

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,530
I want you to see everyday midnight,
all of them every day,

237
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,510
always forever.

238
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,940
That's what it takes for what I want.
Good news is between what I want and

239
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:10,570
what is achievable and it's considered
unbelievably all time.

240
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:14,620
Happy is a big gap,
so there's plenty of vacation time.

241
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,660
I know tons of people with vacation
time.

242
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,880
I know tons of people with work life
balance.

243
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,290
I know tons of people that do tons of
fun activities and make seven figures,

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,010
millions of dollars a year and love it.
I'm playing for legacy.

245
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,020
I'm playing for all time.
I'm looking to impact every generation

246
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,130
that comes behind me because I want to
show that you can build all time,

247
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:37,180
wealth,
all time.

248
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:40,720
Greatness doing it the right way and the
old way.

249
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,980
That's what I'm up to,
so please make sure you understand that

250
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,220
and more importantly,
make sure you understand yourself so

251
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,710
that you can reverse engineered that
blueprint and figuring out you fit

252
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,260
within that and then deploy it,
but I promise you,

253
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,510
but I promise you,
you will not get there with your big

254
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:01,760
idea.
I promise you.

255
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,500
Sitting around and saying,
Oh,

256
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,680
I had that idea for uber before uber
did.

257
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,470
Nobody gives a shit.

258
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,750
I've got every idea that's going to be
successful over the next hundred years.

259
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,260
It's all about ai and Vr and ar and
augmented and all this.

260
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,290
I'll give them to you all.
It doesn't matter because most of you

261
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:25,160
won't execute against it.
The reason I put out all my best stuff

262
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,780
and I'm like,
then I don't charge for it,

263
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,440
is somewhere along the line I realized
that 99 point nine percent of you aren't

264
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:34,730
going to do anything about it.
You're going to ponder it.

265
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,820
You're gonna get super pumped up when
you watch me say it,

266
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,780
and then three weeks later you're going
to give up because you're not willing to

267
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,560
pay the price.
