1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Oh,
I spend at least a week,

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,990
a year where I go off to the screen,
keep us phd.

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,780
Theses and new things are going on in
the field.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,490
You'll believe the prime ingredient of
his success was his early fascination

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,520
with computers.
You have to understand when you spend

6
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:27,420
your time thinking intensely about a
field and how from a very young age,

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,570
uh,
what's my cases?

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,130
You know,
it's 13 or 14 when I started to get

9
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,520
involved.
Uh,

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,830
that's where you can do great things is
because your mind has really gotten into

11
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,111
it.
You,

12
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:39,210
you understand that

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,480
one of the ideas that excite you or is
it just customers?

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,770
Customers first,
second is last a century a company.

15
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:51,960
If you want to grow,
I believe you should find a great

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,290
opportunity.
But today this was now lack opportunity

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,780
that today if you want to be a Greek
company,

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,940
think about what problem you can solve.
It's not the catch the opportunity.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,670
It's about solving the social risk
problems.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,970
If you,
because companies like Alibaba where

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,090
brings so fast,
it's very difficult for one opportunity

22
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,290
that can make us lost
such a organization.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Who is the power power by ink to net was
millions and millions of smes with 400

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,340
million consumers.
What kind of problem can solve and uh,

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm excited.
Anything you mentioned about cloud

26
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,840
computing and talking about a more bio
things,

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,810
anything that's happened in the USA is
going to happen in China.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,260
There is an amazing degree to which
people's ambitions get beaten out of

29
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,370
them in these,
in these,

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,890
in these top universities.
If I look at what people thought my

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,210
senior year in high school,
it was sort of like,

32
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:47,130
we're very ambitious.
They'd all these ideas what they were

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,510
going to do.
And if you looked at the same people at

34
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:53,880
a sort of college plus five years,
sort of nine years later,

35
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,490
let's say,
it was amazing how much things have been

36
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,750
ratcheted down.
So I,

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
I do think there's something problematic
where all the talented people go to

38
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,870
these schools.
They're sort of evaluated on the same

39
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,680
terms and at the end,
uh,

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,190
at the end,
a lot of ambitions are beaten out of

41
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:11,640
them.
Know,

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,810
probably the,
the one that I think is even worse for

43
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,900
people than Harvard in this respect,
uh,

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,780
might be,
uh,

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,420
might be Caltech where you have these
brilliant math,

46
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,990
physics people and after four years
where you're in the middle of your

47
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,030
class,
you're convinced that the most you can

48
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,030
do with your life has become a blind
engineer at Lockheed.

49
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,000
And maybe you can go into mid level
management 20 years later.

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,470
And so that,
that is,

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,600
that sort of is characteristic of a,
of what I think has happened and what,

52
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,580
what,
what I think we need to somehow find a

53
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,760
way back to is,
is this idea that,

54
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,520
um,
that there's not just a single track,

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,580
that there are very different things you
can do.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,780
You know,
the question,

57
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,760
you know,
what truth do you know that nobody

58
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,300
agrees with you on the,
the,

59
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,900
the sort of career version of this is
what,

60
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,750
what are you really at that other people
aren't that good at or,

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,820
or something like that.
And that's a,

62
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,310
and that's somehow gets discouraged by
this,

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
by this incredible homogenization.
Yeah.

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,980
And big ambitions get discouraged.
I think that you think every way the EU,

65
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,650
then everyone runs true of all of us.
I suppose we decide we can make it in

66
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,140
certain line and do things a little,
you know,

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,420
move ahead step by step.
But the kind of,

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,220
yeah,
there's always the ambition to be a

69
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,190
founder that if that seems to be knocked
out,

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,900
the whole,
both the institutions and the mindset

71
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:32,010
that permeates the institutions is
almost a denial that that ambition is

72
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,900
reasonable or even possible.

73
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,250
Well,
there's a sense that um,

74
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:37,680
there are all these people who are ahead
of you.

75
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:41,040
So there's always this sense,
there's so many people who are,

76
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,920
uh,
who are much better or just as good as

77
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,780
you.
So who are you to think that you can do

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,970
anything on anything different?
And obviously when everybody starts to

79
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,880
think that nobody does anything,
and in fact it becomes self fulfilling

80
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,714
once again,

81
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,690
you know,
for me,

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,510
so much of the lesson that,
that I,

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,990
I feel like I've learned is I feel like
it's really hard to decide to start a

84
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,824
company.
Right.

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,641
You know,
facebook,

86
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,940
I didn't start it to start a company.
I started it because I really wanted

87
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,820
this thing personally and I believed
that it should exist globally.

88
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,150
Although I wasn't quite sure that that
we would be able to play a role in doing

89
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,490
that.
It was mostly just through kind of like

90
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:20,470
wanting to build it and having it be
this hobby and getting people around me

91
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,560
excited that it eventually kind of
evolved into and got the momentum to

92
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,230
become a company.
But I never really understood the

93
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,770
psychology of deciding that you want to
start a company before you understand

94
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,960
what you want to do.
And this gets back to the question of

95
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,300
why did we,
why did we first open it at colleges

96
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,170
that had competitors?

97
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,510
I have this big fear I think of getting
locked into doing things that aren't

98
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,230
actually the most impactful things.
I mean to me this is like the trait that

99
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:49,231
entrepreneurs have is they just have
this like laser like ability to go find

100
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,150
where they can have the most impact.
And you know when you take on a new

101
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,370
project,
especially if you hire people or start a

102
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,960
company,
you're doing that project.

103
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,010
And I mean there,
there are ways,

104
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,050
there are obviously different ways that
it can exit and all that.

105
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,860
But,
um,

106
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,920
I think having the flexibility to
explore a lot of different things,

107
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,470
which you can do when you're in college,
which is one of the amazing things about

108
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,300
being in college is you can work on all
these hobbies,

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,200
um,
and,

110
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,090
and,
and code a lot of stuff and try a lot of

111
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,870
different things.

112
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,720
It's this amazing flexibility that I
think most people take for granted.

113
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,040
And once you decide,
okay,

114
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,170
I'm going to start a company,
I'm going to do it with someone else,

115
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,200
you immediately now need to convince
someone else if you want to change your

116
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,230
mind on something.
And I think people really undervalue the

117
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,710
option value and flexibility.
I think explore what you want to do

118
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,980
before committing is really like the,
the key thing and keep yourself

119
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,090
flexible.
Um,

120
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,280
and no,
I think that that's,

121
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,340
I mean agree,
but I think you can definitely do that

122
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,920
within the framework of a company.
But I think you have to be wary about

123
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,910
starting a company,
um,

124
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,440
to rigidly because you're,
you're going to change what you do.

125
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,720
I mean,
people talk about pivots all the time as

126
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,760
if it's like it doesn't,
didn't your thing didn't work.

127
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,100
So you pivoted.
Facebook pivoted many times.

128
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,611
Um,
it just,

129
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,181
that,
you know,

130
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,160
we kind of,
we were college and then we were not

131
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,950
college and then we were just a website
and then we were a platform.

132
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,270
Right?
And you're going to change what you do.

133
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,550
There's another word for the kind of
pivots you were talking about.

134
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,570
Expansions.
Hell No.

135
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,640
What people usually mean by pivoting.
Well,

136
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
you know,
flexibility.

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,670
Follow your instincts.
Very easy to say.

138
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,150
Incredibly difficult to do.
A little more context.

139
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,700
Everybody,
when they're wondering about what they

140
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:25,030
should do after college or after
university,

141
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,020
you have the weight of expectations on
your shoulders.

142
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,170
You have college bills that you might
have to pay.

143
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:37,171
You have parents who have expectations
for you in a particular direction.

144
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,380
And whether you like it or not,
subconsciously you carry all that stuff

145
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,260
with you.
And if you want to go in a different

146
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,980
direction from what you've been spent
the previous 20,

147
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:51,250
25 years,
he realized almost being programmed to

148
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:54,010
go and do.
That's a very difficult thing to do.

149
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,740
What matters eventually is the quality
of the investment decisions made and the

150
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:06,490
acuity with with which those are made.
And it's somewhat similar to the analogy

151
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:11,491
that people used to make when newspapers
were read more frequently than they are

152
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,470
today,
which is not to get sucked up into

153
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,180
believing your own headlines.

154
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,230
And so I think especially in today's
era,

155
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,260
and humility also goes along way
particularly in which if you don't make

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,980
decisions correctly,
can a hand you out a right royal

157
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,060
spanking?
Uh,

158
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:36,061
no matter how high your public profile,
do you believe that there'll be another

159
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:40,960
steve job in this five to 10 years,
uh,

160
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,961
know any more than I believe there'll be
another Larry Page or mark Zuckerberg or

161
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,670
Bill Gates.
They're each very distinctive

162
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,960
personalities.
Now,

163
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,320
if the question is,
is there somebody whose name we don't

164
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:57,580
know today,
who 20 years from now will be very well

165
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:00,640
known because of a company that he or
she started?

166
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,560
Absolutely.
Yes I do.

167
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,160
I think sequoia is the preeminent
venture firm.

168
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,660
I don't,
um,

169
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,900
I think,
I think I always feel we're always one

170
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,440
step away from going out of business and
um,

171
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,640
that we can never take anything for
granted and that we're only as good as

172
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:22,780
our next investment.

173
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,660
The advice that people should follow
their instincts,

174
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,910
whether I could say a little bit more
about that.

175
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,150
I think it helps if you try and enter an
environment where you think you can

176
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:39,130
learn a lot,
whether that's inside the organization.

177
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,260
It doesn't have to have to be a company.
It can be,

178
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,260
uh,
be,

179
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,700
uh,
some other organization or around people

180
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,020
that you particularly admire that you
can learn a lot from.

181
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,590
And I think that just helps expand
horizons.

182
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,610
So also gives the individual a sense of
what excellence is really like how

183
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:06,330
realistic is it for a company to do b to
c and B,

184
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,900
two b at the same time?
Uh,

185
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,430
we,
I,

186
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,070
I'm sure there examples of companies
that have pulled it off.

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,280
Um,
I just think right at the beginning you

188
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,920
have to concentrate on doing one thing
super well on.

189
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,770
Once you've done that,
uh,

190
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,440
the second thing becomes easier,
particularly if you're dealing with,

191
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,550
it's one thing to sell precisely the
same product to both audiences.

192
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,860
And if you can do that,
bless your heart.

193
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,581
Uh,
it's a,

194
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,510
it's a,
it's a,

195
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,750
it's a good thing to do,
but I think it's very [inaudible] you've

196
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:40,800
got to tailor the product differently.
I think that's a very dangerous thing

197
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,490
for a company to do.
Uh,

198
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,280
right at the start,
you know,

199
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,281
it's no coincidence apple under Steve
Jobs was not prepared to compromise a

200
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:54,270
change and alter its products to please
corporations.

201
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,810
They would,
um,

202
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,990
uh,
build products and if corporations,

203
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,600
and it's wanted to buy them,
so be it,

204
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,430
but they weren't going to come up with,
with special products.

205
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,000
So it was an approach that,
uh,

206
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,360
obviously served them very well.
And then as you know,

207
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:13,470
there are plenty of examples of other
companies that have over time,

208
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,690
uh,
succeeded with two different sorts of

209
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,970
distribution channels.
Plenty of examples of that.

210
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
But at the beginning,
I think simplicity is a virtue

211
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,180
cause I think that's really important,
especially for young people to actually

212
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,550
do that self assessment and find that
passion.

213
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,490
Do you have any advice?
I think many,

214
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,940
many kids and many grownups do figure
out,

215
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,090
uh,
over time what their passions are.

216
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,780
And sometimes we let our,
I don't think it's that hard.

217
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:44,781
I think what happens though sometimes is
that we let our intellectual selves

218
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,760
overrule those passions.
Uh,

219
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,250
and so that's what needs to be guarded
against.

220
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,350
Uh,
kids are very good about knowing what

221
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,650
their passions are.
I love that because I think I've seen

222
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:58,680
you described this way that you've
always maintained that sense of wonder.

223
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,320
I think that's what kids have,
but we lose it somehow along the way.

224
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,510
Everybody,
it's a gift.

225
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,120
If you can keep your childlike sense of
wonder,

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,730
uh,
and it helps with creativity,

227
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,950
it helps to have fun.
Uh,

228
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,010
you know,
you laugh more and play more if you keep

229
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,840
that childlike sense of wonder.

230
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,130
What we're really focused on is thinking
long term,

231
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,270
putting the customer at the center of
our universe and inventing.

232
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,830
Those are the three big ideas I don't
think that you can invent on behalf of

233
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,430
customers unless you're willing to think
long term because a lot of invention

234
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,250
doesn't work.
If you're going to invent,

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,860
it means you're going to experiment to
have to think long term.

236
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,430
So these three ideas,
customer centricity,

237
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,520
long term thinking,
and a passion for invention,

238
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,070
those go together.
That's how we do it.

239
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,470
And by the way,
we have a lot of fun doing it that way.

240
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,970
Amazing about your successes,
that you actually,

241
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,210
your timing was good.
How does a,

242
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,100
an innovator actually identify that
historical momentum,

243
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,190
that Kitty Hawk moment you breathe,
you recognize what was happening with

244
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,300
the Internet and you said,
you know what,

245
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,700
there's actually a room for me to start
with books and then move on.

246
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,130
How do you do that?
How do you find the time and the

247
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,390
momentum,
the Zeitgeists,

248
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,690
I think everybody has their own passion,
their own thing that they're interested

249
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,600
in.
And then you're very alert to the things

250
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,990
that,
that are in the sphere of influence of

251
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,170
that passion.
So your passion has led you to change

252
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,670
the world,
frankly with Amazon,

253
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,170
but yet you've got blue origin,
you've got pesos,

254
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,130
explorations.
Why can't somebody like you just rest on

255
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,800
your loral go?
Well,

256
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,820
I,
you know,

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,520
I love what I do.
I also have four kids.

258
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:41,050
I have wife that I love.
I have a lot of passions and interests.

259
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,810
Um,
but I,

260
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,890
one of them is the pace of change.
Um,

261
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,670
I love the fact that I get to work with
these smart,

262
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,650
big smart teams.
Uh,

263
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,370
the people I work with are so smart and
they all,

264
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,210
they're self selected for loving to
invent on behalf of customers.

265
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,770
And so,
you know,

266
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,240
it's not,
uh,

267
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,080
I do,
I love every moment of every day.

268
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,670
No,
that's why they call it work.

269
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,863
There's,
you know,

270
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,760
there's always,
there are things that I,

271
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,140
that I don't enjoy,
but if I'm really objective about it and

272
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,910
I look at it,
I'm so lucky to be working alongside all

273
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,060
these passionate people and I love it.
How do you remain nimble?

274
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:28,900
Because there is somebody in their dorm
room who could eat you up for lunch the

275
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,620
next day.
You know,

276
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,080
my belief on this is,
first of all,

277
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,820
that's completely correct and you can't,
uh,

278
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,240
it can never show anybody that that
can't happen.

279
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,750
But I think if you have a customer
centric culture that cures a lot of ills

280
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,310
because we wake up,
if,

281
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,230
let's say you're the leader in a
particular arena,

282
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,180
if you're competitor focused and you're
already the leader,

283
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,100
then where does your energy come from?
Whereas if you're customer focused and

284
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,850
you're already the leader,
customers are never satisfied.

285
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,790
So you always,
if you're customer focused,

286
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:11,200
you're always waking up.
How can we make that customer say,

287
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,120
wow,
how can we,

288
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,580
you know,
our energy,

289
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,890
our passion,
we want to impress our customers.

290
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
We want them to say,
wow,

291
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,180
is that kind of divine discontent comes
from observing customers and noticing

292
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,051
that,
you know,

293
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:26,600
things can,

294
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,900
so what was the sense that people have
that it's really hard to come with the

295
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,620
answers.
All the answers have already been

296
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,310
discovered in one way or another.
And I think that's not the case.

297
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,360
And I,
I sort of,

298
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,510
um,
I sort of divided things up into

299
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,670
conventions,
which are things everybody knows to be

300
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:45,380
true.
The other extreme,

301
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,530
there are mysteries,
things that nobody can figure out and in

302
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:53,030
between are these things that I call
secrets are things that you could figure

303
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,500
out.
They're hard,

304
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,630
but if you really work at it,
you could,

305
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,790
you could figure something out.
And,

306
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,100
um,
and one one thought that I have is that

307
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,100
there are many secrets left to be
discovered.

308
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,490
I actually think that this is a somewhat
nonconventional view because I think the

309
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:13,920
conventional view is that most secrets
have been discovered and that there's

310
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,470
nothing new to find.

311
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,370
And so,
uh,

312
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,170
and this is certainly is,
it is true,

313
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,730
certainly certain domains,
but I think most things are not like

314
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,980
that.
And I think there are a lot of fields

315
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,910
where new things can be found.
Um,

316
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,240
we're often discouraged by sort of a
version of globalization.

317
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:32,810
We think they're,
you know,

318
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,320
7 billion other people in the world.
And there will always be someone who

319
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,780
will have already thought of it.
And if no one will have thought of it

320
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,570
before us,
it must be almost impossibly hard.

321
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,200
And so it ends up being this sort of
self fulfilling thing where we don't

322
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,430
even try.
And I think,

323
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,990
I do think the only people who will
discover secrets are people who work at

324
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,760
it and who tried doing it.
And I,

325
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,710
I think that many of these,
um,

326
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,130
great companies have something like this
at the core that's,

327
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,170
it's some,
some domain of knowledge,

328
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,720
some area where people think they can
figure out a lot more at,

329
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:04,970
at,
at paypal,

330
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,980
we were very interested in this and the
intersection of money and cryptography.

331
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,980
Could you create a new digital currency
on the Internet?

332
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,330
And um,
and you know,

333
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,870
it was a fairly idiosyncratic field
were,

334
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,190
you know,
small number of people working on it.

335
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:20,024
There's a,
you know,

336
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,240
financial,
cryptography community,

337
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,490
um,
and you could sort of understand the

338
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,070
field you'd get to the frontiers and you
could,

339
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:28,904
uh,
you could,

340
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
you could explore it quite a bit more.
And so,

341
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,270
so that,
that,

342
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,810
so I think the second idea I want to
leave you with is there still is a

343
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,500
frontier left and the frontiers not
infinitely far away.

344
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,200
There's certain places where the
frontier has been close of

345
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,650
geographically it's kind of closed,
but there are many places where you can

346
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,140
still get to the frontier.
And it's actually,

347
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,700
uh,
there are many directions you can go

348
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:53,540
with a frontier as close and where
there's a lot left to be left to be

349
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,230
discovered.

350
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,210
You have developed as at least profile
as a young man in a hurry.

351
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,830
You know,
all the rough elbows at,

352
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,060
you know,
I think it's improved,

353
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,890
if,
how should I put it?

354
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:10,000
Um,
we look at all of the cities and we know

355
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,400
that the transportation systems there
are just not,

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,980
they're not serving everybody's needs.
I mean,

357
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,470
even here in New York with a great mass
transit system,

358
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,540
there are still two and a half million
cars going over those bridges every day.

359
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,220
And so we just believe we can help the
city do better.

360
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,400
I guess most,
most successful entrepreneurs are not

361
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,430
waiting for it to come to their success
and not waiting for progress.

362
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,530
Um,
we are generally a little bit,

363
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,550
um,
forward leaning when it comes to trying

364
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:46,390
to make progress happen.
For me it's about problem solving and

365
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:51,391
loving to solve problems.
And so if you are passionate about

366
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,960
solving problems,
and in some,

367
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,630
sometimes I just like to describe this
as like imagine a really great math

368
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:01,170
professor with no problems to solve,
right?

369
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,050
The great a great math professors,
somebody who,

370
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,010
who wants the hardest problems,
who wants to solve them and love solving

371
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,260
them.
That's Kinda how I feel about my work.

372
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:15,150
And so it's not about a man in a hurry.
It's more about really interesting

373
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:20,070
problems in the world and how do you
lean into them and solve things that

374
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,350
people maybe thought weren't even
possible to solve.

375
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,640
And that's fun.
You know,

376
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,370
for us,
we don't really aspire to be somebody

377
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,650
other than ourselves.
And part of being ourselves as sort of

378
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,990
reimagining the way things could be
done.

379
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:38,260
So we like to take the impossible.
We like to take the old way of doing

380
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:41,350
things and just completely change it.
That's part of who we are.

381
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,860
Um,
but I mean there are great ceos,

382
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:47,020
great founders,
great leaders out there and there's,

383
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,750
there's something to learn from all of
them.

384
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,100
In fact,
there's something to learn from the ones

385
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,590
that aren't great too.
Like again,

386
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,200
you know,
everybody sees success,

387
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,860
they see failure and we see that
personally and we should learn from it.

388
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:02,560
But why not learn from other people's
success and failure?

389
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,760
There's something to learn from all of
them.

390
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,350
I mean,
it depends how you look at it,

391
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:10,150
but when you have sort of this,
this problem solving culture,

392
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,120
uh,
the core group sort of depends on the

393
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,050
problem that's being solved.
And so it's very dynamic what that core

394
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:19,410
group is and on what problem.
Um,

395
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,500
I have 10,
11 direct reports and then depending on

396
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,770
what the problems of the day,
our can determine how many of those

397
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,990
folks are in a particular problem.
And by the way,

398
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:31,000
a lot of problems getting solved that
I'm not involved in.

399
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,450
And so figuring out what,
which ones that you go into,

400
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:36,430
how do you prioritize it?
Um,

401
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,540
how do you get to the future faster?
Is is one of the things we spend a lot

402
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,860
of times sort of architecting

403
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,620
silicon valley and the sort of the state
of Silicon Valley.

404
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Do you think it's at a high point of,
of invention right now or to plateau or

405
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,060
at a low point or,

406
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,780
well,
I think they're jumping off.

407
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,430
It's funny,
it reminds me like I,

408
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:55,881
you know,
look,

409
00:19:55,881 --> 00:20:00,881
I've been an entrepreneur since the mid,
late nineties and I remember in 2001 I

410
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,320
was raising money.
This is the host raising money in the

411
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,590
fall of 2001 for a networking software
company.

412
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,040
And I remember going to one of the,
one of the restaurants in Palo Alto,

413
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:19,400
which used to be bustling and like you'd
have to book,

414
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:22,610
like get a reservation like a month
ahead of time or something.

415
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,470
And it was empty.
It was like tumbleweeds.

416
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,770
And I remember a vc telling me that all
the things that could be invented is

417
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:33,590
2001,
all the things that could be invented in

418
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:37,940
software had been invented and that
there was no more innovation left and

419
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:41,270
software and right.
So that irrational sort of,

420
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,970
there's irrational exuberance and
irrational pessimism.

421
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,070
Uh,
I'm just generally an optimist.

422
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:51,370
I just think there's just problems to be
solved everywhere.

423
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,410
And once you solve them,
you already see what's,

424
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:54,840
you know,
you know,

425
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,810
I'd like to say boredom is only the
result of a lack of imagination.

426
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,110
And you know,
the minute you solve one thing,

427
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:05,560
you just sit down for a few minutes and
then you come up with like 10 more

428
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,150
ideas.
So,

429
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,700
uh,
so I think I'm an optimist.

430
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,920
Like there's just so much more to do.
Um,

431
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:15,190
I think what's very interesting,
and maybe this is because of our global

432
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:20,191
reach and just where we've been is
silicon valley I think has been sort of

433
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,930
the,
the North Star for innovation or,

434
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,250
or,
or the hub of innovation globally.

435
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,520
And I think that is no longer going to
be a thing.

436
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:35,440
I think if we go five years out,
you're going to start to see hubs of

437
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,990
innovation.
This is about to be real,

438
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,840
at least with a couple major ones.
Right?

439
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,070
Yeah.

440
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,110
Was going to ask you one more question.
Was there a time was up,

441
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,370
um,
um,

442
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,100
you're worth a lot of money now.
What's the most expensive thing you've

443
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:46,934
bought?
Hmm.

444
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,180
Well,
I think what a lot of people don't know

445
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,880
is that I've never sold a single uber
share.

446
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,670
So,
um,

447
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,630
the most expensive thing I bought,
I bought before uber started and it's my

448
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:00,464
