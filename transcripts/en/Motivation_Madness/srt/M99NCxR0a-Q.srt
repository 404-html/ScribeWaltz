1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,760
Put God first.

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,700
God first in every thing you do,
everything that you think you see in me,

3
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:28,090
everything that I've accomplished,
everything that you think I have and I

4
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,810
have a few things.
Everything that I have is by the grace

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,400
of God,
understand that it's a gift.

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,910
40 years ago,
March 27th,

7
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,360
1975 it was 40 years ago,
just this past march,

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,060
I was flunking out of college at a 1.7
grade point average.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,810
I hope none of you can relate
at a 1.7 grade point average.

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,640
I was sitting in my mother's beauty
shop.

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,590
They still call it beauty shops now when
they call it now.

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,330
Yeah,
I'll sit in the beauty parlor.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,370
I was sitting in my mother's beauty
pollock and I'm looking in the mirror

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,780
and I see behind me this woman under the
dryer and every time she looked up,

15
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,400
she,
every time I looked up,

16
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,160
she was looking at me,
just look at me in the eye and I didn't

17
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,820
know who she was and I said,
you know,

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,670
she said,
somebody give me a pen,

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,300
give me a pencil.

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,530
I have a prophecy.
March 27 1975 she said,

21
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:26,590
boy,
you are going to travel the world and

22
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:30,610
speak to millions of people.
Am I a flunked out of college?

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm thinking about joining the army.
I didn't know what I was going to do and

24
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:38,050
she's telling me I'm going to travel
there world and speak to millions of

25
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,790
people.
Well,

26
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:44,320
I have traveled the world
and I have spoken to millions of people,

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,530
but that's not the most important thing
to success that I had.

28
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,680
The most important thing is that what
she taught me,

29
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,520
what she told me that day has stayed
with me.

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,510
Me,
since I've been protected,

31
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,940
I've been directed,
I've been correct.

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,010
I've kept God in my life and has kept me
humble.

33
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,850
I didn't always stick with him,
but he always stuck with me.

34
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,050
So stick with them in everything you do.
If you think you want to do what you

35
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,370
think I've done,
then do what I've done and stick with

36
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:18,670
God.

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,780
Number two,
fail big.

38
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,750
That's right.
Fail big.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,290
Today's the beginning of the rest of
your life and it can be,

40
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,580
it's good.
Can Be very frightening.

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,300
It's a new world out there.
It's a mean world out there and you only

42
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:39,050
live once.
So do what you feel passionate about,

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,700
passionate about.
Take chances professionally.

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,880
Don't be afraid to fail.
There's an old Iq test was nine dots and

45
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:54,881
you had to draw five lines with the
pencil within these nine dots without

46
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:59,060
lifting the pencil.
The only way to do it was to go outside

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,920
box.
So don't be afraid to go outside the

48
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,921
box.
Don't be afraid to think outside the

49
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,910
box.
Don't be afraid to fail,

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,260
big to dream big.
But remember,

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,760
dreams without goals are just dreams and
they ultimately fuel disappointment.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,480
So have dreams but have goals,
life goals,

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,810
yearly goals,
monthly goals,

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,660
daily goals.
I tried to give myself a goal every day.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Time is just to not curse somebody out.
Simple goals,

56
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:51,491
but have goals
and understand that to achieve these

57
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:56,030
goals,
you must apply discipline

58
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,360
and consistency
in order to achieve your goals.

59
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:05,240
You must apply discipline which you
already done,

60
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,040
and consistency every day,
not just one Tuesday and miss a few

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,950
days.
You have to work at it every day.

62
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,550
You have to plan every day.
You've heard the saying,

63
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:21,551
we don't plan to fail.
We fail to plan hard work works.

64
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,590
Working really hard is what successful
people do.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,520
And in this text tweet torque world that
you've grown up in,

66
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,650
remember,
just because you're doing a lot more

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,070
doesn't mean you're getting a lot more
done.

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
Remember that just because you're doing
a lot more

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,340
doesn't mean you're getting a lot more

70
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,863
done.

71
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,740
Don't confuse movement
with progress.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,820
My mother told me she,
yeah,

73
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,680
yeah.
Cause you can run in place all the time

74
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:11,190
and never get anywhere.
So continue to strive and can you to

75
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:16,191
have goals continue to progress.
Number three,

76
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,540
you'll never see a u haul behind a
hearse.

77
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,950
I'll say it again.
You'll never see a u haul behind a

78
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,770
hearse.
I don't care how much money you make,

79
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,040
you can't take it with you via Gypson.
[inaudible],

80
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,270
Dryden.
They got robbed as all nate got.

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,090
You can't take it with you and it's not
how much you have.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,650
It's what you do with what you have.
We all have different talents.

83
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,360
Some of you will be doctors,
some lawyers,

84
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,280
some scientists,
some educated,

85
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,300
some nurses,
some teaching.

86
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,080
So I'm preachers.
The most selfish thing you can do in

87
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:10,130
this world
is helps someone else.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Why is it selfish?
Because the gratification,

89
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,190
the goodness that comes to you,
the good feeling,

90
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,310
the good feeling that I get from helping
others.

91
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,290
Nothing's better than that.
Well,

92
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,870
one or two things,
but nothing's better than that.

93
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,900
Not Not Jewelry,
not big house.

94
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,410
I have not cars,
but it's the joy.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,480
That's where the joy is in helping
others.

96
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,170
That's where the success is in helping
others.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,300
Finally,
I pray that

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,640
you put your slippers way under the bed
tonight

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,600
so that when you wake up in the morning,
you have to get on your knees

100
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,883
to reach them.

101
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,170
And why did you win?
While you're down there say thank you

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,040
for grace.
Thank you for mercy.

103
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,100
Thank you for understanding.
Thank you for wisdom.

104
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,160
Thank you for parents.
Thank you for love.

105
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,370
Thank you for kindness.
Thank you for humility.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
Thank you for peace.
Thank you for prosperity.

107
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,910
Say thank you in advance for what's
already yours is how I live my life.

108
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:30,600
That's why I,
why I am one of the reasons why I am

109
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,740
today.
Say thank you in advance for what is

110
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:39,741
already yours.
True desire in the heart for anything

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,800
good is God's proof to you.
Sit beforehand to indicate that it's

112
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,720
yours all ready.

113
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,493
I'll say it again.

114
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,850
True desire in the heart,
that itch that you have,

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,240
whatever it is you want to do,
that thing that you want to do to help

116
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,690
others into,
to grow and to make money that desire,

117
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,820
that itch,
that's God's proof to you.

118
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Sit beforehand or ready to indicate that
it's yours and anything you want,

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
good you can have
so claim it.

120
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,910
Work hard to get it when you get it,
reach back.

121
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,780
Pull someone else up.
Each one.

122
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Teach one.
Don't just aspire to make a living

123
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,440
and aspire to make a difference.

124
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,940
Every failed experiment is one step
closer to success.

125
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,750
You've got to take risks and I'm sure
you've probably heard that before,

126
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,540
but I want to talk to you about why
that's so important.

127
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,543
Okay,

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,800
I got three reasons and then you can up
your iphone

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,673
first.

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,540
You will fail at some point in your
life,

131
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,550
except it,
you will lose,

132
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,090
you will embarrass yourself,
you will suck at something.

133
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,410
There's no doubt about it.

134
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,530
Okay.

135
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,210
I know that's probably not a traditional
message for a graduation ceremony,

136
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,950
but hey,
I'm telling you,

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,100
embrace it because it's inevitable.
And I should know in the acting

138
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,600
business,
you fail all the time.

139
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:27,590
Early on in my career,
I auditioned for a part in a broadway

140
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:30,080
musical,
perfect role for me.

141
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:33,200
I thought,
except for the fact that I can't sing.

142
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,600
So I'm in the wings,
I'm about to go onstage,

143
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,180
but the guy in front of me,
he's singing like,

144
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,730
like,
like Pavarotti.

145
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,930
He's
just

146
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,840
gone on and on and on and I'm just
shrinking and getting smaller and

147
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,030
smaller.
So when you say,

148
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:53,960
Oh,
thank you very much,

149
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,610
thank you very much in it,
you will,

150
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,690
you'll be hearing from us.
So I come out with my little sheet music

151
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,580
and it was,
it was,

152
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,000
uh,
jess,

153
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,990
my imagination by the temptations.
That's what I came up with.

154
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,420
So I hand it to the,
the,

155
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,530
the,
the accompany us.

156
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:10,340
And,
uh,

157
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,830
she looks at it and looks at me and
looks at it,

158
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:13,880
the director,
and he's was like,

159
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,423
hi.

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,530
So I,
I start,

161
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,360
you know,
I'm going to sing.

162
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,213
I'm like,

163
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,260
say again,
can away with me

164
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,220
and then not saying anything.
So I'm thinking I'm getting better.

165
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,280
I started getting into it.
Yes ma'am.

166
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,550
Yeah.

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,060
Rania thank you.
Thank you.

168
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,390
Thank you.
Thank you very much Mr. Washington.

169
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,070
Thank you.
So I assumed I didn't get the job,

170
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,140
but the next part of the audition he
called me back the next party.

171
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,750
The audition is the acting part of the
audition.

172
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,771
You know,
I'm like,

173
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,401
Hey,
okay,

174
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,260
maybe I can't sing,
but I know I can act.

175
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,260
So they pair me with this guy.
And again,

176
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:05,520
I didn't know about musical theater and
musical theater is big so they can reach

177
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:08,130
everyone that all the way in the back of
the stadium.

178
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,290
And I'm more from a realistic,
naturalistic kind of acting where you,

179
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,690
you know,
you actually talked to the person next

180
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,300
to you.
So I the,

181
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:21,870
I don't know what my line was.
My line was will hand me the cup and his

182
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:22,980
line was,
well,

183
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,610
I will hand you the cup.
My idea,

184
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,240
the cup would be there to be handed to
you.

185
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,103
Yeah,

186
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,403
I see,
I see.

187
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,263
Okay.

188
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,453
Okay.

189
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,350
Should I give you the cup back?
Oh yes.

190
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,270
He said,
give it back to me because you know that

191
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:44,840
is my cup and it should be given back to
me.

192
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,070
I didn't get the job,
but here's the thing.

193
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,620
I didn't quit.
I didn't fall back.

194
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,570
I walked out of there to prepare for the
next door edition and the next door

195
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,750
audition and the next door audition.
I prayed,

196
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,700
I prayed and I prayed.

197
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,040
But I continue to fail and fail and
fail,

198
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,510
but it didn't matter because you know
what,

199
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,740
there's an old saying,
you hang around the barbershop long

200
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,090
enough.
Sooner or later you're going to get a

201
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:30,530
haircut
so you will catch a break.

202
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,600
And I did catch a break
last year.

203
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,810
I did a play called fences on Broadway.
If someone talked about it,

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,980
won the Tony Award,
and I didn't have to sing by the way,

205
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,270
but here's the kicker.
It was at the court theater.

206
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,920
It was at the same theater that I failed
that first audition 30 years prior

207
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,010
point is,
and I'll pick up the pace.

208
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,220
The point is,
every graduate here today has the

209
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:15,221
training and the talent to succeed,
but do you have the guts to fail?

210
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,120
Here's my second point about failure.
If you don't fail,

211
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,250
you're not even trying.
I'll say it again.

212
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,920
If you don't fail,
you're not even trying.

213
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:32,030
My wife told me this great expression to
get something you never had.

214
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,150
You have to do something you never did.
Les Brown is a motivational speaker.

215
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,500
He made an analogy about this.
He says,

216
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:43,430
imagine you're on your deathbed and
standing around your deathbed are the

217
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:46,490
ghosts representing your unfulfilled
potential.

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,600
The ghost of the ideas.
You never acted on the ghost of the

219
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:54,290
talent you didn't use,
and they're standing around your bed

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,360
angry,
disappointed,

221
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,280
and upset.
They say,

222
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:01,100
we,
we came to you because you could have

223
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,240
brought us to life.

224
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,210
They say,
and now we have to go to the grave

225
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,370
together.
So I ask you today

226
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,270
how many goals they're going to be
around your bed.

227
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,630
When your time comes,
you go west,

228
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,790
you,
you've invested a lot in your education

229
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,330
and people had invested in you.
And let me tell you the world needs your

230
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:24,530
talents and does it ever,
I just got back from Africa like two

231
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,750
days ago.
So if I'm rambling on it's cause I'm jet

232
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,940
lag.
I just got back from South Africa.

233
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:32,210
It's a beautiful country.
But there are places there with terrible

234
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:35,480
part of it.
Poverty that need help in Africa is just

235
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,570
the tip of the iceberg.
The Middle East needs your help.

236
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,500
Japan needs your help.
Alabama mujer help Tennessee needs your

237
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,330
help.
Louisiana needs your help.

238
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,980
Philadelphia need your help,

239
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,473
the world.

240
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,080
The world needs a lot and we needed from
you.

241
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,720
We really do.
We need it from you young people.

242
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:02,640
I mean I'm not speaking for the rest of
us up here,

243
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:06,480
but I know I'm getting a little grayer.
We needed from you.

244
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:10,080
The young people cause remember this.
So you got to get out there.

245
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,270
You got to give it everything you've
got.

246
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:14,850
Whether it's your time,
your,

247
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:16,320
your,
your talent,

248
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,180
your prayers or your treasures.
Because remember this,

249
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,010
you will never see a u haul behind a
hearse.

250
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,573
Okay,

251
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,250
I'll say it again.
You will never see a u haul behind a

252
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,060
hearse.
You can't take it with you.

253
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,790
The Egyptians tried it
and all they got was robbed.

254
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,130
So the question is what are you going to
do with what you have?

255
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm not talking about how much you have.
Some of you are business majors.

256
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,070
Some of you are theologians,
nurses,

257
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,110
sociologists.
Some of you have money,

258
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,140
some of you have patience.
Some of you have kindness,

259
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,650
some of you have loved,
some of you have the gift of long

260
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,030
suffering.
Whatever it is,

261
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:15,680
whatever your gift is,
what are you going to do with what you

262
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,960
have
right now?

263
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:22,961
Here's my last point about failure.
Sometimes it's the best way to figure

264
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:29,000
out where you're going.
Your life will never be a straight path.

265
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,970
I began at Fordham University as a
premed student.

266
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,460
I took a course called the CARC cardiac
morphous.

267
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,460
I still can't see it.
It's called cardiac,

268
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,860
cardiac morphogenesis.
I couldn't read it.

269
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,840
I couldn't say it,
I sure couldn't pass it.

270
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,840
So then I decided to go into pre law
then journalism and with no academic

271
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,850
focus,
my grades took off in their own

272
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:55,684
direction.

273
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,723
Yeah,
down.

274
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,370
I was a 1.8 gpa one semester and the
university very politely suggested that

275
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,540
it might be better to take some time
off.

276
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,210
I was 20 years old,
I was at my lowest point and then one

277
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,130
day,
and I remember the exact day,

278
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,330
March 27th,
1975 I was helping my mother and her

279
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,820
beauty shop.
My mother owned a beauty shop up in Mt.

280
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,550
Vernon,
and then there was this older woman who

281
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:30,630
was considered one of the elders and the
town and I didn't know her personally,

282
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,450
but I was looking in the mirror and
every time I looked in the mirror I

283
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,760
could see her behind me and she was
staring at me.

284
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,000
She just kept looking at me.
Every time I looked at it,

285
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:43,100
she kept giving me these strange looks,
so she finally took the dry off ahead

286
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,660
and sets to some,
she said something I'll never forget.

287
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,311
First of all,
she said,

288
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:48,900
somebody give me a piece of paper,
give me a piece of,

289
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,210
she said,
young boy,

290
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,260
I have a prophecy,
a spiritual prophecy.

291
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,380
She said,
you are going to travel the world and

292
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:03,110
speak to millions of people.
Now Mind You,

293
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,510
I'm 20 years old.
I'm flunked out of school.

294
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,970
In fact like a wise ass.
I'm thinking to myself,

295
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,730
maybe she's got something in that
crystal ball about me getting back into

296
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:11,570
school next fall.

297
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,350
But maybe she was onto something because
later that summer,

298
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,320
while working as a counselor,
the Ymc camp and Connecticut,

299
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,530
we put on a talent show for the campers
and after the show,

300
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:25,480
another council that came up to me and
ask,

301
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,790
had you ever thought about acting?
You're good at that.

302
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,260
So when I got back to Fordham that fall,
I got in and I changed my major once

303
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:37,261
again for the last time and then the
years that followed just as that woman

304
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:40,270
prophesies.
I have traveled the world and I have

305
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,910
spoken to me,
tons of people through my movies,

306
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,140
millions who up until this day couldn't
see me.

307
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,460
I owe who were up till this day.
I couldn't see while I was talking to

308
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,620
them and they couldn't see me.
They could only see the movie.

309
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,730
They couldn't see the real me.
But I see you today

310
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,800
and I'm encouraged by what I see
and I'm strengthened by what I see

311
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,280
and I love what I see.
One more page and I'll shut up.

312
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,910
Let me conclude with this one final
point and actually the president kind of

313
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:34,200
brought it up.
It has to do with the movie

314
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,660
Philadelphia.
She stole my material

315
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,980
many years ago.
I did this movie called Philadelphia.

316
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,460
We filmed some of the scenes right here
on campus.

317
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,350
Philadelphia came out in 1993 most of
you are probably still in diapers.

318
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,420
Some of the professors too.

319
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,460
That cracked me up,

320
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,890
but it was a good movie you rented on
Nick.

321
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,781
Nick,
what do you call it?

322
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:02,920
Netflix.
It's good movie.

323
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
Renton.
I get 23 cents every time you run it,

324
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,950
please.
True

325
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,333
there.
Rent,

326
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,273
rent,
rent it.

327
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,263
Netflix.

328
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,560
Tell your friends too.
It's about a man played by Tom Hanks

329
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,230
who's fired from his law for him because
he has aids.

330
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,380
He wants to sue the firm,
but no one's willing to represent him

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,480
until the homophobic ambulance chaser
lawyer played by yours truly takes on

332
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:27,950
the case.
In a way.

333
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:31,160
If you watch the movie,
you'll see everything I'm talking about

334
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,860
today.
You'll see what I mean about taking

335
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:38,861
risks or being willing to fail because
taking risk is not just about going for

336
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:42,860
a job.
It's also about knowing what you know

337
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,190
and what you don't know.
It's about being open to people and two

338
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,670
ideas
in the course of the film,

339
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:55,270
the character I play begins to take
small steps,

340
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,020
small risks.
He's very,

341
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:03,880
very,
very slowly begins to overcome his fears

342
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,190
and I feel ultimately his heart becomes
flooded with love

343
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,250
and I can't think of a better message as
we send you off today to not only take

344
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,590
risks,
but to be open to life,

345
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,700
to accept new views,
and to be open to new opinions,

346
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,290
to be willing to speak at a commencement
had one of the best country Becka,

347
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,320
the universities in the country.
Even though you're scared stiff.

348
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:36,150
While it may be frightening,
it will also be rewarding because the

349
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:40,920
chances you take the people you meet,
the people you love,

350
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,270
the faith that you have,
that's what's going to define you.

351
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,260
So members of the class of 2011 this is
your mission.

352
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,830
When you leave the friendly confines of
Philly.

353
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,970
Never be discouraged,
never hold back.

354
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,760
Give everything you got
and when you fall throughout life.

355
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:08,761
And remember this fall forward.
