1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,840
The first thing I'll say is I challenged
that there might be a founder here in

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:13,460
the audience that's going to do
something big.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,800
Um,
it's like the birthday paradox,

4
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,960
right?
Like there's absolutely the chance that

5
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:21,290
someone in this room here today will be
the CEO,

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,830
cto,
founder of like one of the world's most

7
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:28,250
changing companies in the next 10 years.
He live in a really special place where

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:32,090
people get to work on ideas where
failure is tolerated.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,410
If you travel overseas to other places,
there's a reason why silicon valley is

10
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,960
so different and it's because failure is
tolerated.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,930
I realized that I loved doing lots of
different stuff.

12
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:45,410
It's not that I loved technology,
it was that I loved doing lots of

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,810
different stuff.
So I went to boarding school and I was

14
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,460
the guy hanging a,
uh,

15
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:54,290
an antenna outside of my dorm room
window to do a pirate radio station.

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,350
I was designing flyers for dances.
I was deejaying,

17
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,200
like I just love doing a lot of
different things.

18
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:02,570
And when I read the required reading in
school,

19
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:05,090
our junior year was this book called the
new new thing,

20
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,160
kind of the Netscape Saga,
right?

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,010
Um,
I read that and I said to myself like,

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,810
this feels like an area of the world I
can come to and be myself and do lots of

23
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:19,040
different things and see what sticks,
a little schizophrenic and how I treat

24
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,990
different ideas and go from thing to
thing.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,280
But that's kind of the ethos of an
entrepreneur to teach myself ruby on

26
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,540
rails.
And I was like,

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,190
this is going to be a really awesome
skill.

28
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,740
So I learned that,
learned about databases and learned

29
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,200
enough to be dangerous.
And this is one of the lessons in

30
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,380
entrepreneurship is that like,
you don't have to be the best,

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,090
but you have to be dangerous.

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,480
You have to learn just enough to be
dangerous to build an idea,

33
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,080
concept it and show it to the world.
And then it turns out there are lots of

34
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,770
other people including all 170 employees
that work at instagram who are much

35
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:50,540
better at doing all that stuff than I
am.

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,080
But you'd need to find people who can be
drawn to the idea that you build and

37
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,370
then they ended up taking it and make an
even better.

38
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,620
I think everyone's experience is
different.

39
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,060
Everyone in this room has to take the
idea that there is a perfect next move

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,670
and throw it out the window.
There's no perfect.

41
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,660
Next move.
I had the privilege of going to a Marine

42
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,661
base once and talking to marines about
how they plan their next move.

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,340
There's this phrase called bias towards
action.

44
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,600
The idea that you can spend all of your
time thinking about what the perfect

45
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,550
next move is trying to plan.

46
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,400
Am I going to work at Google?
Am I going to work at Microsoft?

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,260
Like which one Mckinsey or Bain,
like the next perfect move and spending

48
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,870
a tremendous amount of time trying to
figure that out.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,390
The marine say you can spend all the
time you want,

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,700
but by the time you figured it out,
you're dead.

51
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,690
So like sometimes you need to make a
tradeoff of what is the action I can

52
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:48,950
take with the appropriate amount of
information and risk to move because

53
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:53,900
moving and progress is what gets us to
the next step by moving and learning.

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,900
It all adds up.
That summation of your experience over

55
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:01,060
the last 10 years is what makes you into
the thing tomorrow that will be

56
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,960
successful.
All the other jobs that I had offered,

57
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,820
there were like two or three,
a couple at a startup,

58
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,680
one at Microsoft and Google.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I took the lowest salary of anyone,
any of the offers that I had because I

60
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,690
wanted to work in a specific job at
google.

61
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,930
I didn't care what job it was actually.
I just cared that it was at Google and I

62
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:23,550
would surround myself by amazing people.
That was the first lesson that I learned

63
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:27,500
is like go to where the people are short
term longterm tradeoffs.

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,180
Just go to where the people are.
Being at Google and going to Corp Dev

65
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,740
was an interesting move because I was
like,

66
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,500
I want to be nurse startups again.
I learned a lot about startups in

67
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,300
school,
but I want to be back in the startup

68
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,410
world and then 2008 happened and I'm not
sure how many people remember 2008 in

69
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,300
this room.
The economy kind of went to crap.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,980
I remember looking at my boss and being
like,

71
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,610
okay,
so like,

72
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,050
can we buy this company is like,
nope,

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,210
can we buy this company note one of
them,

74
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,760
and I won't even name the name,
but it was a really interesting company.

75
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,800
Ended up doing really well.
I wish we had purchased it,

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,740
but the thing is he was like,
we're actually not going to do many

77
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,590
deals now.
You should probably just go golfing and

78
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,190
for like a 20 something year old
thinking to themselves like I want to

79
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,740
make a difference in the world and your
boss is telling you to go golfing.

80
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:10,741
Like maybe I should just leave.
So I did and I actually,

81
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,610
there's a chapter in between Google and
Bourbon that not many people know about,

82
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:19,370
but I ended up joining a startup of some
ex Google folks called nextstop.

83
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,780
Hugely transformational for me because
it's where I cut my teeth,

84
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,660
learning to program,
learning to build a site and everything

85
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:29,620
I learned in that year at next stop
before starting bourbon was actually

86
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,320
like,
it made me ready to go do bourbon.

87
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:35,110
So again,
every move you think needs to be

88
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,330
perfect.
It turns out just like surround yourself

89
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,270
by great people where you can learn the
most and great things will happen.

90
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,610
But I didn't go golfing and that's rule
number two.

91
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,000
I never know I will be able to survive
for 20 years.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,010
So I call myself like a blind man.
Riding on the back of a blind tiger for

93
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,900
20 years.
Survived to today,

94
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,470
Stu surviving that.
We want to make this company lost 102

95
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,990
years.
So we finished only 16 years.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,790
There are 86 years ago.
You started in 1999 because in China

97
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,990
everybody wanted to be make company for
last 100 years that this become a

98
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,970
slogan.
Nobody take it too seriously.

99
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,800
So if you want,
if you want to give,

100
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,130
you know,
the KPI to your people should be very

101
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:22,570
specific and people know it's a serious
100,

102
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,120
two years that we were born in 1999.
Alibaba,

103
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:28,920
so will last a century.
We had a one year and this central one

104
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,950
to have a winder years,
next century,

105
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,870
one year,
100,

106
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,120
two crossroads centers.
So very specific.

107
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,230
So we're in our company.

108
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,350
We never talked to your succeed,
successful or not because we think

109
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,020
they're 86 years,
next 86 years.

110
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,220
There are many chance that failed.
So that's why we say don't talk about

111
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,680
your successful.
Eighty six years later we'll talk about

112
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,880
it and this is something we know how to
make this thing happen.

113
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,180
So I think generally I'm a positive,
but nectar two or three years maybe have

114
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,930
problems.
People say,

115
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,980
well anticorruption this,
but think about anticorruption and rule

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,870
by law is laying a great foundation for
the market.

117
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,710
Common economy.
You don't want to go to business by

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,140
bribery.
You don't want to have an unfair

119
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,610
environment.
The market Kami is by rule by law and

120
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:23,611
market economy is very clear,
transparent and fair and I think this

121
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,680
year does here bad,
but this is why we need

122
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,790
entrepreneurship.
This is why we need the business to

123
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,570
drive the economy.
So I'm the positive and people when

124
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,720
people worry,
I'm happy when people too happy.

125
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,680
I started worrying because.
And I don't worry about the things the

126
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:47,540
president is worried about,
worry about the things that nobody worry

127
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:52,490
about and this is the opportunity.
So I'm positive because I'm not,

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,710
I'm not positive,
but I'm not stupid.

129
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,800
I know you have a problems,
but you have to solve the problems.

130
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,930
They by little and um,
that's it.

131
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,960
Play one game a little bit with me for
just a minute.

132
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:08,961
I'd like for the moment
to have you have you pretend I've made

133
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:13,770
you a great offer and I've told you that
you could pick any one of your

134
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:17,100
classmates and you now know each other
probably pretty well after being here

135
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,020
for awhile.
You can take 24 hours.

136
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,270
If they got all burned,
you can pick any one of your classmates

137
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,710
and you got 10 percent of their earnings
for the rest of their lives.

138
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,010
I asked you what goes through your mind
in determining which one of those you

139
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,620
would pick.
You can't pick the one with the richest

140
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,700
father.
That doesn't count.

141
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:36,534
I mean,
you've got to,

142
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,500
got to do this on merit,
but you probably wouldn't pick the

143
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,860
person that gets the highest grades in
the class.

144
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,420
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with getting the

145
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,930
highest grades in the class,
but that,

146
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,210
that isn't going to be the quality that,
that sets apart a big winner from the

147
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:53,430
rest of the pack.

148
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,040
Uh,
think about who you would pick and why.

149
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,770
And I think you'll find when you get
through,

150
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760
you'll pick some individual.
You've all got the ability,

151
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,070
you wouldn't be here otherwise.
You've got the energy.

152
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,953
I mean,
you've got,

153
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,103
you know,
the,

154
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,650
the initiative is here,
the intelligence is here,

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,480
but some of you are going to be bigger
winners than others.

156
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,710
And it gets down to a bunch of qualities
that,

157
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,990
uh,
interestingly enough,

158
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,850
our self made.
I mean,

159
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:23,010
it's not how tall you are is not where
he can kick a football,

160
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,620
60 yards.
It's not whether you could run the

161
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,630
hundred yard dash 10 seconds,
whether the best looking person in the

162
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:31,200
room.
It's a whole bunch of qualities that

163
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:33,880
really come out of Ben Franklin or the
boy scout coater,

164
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,600
so whatever it may be,
I mean it's,

165
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:38,370
it's,
it's integrity is honesty,

166
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:41,130
it's generosity,
it's being willing to do more than your

167
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:41,650
share.

168
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,850
It's,
it's just all those qualities that are

169
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,670
self selected and then if you look on
the other side of the ledger,

170
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:51,330
because there's always a catch to these
free gifts and Jeannie jokes.

171
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,690
So you'll also have to,
and this is the fun part,

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,430
you also have to sell short one of the
your classmates and pay 10 percent of

173
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,770
what they do.
So who do you think is going to do the

174
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:05,070
worst in the class?
This is way more fun and think about it

175
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,830
again and again it isn't.
It isn't the person with the lowest

176
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,750
grades or anything.
Anything of the sort.

177
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,340
It's the person who just doesn't shape
up in the character department.

178
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,370
We look for three things when we hire
people,

179
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:19,120
we look for intelligence,
we look for in,

180
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,240
for initiative or energy,
and we look for integrity and if they

181
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,600
don't have the ladder,
the first tool will kill you because if

182
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,040
you're going to get somebody without
integrity,

183
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,110
you want them lazy and dumb.

184
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,010
You don't want them to.
You don't want a smart and energetic.

185
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
So,
uh,

186
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,300
is that third quality.
But everything about that quality is

187
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,310
your choice.
You know,

188
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,390
you,
you can't change the way you were wired

189
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,300
much,
but you can change a lot of what you do

190
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,910
with that wiring.
When you write down the qualities of

191
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,820
that person that you'd like to buy to 10
percent of.

192
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,230
Look at that list and ask yourself,
is there anything on that list?

193
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,810
I couldn't do the answers.
There aren't.

194
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,980
There won't be.
And when you look at the person,

195
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:03,420
you're so short and you look at those
qualities that you don't like,

196
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,890
if you see any of those in yourself,
you or whatever it may be,

197
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,560
selfishness,
you can get rid of that.

198
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,480
I mean,
that is not ordained.

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,630
And uh,
if you follow that,

200
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,340
you and Ben Franklin did this and my old
boss Ben Graham did this at early ages

201
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,040
and their young teens,
they just been granted looked around and

202
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,090
he said,
who do I admire,

203
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,420
you know?
And he wanted to be admired himself.

204
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:27,990
And he said,
you know,

205
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,480
why do I buy these other people?
And he said,

206
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,360
if I admire them for these reasons,
maybe other people would hire me if I

207
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
behave in a similar matter.
And he had,

208
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,140
he decided what kind of a person he
wanted to be.

209
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,180
And if you follow that at the end,
you'll be the person you want to buy 10

210
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:42,961
percent of.
I mean,

211
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,390
that's the goal at the end.
And it's,

212
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,090
it's something that's achievable by,
by everybody in this room.

213
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,430
Learning to tell a story is critically
important because that's how the money

214
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:57,250
works.
The money flows as a function of the

215
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,310
stories.
And what are the critical things I would

216
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,970
encourage you to learn that's way more
important,

217
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,180
important in my world and anything else
is how to ask a question because you

218
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:15,571
want to have the person comfortably
telling you what he thinks is important

219
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,720
so that you get for a long time.
We don't understand the product or the

220
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:26,380
market well.
We're listening so we have learned to

221
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:31,381
string questions in a way that provides
the entrepreneur with a way to explain

222
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,760
what he wants to do,
how long it's going to take,

223
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,540
who the competition is,
how much money he needs,

224
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,320
without feeling threatening for many of
the investments we've made.

225
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,840
We didn't understand the answers,
but we constantly work on developing the

226
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,080
questions.
