1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,920
So here's a little issue we have in
America today.

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,450
Um,
there are currently about 250,000 people

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,960
a year who are dying in our hospitals
due to,

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,700
uh,
due to preventable deaths.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,440
And I'm not talking about negligence,
I'm talking about little accidents,

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,790
right?
Um,

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm talking about the doctor in the
morning,

8
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:35,680
not properly briefing the doctor for the
evening.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,370
You know,
I'm talking about things that you,

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,710
you know,
we can't sue anybody.

11
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,810
There's nothing,
there's nothing that we can see that's

12
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:44,320
wrong,
but there's 250,000 preventable deaths

13
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:47,320
every year.
That's about 27,

14
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:52,321
40 sevens going down every single week.
That's what's the equivalent to,

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,450
and the confusing thing is that we have
the best doctors in the world.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,350
We have the most advanced technology in
the world.

17
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:04,720
Some of the medical equipment we have is
the best in the world.

18
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,390
The medicines we have are the best in
the world.

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,730
So you start asking yourselves,
why are these things happening?

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,730
And the reason is not because of any of
those things,

21
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:16,270
the reasons are actually something
vastly more simple and something very,

22
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:20,920
very human.
5% of hospital administrators or

23
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:23,890
doctors,
most of them are number crunchers.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,540
Hospitals are run like businesses.
Hospitals are run by the numbers.

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,080
And the problem isn't the people who are
giving the care,

26
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:35,260
they're very highly trained.
The problem is the way those people are

27
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,080
cared for.
Because what we've done is we've created

28
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:41,800
cultures in hospitals where the people
who were doing the caring aren't cared

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,590
for.
And so all of these little preventable

30
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,760
deaths are happening because they don't
feel like they're a part of anything.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
They're just doing their jobs and they
don't get along that well.

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,270
And there's not a lot of camaraderie.
And the impact is death.

33
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,450
Right?
Now I use this example because it's

34
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,140
exaggerated because the impact is so
powerful.

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,280
But the problem is the same in our own
companies,

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,250
right?
Which is we come to work and were told,

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,190
you must care for your clients.
You must care for your customers.

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,170
You must make them the focus of all you
do.

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,650
And yet why aren't the people who are
managing us from the top caring about

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,710
us?
So yes,

41
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,300
in a hospital,
the impact is worse,

42
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,600
but the impact that we're having on the
outside world is just as bad.

43
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,250
In other words,
we're not working at our best.

44
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,990
We don't care for the things we're
doing.

45
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,510
We're not helping each other is the most
important part.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,490
And the residual impact is that we are
unfulfilled by the work that we do and

47
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,140
when were unfulfilled by the work that
we do,

48
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,480
we focus on the details,
and when we focus on the details,

49
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,590
we retract from each other.

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,240
When we track from each other,
we feel lonely.

51
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,820
And when we feel lonely,
cancer goes up.

52
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,950
Heart disease goes up,
diabetes goes up.

53
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,420
In other words,
by going to work,

54
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:52,900
we're killing ourselves.
Literally.

55
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,720
There's another study that was released
not that long ago that says,

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,300
uh,
parents who work late.

57
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,370
The negative impact that it has on their
children is little to none.

58
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
They may feel guilty as parents,
but the negative impact that it has on

59
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,830
the raising of their children is little
to none.

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,220
However,
parents who come home from jobs they

61
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,300
hate or don't love,
their kids are more likely to be bullies

62
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,790
at school.
And now you think about the bullying

63
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,070
epidemic we have in America,
right?

64
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,850
Where there's this disturbing number of
young children who are killing

65
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,510
themselves,
suicides because of bullies.

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,080
The problem is not the schools and the
problem isn't even the parenting.

67
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,530
The problem is the jobs the parents
have.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,450
This is the importance and this is the
power of the work that we do and the

69
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,480
places we go to work,
right?

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,670
Most of us,
I mean like if you listen to the,

71
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,061
the,
the,

72
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,710
the uh,
the unemployment statistics,

73
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,720
they say,
you know,

74
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,350
we're all time high,
record high,

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
nine to 10% unemployment,
right?

76
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:55,751
And people go,
oh my God,

77
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,970
that's terrible.
And I hear that number and I go,

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
well,
that means 91% still have a job right?

79
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,571
Now,
granted,

80
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,580
we want to get that employment number
up,

81
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,860
but that means 91% is still going to
work.

82
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,310
The question is how many of them coming
home fulfilled by the work that they do

83
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,070
and how many of them are waking up
inspired to go back to work the next

84
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,530
day?
If we don't love our works,

85
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,580
we don't look out for each other.

86
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,200
And if we don't look out for each other,
we feel lonely.

87
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:19,810
If we don't feel lonely,
all these negative things happen.

88
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,940
So what example can I share with a
creative audience about how to change

89
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,490
this?
The United States Marine Corps,

90
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,630
I had the great honor last week of
spending a week with the marines.

91
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:35,770
I spent a couple days at camp lagoon and
then I went for a few days to,

92
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,870
um,
Paris island to watch them go through

93
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,800
bootcamp.
And this isn't a race.

94
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,730
It's a remarkable,
remarkable human experiment that they're

95
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,250
doing.
And even though they know what works,

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,350
they don't know why it works,
but they don't need to know why,

97
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,210
because they know that it works,
right?

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,120
But what's happening is they're taking a
group of strangers,

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,810
people who don't know each other,
who are showing up and within a very,

100
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,650
very short period of time,
learn to trust each other so much that

101
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:02,020
they would give their lives for each
other.

102
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
Right?
And we know everyone,

103
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,920
sort of,
anyone who's ever worn a human form

104
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,590
knows that no one runs into battle for
God and country.

105
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,200
It doesn't happen.
It's for the guy to the left of me and

106
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,960
the guy to the right of me.
That's the reason they do what they do.

107
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,510
Right?
And these sort of remarkable stories of

108
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:20,980
heroism where people rush into very,
very dangerous situations to save

109
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,470
others.
And they always ask the question,

110
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,360
why did you do it?
Why would you risk your life?

111
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,850
Why would you put yourself at risk for
them?

112
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,450
And the answer's always the same because
they would do it for me.

113
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,820
In other words,
what gives him the confidence to put

114
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,940
themselves at great risk is the
knowledge that someone would do the same

115
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,180
for them.
We would put ourselves at great risk for

116
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:43,210
our companies if we knew that our
companies would put themselves at great

117
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:46,510
risk for us,
but they don't.

118
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,020
So we don't.
Now,

119
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,780
one of the things that's remarkable
about the marines,

120
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,950
and if you go read and you know this is
the most I asked these young and 2122

121
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,620
years old,
some of these are these lance corporals,

122
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,250
the grunts,
you know the guys,

123
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,380
the infantry,
I mean this is the lowest of the low.

124
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:06,980
The ones we actually send into battle,
the front lines and I asked them,

125
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,810
are you misunderstood in America?
And they said,

126
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,430
yes unanimously.
They all nodded.

127
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,330
I said,
what?

128
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,670
What did people think of you?
And one stood up and says,

129
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,680
they think we're baby killers.
I said,

130
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,390
how does it feel?
He says,

131
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,430
it hurts.
And when I say,

132
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,340
well,
tell me a story then that captures to

133
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,430
you what it means to be a marine.
The feeling you have of being a marine.

134
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,610
Tell me a story that captures it and I
expect it to hear stories of I took a

135
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,720
hit and somebody saved me or I ran into
a firefight can pull somebody.

136
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,650
I expected these stories of heroism,
not a single story like that came out

137
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,230
and I'm sure those stories exist,
but those aren't the tall the stories

138
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,630
they told me that capture what it means
to be a marine.

139
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,830
One of the stories they told me was a
young boy in Afghanistan who would come

140
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,090
around every morning and sell kabobs to
the marines and then one day he showed

141
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,540
up and he was all beaten up and he
didn't go to his parents for help and he

142
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,110
didn't go to his friends to help.
He came to the marines for help because

143
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:05,111
he trusted them more than anyone else.
They told me a story that captured how

144
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:10,010
they feel of a civilian edge that had
been overrun by the Taliban and the

145
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:12,710
residents of the village could,
couldn't go home because they would be

146
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,680
killed by the Taliban and so they were
just living by the river.

147
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,480
The problem was winter was coming and
one of the uh,

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,860
the elders came to the marines,
knocked on the door and said,

149
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,230
I need you to come down to the river and
kill us.

150
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,480
And the marines said,
what are you talking about?

151
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,400
He says,
if we go back home will be killed by the

152
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,210
Taliban and if we stay out there,
we're going to die slow deaths this

153
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,040
winter.
It's easier if you just come and kill us

154
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,370
please.
The marines overran the Taliban village,

155
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,300
push the Taliban out.
A year later they went back to this

156
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,840
village and people were playing
volleyball.

157
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,390
These were the stories they told me that
capture what it means to be a marine.

158
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,470
They believe in doing good for others
and the fulfillment they get when they

159
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:58,310
put themselves at risk so that others
may prevail is overwhelming.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,570
This is not unique to the Marine Corps.
This is all human beings.

161
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,890
The feeling of fulfillment comes from
doing something for another.

162
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,710
The feeling from fulfillment comes from
the exertion of time and energy for

163
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:16,070
someone else.
If you are walking to work and you

164
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,680
throw,
throw a few pennies in a cup and you

165
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,420
come to work and you say to your
friends,

166
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,790
hey guys,
I gave a dollar to somebody homeless

167
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,650
this morning,
what are your friends going to say?

168
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,290
A good,
right?

169
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,140
I gave 20 bucks to somebody homeless.
They'd be like,

170
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,000
ah,
good for you.

171
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,230
Right?
What have you come in in the morning?

172
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:34,701
You say,
Hey,

173
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,490
I gave up my Saturday and I went and
paid and as painted a school in the

174
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,320
inner city,
people go,

175
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,000
Whoa,
cool,

176
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,350
wow,
cool.

177
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,230
And all of a sudden,
not only are they inspired to do

178
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:49,160
something good themselves,
but the feeling that you have persists.

179
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,550
The amazing thing is that when we do
good for others,

180
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,290
that actually inspires others to do good
for others.

181
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,320
This is provided for us,
it to logically,

182
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,160
anthropologically it's all part of the
survival of the species.

183
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,660
You know,
sex feels good,

184
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,540
so that will do it.
So we can procreate and perpetuate the

185
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,150
species,
but we're social animals and so we have

186
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:12,060
to provide for the fact that we'll
maintain strong buns and build cultures.

187
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:13,680
Right?
Because that's what humans do.

188
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,530
We're cultural animals.
And so when we do good for others and we

189
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,320
look out for those in our tribe,
we look out for those in our group.

190
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,410
It actually feels good biologically.
It releases oxytocin.

191
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,160
This chemical that's released when you
do good for others is released and it

192
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:27,780
makes you feel good.
And the amazing thing is the more

193
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:31,050
oxytocin you have in your body,
the more you want to do good for others.

194
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,480
The problem is we've replaced this
feeling,

195
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,220
the exertion of time and energy with
digital communications.

196
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,600
We've replaced it with headphones,
we've replaced it with money,

197
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,030
right?
Think about the invention of money,

198
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,490
right?
It used to be money.

199
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,750
You know,
it used to be like you go to someone's

200
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,920
house,
you cook them dinner,

201
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,910
and the deal was they'll do the dishes,
time and energy exchange for time and

202
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,770
energy.
And someone said,

203
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,500
I'll give you an Iou,
right?

204
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,510
Someone says,
I don't feel like doing the dishes,

205
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,720
so I'm going to give you an Iou that I
promised to do them another day,

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
right?
And that's what money is.

207
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,760
It is the promise for future goods or
services,

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
the promise of future goods and
services.

209
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,140
In other words,
we've replaced our own time and energy

210
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,530
with promises for someone else to do it
another day.

211
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,390
Right?
In other words,

212
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:22,050
there's no exertion of time and energy.
And so the feeling people get is that I

213
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,420
did something for you and you did
nothing for me.

214
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,050
You replaced it with a piece of paper,
with an Iru,

215
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,180
with a promise for future goods and
services.

216
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,820
The way we find fulfillment is by doing
good for others.

217
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:35,070
So how did the marines it,
how do you get people to do good for

218
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,230
others?
We all know this intellectually.

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,690
We know that it's good to do good for
others,

220
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:42,930
but why don't we do it then why don't we
do it?

221
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,710
And what the Marines learned is
something that I completely did not

222
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,140
expect.
They kinda just yell at these guys to

223
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:51,060
help each other.
That's not what happens.

224
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,030
There's a few things that they have to
do first.

225
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,690
So we all heard of the obstacle course,
right?

226
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,250
The marines have a thing called the
obstacle course and this is where they

227
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,490
build anaerobic strength and aerobic
strength,

228
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,860
muscle strength,
and it's timed and all of this good

229
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:05,610
stuff.

230
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,440
They have another course called the
confidence course and it's never timed

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,910
and most of the obstacles on this course
cannot be completed by yourself.

232
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,530
They must be completed in teams.
You have no choice.

233
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,460
That's just how it's designed and what
they say is the first two weeks of

234
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,250
bootcamp.
Everybody's there to outdo each other

235
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,710
and prove that there's strong.
Just kind of like when we start on a

236
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,490
job,
we're proof.

237
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,500
We want to show how great we are.
We'll work a little harder,

238
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,210
we'll do good work.
Look how good my design is,

239
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,400
right?
It's all about us and how good we are,

240
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,950
right?
But they keep putting them in situations

241
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,540
where they can't do things by
themselves.

242
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,080
And what starts to happen very slowly,
they said after about two weeks,

243
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,960
they start cheering for each other.
Now they get in trouble when they do,

244
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,400
but they start cheering for each other
and then before too long you see them

245
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:55,401
organically start helping each other and
what happens is if there's one person

246
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,810
who's weak and refuses to help each
other,

247
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,740
the others,
or even if there's one person who's

248
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,790
strong,
who's,

249
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,350
you know,
I was the star college athlete and they

250
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,270
get to every,
the end of every obstacle and they just

251
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,700
stand there and wait for everybody to
finish and they don't help each other.

252
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,820
What starts to happen as organically,
the group starts to ostracize that

253
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,260
person organically.
They get ostracized until they learn

254
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,330
that the only way that they will get
through this thing,

255
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,810
they only way they will survive bootcamp
is if they ask for help because they

256
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:22,570
have no option.
The problem is no one will help them

257
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,140
until they're willing to help another.
It's the deal we have to make.

258
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,380
It's called vulnerability and risk.
We have to take the risk to make

259
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,670
ourselves vulnerable.
Yes,

260
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,370
you might do something for someone else
and they may not do something back for

261
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,930
you.
That's the risk you run.

262
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,180
That's the risk you run.
It's not about,

263
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,390
it's not about giving everything to them
and and sort of huge,

264
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,320
big,
overwhelming risk.

265
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,790
It's about little things and little
things.

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,560
It's like going on a date,
right?

267
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,330
He's like,
if I went on a date with somebody,

268
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,470
I came home and I said,
uh,

269
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,380
I'll have to one day,
and I said,

270
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,843
I'm marrying her.

271
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
They'd be like,
what?

272
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,750
Are you nuts?
I'd be like,

273
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm in love.
They're like,

274
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,170
but you're here.
This is crazy.

275
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,090
I'm like,
I know I'm in love.

276
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,530
She feels the same way.
We both know it's nuts right now.

277
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,970
You know that you're going to be like,
go on a couple more dates.

278
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,570
Right.
We know instinctively that the strong

279
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:18,550
bond that's created that that needs to
be created first takes more than a week,

280
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,960
right?
We know that.

281
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,420
Right?
But if I've been dating somebody for

282
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,860
seven years and we haven't,
you know,

283
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,661
married,
you'd be like,

284
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,650
dude,
what is wrong?

285
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,060
Right?
In other words,

286
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,450
we know that it takes more than seven
days and we know that it takes less than

287
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:36,160
seven years.
The problem is we don't know how long it

288
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:39,160
takes.
Somewhere in the middle.

289
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,180
All human bonds are the same.
Like when you show up at work,

290
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,100
when you show for the first time,
when you're new,

291
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,280
don't expect that people will look out
for you and they won't expect you to

292
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,480
look out for them in seven days.

293
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,720
It won't happen.
But if you can working at a job for a

294
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,150
few years and you don't have the
[inaudible] sort of the,

295
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,010
the absolute confidence that if you turn
your back,

296
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:58,780
you will not get stabbed.
You can rely on somebody,

297
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,520
you can give them something.
Nothing will go wrong.

298
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,620
You will share the credit.
No one will throw you under the bus if

299
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,780
you don't have that in a few years,
something's wrong,

300
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,050
something's wrong.
I don't know how long it takes,

301
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,450
but I know that's more than a week and I
know it's less than seven years,

302
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,380
and the marines fundamentally understand
that before anyone is willing to put

303
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:20,140
themselves out for another,
they have to have self confidence,

304
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,160
real self confidence.
You have to be confident in yourself and

305
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,070
your own ability before you're willing
to help another.

306
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,710
If you're insecure at all about your own
ability,

307
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,330
it's an oxy.
It's sort of a paradox,

308
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:31,960
right?

309
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,940
How am I,
how can I overcome my confidence?

310
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,650
You know,
my self confidence and we all have ego

311
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:36,790
issues at all times.
You know,

312
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,020
we all do,
right?

313
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,350
But if I'm not confident in myself,
I won't help another.

314
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a paradox because then we need
someone to look out for us before we're

315
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,200
willing to help our peers,
right?

316
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,120
This is what management is supposed to
do.

317
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,760
The drill instructors,
the school they are,

318
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,320
there are parents.
They're there for one reason and one

319
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:58,670
reason only to help us feel strong and
good about ourselves.

320
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,420
But look at the way we talk to each
other.

321
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,630
A look at the look.
A budget's been cut and so what do you

322
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,180
get told?
I need you guys to do more with less,

323
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,380
right?
That's what we're told.

324
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,570
Hey guys,
I need you guys to do more with less.

325
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,250
That's what it told by our clients,
by our bosses,

326
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:10,700
by our parents.

327
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,570
This is what we're told,
right?

328
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,640
That's like your parents telling you
when you're young.

329
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,330
I know you're stupid.
Figure it out.

330
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,890
Right?
You're not as smart as the other kids.

331
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,220
What do you want me to do?
Right?

332
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,040
It's the exact same thing.
I need you to do more with less,

333
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,500
right?
What we need to be telling people is I

334
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,320
need you,
I need you to do more with what you

335
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,270
have,
right?

336
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,400
You have capacity,
you have strength,

337
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,800
you have talent,
you have compatibility.

338
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,080
I need you to do more with what you
have.

339
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,490
We don't celebrate what we've got.
We criticized for what we don't have.

340
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,200
This is the responsibility of management
to take us under their wing and help us

341
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,201
understand our own value to ourselves.
Close your eyes and think back to high

342
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,951
school and think of that one teacher who
took you under their wing and cared for

343
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:07,940
you and looked after you and helped you
realize that you are capable of more

344
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,210
than you thought you were and you and
you.

345
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:14,870
You probably are the person you are
today in some part because of that

346
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,580
person,
right?

347
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,090
Do you have that name?
What's the name?

348
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,660
Tell me the name.
Tell me the name of the teacher.

349
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,400
Okay,
give me the name.

350
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,130
Okay,

351
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,770
we can,
I can point to anybody and you can tell

352
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:29,610
me that name.
Now,

353
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,680
tell me the names of all the other
teachers you have that day.

354
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,430
Can't remember them.
Kenya.

355
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,880
This is the power of those who teach us
confidence.

356
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,450
We will literally carry their names
around with us for the rest of our

357
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:44,050
lives.
Wouldn't you want to be that person?

358
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,750
Wouldn't you want to be the person that
20 years from now,

359
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,190
30 years from now,
40 years from now,

360
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:51,730
I can do this exercise with somebody and
they will tell me your name.

361
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,360
Yeah.

362
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,100
This is the power of helping others
realize their own strengths.

363
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,130
This is what management and leadership
is supposed to be doing.

364
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,990
They're supposed to be caring for us and
helping us realize our own value.

365
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,630
And by the way,
if you have anybody who reports to your

366
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:11,540
work for you,
your responsibility is not to make them

367
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,540
meet the deadline.
You're responsibility is not to make

368
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,130
sure that they do.
As you say,

369
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,370
you're responsibility is to make sure
that they understand their own

370
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,870
strengths,
their own value,

371
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,920
and that they are way,
way more talented than they think they

372
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,470
are.
And the only way they will learn that is

373
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,990
that you put them in situations in which
they can fail.

374
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,440
And you hold them and you support them
and you give them talent and you give

375
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,530
them skills and you'd give them
education and you watch their backs and

376
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,270
if they fall over,
you encourage them to get back up.

377
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,070
And if they follow the,
you character them to get back up.

378
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,140
And if they fall over,
you encourage them to get back up until

379
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,320
they figured out themselves cold
confidence.

380
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,140
It's your responsibility to help others
find it to others.

381
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:51,210
Responsibility to help you find yours.
And the amazing thing is as soon as you

382
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,890
start feeling confident in your own
ability,

383
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,750
you're naturally help each other.
That's what happens.

384
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,030
It's called trust in the military.
They give medals to people who were

385
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:06,210
willing to sacrifice themselves so that
others may gain.

386
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,460
In business,
we are willing to give bonuses to people

387
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:12,500
who will sacrifice others.
So that we may gain,

388
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,680
we have it backwards and then we
complain about how we don't love our

389
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,590
jobs and we complain about how the work
is suffering and we can plan about how

390
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:24,560
budgets are being cut and we can
complain and complain and complain and

391
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,460
the first thing we do is blame each
other and become more selfish and

392
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:31,940
worried about my pay and my benefits and
my this and this is what happens when we

393
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,280
are unfulfilled.
We look at the metrics and we say

394
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,050
they're not good enough.
When we are fulfilled,

395
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,840
we don't care about the metrics.
This is why when you have a job you love

396
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,510
and you get a call that says,
I'll offer you tons more money in great

397
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,740
benefits you like,
I'm not interested,

398
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm not interested,
I'm not interested.

399
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,810
I'm very happy here,
but we'll give you more.

400
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,650
That's not the reason I'm here.
I'm here because I love it.

401
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,850
I'm here because I care for the people I
work with and I'm here because the

402
00:18:55,851 --> 00:19:00,851
people I work with care for me.
This is the world I imagine.

403
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,560
Yeah,

404
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,440
this is the world I imagine.
And here's the great thing.

405
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,650
If you take little risks,
I'm not talking about big things,

406
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,590
little things.
If you start doing little things for

407
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:16,120
each other,
the amazing anthropological response is

408
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,910
other people will start doing little
things for others too.

409
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,660
I was walking down the street two days
ago and a guy's backpack was open at a

410
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:26,770
whole bunch of paper,
fell out as he's walking down the street

411
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,220
and I happened to be behind him.
And so my friend and I just sort of,

412
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,860
we were in mid conversation and in mid
conversation we never even stopped

413
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,030
talking.
We just bend down,

414
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:36,250
sort of helped him gather his papers.
I hadn't them back to him,

415
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:38,650
sort of pointed out that his book bag
was his,

416
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,360
you know,
his backpack was unzipped and he said

417
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,051
thanks.
And we walked down.

418
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,940
It was like no big deal,
right?

419
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
We get to the end of the street and we
stand at the that we are waiting to

420
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:48,430
cross the street.
We're still talking,

421
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:52,600
we haven't stopped talking and the guy
in front of us turns to us and says,

422
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,750
I saw you help that guy.
That was really cool.

423
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,370
But here's what's great about that.
The guy will go do something for someone

424
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:06,910
else simply because he saw us bend down
and pick up paper for someone else.

425
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,970
He will actually go do something for
someone else because of it.

426
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,620
Right?
He,

427
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,950
he won't give to charity because I,
he sees me put a dollar in a cup,

428
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,660
but he will actually help someone
because he saw someone also helps

429
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,210
someone.
Little things hold a door open for

430
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:23,950
someone.
Say thank you to the person holding the

431
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,870
door open for you.
Smile to the Barista.

432
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:28,520
Little little things,
you know,

433
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,090
put your foot in the subway when the
door is closing.

434
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:33,550
So someone who's running,
we'll make it hit the open at the,

435
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:34,810
at the elevator.
Don't go

436
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,740
or pretend you didn't.
See that's the best one,

437
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,740
you know.
Uh,

438
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,560
I didn't always,
I wouldn't if I saw sorry.

439
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,030
Alright,
do it a little time and a little energy

440
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,160
and you'll find around work that people
give a little time and a little energy

441
00:20:57,161 --> 00:21:00,460
back to you and you'll give a little
more time and a little more energy.

442
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,840
You go for coffee with someone,
then you go for a two hour coffee and

443
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:07,480
you go for a coffee and a lunch.
Then you go for lunch and a dinner.

444
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,330
Then you go for a dinner and a movie,
and then you sleep over,

445
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,790
and then he'd sleep over two nights and
then you go on holiday together and

446
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,440
eventually you get married.
Right?

447
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,510
It's slow.
It takes time.

448
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,490
And we can't rush it.
You know,

449
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,990
if when we rush it,
it's all fake.

450
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,490
Do things for others and watch.
Watch how much others do for you.

451
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,740
But you know,
you go get yourself a cup of coffee from

452
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,380
the coffee shop machine in the morning,
make one for someone else.

453
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,200
It takes a little extra time.
It takes a little extra energy.

454
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,660
That's the point.
That's the point.

455
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
And here's the best part.
You will feel so good at the end of the

456
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,730
day.
So good.

457
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,573
Thank you very much.

458
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,980
[inaudible]

459
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,710
it's a great question.
How do you convince someone,

460
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:00,331
how do you know,
said,

461
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:02,200
what are the metrics?
How do you convince a skeptical audience

462
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,000
of this trust metric?
Um,

463
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,550
you don't,
you don't,

464
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,070
right?
You can't twist anybody's arm to do

465
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,700
something that they don't want to do.
And you know,

466
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,250
the law of diffusion,
which I obey,

467
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,720
you know,
as hard as that,

468
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,600
as much as I can,
which is you don't need the majority.

469
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,820
You need those people who believe what
you believe.

470
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:22,654
In other words,
if you buy,

471
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,590
if you,
you know,

472
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,840
when you go sort of,
when you do some nice things for people,

473
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,080
they may not do something nice back
because they may be,

474
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,290
you know,
we live in a world in which you do

475
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,440
something for somebody.
They think you want something from them.

476
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,150
Right?
That's unfortunately the society we've

477
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,700
created.
But,

478
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,620
but that's the risk that we keep taking.

479
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,010
And I'm not saying you should keep doing
it for somebody who keeps doing nothing

480
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:43,570
and keeps sort of,
you know,

481
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,390
crapping on you because of it.
Then at some point you have to be like,

482
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,860
all right,
my bad,

483
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,001
my bad.
Right.

484
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,050
And you back off.
You know,

485
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,110
I don't believe in helping everyone.
I do not believe in it.

486
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,640
Right.
Um,

487
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,750
this is not,
you know,

488
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,550
let's do good for everyone in on the
planet.

489
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,370
That's not what I'm talking about.
Mother Teresa,

490
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,830
who is the poster child for giving
selflessly to all who need at the end of

491
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,570
her life,
started questioning the existence of God

492
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,480
and by the way,
hated her life serious.

493
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,010
Okay.
In other words,

494
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:14,011
giving to others unabashedly is actually
self destructive.

495
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,540
It doesn't help.
Right.

496
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,110
And it's just like going on dates with
people you don't like,

497
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,070
doesn't mean you'll eventually click in.
Right.

498
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,860
There's,
there's only one machine that I found

499
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,610
that really accurately measures trust
better than any other sort of metric.

500
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,700
It's called the human being.
It's really good at it.

501
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,700
Right?
And so those feelings,

502
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:42,610
you get trust them.
And one way or the other,

503
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,620
you know,
it's the little risks.

504
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,710
It's the butterflies,
it's the,

505
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm unsure.
You know,

506
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,920
it's the,
it's the backwards with the dance.

507
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,450
It's dating,
it's the dance.

508
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:51,360
It's the nerves.
Like I,

509
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,300
you know,
it's that.

510
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,450
So if there were,
if there are cynical bastards at your

511
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,710
office who,
who are,

512
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,970
who,
who don't get it,

513
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,870
ignore,
ignore him,

514
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,120
don't worry about it.
Because eventually you'll get enough.

515
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,030
And those people either come along or
leave or be pushed out,

516
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,950
you know,
ostracized.

517
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,140
Remember when the group starts helping
each other,

518
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,300
they ostracize the ones who refuse to
help,

519
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,650
whether they're strong or whether
they're weak,

520
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,460
they get ostracized until they learn,
until they learn that they cannot

521
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,980
survive without the help of others.

522
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,340
And they learn that the only way others
will help them as if they,

523
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,130
if they help the others.
Right?

524
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,950
The order matters.
The order matters.

525
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,450
I'll just,
I just thought of something that,

526
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,410
that sort of is pervasive in our sort of
digital world.

527
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,000
Uh,
the order matters,

528
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,280
you know,
so to speak honestly about what you

529
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,120
want,
right?

530
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,880
If you are doing,
don't do things for people when you want

531
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,130
something from them,
just ask them what you want from them.

532
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,500
And I'll give you one little example.
It's a funny little example.

533
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,380
We've all received emails that go like
this.

534
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,680
Dear Simon.
Well you wouldn't get an email to their

535
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,880
assignment,
but I dear,

536
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,780
insert your name right.
Dear Simon.

537
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,130
Um,
haven't seen you in years.

538
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,410
Hope you're well,
congratulations on all you've been

539
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:04,970
doing.
It's really amazing.

540
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,770
We should get coffee sometime.
If you could do me a favor,

541
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,470
I'm,
if you could vote for me on this

542
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,750
website,
I'm hoping to win,

543
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,220
you know,
some thousand dollars prize for my

544
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:16,731
design,
blah,

545
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,564
blah,
blah.

546
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,180
Hope you're well.
Talk to you soon Kenny.

547
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,490
Right?
We've all received an email like that

548
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:27,440
and how do we respond to it
right now?

549
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,780
What happens if you get the same email
that goes like this?

550
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,280
Dear Simon,
I'm hoping you could vote for me on this

551
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,390
website.
I'm trying to win some thousand dollar

552
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:39,650
prize for my design.
I haven't seen you in years.

553
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,890
I hope you're really well.
Congratulations on all that you've been

554
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,420
doing.
We should get a coffee sometime.

555
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,870
Thanks Kenny.
Totally different.

556
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,930
In other words,
when we know why you're emailing and it

557
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,240
comes first,
it has a remarkable impact.

558
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,260
We know that all those pleasantries are
just buttering us up to get to what they

559
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:58,540
want,
right?

560
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,410
But if you come right out with what you
want,

561
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,160
we're actually very grateful for the
pleasantries,

562
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,510
right?
It's the same thing in human

563
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:08,060
interaction.
Don't give someone a cup of coffee.

564
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,390
If you need a favor back,
just ask them for the favor.

565
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,140
It builds trust.
I can't trust you.

566
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,240
Every time you do something nice for me,
I think you just something what you

567
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,074
want,
something from me,

568
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,110
I won't trust you and this is what
companies do to us,

569
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,460
right?
When we did this for you,

570
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,650
why won't you do this for us?
That's not how it works.

571
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,080
Generosity,
bending down to pick up the papers,

572
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:31,280
holding the door open for someone is
expecting nothing in return ever.

573
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,160
You do not give,
you know,

574
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,850
this is what happens in new business,
right?

575
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,180
We beat new business is built on
relationships and so we build the

576
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,260
relationship,
build the relationship,

577
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:41,570
build the relationship until we're
comfortable to ask for the business.

578
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,430
In other words,
you were only befriending till the point

579
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:48,150
you felt that I would let down my guard
and you could ask me for something the

580
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:48,870
whole time.

581
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,230
You were just waiting for that time.
It doesn't work that way.

582
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,270
If you actually want to build
relationships,

583
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:59,271
you build relationships without wanting
anything and that's how you build trust.

584
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,210
You want to know why the marines gave me
this incredible access?

585
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,710
I mean literally they said,
Simon,

586
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,240
anything you want to see,
you got it.

587
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,830
Anything you want to do,
you got it.

588
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,290
You can go.
We went past sign that said no

589
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,330
observers,
no civilians beyond this point.

590
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm like,
can I take pictures of like,

591
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,620
go ahead.
You should see some of the pictures.

592
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,330
They're unbelievable,
right?

593
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm like right in their marines coming
at me.

594
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,570
We went out to the crucible and we're
all like,

595
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,640
you know,
they're like rolling in the dirt and

596
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,470
like,
you know going under barb wire and I'm

597
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:29,850
like,
I'm not joking either.

598
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,640
They're like,
you know,

599
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,960
unprecedented access access that
journalists would be jealous of.

600
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,320
Do you know why they gave it to me?
Because in all the time that I've been

601
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,660
visiting with marines and having
meetings with them,

602
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,450
I've never asked for anything.
I don't want anything and I don't have

603
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:47,580
anything to sell.
I just keep showing up and say,

604
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:48,540
what do you need?
How can I help?

605
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,030
And at some point they said,
when I called him and said,

606
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,940
I need a little favor cause they know I
haven't been waiting for the favor.

607
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,980
It's the time now that I have a little
favor.

608
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,270
They go absolutely whatever you need.
It's called human relationships.

609
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,490
Companies don't do business with
companies.

610
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,280
People do business with people.
You know,

611
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,830
your company didn't win.
Ibm as a client,

612
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,920
somebody who likes somebody said,
we'll hire you.

613
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,720
And if they didn't like you,
they're just,

614
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,040
you know,
they're,

615
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,030
they're,
they're playing roulette.

616
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:15,841
Well,
we're betting that,

617
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,640
you know,
this whole workout,

618
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,730
those are the weak relationships.
Yes.

619
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,970
The more we give,
the more it inspires others to give,

620
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,210
but the more selfish we are,
the more others become selfish around

621
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,250
us.
And so those are organizations in which

622
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,940
selfish behavior prevails.
And so we see the residual effects,

623
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:39,000
which is they make decisions that
ultimately screw us.

624
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,480
They destroy our economy because of
their selfish behavior.

625
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:42,750
Right.
We know this is what,

626
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,830
what,
what happens?

627
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,120
Same in politics,
right?

628
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,130
Um,
uh,

629
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,190
and the answer is don't worry about it.
I know it sounds silly and you said you,

630
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,760
you,
I mean your first question is do I talk

631
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,400
about these things to them?
I will talk to anyone who will listen,

632
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,330
you know,
but I don't talk to people who don't

633
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:03,300
want to listen.
The good news is there are some good

634
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:08,250
eggs and there are some of them who've
had conversions where they were the

635
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:11,730
bastards who believe in firing people in
screening people to advance their

636
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,710
careers and something happens.

637
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,380
I just met a guy recently,
he was a very senior executive at very,

638
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,650
very large company and something
happened and he like,

639
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,530
he got like hitting the head or
something and he realized,

640
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:25,140
holy cow,
I have to look after people.

641
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,780
Right.
And they become obsessed with it and

642
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:31,260
they start sticking their necks out and,
and we just need those champions

643
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,540
scattered around.
And this is what I do.

644
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:36,510
The more I spread this message,
the more sort of it's,

645
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,560
it's kind of like,
um,

646
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,811
you know,
in the,

647
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,950
in the cartoons you sort of,
the whole of justice,

648
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,730
you know,
that the message goes out and they all

649
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:43,451
sort of like,
you know,

650
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:44,440
wherever they are.
Like,

651
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,760
you know,
that they'd poke their heads up.

652
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:48,190
It's that kind of thing.
The more we talk about it,

653
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,130
the more we put it in our work.
The,

654
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,370
you know,
because don't forget you're going to

655
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:54,760
help someone who goes home feeling good
and their husband or their wife works in

656
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:57,320
the bank and they're going to talk how
much about they love to,

657
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,710
and that might inspire that person.

658
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,320
You know,
it's,

659
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,200
it has all of these residual impacts
that,

660
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,370
that we don't really know.
This is the funny thing about the

661
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,410
Internet,
which is we're so proud of the internet

662
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,880
that we can measure everything.
No,

663
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,040
you can't.
You can only measure one layer.

664
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,420
Right.
So for example,

665
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:10,871
we say,
Simon,

666
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,210
what's the impact you're having?
I don't know.

667
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
Is The answer right?
I know it's,

668
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,480
it's,
I know that it'll take more than a

669
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,560
weekend.
I will take seven years,

670
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,820
but I don't know when it's going to
happen.

671
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,080
And I don't know how it's going to get
there.

672
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,770
Right?
All I can do is,

673
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,470
is do it right.
But I have no clue how or when.

674
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,560
And so for example,
I can measure book sales and I can

675
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,600
measure how many hits.
And I can measure how many people have

676
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:34,060
watched a ted talk and all of this.
But I can't measure,

677
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,870
you know,
that Ted talk being shown to a room of

678
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,840
50 people and one of those 50 people
doesn't buy a book,

679
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,120
doesn't watch a Ted talk,
doesn't do anything but goes out and

680
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,110
does something good for somebody else.

681
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,500
I have no way of measuring that.
And so we're so proud of the internet

682
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,070
and its ability to measure everything.
But we're measuring one layer where we

683
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:53,410
used to measure no layers.
It's like,

684
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,120
you know,
this is how people work.

685
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:55,530
It's,
it's,

686
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,010
it's Gossamer,
you know,

687
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,960
it's networked.
Um,

688
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,670
and so the answer is don't worry about
them.

689
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,180
Don't worry about them.
Worry about the people who you can care

690
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,470
for,
who you can give to.

691
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,540
And when we reach a critical mass in
society,

692
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,220
it will tip,
right?

693
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,310
And if you don't believe me,
the reason it is the way it is now is

694
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:15,310
because it tip the wrong way.
There was no such thing as massive

695
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:17,320
layoffs as,
as business strategy prior to

696
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:19,570
[inaudible] in the 1980s.
It just wasn't done.

697
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:21,550
It was done here and there,
but it wasn't strategy.

698
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,510
The idea of using layoffs to balance the
books is a relatively new phenomenon

699
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,810
that came for the increase of
selfishness in the Gordon Gekko greed is

700
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,110
good.

701
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,070
1980s,
boom.

702
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,910
Right?
Um,

703
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,440
and uh,
this was also the same exact period,

704
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,360
the 1980s,
where the theory,

705
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,940
the theory of shareholder value was put
forwards,

706
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,620
right?
Because they had all of these people

707
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,440
buying large companies and installing
professional managers to run the

708
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,540
companies that they bought,
that they invested in and they had a

709
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,490
problem,
which is those professional managers

710
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,700
were paid for by the company and those
professional managers cared for the

711
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,950
employees and the customers.
And so the investors said,

712
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:56,230
how do we protect our investments?
We've got an idea,

713
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,220
we're going to give them equity in the
company and bonus them based on the

714
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,020
performance.
Right.

715
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,000
And so the shift happened where the ceos
started caring more about the investors

716
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,590
and stop caring about the customers and
employees.

717
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,820
Those with theories introduced by some
Harvard professor in the 1980s.

718
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,510
We can push it back the other way,
right?

719
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,220
We can push it back the other way.
Um,

720
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,280
but we just have to,
and there's just a,

721
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:22,170
there's a,
there was a,

722
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,590
uh,
just the other day.

723
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,660
Which company was it?
Uh,

724
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,750
one of the large banks where the
shareholder is Citibank.

725
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,000
Citibank,
yeah.

726
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,500
Citibank.
The shareholders voted majority

727
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:36,310
shareholders voted against a fat pay
package.

728
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,950
That's unprecedented.
It has never happened even in hard

729
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,660
times.
Even when the company is doing this,

730
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,310
the shareholders just,
it's just sort of a,

731
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,680
uh,
a cursory thing where they approved the

732
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:49,400
$15 million bonus for the CEO.
They voted against it.

733
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,030
It's non binding,
but it sends a shot across the bow

734
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,090
saying shareholders now want you to be
bonused if you do something good for

735
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:01,100
others,
even if the others is us.

736
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,450
Right.
The point is,

737
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:10,451
is that it's starting to crack.
And so let's just stick our finger in

738
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,350
the crack,
you know,

739
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,470
make sure that it keeps cracking.
It swung one way.

740
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,300
We can swing it back.
The question was,

741
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:20,360
can I talk about celebrating
accomplishment while still asking for

742
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,380
more,
right.

743
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,910
Um,
to,

744
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,350
to so,
so,

745
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,250
um,
they did a study on kids who are really,

746
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,170
really smart,
like an older gifted classes.

747
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,370
Why is it when you're smart,
you're gifted?

748
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:32,270
When you're stupid,
you're special.

749
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,104
Why is that?

750
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,510
I was told my whole life I was special.
It's not never gifted.

751
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,810
Um,
uh,

752
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,290
they took the gifted kids who are
constantly told,

753
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,940
you're so good.
Oh,

754
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,530
thanks for that.
I knew you'd do well.

755
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,393
Oh,
you're the,

756
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,780
you're our best employee.
You know,

757
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,400
you're best student.
You're awesome.

758
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,590
Right?
And what happens is later in life they

759
00:33:56,591 --> 00:34:00,030
actually suffer because they're very
afraid of taking risk because they're

760
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,930
very afraid of losing their position on
the Mantel.

761
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,110
Okay.
Kids who were sort of more average,

762
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,600
who constantly are rewarded,
not for their accomplishment,

763
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,730
but for their effort,
great effort,

764
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,920
really proud of the improvement you
made.

765
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,190
What they find is they do very well in
life because there's no shelf.

766
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,720
There's always more.
There's more effort,

767
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,260
right?
And so you want to reward and

768
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:27,910
acknowledge effort.
Even if they don't hit the goal,

769
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:29,770
it's that the delta.
But at the same time,

770
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:30,970
if it goes backwards,
you'd be like,

771
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,110
dude,
what's going on?

772
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,070
It was like,
we don't get,

773
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,290
we shouldn't be giving ribbons for
everyone who competes,

774
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,750
right?
Because what we're teaching people is if

775
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:40,300
you do nothing,
you get a medal,

776
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,460
right?
And the funny thing is,

777
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,610
is we start,
we're creating a generation that's

778
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,990
feeling very hollow and feeling,
you know,

779
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:50,830
this sense of entitlement that people
complain about Gen y the entitlement is,

780
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,270
I don't feel like I've accomplished
anything.

781
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,850
And the funny things about human beings
is we,

782
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,550
we,
the,

783
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,550
the way we feel accomplished is when we
exert energy and time and reach a

784
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:02,470
destination,
right?

785
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,350
And the more energy and time that we
have to suffer through,

786
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,560
especially if we suffer together and we
get somewhere,

787
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,070
it is overwhelming.
Think about the best jobs you've ever

788
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,840
worked on.
Was it the best design?

789
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,610
Was that the best results that the
company had because of your,

790
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,660
your project or was it an absolute hell
project that you worked together and you

791
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,240
came out on the other end and that you
got it done at the deadline and you're

792
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:27,010
like,
that was amazing.

793
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,910
It was the hell projects.
It was the things that we had to go out

794
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,730
of our ways more,
do things for each other,

795
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,290
right?
Things we weren't thinking of doing.

796
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,820
I was wrapping packages I was doing that
aren't designers on supposed to do

797
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,863
going,
you know,

798
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
this is what produces that,
right?

799
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,730
And so the,
the,

800
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:45,211
the,
the,

801
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,670
the thing is about measurement and
destination reward.

802
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:50,460
Imagine we're standing in a big empty
room,

803
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,370
right?
And we're standing in one corner and I

804
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:57,750
give you a simple instruction.
I want you to go to that corner in a

805
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,470
straight line,
right off you go.

806
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,410
No big deal,
right?

807
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,840
Without telling you,
I slip a chair in front of you.

808
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,660
What do you do?
You go around the chair.

809
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,120
Now you just disobeyed what I told you
to do.

810
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,740
I told you to go to that corner straight
line.

811
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,110
But this is the amazing things about
human beings,

812
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,180
which is when we're given a clear
destination,

813
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,560
we use our own creativity and our own
sense of innovation and our own problem

814
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,650
solving abilities to overcome obstacles
to get to the destination.

815
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,450
In other words,
the destination is more important than

816
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,920
the root,
right?

817
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,860
We are flexible about the route.
We are obsessed with the destination

818
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,020
reset.
We're standing in the corner together

819
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,630
and I give you a simple instruction.
Go somewhere in this room,

820
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,520
in a straight line,
and you say to me,

821
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:36,151
well,
where do want me to go?

822
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:36,984
I'm like,
I dunno,

823
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,190
you're smart.
Figure it out.

824
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,950
Go on a straight line.
And so you pick a point and you start

825
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,380
walking and without telling you,
I put a chair in front of you and what

826
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,780
do you do?
You come to a grinding halt and I say,

827
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:46,530
what'd you stop for?

828
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:46,891
You Go,
well,

829
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:50,100
you put a chair in front of me or you'll
make a sudden turn,

830
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm going in another direction,
right?

831
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,390
And this is the problem.
It's the same obstacle.

832
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,880
The differences.
When you have a clear set of clear

833
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,970
destination,
the obstacles become easy to overcome.

834
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,730
When you don't have a clear destination,
you keep coming to a grinding holt.

835
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:05,730
And what we do in our companies is we're
counting the steps we're taking along

836
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,020
the route,
but we're never looking at the

837
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:08,220
destination,
right?

838
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:10,770
So companies has made $1 million this
year.

839
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,110
We were only planning on making 800,000
is like we took 10 steps.

840
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,600
We only planning on taking eight.
Where are you going?

841
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,040
No clue,
right?

842
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,740
We count the steps.
And so the point is,

843
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:22,530
is that people want to feel that the
effort that they're exerting actually

844
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,110
are moving somewhere.
And so successful measurement,

845
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:27,780
successful recognition is not just for
the steps you take.

846
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,110
It's not just for the effort,
it's that the effort you exerted moved

847
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:32,850
us closer to where we're trying to get
to.

848
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,490
And that get two should be some crazy
ideal.

849
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,970
My ideal is to live in a world in which
the vast majority of people wake up

850
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:42,630
every single morning inspired to go to
work and fulfilled by the work that they

851
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:43,620
do.
And the,

852
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,660
the,
the couple of measurements that I use

853
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,520
are,
if the book is selling.

854
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,241
And I,
by the way,

855
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:49,440
people ask me,
how many have you sold?

856
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,110
I have no clue.
I've never asked the publisher because

857
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:54,870
they don't care.
I really don't care how many I sold.

858
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,490
What I care about is the Amazon rankings
and that those are going steady or up

859
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,460
and not plummeting because that means
other people,

860
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,050
right?
Cause I don't have a publicist and I

861
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,550
don't have a marketing strategy on
purpose.

862
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,890
I didn't hire one of those companies to
sell the book for me.

863
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,290
And the reason is,
is because I'm not interested in book

864
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,060
sales.
I'm interested in the spreading of an

865
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,250
idea.
And so I just used that as a metric to

866
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,070
help me understand,
am I sort of marching in the,

867
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,650
because the more I preach,
is it resonating?

868
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,230
You know?
And so you have a couple of these

869
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,370
imperfect measurements that help you
understand are you going along the way?

870
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,210
So it's not just great effort.
Look what you achieved because that's

871
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,800
what we're doing now,
right?

872
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:36,801
Our goal is to increase top line
revenues by $50 million for what reason?

873
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,550
Right?
Which is we have to know the

874
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,580
destination,
and then we say,

875
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,770
amazing.
You took us that much closer.

876
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:47,170
And if we go to the right,
it's because we were overcoming an

877
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:49,900
obstacle.
If we hadn't gone to the right,

878
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,060
we would've been stuck forever.
Thank you.

879
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,910
You know,
it's not always straight lines.

880
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,600
It's not always straight lines,
but it's in one direction.

881
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,630
She's pulling the cane out.
Thank you very,

882
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,464
very much.

883
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.
