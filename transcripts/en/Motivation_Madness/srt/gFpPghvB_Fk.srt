1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,450
Be Open to experience,
be willing to try new things.

2
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:17,451
Don't have a rigid plan except random
acts of hospitality without judgment or

3
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,510
fear.
Don't be afraid to wander.

4
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:24,510
Don't be afraid to eat a bad meal.
You know,

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,330
if you don't risk the Bab Neil,
you'll never get the magical one,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,660
but are the most important to be humble.
Be grateful.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,700
Be Aware of the fact that you are
probably the stupidest person in the

8
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,580
room as far as you were the least
prepared,

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,600
at least equipped person to know who's
really in charge of what's really going

10
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,800
on.
I think I made maybe before I started

11
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,320
traveling,
I thought that the human race as a whole

12
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:51,210
or you know,
could,

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,420
could and would turn on itself at any
moment.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,310
You know,
Venal petty,

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,520
cruel,
arbitrary,

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,170
and it's true with all of those things
exist in this world,

17
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:06,171
but I need mostly pretty nice people
doing the best they can.

18
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,640
Often under very,
very difficult conditions.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,280
I met a lot of very nice people who've
done very,

20
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:15,030
very bad things that conflict with my
deeply held

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,590
conceptions of justice or sexual
equality or acceptable practice or

22
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,640
religious views.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,073
Um,

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,130
a lot of gray areas in travel,
um,

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,380
but I think that on balance
the world is filled with people doing

26
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:38,690
the best they can,
you know,

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,920
we love their kids and you know,
would like to,

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,900
you know,
put on a clean shirt every morning and

29
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:48,560
live their lives in the little dignity
and have access to food and water.

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,870
Hope.
I'm

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,790
just like everybody else.
Uninhibited.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Creative freedom is something that I've
been incredibly fortunate to have for

33
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,290
the better part of my entire television
career.

34
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,980
Unlike anyone else I know of in
television.

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,500
I've been free to do whatever I want to
make the shows I want,

36
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:16,640
anywhere I want,
with whom I want it in any style I want.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,100
So I,
at first I don't know any other way and

38
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:26,150
by now I won't have it any other way.
Life is good.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,930
Why settle for less?
And by the same token,

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,880
when you're given that much freedom and
you're,

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,960
you have essentially no interference,
nothing but support behind you.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,740
Um,
what you don't want to do is get lazy

43
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,500
and bored and sloppy.
To me,

44
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:53,501
I'd much rather not make tv at all or
make even unsuccessful tv that make

45
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,540
competent television.
You know,

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,230
it's very easy to make a conventional
travel or food show at this point.

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,970
It's,
it's like shooting corn.

48
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,971
It's the same shot sequence at the same
sort of limited a terminology.

49
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,390
Uh,
you know,

50
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,750
how all of their little pieces work
where you have to start and where you

51
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,130
have to add.
Um,

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,030
I detest competent workman like
storytelling and I'm always very,

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,250
you know,
the Times that we,

54
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,430
we,
we do that.

55
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,350
I'm,
I'm very unhappy with that.

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,080
I'd rather I'd rather fail.
Now.

57
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,660
I've been fired many times by in my
cooking career.

58
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,970
Uh,
I've been fired a number of times.

59
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:44,971
I was not a particularly good chef.
I had a lot of problems at various

60
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,810
points in my career with narcotics.

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,363
Um,

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,830
I was very deservedly a fired on a
number of occasions.

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,373
Um,

64
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,990
but I mean if you're talking about
failure,

65
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,750
you know,
I accepted failure as a chef because I

66
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,320
was at various times a bad chef or even
a bad person

67
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,440
these days.
If I fail,

68
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,220
it's because I tried to do something and
did not succeed or I,

69
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,990
I just was not able to do,
uh,

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,870
what I hope to do or wanted to do.
Or maybe I tried to do something that is

71
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,730
clearly in retrospect didn't work,
but I would much rather than that I

72
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,420
would much rather fail gloriously then
not venture,

73
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,763
not try.

74
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm not in,
as I said before,

75
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,990
I'm not interested in,
in competent making,

76
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,060
telling,
telling stories with,

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,750
with competence.
I'm looking at them with some style and

78
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:06,591
originality and some creativity that is
interesting to me and the people I work

79
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,690
with
and there have been times that,

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,440
that,
that has resulted in failure,

81
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,420
a beating.
It didn't work.

82
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,390
It didn't communicate anything like what
I wanted to.

83
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,390
Often the story I think I'm going to get
ends up being another story entirely

84
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:29,391
that's even better.
We're very different.

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,510
That's good.
But there are other times where I just

86
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:34,321
failed miserably,
you know,

87
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:37,980
I tried to do with cecily shell again
and it was not good.

88
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,080
It did not capture the place.
It did not,

89
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,430
didn't show us anything of value.
It,

90
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,540
it did not live up to its subtlety and
beauty of its subject.

91
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,680
Um,
and then there are,

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,560
there are shows where some people are
just going to hate it.

93
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,400
They just don't like the style.
They think it's self indulgent.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,590
They don't get it.
But that's kind of failure.

95
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,424
I like

96
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,673
no,

97
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,670
a powerful reaction one way or the
other,

98
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,040
uh,
infinitely preferable to me than

99
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,340
pleasing everybody.
If you,

100
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,860
if every.
If I walk into a room where everybody

101
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:16,120
agrees with me,
I find that frightening and dismayed and

102
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,100
pouring.
It's fucking my answer.

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,390
That question stems from my history is
an addict.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm a lot of other addicts look in the
mirror every day and did not see

105
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:33,231
somebody worth saving.
Even at my worst,

106
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,670
there was a level of vanity.
I guess I look in the mirror and saw

107
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:42,210
somebody who,
somebody deep in there,

108
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:45,120
regardless of how low I was,
my circumstances,

109
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,020
I had a high enough opinion of myself
that I thought,

110
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,613
um,

111
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,250
it's worth going forward.
I think a lot of people in a similar

112
00:06:56,251 --> 00:07:00,740
situation for whatever reason,
look in the mirror and see somebody

113
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,610
unworthy of good things
and allow themselves or excuse

114
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,970
a downward spiral because they don't
really believe

115
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,220
in their basic work I did.
You know?

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,240
So that's vanity.
I think it's the same drive that allows

117
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,680
me to tell stories in books and on tv
because let's face it,

118
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:36,681
anybody who writes a book or ged with
the notion that they have a story worth

119
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,040
telling that people might want to listen
to.

120
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,700
You're really already by definition now
as sort of an aberrant personality and a

121
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:48,300
monster of self regard.
This is a very reasonable attitude.

122
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,770
I have a unique,
I have a story that you will want to

123
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:57,300
listen to for 10 minutes.
Why would any reasonable?

124
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,660
And I might make a living doing that.
So you might even want to pay for that

125
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:03,480
story.
To the point that I could make a living

126
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,750
doing that rather than washing dishes
or,

127
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,530
or,
or preparing meals

128
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,240
that's not normal.
That takes something and I don't know

129
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,300
whether that's,
you know,

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,760
that's often a very much at odds with,
with,

131
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,400
you know,
being a functioning well rounded good

132
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,120
person in the conventional sense,
uh,

133
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,820
that kind of vanity and narcissism,
self regard,

134
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,910
self importance and cheerful willingness
to examine your and share your feelings.

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,893
No,

136
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,770
I think Fran Liebowitz said at one
point,

137
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,551
you know,
you know,

138
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,890
if you're,
if you're sharing your feelings,

139
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,990
you don't need that.
It's not sharing that's leaking.

140
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,540
When that book came out,
it was immediately a best seller and it

141
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,150
changed my life overnight.
Overnight.

142
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,920
I was desperately and debt
hadn't paid my rent on time.

143
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Ever
had owed Amex for 10 years without

144
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,660
making a single payment owed.
The irs hadn't even filed,

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,880
was in very,
very,

146
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,881
very insecure place.
At Age 44.

147
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Suddenly people were offering me things,
offering the opportunities.

148
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,280
I think if I did,
I was old enough and I fucked up enough

149
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,890
already that I just said,
you know,

150
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,150
I realize this is a lucky break,
was unlikely to get another,

151
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,310
so I'd be very careful.
Choices

152
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,500
in that environment was very determined
to not fuck up.

153
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,540
Oh,
I didn't go for easy money.

154
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,660
I didn't grab the first thing.
I did not

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,080
give food,
network the show they wanted

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,100
and I said no a lot.
So what seemed like a lot of money.

157
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Well look what's good for you in the
short run is not necessarily good for

158
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:05,294
you in the long run.

159
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,170
You know you're starting out as a
writer.

160
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,230
You've written one book and somebody got
a TV show and somebody offers you a

161
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,740
million dollars to represent that
antidiarrhea medication.

162
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,230
Well,
that's a lot of money in the short run,

163
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,430
but you're always going to be that guy
with the shits.

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm admittedly,
I'm a very contradictory impulses here.

165
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,020
I'm,
I'm old school and a lot of ways I think

166
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:38,760
you should at least know how to make
beef Bourguignon correctly according to

167
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:43,500
the original recipe.
To the degree that anything can be

168
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,120
authentic,
uh,

169
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,530
you should know how to,
you know,

170
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,740
some dishes to me,
like a conduit or a traditional Italian

171
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,710
pastas.
I get really pissy if people riff on

172
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,101
them,
you know,

173
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,490
you put chicken in a carbon,
are you lost me,

174
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:07,491
it's unforgivable sin against God.
But on the other hand,

175
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,603
you know,

176
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,190
you know,
the guys who came out of Blues and R and

177
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:14,960
B,
uh,

178
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,040
who turned out to be Jimi Hendrix,
you know,

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,740
there are people who can riff on and
improvise on classics and create whole

180
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,060
new,
wonderful worlds.

181
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,630
And what is authentic is mostly meaning
the city.

182
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,490
When the tomato is not authentic Italian
and it came from the new world of

183
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,910
Chinese food is always evolving.
So it was protective.

184
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,140
It instinctively hostile to new as I can
be a.

185
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I know too many really creative chefs
and I understand the changing world.

186
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,950
Is it pleasurable,
I guess is the benchmark for the.

187
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,790
If you're going to mess with a classic,
are you making something more dazzling

188
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,770
that says,
look at me and how smart I am?

189
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,970
Or are you in some way improving?
It is it pleasurable?

190
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,710
Is it chicken Caesar more pleasurable
than a plain Cesar?

191
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,900
I think not.
I think the chicken takes away,

192
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,810
but that's my opinion.
I'm relentlessly,

193
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:17,260
pathologically a punctual,
I think.

194
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,480
I think that comes from all those years
as a chef that is a,

195
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,840
more importantly,
as a cook,

196
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,380
you know,
can you showed up late as a cook?

197
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,840
You're letting your people down in a
very tangible way.

198
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,730
Somebody else has to physically do the
work,

199
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,730
do the setup,
or you lose the shift or you get fired

200
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,830
as a chef cooks and showed up late who
are disorganized.

201
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,350
You couldn't keep a lot of stuff going
on in their heads.

202
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,980
They failed and when they fail,
we all went down with them.

203
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,640
So I am a relentlessly,
you know,

204
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,910
possibly either unhealthfully,
you know,

205
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,140
anal retentive,
uh,

206
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,860
you know,
obsessive compulsive,

207
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,023
uh,
you know,

208
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,560
cleaning up after my,
when I'm cooking,

209
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm cleaning up after myself constantly.
I keep things organized.

210
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,420
I write lists,
I keep my schedule up to date.

211
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,180
I am never late.
And as part of that,

212
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,960
if I say to you,
I'm going to meet you tomorrow at 12

213
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,530
minutes after five to see John Wick
seven,

214
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,160
uh,
I will be there at five.

215
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,470
Oh,
two hanging out across the street,

216
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,730
discreetly observing to see what time
you show up and I'll be making some very

217
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,890
important decisions based on your
arrival time.

218
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,850
It's a curse and a blessing.
But I think everything important I ever

219
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,290
learned,
I learned that I learned as a,

220
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,390
as a,
as a dishwasher and as a cook,

221
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,760
a,
you show up on time,

222
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,890
you organize,
you get,

223
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,070
you know,
you stay organized and clean up after

224
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,650
yourself or you think about the people
you work with.

225
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,120
You respect the people you work with.
Um,

226
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,810
and like I said,
you do the best you can.
