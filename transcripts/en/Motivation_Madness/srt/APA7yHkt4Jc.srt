1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,400
Did you hear what the cow said to the
farmer on a cold winter morning?

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,930
Thanks for the warm hand
anyway.

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,740
It's going to get better,
so don't panic on the

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,183
start.
Small.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,060
Nice to see all of you.
How many of you have never seen me

6
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,160
before?
Is this your first time?

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,050
Oh Wow.
Most of you.

8
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,450
Okay.
I keep thinking for sure.

9
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm more famous than that,
but uh,

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,590
you know,
that is the truth.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,830
I'm delighted to be here and looking
forward to it for a long time and it's

12
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,110
nice to be back.
You know,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,770
I was here not too long ago.
It's nice to be invited back.

14
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,300
It says something when you're invited
back.

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,910
It doesn't say everything but says
something.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,120
Maybe it says,
let's give him one more chance.

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,220
Right?
See if he can get it right this time.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,260
But I'm delighted to have all of you
here.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,430
We're going to spend the day together.
I feel two major responsibilities and

20
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:06,990
I'm sure you can guess what those are.
Number one is to make sure you get your

21
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:10,530
money's worth right when you shallow out
your cash,

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,640
basically these days you want to make
sure you get full value for the money

23
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,550
you spent,
and I know the tab for the seminar was

24
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:21,950
not that much.
Pretty modest fee to get in most of you,

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,280
your tips for the week,
right?

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,280
So it wasn't that much,
but I want you to be able to say,

27
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,400
when you walk out of here today,
it was worth my money,

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,480
but my biggest responsibility is to make
sure you get your time's worth.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,740
And the reason I say that is because
time is more valuable than money.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,140
In fact,
you might start your notes with that.

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,770
Time is more valuable than money.
You can get more money,

32
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,240
but unfortunately you can't get more
time.

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,960
If somebody asked you to spend your
money,

34
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,220
that's pretty easy,
right?

35
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:57,960
We live in America were wealthy,
so the money's not the problem,

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,960
but what if somebody asks you to spend
the day?

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,750
Right?
You got to think that over carefully,

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,320
and I know you did.
I wouldn't waste one of my days and not

39
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,850
for anybody,
not for anything.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Once I understood how valuable they
were,

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,390
I don't waste any,
but to make an investment like today of

42
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,920
your money and your time,
I appreciate it.

43
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,130
That today is going to be constantly for
me.

44
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,960
It's going to cost me one of my days to
be here

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,240
and some money of course,
but no,

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,800
I don't need the money.
I take the money,

47
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:30,410
but I don't.
I don't need the money,

48
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,040
but guess what?
I do need the time.

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,980
So I'm here not to just joke with you on
here,

50
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:40,340
not to just tell some funny stories and
give a performance and walk away.

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,570
I'm here to give you some value and I
want to make it worth your time.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm going to invest a day.
You're going to invest today.

53
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,250
Let's get the most out of it and see
what we can walk away with today.

54
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,930
Anyway,
for you that have not seen me before.

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,890
Just very briefly,
let me just tell you my story.

56
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,510
I grew up in Idaho farm country,
southwest corner of Idaho.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,450
In fact,
my father still lives on the old

58
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,450
homestead where I grew up.
He'll be 89.

59
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,990
His next birthday still hasn't retired.
I'm proud of.

60
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,390
My Dad has never been ill.
He's really something.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,370
I'm trying to get him to retire this
year.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,230
80 eight.
I'm telling my father,

63
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,310
what a good year to retire when you're
88.

64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,240
And he says,
Hey,

65
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,130
talk to me in 10 years.
Right.

66
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,530
I might be ready.
But anyway,

67
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,460
I went to high school.

68
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,490
I graduated,
I went to college one year.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,550
Halfway through my second year of
college I decided I was smart enough.

70
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,880
So I quit.
One of my major mistakes.

71
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,360
I should've stayed in school.
Uh,

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,050
but I thought,
yeah,

73
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,740
you know,
I'm smart enough to get a job.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,050
That's what life's all about,
right?

75
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,180
Get a job,
pay your bills,

76
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,680
were card and stay out of trouble.
Keep your fingers crossed and hope for

77
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,500
the best.
And I figured I was at least prepared to

78
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:00,340
do that.
So I quit college and went to work.

79
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,800
Then a while later,
got married,

80
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,400
got my little family going,
and I'm out there doing what I thought

81
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,880
was the best I could,
but at about age 25,

82
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm starting to struggle.
I've purchased a little more than I can

83
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:17,830
conveniently pay for on time and the
creditors are starting to call saying,

84
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,230
hey,
you told us the check was in the mail.

85
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,710
What's the deal?
And I'm getting embarrassed by that.

86
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,430
I'm also embarrassed,
big mouth me with all the fancy promises

87
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:32,431
I made to get married.
I'm way behind on those promises and I'm

88
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,090
getting discouraged or wondering what to
do.

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,030
And I thought,
well maybe I should go back to school,

90
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,740
right?
One Year of college.

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,460
Pretty short on an application.
But uh,

92
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,960
you know,
tough to go back to school,

93
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,490
right.
Especially when you got your family

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,670
going.
Time to stay is when you're there.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,370
Uh,
so I discounted that.

96
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,911
I thought,
well,

97
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,940
if I had my own business,
that would be the way to go.

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,600
But you know,
I'm short on money too much month at the

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,750
end of the money you've ever been there.
That's where I was age 25.

100
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,190
So I had to discount that and I'm
discouraged wondering where do I go from

101
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,890
here?
And then the miracle happened for me.

102
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,190
Good fortune came my way,
and who can explain good fortune?

103
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,110
I don't know,
remarkable things that happened to you

104
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,920
at a particular time.
Sometimes it's just unexplainable how

105
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:26,080
those things happened.
One of my friends says,

106
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,741
well,
hey,

107
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,980
things don't just happen.
Things happen.

108
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,310
Just another good note for your notes.
Things don't just happen.

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,380
Things happen.
Just.

110
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,690
And maybe that's it.
I don't know.

111
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm an amateur on life,
I guess like most of us are trying to

112
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,570
figure it out,
how to make it valuable.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,390
But I was ready and my good fortune was
at age 25.

114
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:55,590
I met a very wealthy man.
His name was Mr Shoaff,

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Mr Earl show.
A friend of mine had gone to work for

116
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,870
him and he started telling me about this
man.

117
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,250
He said,
you got to meet this man I've gone to

118
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,900
work for.
He's wealthy,

119
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,820
but he's easy to talk to a and he's got
a unique philosophy of life.

120
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,690
And the more he kept talking about this
man,

121
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,081
I thought,
well,

122
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,270
I've got to meet this man.
So sure enough,

123
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,050
shortly after that I had a chance to
meet this remarkable wealthy man.

124
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,910
And I was impressed.
He was wealthy.

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,070
Sure enough,
he was easy to talk to.

126
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,860
I was so intrigued.
Within a few minutes,

127
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:27,320
I said to myself,
if I could be like him,

128
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,050
farm boy from Idaho,
I could be like him.

129
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,840
I'd give anything.
And then I thought if I could just get

130
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,440
around somebody like him and if he would
teach me what to do,

131
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,250
I would be willing to learn.
I'm coachable.

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,170
And that was my good fortune.
A few months later,

133
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,790
this wealthy man that I met,
Mr Joe took a liking to me,

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,510
hired me,
gave me a job.

135
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:55,210
I went to work for him and I spent the
next five years in his employer.

136
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,690
And then unfortunately he died at the
end of that period at age 49 his last

137
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:03,890
five years.

138
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,910
But the first five years of my new life,
I got to spend with this remarkable man.

139
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,150
And my dream came true.
He coached me and taught me.

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,170
He taught me the books to read.
He taught me the discipline.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,270
He taught me the changes to make in my
language and personality and the things

142
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,740
he shared with me during that five
years,

143
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,810
literally changed my life,
turned my life around,

144
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,850
change my income,
changed my bank account.

145
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,800
That changed my future,
changed everything.

146
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,280
I've never been the same since that
unique experience and I wish he was

147
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,180
still alive today.
Mr. Show,

148
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm sure if he was alive today,
especially after this seminar,

149
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,840
Idaho farm boy and mix it to Dallas,
fort worth,

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,540
full house,
standing room only.

151
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,200
Pretty awesome.
I'm sure he was alive.

152
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,380
I'd be calling him today saying,
you won't believe what's happening to

153
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,840
me.
I've had a chance now to share with

154
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,690
other people what you shared with me,
but anyway,

155
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,680
how I got here 30 plus years ago.

156
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,180
I was living in Beverly Hills,
California and one day a friend of mine,

157
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,580
businessmen friend said,
Jim,

158
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,520
would you,
I'd like to have you come and share your

159
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:13,610
story with my service club that I belong
to the Rotary Club.

160
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,560
He said,
I know your story.

161
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,110
Idaho farm boy and makes it to beverly
hills,

162
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,570
but he said,
I think my club members would love to

163
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,381
hear your story.
He said,

164
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,090
if I arranged one of our breakfast
meetings,

165
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,550
would you come and tell your story?
Just share a few thoughts.

166
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,110
And I said,
okay,

167
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,050
uh,
so I agreed to go give this breakfast

168
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,890
talk and guess what?
They liked it.

169
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,290
And my telephone rang.
I got another call.

170
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,910
I've got another call saying we heard a.
you've given your story and shared some

171
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,680
ideas.
Would you come talk to our club?

172
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,410
Tough dark club?
First thing I know I'm starting to

173
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,080
devote a piece of my business time to
giving these talks.

174
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,910
And then one day a businessman who had
heard my talk,

175
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,710
I think two or three times approached me
and said,

176
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,840
would you come and share that story and
some thoughts with my management and

177
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:01,560
sales?
And I got this little company going and

178
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,990
he said,
if you'd come and tell your story to my

179
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,060
organization,
he said I'd be happy to pay.

180
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,450
And I thought,
wow,

181
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,780
wouldn't that be something?
So I agreed to go do it and I got paid.

182
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,090
Little did I know another fortune was
waiting for me to translate my ideas

183
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,960
into talks and speeches and seminars.
Now I've written some books.

184
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,200
It's on cassette tape now I get to
travel around the world.

185
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:33,201
Last year I was in Japan is real Spain,
Mexico,

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Australia,
New Zealand,

187
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,480
France,
Germany,

188
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,180
Canada,
and now Dallas,

189
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:47,181
fort worth,
Idaho farm boy gets to travel around the

190
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,090
world and sharing dory and here I am
today.

191
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,770
Anyway.
It's almost too much for me to

192
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,500
comprehend from where I started,
raised in obscurity,

193
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,850
a little small farm community and now to
be here.

194
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,260
Today's pretty awesome for me.
So anyway,

195
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,980
that's just a little bit about my story.
My story is probably more intriguing for

196
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,110
me than it is for you,
but I wanted to hear it again.

197
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,680
So I thought I would just bore you with
it anyway.

198
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,160
I don't ask you to be impressed today.
I'm the one that's impressed from where

199
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,830
I came from to have a chance,
but that's the American dream,

200
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:17,760
right?
Come true.

201
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,120
Chance to start from scratch.
Start from obscurity.

202
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,590
Start with pennies.
Start with nothing and have a chance to

203
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,450
transform your life,
change your life,

204
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,150
set your goals,
and see what you can accomplish.

205
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,300
So anyway,
that's how I got here and I'm just

206
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,020
delighted that this day has arrived and
I truly want to make it valuable for

207
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,340
you.
Let's go to work.

208
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,760
Here's what I hope you'll find out of
this seminar today for your notes.

209
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
Here's what I hope you'll find.
Number one,

210
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,090
sincerity
above all else today.

211
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:59,091
I hope you will find me sincere,
best place for people to start to

212
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:03,910
communicate his sincerity on both sides.
I'm sure you're sincere or you wouldn't

213
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:04,800
be here today,
right?

214
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,420
To spend this kind of money,
to spend this kind of time.

215
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:10,120
Roll up your sleeves today,
go to work like I am,

216
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,750
and get this message.
You've got to be sincere,

217
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,490
so I assume you're sincere.
Now,

218
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:19,120
I want you to see me sincere,
but I've got a good note for you to

219
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:21,550
make.
Sincerity is not a test of truth.

220
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,480
Important note,
to make sincerity is not a test

221
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,723
truth.

222
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,820
We must not make the mistake of saying
he must be right.

223
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:35,940
He's so sincere.
That would be a mistake,

224
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,600
and here's why it's possible to be
sincerely wrong,

225
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,460
so we don't mistake sincerity for truth,
right?

226
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:51,320
Sincerity is only a test of sincerity.
Truth has to yet be tested by truth.

227
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,100
Okay,
but hopefully you will find

228
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,850
me sincere and truthful.
Next,

229
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,980
a combination of things I hope you'll
find here today.

230
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,380
Ideas plus inspiration,
ideas,

231
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,250
plus inspiration

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,090
ideas,
business ideas,

233
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,210
and social ideas and personal ideas.
We all need ideas,

234
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,580
right?
How to have a good day,

235
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,500
ideas,
how to have a good year,

236
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,570
ideas,
how to have your best year ever.

237
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,580
Ideas,
good health ideas,

238
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,510
personal relationship ideas,
how to deal with your family ideas,

239
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,511
sales management ideas,
financial freedom for the future ideas.

240
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:36,100
We all need good ideas.
So today I hope you gather up by notes

241
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,520
and by what you can remember.
A lot of ideas.

242
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,180
I want to share as many with you as I
possibly can and the time constraints we

243
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,280
have today is going to go very rapidly.
I used to think a day like this was a

244
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,910
long day.
Found out it's pretty short day,

245
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,330
but I'm going to go as fast as I can,
share with you as many ideas as I

246
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:56,440
possibly can and here's why.
Ideas can be life changing.

247
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Ideas can be life changing and sometimes
all you need is just one more in a

248
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,540
series of good ideas.

249
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,620
It's like dialing the numbers into the
lock,

250
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,030
right?
You got five or six numbers dialed into

251
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,930
the lock.
The lock still won't come open,

252
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,360
but you don't need five or six more
numbers.

253
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,910
Maybe you just need one more and maybe a
seminar like this could do.

254
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,010
A sermon,
could do it.

255
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,920
The lyric from a song could do it.
The dialogue from a movie,

256
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,160
you could do it conversation with a
friend might do it.

257
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,920
That one last piece,
you need number,

258
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,350
dial it into the lock.
That's it.

259
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,100
The lock comes open.
There's the door for you to walk through

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,040
and maybe this seminar today could
furnish that for you.

261
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,590
One more idea.
I know you've come with a lot already.

262
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,260
Sometimes we get the impression I used
to have that,

263
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,780
but I only had this much going for me
and I needed this much,

264
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,110
usually not true,
and I'm sure not true of this audience.

265
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,140
Where do I find you today as well
dressed as you look today.

266
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,260
You know,
it's fine as you are sitting here today.

267
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,440
It isn't that you know you've got this
much going for you and you need this

268
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:03,350
much.
I would assume you've got this much

269
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:07,460
going for you and maybe all you need is
just a few more thoughts,

270
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:08,970
ideas,
uh,

271
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,010
to furnish Houston ways and means to
turn your life into the dream you want

272
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,250
it to be.
So ideas.

273
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,030
The seminar is going to be loaded with
ideas.

274
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,700
I want you to take good notes,
but here's what else I hope you'll find

275
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,440
here today,
and that is inspiration

276
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,130
and who knows the mystery of
inspiration,

277
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,470
why some people are inspired and some
are not.

278
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,980
You weren't inspired to get here,
some were not.

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,230
Who knows the mystery of that?
I don't know.

280
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,890
How come you made it.
The rest of them didn't make it.

281
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,130
We don't know what that mystery is.
Some people turned it down,

282
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,220
some people said it costs too much.
Some people say it's going to take too

283
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:46,310
much time.
Some people are too busy,

284
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,530
right?
A lot of different excuses why some are

285
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:52,070
inspired to take advantage of something
that comes to town and pass it up.

286
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,350
We don't know the mystery to that.
Here's what I call it,

287
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,050
mysteries of the mind,
and I just leave it at that.

288
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,590
Some things I don't try to figure out.
I take the simple approach now,

289
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,400
right?
Some people do and some people don't.

290
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,810
I mean that's about as profound as my
philosophy is.

291
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Some buyers and some don't buy something
go forward and some don't.

292
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,950
Some change and some don't.
And if you've been around for awhile,

293
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,150
you can usually work out the numbers
right out of 10,

294
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,090
you know,
three do $7,

295
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,170
whatever business you're involved in,
pretty soon you've got this ratio going.

296
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,270
The ones that do the ones that don't,
you say,

297
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,950
well,
why don't the ones that don't,

298
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,110
how come they don't?
We don't know.

299
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,680
I just leave it as a mystery.
I used to try to understand all that.

300
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,710
I just take the simple approach.
Now the guy says,

301
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,940
this happens to me.
This happened to me.

302
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,950
This goes wrong for me,
and all this stuff goes wrong for me.

303
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,720
How come all this stuff happens to me?
I say,

304
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,554
I don't know.
Beats me.

305
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,050
The Best I've been able to figure it out
is those kinds of things always happen

306
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:51,860
to people like you.

307
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,380
I mean,
that's the best I got.

308
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,170
I don't know.
I'm an amateur on this stuff.

309
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,860
What do I know?
So just take the simple approach,

310
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,150
right?
That's how it is.

311
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,100
Who knows?
Interesting story says the day the

312
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:11,270
Christian church was started.
Now I'm an amateur on the Bible,

313
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,170
but best account I can remember the day
the Christian church was started,

314
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,550
a magnificent sermon was preached,
great presentation,

315
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,400
and if you're a student of all at all,
have good communication.

316
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,120
It was one of the classic presentations
of all times the sermon.

317
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,710
The first day the Christian church was
started and it said the sermon.

318
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,630
This presentation was given to a
multitude,

319
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,620
meaning a lot of people,
but it was interesting as the account

320
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,400
gives us the record,
it says when the sermon was finished,

321
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,700
there was a variety of reaction to the
same server.

322
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,070
Isn't that fascinating?

323
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,490
I find it fascinating.
It said some that heard this

324
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,580
presentation were perplexed and I read
the presentation sounded pretty

325
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,790
straightforward to me.
He said,

326
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,830
why would somebody be perplexed with a
good,

327
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,570
sincere,
straightforward presentation?

328
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,540
Best Answer I've got.
They are the perplexed.

329
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,160
What other explanation is that?
It doesn't matter who's preaching.

330
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,890
It said some that heard this
presentation mocked and laughed,

331
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,440
made fun of the presentation.
I thought,

332
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,350
Hey,
this looks pretty sincere to me.

333
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,630
If you give a sincere,
honest presentation,

334
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:25,010
why would somebody mock and laugh?
Easy explanation.

335
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,940
They are the mockers and the laughers.
What else would you expect them to do?

336
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,550
I used to try to straighten all that
out.

337
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:31,741
Say,
well,

338
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,380
they shouldn't do that.
I don't do that anymore.

339
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,170
I've got peace of mind now.
I sleep like a baby.

340
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,760
Not try to straighten all this stuff
out.

341
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,340
I used to be so naive.
I used to say,

342
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,540
well,
liars shouldn't lie.

343
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,140
See how naive can you be?
Of course they're supposed to lie.

344
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,040
That's why we call them liars.
They lie.

345
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,440
Why don't straighten this stuff out
anymore.

346
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Anyway,
it said some that heard this magnificent

347
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,490
presentation didn't know what was going
on,

348
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,430
and they're usually easy to spot.
They're usually saying,

349
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,540
what's going on,
right?

350
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,920
I mean,
they don't know what's going on,

351
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,450
but interesting,
right?

352
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,970
A variety of reaction to the same
sincere,

353
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:12,510
honest presentation.
Now it also says in wrapping it up,

354
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,810
some that heard the presentation
believed,

355
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,390
and I think that's who the speaker was
looking for.

356
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,880
The believers.
Interesting.

357
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,910
Now it said the number of believers was
about 3000,

358
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,620
so pretty good.
First Day,

359
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,590
3000.
I've had some first days though.

360
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,710
I never had 3000,
but anyway,

361
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,400
3000 were believers and that's the
speaker was looking for the believers

362
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:39,300
out of this multitude and that's about
as close as we can come to understanding

363
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:42,330
the mystery.
Some believe and some mock and some

364
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,440
laugh and some are perplexed and some
don't know what's going on and you just

365
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,610
have to leave it that way.

366
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,980
Why?
Because that's the way it's going to be.

367
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,950
The way to be brilliant is to find out
how it's going to be and then say,

368
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,300
here's how it should be.
I mean,

369
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,830
that's how you'd be coming.
Brilliant.

370
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,130
So anyway,
who knows the mystery,

371
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:02,490
I call it mysteries of the mind.
We don't understand,

372
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:05,460
but I don't try to change it anymore on
this particular story.

373
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:08,310
As far as we know,
they didn't have classes after the

374
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,800
presentation to try to deeper plex the
perplexed.

375
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,220
I mean as far as we know,
they left them for plaques.

376
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,810
They left the mockers mocking.
They let the laughers laugh.

377
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,120
I mean they didn't come back and try to
straighten all this out.

378
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:21,721
You say,
well,

379
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:22,990
how can you build a church?
Well,

380
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,950
make another presentation and you'll get
some believers and some mockers,

381
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,560
some laughers and some who don't know
what's going on.

382
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,170
So that's about the best we can do.
So.

383
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,180
But I'm glad I've got the believers here
today.

384
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:38,160
You believed enough to shell out your
cash and parked with your time and some

385
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,350
of your effort and energy,
and I appreciate that,

386
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,950
so hopefully you'll find some
inspiration here today.

387
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,640
All right,
to get the most out of today,

388
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,020
a couple of more notes.
Number one,

389
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,860
be thankful.
That's a good way to capture the most of

390
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,920
a day like this and be thankful for what
you already have.

391
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,490
That shouldn't be any problem in
America.

392
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,210
Being thankful.
Everything we need is available in

393
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,070
America.
Everybody wants to come here,

394
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,840
right?
The last time I was here,

395
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,720
that little presentation I gave,
everybody wants to come here.

396
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:13,200
America.
People haven't plotted and schemed the

397
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,390
last 40 years,
and if I could just get to Poland and

398
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,430
everything,
it'd be okay.

399
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,440
No,
everybody wants to come to America.

400
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,020
Why?
Everything's available here on the

401
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,520
books.
You need all the sermons you need,

402
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,830
all the churches you need all the
schools you need all the instruction.

403
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:29,610
You need all the inspiration you need,
all the capital you need,

404
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,650
all the markets you need,
all the challenge you need,

405
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,990
all the information you need,
all the seminars you need.

406
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,420
Everything's available here.
This is America,

407
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:39,360
so number one,
let's be thankful for what we already

408
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,850
have.
Thanksgiving does.

409
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,410
This,
opens up the doors,

410
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,530
opens up the windows,
opens up the channels,

411
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,720
thanksgiving for what you already have.

412
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,910
I did a seminar one weekend up at the
ranch up at clear lake,

413
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,600
got a lodge up there,
nice setting,

414
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,500
high valley high serenity ranch for the
weekend.

415
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,610
Friday evening,
Saturday,

416
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:07,610
Sunday.
People drove in from around California.

417
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,290
I got there late Friday afternoon.
Everybody had pretty well already gotten

418
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,970
there.
I couldn't believe the parking lot.

419
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Continentals and Eldorados and Mercedes
and cadillacs and unbelievable Ferrari.

420
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,840
One Rolls Royce.
Unbelievable.

421
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,690
I walked in the crowd,
but like this,

422
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:29,390
sitting there ready for the weekend
seminar.

423
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:31,190
My opening remarks were ladies and
gentlemen,

424
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:35,210
I think the rest of the world would find
it strange that we have all come here

425
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,460
this weekend to try to figure out how to
do better.

426
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,800
I think the rest of the world would say,
I don't understand in his Rolls Royce

427
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,080
and I got to get to the seminar,
find out how to get another one of these

428
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:49,730
rolls royces.
Unbelievable.

429
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,590
Anyway,
let's be thankful.

430
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Here's what locks up the doors and the
channels to receive more cynicism that

431
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:00,470
locks you away,
that prevents you from learning more.

432
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:03,770
Being a cynic about the past and the
future of cynic,

433
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,530
about the marketplace,
cynical about the people,

434
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,040
cynical about the institution since
cynical about the setup,

435
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,990
cynical about yourself,
cynical about your chances.

436
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:19,970
See that locks away all the chance for
stuff to flow your way.

437
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,580
So good advice.
I think today,

438
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:24,200
start off,
be thankful.

439
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,150
Here's number two.
Listen,

440
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:28,880
well,
that's gonna be a challenge today.

441
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:29,810
I understand.
That

442
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,310
seems like most of you know,
our life is still going on outside these

443
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,570
four walls,
right?

444
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,910
Most of our life seems like it's out.
Continuing out their family and business

445
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,690
associates,
market and economy and whatever else is

446
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:51,691
happening in the midst of your life and
to Sorta pull your attention from what's

447
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,180
going on out there and put it in here
for just a few hours.

448
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,660
I know is a challenge,
but do the best you can.

449
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,770
Listen.
Well,

450
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,950
here's the last one.
Take good notes.

451
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,560
Be a good student today.
Take some good notes.

452
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:09,340
I have not come to entertain you as you
can tell by my opening joke,

453
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:13,120
right?
I would not make it in Las Vegas so we

454
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,640
don't have a dog and pony show today.
No entertainment,

455
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,000
but I do have some ideas.
Take some good notes.

456
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:23,380
Somebody showed me the other day notes
that they took about 21 years ago,

457
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,290
attending one of my seminars out in Los
Angeles.

458
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,630
He said,
I still use these notes.

459
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:33,631
I took 21 years ago to help me in my
business relationship with my family,

460
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,480
so I'd like to have these notes that you
take today,

461
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:41,530
become that valuable for you than it
would be worth me making the investment

462
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,250
to come and spend a portion of my life.
My my energy here and I want this

463
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,400
investment I'm making here today to pay
off,

464
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:51,140
and one of the ways it can pay off for
me,

465
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:55,340
it's for you to take good notes and then
go away and use whatever makes sense

466
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,240
because what I feast on,
coming back around as the stories out of

467
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,980
this audience today.
Sure enough,

468
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,260
six weeks from now,
six months from now,

469
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,110
six years from now,
somebody is going to by phone,

470
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,850
by letter,
by personal contact.

471
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:11,840
Walk up to me and say,
the things you shared that day got me

472
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,690
thinking and I started making some
changes and let me tell you what's

473
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,280
happened to my business.
Let me tell you what's happened in my

474
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,020
sales career.
Let me tell you what's happened in my

475
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:21,260
relationship with my family.
See that will make it worth it for me,

476
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,750
not the money,
the return.

477
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,050
Something you can't buy with money.
If somebody says,

478
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:31,070
thank you for touching my life and
taking the time to make the investment,

479
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,880
and that's what I'm all about.
So if you'll become a good student

480
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,350
today,
and here's the last note,

481
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,870
don't be a follower.
Be a student

482
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,720
you'd be happy to know today we haven't
come seeking disciples.

483
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,730
We've got no movement for you to join.
I'm just here to share some of my

484
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:51,190
experiences,
good ideas,

485
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
best I can,
but I think that's good advice.

486
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:56,240
Don't be a follower.
Be a student,

487
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,340
right?
Take advice,

488
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:01,490
but not orders.
Take information,

489
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:05,720
but don't let somebody order your life.
Make sure what you do is the product of

490
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,690
your own conclusion.
Excellent note to make.

491
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,980
Make sure what you do is the product of
your own conclusion.

492
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,440
Not to do what someone else says.
Take what someone else says,

493
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,880
process it,
think about it,

494
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,730
ponder it.
If it makes you wonder,

495
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,560
if it makes you think,
then it's valuable.

496
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,490
Then when you go take action,
make sure that the action is not what

497
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,890
somebody told you to do.
Make sure the action is the product of

498
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:31,970
your own conclusion.

499
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,740
If you will,
follow just a little bit of those simple

500
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,180
guidelines.
I'm telling you,

501
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,640
the learning process can be speedy,
swift,

502
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,610
powerful.
Your learning curve can go up and then

503
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,230
applying it to your business,
your life,

504
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,590
your family conversations,
equities of all kinds.

505
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,460
You'll find some progress like I did
that first five years when I met a

506
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:56,960
teacher willing to share with me,
turn my life around progress I couldn't

507
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:00,320
believe happened for me.
Okay,

508
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,100
let's get started.
I want to review.

509
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:08,030
I was here last time and we talked about
the five major pieces to the life puzzle

510
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,010
and I just want to review those because
it lays such a good foundation for all

511
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,570
the rest that I want to share with you
today.

512
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,810
We've got a lot of subjects to cover so
we're going to go rather swiftly.

513
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,050
Okay.
Put on your mental track shoes here and

514
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,520
run with me today because I'm going to
deal mostly in concepts.

515
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,580
Expect you to,
you know,

516
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:33,090
fill in a lot of the details because I
got a lot to share.

517
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,570
I want to get through it all but let's
lay this foundation again of the five

518
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:39,150
major pieces happens to be the title of
my latest book,

519
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,050
but I think it is so valuable and laying
a foundation at some of the things I

520
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,380
between ages 25 and 30,
the teacher who taught me taught me so

521
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,940
well.
He dealt in these fundamentals,

522
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:55,941
we call these fundamentals.
We call these basics

523
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,890
basics for sports,
fundamentals,

524
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:02,210
for sports,
fundamentals,

525
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:04,850
for your business,
fundamentals for the way you deal with

526
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,830
your family.
A few simple things,

527
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,640
few basic things that if you practice
everyday can make all the difference in

528
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:12,290
the world.
How it works out.

529
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,470
I boiled it down to five major pieces to
the life puzzle.

530
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,810
Let's just review those.
Number one is philosophy.

531
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,703
Philosophy.

532
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,500
Philosophy is I taught the last time I
was here.

533
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:30,360
Philosophy in my personal opinion,
is the major determining factor in how

534
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:35,361
your life works out philosophy,
the major determining factor in how your

535
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:40,230
life works out philosophy to form our
philosophy.

536
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,560
You've got to think,
got to use your mind to process ideas

537
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,950
and this whole process over a lifetime
starting way back here when we were

538
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,770
children,
schools that we've attended,

539
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,050
our parents,
our experiences,

540
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:59,760
all this stuff that we've processed by
the thinking process helps to develop

541
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,720
our philosophy and in my opinion,
each person's personal philosophy is the

542
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:08,721
major factor in how your life works out.
Here's what I called it in that last

543
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,360
presentation when I was here.
It's called the set of the sail.

544
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,860
Each person's personal philosophy is
like the set of the sail now,

545
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,220
I used to think of was circumstances
that ordered my life.

546
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,560
If someone would have asked me at age
25,

547
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,150
Mr Owen,
how come you're not doing well?

548
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:28,920
Pennies in your pocket,
creditors calling nothing in the bank

549
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,870
behind on your promises to your family.
You live in America.

550
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,600
Twenty five years old,
got a beautiful family.

551
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:40,410
Every reason to do well and things are
not going that well for you.

552
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,310
What is wrong here?
It would not have occurred to me to

553
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:45,300
blame my philosophy.

554
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,070
I mean it would not have occurred to me
saying,

555
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,990
well,
I got this lousy philosophy and that's

556
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:54,050
how come I got pennies in my pocket and
nothing in the bank and things aren't

557
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,940
working well.
That would not have occurred to me.

558
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,330
I found it much easier to blame the
government.

559
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Much easier to blame the tax problem.
I used to say taxes are too high.

560
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,800
Top tax rate.
When I first started paying taxes,

561
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,000
91 percent

562
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,350
back then when your income reached a
certain level,

563
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:18,640
all your income over that 91 percent,
so I have to say that's too high.

564
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:21,730
Now,
the tax top tax rates about 33 percent,

565
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,450
but people are still saying what taxes
are to see,

566
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:29,920
but you can't use that anymore.
If it's gone from 91 to 33,

567
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,930
how could it be?
Do.

568
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,940
Hi,
come on.

569
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,360
I threw all that old excuse stuff away.
Some people found it though and they're

570
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,670
using it these days.
My old list,

571
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,890
I used to blame the traffic.
Weather used to blame circumstances,

572
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,710
right?
People say I'm too tall.

573
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm too short.
I'm too old.

574
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,870
I was raised in obscurity,
raised on a farm.

575
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,470
Parents of modest means all the stuff.
If you had asked me,

576
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,150
how come you find yourself here,
Mr Owens,

577
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,590
age 25,
living in America,

578
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:06,070
land of abundance and opportunity,
Kenny's zero in the bank,

579
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,960
not doing well.
Creditors calling.

580
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,300
It would not have occurred to me to
blame my philosophy.

581
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,020
I found it easier to blame the company
company policy.

582
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,280
I used to say,
if this is all they pay,

583
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:23,210
how do they expect you to do well?
So I figured that you know,

584
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,660
my future was going to be tied to what
everybody else was arranging the

585
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:28,520
economy,
right?

586
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,090
Interest rates.
I used to say things cost too much.

587
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:36,740
That was my whole explanation,
not my philosophy until my teacher

588
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,930
taught me better that this is where the
problem was.

589
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:43,040
My own personal philosophy.
Here's what's exciting about each

590
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,160
person's personal philosophy.
That's what makes us different than dogs

591
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:49,700
and animals and birds and cats and
spiders and alligators.

592
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,660
That's what makes us different than all
the life forms.

593
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,550
The ability to think,
the ability to use your mind,

594
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:00,420
the ability to process id is and not
just operate by instinct

595
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,270
in the winter and I'm telling you,
the goose can only fly south.

596
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,720
South doesn't look too good,
tough luck.

597
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,770
It can only fly south,
but see,

598
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:19,220
human beings are not like a goose can
only fly south.

599
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,400
I mean you can turn around and go north.
You can go east,

600
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,850
you can go west.
You can order the entire process of your

601
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:31,050
own life and we do that by the way.
We think we do that by exercising our

602
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:33,870
mind.
We do that by processing ideas and come

603
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:37,950
up with a better philosophy,
a better strategy for our life goals for

604
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,230
the future.
Okay.

605
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,930
Plans to achieve those goals.
All this comes from developing our

606
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:47,090
philosophy.
Philosophy helps us to process what's

607
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:48,410
available.
Well,

608
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:52,430
when we get here,
we got seed and we got soil and we got

609
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:57,431
some rain and we've got some hot
sunshine and we've got some seasons and

610
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:04,901
what the miracle of life.
Now the key is what do you do with all

611
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:05,984
this stuff?

612
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,860
How do you turn all this stuff that's
available here into equity and promise

613
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,790
and lifestyle and dreams and future
possibilities.

614
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,570
All of this that's possible now with
human beings.

615
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,550
How do you take all this stuff and turn
it into this equities and values?

616
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,620
Well,
it starts with philosophy.

617
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,670
What is the seed?
What is the soil?

618
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,300
It is the sunshine.
What is the rain?

619
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,560
Is it possible to take some of each of
all the stuff that's available and turn

620
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:44,480
it into food and turn it into value and
turn it into nourishment,

621
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,740
turn it into something spectacular and
unique that no other life form can do,

622
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:53,030
and the answer's yes,
but you cannot deal with all this stuff

623
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,510
and what to do with it unless you start
refining your philosophy.

624
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,590
Think use your mind,
come up with ideas and strengthen your

625
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:02,900
philosophy,
so the seed in the soil and the rain and

626
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:05,960
the sunshine.
This is called you know the economy and

627
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:10,961
the banks and the money and the schools
and everything that's available out

628
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:15,620
there,
processing information.

629
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,740
What to do with all that and turn it
into equity and value.

630
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,200
That is the major challenge of life.

631
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,710
My personal opinion,
so each person's personal philosophy now

632
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,860
is going to determine what you're going
to do with seed and soil and sunshine

633
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:30,500
and rain miracle,
the change of seasons.

634
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,840
That's it.
My personal opinion,

635
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,720
each person's personal philosophy is
like the set of the sail.

636
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,760
That's what the seminars for today help
you to trim a better sale.

637
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,500
You don't need a better economy,
you don't need better seed and soil.

638
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:48,230
In fact,
when it comes to seed and soil and rain

639
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,360
and sunshine and seasons and the miracle
of life,

640
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,090
that's all you got.
Now,

641
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,600
what if you blame this stuff?
Then you're blaming all you got.

642
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,390
If you blame the economy and you blame
the schools and you blame the teachers

643
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,450
and he blamed the sermons and the
preachers and,

644
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,900
and you blame,
uh,

645
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,990
you know the marketplace and you blame
the company and company policy.

646
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,010
What else is there?
When some people get through with their

647
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,850
blame list,
there is nothing else.

648
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:20,150
That's all there is.
And if you blame the only thing you've

649
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,320
got to work with,
I'm telling you,

650
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,690
it's called mistake,
colossal

651
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,710
and not understanding that that's all
you've got to work with.

652
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,600
And if this is all you've got to work
with,

653
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,620
then you don't change the seed and you
don't change the soil and you don't

654
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:38,380
change the rain and you don't change the
sun sign.

655
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,840
You don't change the seasons.
Right?

656
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:42,760
Guy Says,
I'll take three springs,

657
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,150
four summers,
nine falls,

658
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,690
no winters,
no,

659
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,210
you can't fool with this stuff.
You've got to take it like it comes.

660
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,400
Then what do you change to make your
life work?

661
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:57,190
Well,
you gotta start with your philosophy.

662
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,340
Guess what?
I had to do at age 25.

663
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:03,940
In order to change my own future,
I had to change my mind.

664
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:06,760
I had to change my thinking.
I had to change my philosophy.

665
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,050
I was messed up on what was causing my
problem and once I got that straightened

666
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:15,540
out that all the stuff I blamed the
government and taxes and the marketplace

667
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,780
and the economy and things cost too much
negative relatives,

668
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,090
cynical neighbors.
Once I got rid of that and started going

669
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:24,370
for where the real problem was,
which was me,

670
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,230
I'm telling you,
my life exploded into change.

671
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,400
My bank account changed immediately.
My income changed immediately.

672
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,540
My whole life took on a whole new look
and color immediately,

673
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,750
and the early results I got from making
philosophical changes tasted so good.

674
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,120
I've never stopped the process from that
day until this,

675
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,440
and I'm telling you with a little
consideration of the refinement of your

676
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:50,430
sale by setting a better sale,
refining your philosophy,

677
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,680
your whole life can start to change from
today on.

678
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,100
You don't have to wait till tomorrow.
You don't have to wait til next month.

679
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,120
You don't have to wait until spring.
Don't have to wait until 93.

680
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,520
You can start this whole process
immediately.

681
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,300
I recommend it now.
Some people do so little thinking they

682
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,350
don't even have their sale up.
I mean you can imagine where they're

683
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,100
going to wind up at the end of this
week,

684
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,410
at the end of this month,
at the end of this year.

685
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,760
Now is the chance to change process all
this information.

686
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,720
So number one is philosophy and we dealt
with all that.

687
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,480
Where are we?
Get ideas from personal experience,

688
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,210
from other people's experiences.
I don't want to get into all those

689
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:30,900
details because we've covered that.
The last time I was here philosophy.

690
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,670
That's number one,
my personal opinion,

691
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,840
each person's personal philosophy.
Here's the definition of success and

692
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,130
failure.
Just make this note.

693
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,680
Here's failure,
a few

694
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,420
errors in judgment
repeated every day.
