1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,630
What I would say is are other young man.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,660
I want to open your eyes
and look at the world.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,260
Okay,

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,260
right now please see what is the most
needed thing in the world right now.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,040
You don't do some fanciful
thing that you like to do.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,500
You must do what's most needed isn't it

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,343
isn't the top.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,630
If you get carried away by a situations,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,180
people become like this. It's useful,
but it is not the basic thing.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,550
Today you saw a train burning,
so you wanted to become a firefighter.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,030
Tomato.
You saw something.

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,710
You wanted to become that in
reaction and emotional reaction.

13
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:57,220
You choose to become something.
It could be useful on some level,

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,060
but now when most young people
cannot think you're thinking,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,750
what should I do with my life
and set the thought has come.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,120
I would say spend little more time on it

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,050
not being influenced by anybody
or anything. Simply look at it.

18
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,480
What is it that the humanity needs most?

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,600
What is it that the world needs most
today? I want you to recognize that

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,770
the only thing that needs to be
fixed on this planet as human beings,

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,750
everything else is fine, isn't it? So,

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,020
so I would say all young people,

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,290
not just you,
let's take a break from what you're doing.

24
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,500
Just caught up because you did.
You did school,

25
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,210
you went to a college
because he didn't call it.

26
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,500
You went to the next thing and the
next thing and you end up with a phd.

27
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:56,270
What to do. It's a dangerous, you know,

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,710
because the education
scientists are saying if you
go through 20 years of formal

29
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,260
education and landed
with a phd or something,

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,040
70% of your intelligence
is irrevocably destroyed.

31
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,680
Yes, you become a very
knowledgeable, he did.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
And to your knowledge has no use because
whatever beheaded the hold of nos,

33
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,270
a high school kid can open the
Internet and talk the same language.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,780
Uganda one looks smarter anymore
with what you've collected isn't the

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,340
cause of just about anybody.

36
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,100
We'll pop these things because
it's all over the place.

37
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,190
So are you preparing for a
university or the universe?

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,350
That's where you have to live unless
you wanted to become an academic.

39
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:55,880
I'm not saying these things are wrong,
but human beings,

40
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:00,280
sensible human beings must inverse
their life towards what is needed most,

41
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,660
isn't it not some fancy one thing
that I want to do or you want to do?

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,820
You can do whatever joyfully
are miserably, isn't it?

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,440
And just because today you think by
doing this I will be happy if your goal

44
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,020
don't ever think you will stay happy
by doing the that after some time

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,460
everybody,
when they got their first job,

46
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,630
what a beautiful day it was.

47
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,560
You went to this,
Mandy living office,

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,140
sat there and wow,

49
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,690
how are we 12 but after a few years,

50
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:51,440
sitting behind the same table,
it's taking your life,

51
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,640
the same job, the same
marriage, the same situations.

52
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,970
They're taking your life and one day they,
it looked like heaven.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,580
After some time it looks
like hell isn't it?

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,930
Not because there's something wrong with
those jobs simply because you're doing

55
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,810
it for the wrong reason. You're
just doing it for the wrong reasons.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,673
That's all.

57
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,530
Okay.

58
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,250
Now that you're thinking.
I would say take a few weeks off.

59
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,320
We have a link to give you the space.
Just a uninfluenced by anybody.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,550
Just look at it

61
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,260
did have many things you will want
to do right now because of immediate

62
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:34,200
compulsions.
You're broke right now.

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,550
You think the first thing is to find a
job or some of the comparison with the

64
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,690
new thing? Do the first thing is
to do this beside your compulsions.

65
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:47,070
Suppose you had none of these compulsions.
What would you like to do with life?

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,180
That's what you should do.

67
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,470
You should not decide your life and the
course of your life based on immediate

68
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,870
compulsions you decide in your life.

69
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,340
If you do this for a hundred years
and look back after a hundred years,

70
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:06,600
if you look back,
is it still worthwhile you do that?

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,840
There are many others
who would like to be you?

72
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,890
Oh, I wish I was 20 and I wish I
could think what to do at that time.

73
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:21,891
I did something that any number of
people here now that you're 20 and you're

74
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:27,210
fortunate that you're thinking and it's
fortunate that you're here. It's time,

75
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,460
you'd think straight
before you do anything.

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:41,890
Okay.
