1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Seventy years ago I was in high school,
almost a third as long as the country

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,500
has been around and when I was in high
school,

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,100
I really only had two things on my mind,
girls and cars and and it wasn't doing

4
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,470
very well with girls,
so we'll talk about cars,

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,490
but let's just imagine that when we
finished,

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,170
I'm going to let each one of you pick
out the car of your choice.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,490
Sounds good,
doesn't it?

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,730
Pick it out.
Any color,

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,200
you name it,
it will be tied up with a bow and it

10
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:47,930
will be at your house tomorrow
and you say,

11
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,490
well,
what's the catch?

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,160
And the catch is that it's the only car
you're going to get in your lifetime.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,890
Now what are you going to do knowing
that that's the only car you're ever

14
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:05,080
going to have it and you love that car?
You're going to take care of it by you

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,990
cannot believe.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,420
Now,
what I'd like to suggest,

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,510
you're not going to get only one car in
your lifetime,

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,000
but you only get one body and one mind
and that's all you're going to get and

19
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:22,001
that body and mind feels terrific now,
but it has to last you a lifetime.

20
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,110
Most important thing is to decide what
is to be able to define which ones you

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,620
can come to an intelligent decision on
and which ones are beyond your capacity

22
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:37,900
to evaluate.
You don't have to be right about

23
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,210
thousands and thousands and thousands of
companies.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,070
You only have to be right about a
company.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,260
A couple.
I met Bill Gates on July fifth,

26
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:45,130
19,
91.

27
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:50,050
We were out in Seattle and bill said,
you've got to have a computer.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,970
And I said,
why?

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,010
And he said,
well,

30
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,710
he said you can do your income tax on
it.

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,550
It said,
I don't have any income.

32
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,860
Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend.
And he said,

33
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,320
well,
you can keep track of your portfolio.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,150
And I said,
I only have one stock.

35
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:04,984
I said,
I.

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,600
He says,
it's going to change everything.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,920
And I said,
well,

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,040
will it change whether people chew gum?
And he said,

39
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,080
well,
probably not.

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,891
And I said,
well,

41
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:19,310
we'll change what kind of gum they show.
And I said,

42
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,410
well then I'll stick of chewing gum and
Houston computers.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,900
You
don't have to understand all kinds of

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,560
all kinds of businesses I don't
understand,

45
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,230
but there's thousands of opportunities
there.

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,320
I did understand the Bank of America,
you know,

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,600
and uh,
and I'll be able to,

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,020
I'm able to do that.
I'm able to understand some given

49
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:44,540
percentage.
But Ted Williams wrote a book called the

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,510
science of hitting and in science of
hitting,

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,570
he's got a diagram,
shows him at the plate and he's got the

52
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:55,400
strike zone divided into 77 squares each
the size of a baseball.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,330
And he says,
if I only swing at pitches in the sweet

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,080
zone,
which he shows there and he has what his

55
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,910
batting average would be,
which is 400.

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,550
If he had to swing it low outside
pitches.

57
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,010
But still in the,
in the strike zone is average,

58
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,800
would be 2:30.
He said the most important thing and

59
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,880
hitting is waiting for the right pitch.
Now he was at a disadvantage because of

60
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,580
the account was all in two or one and
two or so on.

61
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,580
Even if that ball was down where he was
only going about 2:30,

62
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,310
he had to swing at it.
In investing,

63
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,610
there's no called strikes.
People Control Microsoft.

64
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,890
That man,
you know your name and any,

65
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,180
any stock,
General Motors,

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,960
uh,
and I don't have to swing at nobody's

67
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,070
gonna call me out on called strikes.
I only get a strike called if I swing at

68
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,470
a pitch and mess.
So I can wait there and look at

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,860
thousands of companies day after day and
only when I see something I understand

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,030
and what I liked the price at which is
selling.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,590
Then if I swing,
if I,

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,100
if I headed fine,
if I miss it,

73
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,380
it's,
it's,

74
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,770
it's a strike.
But it's an enormously advantageous game

75
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,000
and it's a terrible mistake.
The thing,

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,640
you have to have an opinion on
everything.

77
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,670
You only have to have an opinion on a
few things.

78
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,850
In fact,
I've told students if when they got out

79
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,240
of school,
they got a punch card with 20 punches on

80
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:13,270
it and that's all the investment
decisions they got to make in their

81
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:16,180
entire life.
They would get very rich because they

82
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:20,860
would think very hard about each one.
And you don't need 20 right decisions to

83
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,000
get very rich,
you know,

84
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,490
four or five,
we'll probably do it over time.

85
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,870
So,
uh,

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,680
I don't worry too much about the things.
I don't understand it.

87
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,120
If you understand some of these
businesses that are coming along and can

88
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,790
spot things on,
if you can spot on Amazon,

89
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,690
for example,
I mean,

90
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,600
it's a tremendous accomplishment what
Jeff Bezos has done,

91
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,580
and I tip my hat to him.

92
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,650
He's a wonderful businessman.
He's a good guy too,

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,160
but can I have anticipated that he would
be the success and 10 others wouldn't

94
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:52,120
be.
I'm not good enough to do that,

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,470
but I don't.
Unfortunately,

96
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,670
I don't have to.
You know,

97
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,520
that I don't have to form an opinion on,
on Amazon.

98
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:01,120
And I do.
I did form an opinion on the Bank of

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,320
America and I formed an opinion on Coca
Cola.

100
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,250
Coca Cola has been around since 18,
86.

101
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,140
There's one point 8 billion,
one point 8 billion,

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,010
eight ounce servings of Coca Cola
products sold every day.

103
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,000
Now if you take one penny and get one
penny extra,

104
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,840
that's $18,
million dollars a day and 18 million

105
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,930
times 365 is 7 billion.
Seven hundred 30 billion or 6 billion,

106
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,750
$570,000,000.
So annually,

107
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,120
6 million.
Five hundred $70,000,000 from one penny.

108
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,380
Do you think coca cola is worth a penny
more than you know Joe's Cola?

109
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,220
I think so.
So you know,

110
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,080
and I've got about 127 years of history
would indicate it.

111
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,210
So those are the kinds of decisions I
like to make and you may have an

112
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:54,211
entirely different field of expertise
than I would have probably much more up

113
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,830
to date in terms of the kind of
businesses that seeing above.

114
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:57,980
And

115
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,690
you can get very rich if you just
understand the few of them and

116
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,690
understand their future.
What is it that you two share?

117
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,800
What makes this friendship so satisfying
for both of you?

118
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,380
Well,
I think we both certainly share a

119
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:17,381
curiosity about the world and we come
from two different but related worlds.

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,380
Uh,
so we had probably spent about 10 hours

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
of this one hour visit that was
scheduled on July fifth,

122
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,250
1991.
His mother had to talk him into it and

123
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,500
uh,
we weren't halfway.

124
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,000
I mean,
we haven't gotten no place in terms of

125
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,620
our eventual agenda just in that time.
In fact,

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,070
the governor of Washington came by and
bills that had to come into the bedroom.

127
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,910
Polar bears we were talking about,
well,

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,410
we have fun to start with.
Every relationship should have a lot of

129
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,250
fun and it,
and,

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,230
and we've,
we,

131
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,930
we find the world and just such an
interesting place.

132
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,720
So we like to compare notes on it when
we compare notes.

133
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,270
We have a lot of fun doing it.
Part of the time is,

134
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,710
I remember the conversation,
and by the way,

135
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,470
there's a remarkable documentary about
wiring,

136
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,390
which is on Hbo.
Uh,

137
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,450
I think it premieres on Gandy 30th
Monday.

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,580
You should take time to take a look at
it,

139
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,300
builds involved in that and you will see
in a sense,

140
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,160
it's called,
I think becoming Warren Buffett.

141
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,550
Yeah,
that's what it's called because it

142
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,750
took me six years,
but think

143
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,320
you're doing well on it so far.
Best is yet to come.

144
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,540
One of the things that happened tonight,
Bill,

145
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,220
was it,
I Guess Your Dad,

146
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,100
uh,
at the dinner said,

147
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,963
you know,
what is it,

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,970
what's been the most important quality
for you and you found out that you and

149
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,420
Warren had the same word.
Yeah,

150
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:46,421
I think curiosity,
which Warren mentioned is a,

151
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,690
an amazing thing where you try and
predict what's going to happen and then

152
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,970
a,
when it doesn't sort of think,

153
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,200
well,
uh,

154
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,980
you know,
that a drug didn't get invented that

155
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,480
stock to go up.
That approach wasn't popular once.

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,050
What is it about my model of the world
that's wrong,

157
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,460
you know,
who could I talk to,

158
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:09,710
what could I read?
And,

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,080
and the things that have happened since
1991.

160
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,190
Uh,
mostly good things have been amazing and

161
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:20,240
just so much fun to talk about.
A

162
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,010
No.
So we read the news and we think,

163
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,660
God,
what did Warren think about that?

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,240
You both are readers.
You both,

165
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,870
you read all the time,
all day,

166
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,170
Lauren built.
Oh,

167
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,330
you're a reader.
You also do a lot of sort of courses

168
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:37,210
online as well.
What does that have done?

169
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,240
What has that done for your life?
The sense of constantly learning.

170
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,820
Well,
go ahead bill.

171
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,160
It's an incredible time to be a learner.
I remember when I was young and I had

172
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,830
the world book,
which is one of Warren's products and it

173
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:55,290
was very good,
but I always felt like kind of how want

174
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,990
to get into this in more depth.
I understand it better today,

175
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,210
the videos that are online and the
courses that you combined with the very

176
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,930
best professors.
It's phenomenal,

177
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,990
you know,
take a subject like weather or climate

178
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:14,370
change or what's going on in economics,
what's known,

179
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,800
what's not known now with the
foundation.

180
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,080
A lot of what I need to learn this about
biology,

181
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,530
making vaccines and uh,
what's going on with these,

182
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,240
these various diseases.
This is a phenomenal time to be a

183
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:30,270
curious person.
The information that's out there,

184
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,340
you know,
I have a,

185
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,690
my,
my biggest problem is that I stay up too

186
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,870
late because I'm reading and then I'm a
little bit tired the next day.

187
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Uh,
the other thing that you share other

188
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:44,070
than reading his optimism,
you believe in America.

189
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,190
Absolutely.
You have said to me more than once.

190
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,830
Uh,
I would give up a year of my life just

191
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,720
to know what the next 50 is going to be
like.

192
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah.
Even for now.

193
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,620
Why'd you pick for number that came to
me

194
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,180
is just fascinating what's happened just
in my lifetime,

195
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,800
you know,

196
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,990
in the six years.
I shouldn't mention one thing about

197
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:15,950
reading a,
it was at the library here at Columbia.

198
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,200
I wish I spent probably more time than
any other student I,

199
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,580
I lived there practically.
But I pulled the book out there,

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,910
happened to be who's doing an American
that taught me something about my

201
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:31,490
professor Benjamin Graham.
And then I looked up and I went to the

202
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:32,590
library and I said,
I want to look more,

203
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,970
learn more about this because I learned
this over here.

204
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,310
That changed my whole life.
You know,

205
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:42,311
we own Geico now because of a librarian
directing me to some other book and then

206
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:47,890
following through on that.
It's the chance I,

207
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,740
I read about one fifth,
the pace the bill does,

208
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
but I still spend five or six hours a
day reading.

209
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:55,034
I mean,
it just,

210
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,750
you can learn so much.
I particularly love biography just to,

211
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,760
you know,
to be able to live the lives of.

212
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,090
These people have been
so extraordinary.

213
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,600
The lessons and the,
you know,

214
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,140
the discouragements they face just
everything about it.

215
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,370
So I,
it can't get enough of reading at.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,020
What surprises you most about bill?
Uh,

217
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,740
that's an interesting question.
I guess what really surprised me

218
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,030
initially,
we just found so many things to connect

219
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,990
on that uh,
uh,

220
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,540
he didn't try to sell me a computer.

221
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,040
Uh,
that's probably the only sale he didn't

222
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,410
make all the computer changed my life

223
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,670
for the better in a big way
subsequently.

224
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:38,460
But uh,
well he,

225
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,030
he,
he just had the same curiosity that,

226
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,620
and the other word,
you have used his focus when the focus

227
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,910
is no question if,
I mean he,

228
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,470
both of us got to where we are in a big,
big way because of focusing.

229
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,060
Bill.
What surprises you about Warren?

230
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,220
I was so

231
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,220
amazed that he comes to investing with
this broad model of the world.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,670
So one of the first questions he asked
me was a,

233
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,610
Microsoft's a small company.
Ibm's this huge company.

234
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,800
Why can you do better?
Why can't they beat you at the software

235
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,350
game that you're playing?
And I always,

236
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,360
you know,
you know,

237
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,290
every day I was thinking about,
okay,

238
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,480
what advantage do we have?
What we do.

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,410
But nobody ever asked me that question
and we've talked about the economics of

240
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,390
software,
which is a very,

241
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,080
a different and special thing.
And he could relate it to things that

242
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,440
he'd seen and you know,
I didn't understand banking why some get

243
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,110
ahead and some don't.
And so he was able to put that in very

244
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,210
clear terms.
And so I found somebody whose model was

245
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,040
rich enough that it helped me understand
things that I really wanted to know and

246
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,520
we could laugh about things that were a
surprise to us.

247
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,880
I'd say his humility and his sense of
humor really stood out in this

248
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,790
incredible way.
I mean he enjoys what he does and he

249
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,550
shares that with other people.
And even,

250
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,860
you know,
when I ask questions that are pretty

251
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:05,320
naive that he's probably been asked 15
times,

252
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,590
he's very nice about it took me a long
time to figure this out,

253
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,330
Bill.
But here's how it works.

254
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,390
I tried bill out with some non
transmitted dies and I'd read about them

255
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,690
in scientific American or someplace and
there are only two people in the world

256
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,660
and the history of these dice that
actually figured it out while I was

257
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:26,260
trying to take their money from them.
And one was the leading symbolic logic

258
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,510
in the world.
And the other was a drunk who didn't

259
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,580
really know any better.
Ask the wrong question.

260
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,990
But bill said,
wait a second.

261
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,500
You choose first and the game was over
you.

262
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,560
You taught him not.
You didn't teach him,

263
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,530
but you brought him into a great
appreciation of bridge.

264
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,180
Yeah,
he can play bridge,

265
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,060
but the family is very big on games as
family with very,

266
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,250
very big on games and,
and uh,

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,390
and so we,
we,

268
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,460
we,
we played bridge together and we played

269
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,270
in China going down rivers.
You're supposed to be looking at.

270
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,410
We had a good time point.
Alright,

271
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,940
we've got a lot of questions.
We want to talk to him,

272
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,730
the audience.
Somebody we want to start up in a,

273
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,560
up in the balcony.
So we'll,

274
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:03,640
we.
So you know,

275
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,640
we haven't forgotten you.
It's hard to see.

276
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,250
But is there a number there that has a
question?

277
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,063
Uh,

278
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,820
okay.
Start it.

279
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,840
Wherever it is.
Yes.

280
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:13,674
Number six.

281
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,400
I thank both of you guys for being here
today.

282
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,630
My question is in regards to public
health and vaccinations.

283
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,670
Given our current president's publicly
stated stance against the use of

284
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,160
vaccinations both in this country and
abroad,

285
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,180
how would you recommend that we as
students and future leaders in health

286
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:41,800
sciences best to allocate our resources
to most effectively resist his

287
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,880
alternative fact political philosophy in
regards to the domestic and global

288
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,040
public health?
Thank you.

289
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,790
That's a good place to start.
Well,

290
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,950
the facts about vaccines are very clear
and very strong,

291
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:02,210
which is both a that they're safe and
that the vaccine schedule has been

292
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:07,211
designed to reduce disease and you know,
the more parents that adhere to it,

293
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,570
the more not only their children be
protected,

294
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:16,280
but you have some kids who are immune
deficient and so unless the kids around

295
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,310
them are protected,
then it puts those kids at risk and

296
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:23,300
there are diseases like measles or
purposes that all it takes is a small

297
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:27,920
cluster and then mostly those diseases
would be coming in from overseas,

298
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:32,570
but you can get infection and in some
European countries you've had dads

299
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,180
because the kids weren't vaccinated.

300
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,440
I don't think the US government is going
to come out with any negative

301
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,600
statements.
There may be a commission,

302
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,300
and fortunately if she look at the
facts,

303
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,560
the facts are quite unequivocal.
Uh,

304
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,730
we certainly are speaking out in favor
of vaccines.

305
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,600
So I,
I,

306
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,190
uh,
you know,

307
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,680
I'm a little surprised that we have to
stick up for them,

308
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:59,681
but it's true in every country that you
get these rumors and particularly in

309
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,150
today's media,
those rumors can get out.

310
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,350
And I had the facts because the rumors
were sort of more salacious or,

311
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,580
uh,
you know,

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,190
contrary to what you've been told,
type things,

313
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,420
uh,
here,

314
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm sure we'll have a chance if
necessary,

315
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,450
to go through the facts again in and get
a clear positive message from the

316
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,940
government.
And the risk is if vaccines,

317
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,970
some have people are scared of having
vaccines,

318
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,630
the risk is,
well,

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,640
there were engaged right now in polio
eradication.

320
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,320
And the only way that succeeds is to get
95 percent of the kids to have these

321
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,780
vaccines.
And there we found,

322
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,870
we ran into a form of anti vaccine
sentiment that's even worse than us.

323
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,720
Rumors and that is that to terrorists
groups.

324
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,070
One in Nigeria,
Boko Haram and another one in Pakistan,

325
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:52,970
Afghanistan,
the polar bond said that vaccination was

326
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,740
a US plot and you know,
would sterilize women and it was a very

327
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,980
bad thing and they took the women who
are going out to the children's houses

328
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,810
in getting these oral drops,
oral polio vaccine,

329
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:10,430
and actually killed a number of them.
And so those negative rumors,

330
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:15,140
the only reason we still have polio
today that were not done is because of

331
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,200
that part of Nigeria that bulk roms
caused armrest in the border areas,

332
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,490
including Baluchistan in Pakistan where
there've been these anti-vaccine

333
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,930
sentiments.
So you know,

334
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,550
our risk is,
is,

335
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,620
is simply those negative things.

336
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,100
So it's not just in rich countries that
we run into this.

337
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,370
It absolutely is causes deaths.
If parents don't know,

338
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,400
bring your kids in and,
and get them fully vaccinated and your

339
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,990
drive to eradicate polio is to show that
you can do it.

340
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,050
Well.
It'll be.

341
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,050
It started in 1988 when it already had
been eradicated in the Americas.

342
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,100
So these were the for the US in the
sixties.

343
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:59,230
The rest of the Americas in the
seventies showed that it could be done.

344
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,110
And so in 1988,
uh,

345
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:05,610
well before our foundation was involved,
a rotary and a number of other

346
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,980
organizations said,
let's get rid of this.

347
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,340
And it's been harder than was expected
just because of these sentiments,

348
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:15,510
you know,
here we are in 2016,

349
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,690
[inaudible] 17 last year,
less than 50 cases.

350
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,640
So we are very,
very close.

351
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,800
In fact,
there are so few cases now,

352
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,990
the way that we track where the virus
is,

353
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,640
is we go and look at sewage samples and
we see because a lot of kids,

354
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,250
uh,
get infected and pass along without

355
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,040
getting paralyzed.
And so it's only through the sewage

356
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,960
samples.
We know that they're still about four

357
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:41,961
places in Pakistan and Afghanistan and
one place in Nigeria that we,

358
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,430
we haven't gotten there yet.
All right.

359
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,420
Let's see.
Next question.

360
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,030
Uh,
I got to see a car number one.

361
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,520
Thank you both so much for being here.
My question again,

362
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,410
sorry,
is a,

363
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,600
a little bit on the political spectrum.
I was wondering what you're both most

364
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,450
hopeful about in this new political
environment we have.

365
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,980
And also what you're both most worried
about,

366
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,780
you want to take hope are worried more
than.

367
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,700
Well,
I'm,

368
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,630
I'm,
I'm confident that America will move

369
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:14,631
ahead.
It's been no from the time I was born

370
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,650
until now.
The real GDP per capita in this country

371
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,300
is one of six for one.
I mean,

372
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,150
nobody ever dreamt that would be
possible.

373
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:27,780
And when you look at what's happened in
this country over 240 years,

374
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,950
you know,
it's,

375
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,980
it's an absolute miracle.
When I went to Columbia business school,

376
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,850
September 19,
51 woman in the class,

377
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,630
I mean,
this country moves forward and uh,

378
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,150
you can't stop it.
So I'm enormously off.

379
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,600
I say the luckiest person born in the
history of the world was the baby being

380
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,480
born today in this country.
And we will go and,

381
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,310
you know,
everybody,

382
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,940
half the country always is going to be
able to somewhat unhappy close to half

383
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,110
about the last election.

384
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,030
But I grew up in a household,
uh,

385
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,820
in the late 1930 [inaudible].
My Dad was very republican.

386
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,150
Yeah.
My sisters and I didn't get dessert

387
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,960
unless we said something bad about
Roosevelt.

388
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,910
I mean it was just,
it was required and I heard all these

389
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,230
apocalyptic views about after his third
term,

390
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,620
there'll be no more elections.
I've been hearing that all my life and

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,050
you know,
year after year after year with

392
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,680
occasional hiccups and,
and an occasional seizure like we had in

393
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,700
2008,
nine,

394
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,850
but this country,
it's all profit folks.

395
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,684
I mean,
you know,

396
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,660
when I came in just think of what it
would have been like in 17,

397
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,030
76,
nothing here and now we've been the

398
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:39,090
velocity of change and just keep moving.
I mean guys like bill,

399
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,830
you know,
they don't quit,

400
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,110
you know,
I mean he,

401
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,140
he moves on to something like polio.
He mentions 50 cases in the world.

402
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:47,590
There were more than 50

403
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
in the ward where I went when I was a
teenager to see a friend of my sisters

404
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,390
and they're all these rocking machines
and everything.

405
00:20:55,391 --> 00:21:00,391
They were destined to a terrible,
terrible life was just one ward in Omaha

406
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,660
and now that's,
you know,

407
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,360
that's the yearly total.
Thanks.

408
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,990
Initially the as well as currently the
rotary in some,

409
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,530
but people kept working on it.
This world moves forward and it's been

410
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,560
doing.
I bought my first stock when I was 11 in

411
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,600
April of 19.
Forty $2.

412
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,910
100.
If you haven't looked at 20,000,

413
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,080
something good must have happened
and it's going to keep happening.

414
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,070
Phil,
I know you share the optimism.

415
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,710
What about concerns?
Well,

416
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:32,711
their optimism is partly that I think
American innovation is strong support

417
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:40,031
for research is by and large bipartisan
and so whether it's health breakthroughs

418
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:43,340
or even energy breakthroughs,
I think you know,

419
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,090
every year that goes by we're going to
have more of those things.

420
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,820
Now.
This administration is new enough.

421
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:52,730
We don't know how their budget
priorities will come out.

422
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,940
You know,
there are things like foreign aid which

423
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,250
is a small part of the budget,
about 30 billion year,

424
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:02,420
but that means to us is the biggest that
every time there's new leadership we

425
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,840
have to go in and articulate the
benefits.

426
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,630
It's well spent.
It's not the image that people have in

427
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:11,750
the past,
and so right now I think there's a lot

428
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:16,751
of intensity a to make sure we get that
message out and get both in terms of the

429
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:22,730
executive branch and the Congress to
maintain amazing things like the

430
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,310
president's malaria initiative or
Pepfar,

431
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,660
which is an HIV thing.

432
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,450
These things started under President
Bush.

433
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:33,830
And so our foundation's had a great
working relationship with democratic and

434
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,420
Republican administrations.
Most people wouldn't realize that US

435
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,120
foreign aid as a percentage of the
economy,

436
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:46,121
which is generally how it's measured,
reached its low point in 1999,

437
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,280
uh,
under the Clinton administration.

438
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:50,630
Now,
I'm not saying it was the

439
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:53,120
administration,
it was a mix of the administration and

440
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,530
the Congress.
Uh,

441
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,090
then,
uh,

442
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,840
during those Bush years,
it went up fairly substantially.

443
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,290
Now the economy helped with that,
but these initiatives were really

444
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:07,760
amazing and you know,
I'm hopeful that maintaining or even

445
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:12,350
growing these initiatives will be a
priority when there's a lot of talk

446
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,200
about tax cuts and different spending
activities.

447
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,390
And so it is a bit up in the air,
uh,

448
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,380
during these months ahead.
And you've often made the point that no

449
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,260
matter how big the private contributions
are,

450
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,260
sometimes in terms of tiers,
sheer scale,

451
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,130
you need a government.

452
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,650
Yeah,
somebody asked me today,

453
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,880
you know,
it Pepfar,

454
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:35,260
which is,
this aids program was canceled when

455
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,710
private philanthropy and make up for it.
Well pepfar's over 5 billion year.

456
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:44,711
That is this one aid program,
which is a phenomenal thing that's saved

457
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,150
a over 10 million lives that's larger
than our foundation,

458
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,430
which is,
uh,

459
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,450
the largest in the world.
So there's no possibility the government

460
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,070
sector,
US,

461
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,930
UK,
other European donors,

462
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,560
that's $130,000,000,000 here in coal
that's uplifting these poor countries in

463
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:09,530
health and education.
And if we lose the consensus around

464
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,040
that,
if,

465
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,040
if people draw inward too much,
the we will hurt progress and there will

466
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:20,480
be millions of lives lost because of it.
One thing that might be mentioned,

467
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,160
Charlie,
who is that

468
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,850
the difference between now and 60 or 70
years ago in the ability of really

469
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,840
bright people,
really innovative,

470
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,420
really energetic people to get financed
to do things is,

471
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,420
is dramatically better than than it was
at that time.

472
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:40,290
So now if you've got good ideas and
there's good ideas right in those crowd

473
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:45,090
and you've got energy,
it's far easier to get financing to move

474
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:48,270
forward.
Those ideas then you couldn't 50 or 60

475
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,620
years.
Is that because of the internet or

476
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,910
crowds crowd sourcing of what is it?
Just lots more capital and people more

477
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,670
optimistic about it.
People are very optimistic on business,

478
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,250
but better ways to connect the tail
capital and absolutely the idea,

479
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,980
it's dramatic.
It's dramatic and willingness to take

480
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,120
risk.
Uh,

481
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,880
you know,
the first venture capital stuff is in

482
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:12,150
the 19 sixties and it's tiny.
Uh,

483
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,180
Microsoft,
when we were taking outside investment,

484
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,910
we took a,
uh,

485
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,990
at a valuation of $20,000,000,
we took a million dollars for five

486
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,040
percent of the company.

487
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,130
I'll do it retroactive.
And you had your chance,

488
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,660
you had your chance.
We,

489
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
we,
we never spent the money.

490
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,960
That is our business was profitable
enough.

491
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:36,570
We really didn't need to do that,
but we wanted people on our board to

492
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:38,240
give us advice.
And uh,

493
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,610
there's an episode of Silicon Valley
where all these venture capitalists are

494
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,250
courting this guy.
And that really reminded me a lot.

495
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,880
It was like by that time,
which was 1984,

496
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,110
there were dozens of venture capitalists
and that's something that other

497
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:58,590
countries have tried to duplicate and
they found a in small part,

498
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,200
but not nearly as well.
This,

499
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,210
this willingness to take risks.
The idea that if you have the failure,

500
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,040
it's not a mark of shame that,
hey,

501
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,180
what's your next startup going to be?
You heard of sacred pumps.

502
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:13,181
He gets his ideas from Silicon Valley
a card,

503
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,800
let's say where the cards are.
Okay,

504
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,300
number three,
take the cart right there.

505
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,620
So you started this talk about how
you're able to make a model and it won't

506
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,040
accurately predict what happens.
And on the other side of the coin,

507
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:33,610
I was wondering what happens when you
create such well developed predictive

508
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:37,740
technology and what are the
ramifications and implications of that

509
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:38,574
outcome?

510
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,900
Well,
I don't think our predictive,

511
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,600
uh,
you know,

512
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,140
was going to be like an oracle warm
nickname is the oracle of Omaha.

513
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,370
But you know,
the percentage of times you can predict

514
00:26:55,561 --> 00:27:00,561
things like macro economics because they
involve a emotional sentiment.

515
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,810
You know,
we're a long ways away from that.

516
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,100
The biggest modeling thing I'm involved
in as a group that models diseases,

517
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:12,540
so we look at HIV or tuberculosis and
understand,

518
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,910
okay,
what do we have to do in terms of

519
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,490
diagnosis and drugs to get these things
down.

520
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,540
Once we finished polio will go on and
our next big challenge,

521
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,080
which will take decades,
but I expect we'll be done in my

522
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,820
lifetime is malaria eradication.
So these models aren't nearly at the

523
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:33,780
point where they can take human
sentiment into consideration,

524
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,840
into the field of economics at a very
basic question about what we should have

525
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,090
done differently before the financial
crisis.

526
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,040
There really is no consensus whether
it's with the public or inside the

527
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,930
professional economists.
They agree that some of the emergency

528
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:55,980
treatment we did was necessary and
important.

529
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,830
And you know,
I wish I was better understood,

530
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,500
but the,
in terms of the root causes,

531
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,970
it's actually a little disconcerting how
little our models,

532
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:10,971
our understanding a explain how that
imbalanced got so extreme.

533
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,700
Alright,
where are number two?

534
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,280
I'm in school here at Columbia and I
wanted to ask,

535
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,920
you were talking about that you love
reading.

536
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,850
I wanted to ask you if you have a
particular book that it changed your

537
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:30,640
life,
like the way you think about things and

538
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,170
I also wanted to ask,
um,

539
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,290
what is the thing that you admire the
most about each other?

540
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,020
Like you build about worrying and the
other way around.

541
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,770
Thank you.

542
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,690
They sort of touched on the,
on the second question,

543
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:43,900
but go ahead and maybe want to add to it
books though first changed your life.

544
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,540
Well,
a book that changed my life when it was

545
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,710
bio fellow who taught here at Columbia,
Benjamin Graham and I read the book when

546
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:53,590
I was 19 called the intelligent investor
and I'd,

547
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,580
I'd been interested in investments since
I was maybe seven or eight,

548
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:01,060
but I'd never.
And I'd read every book in the Public

549
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,430
Public Library.
Why do you think you were interested in

550
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:08,431
investing when you were seven or eight?
Because I was too dumb to get interested

551
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:10,764
in.
Poor.

552
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,340
My Dad,
my dad had it

553
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,770
very small investment for and I would
just get on,

554
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,170
I read all the books that he had there,
waiting to go to a luxury or whatever it

555
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:23,880
might be,
and then I went to the public library

556
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:28,881
and read them all and it just was a
fascinating subject to me and and but I

557
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:33,270
didn't have any.
I knew what everybody thought and all of

558
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,170
that at an early age,
but what Graham wrote made sense.

559
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,480
I just happened to pick that book up at
a bookstore in Lincoln,

560
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:44,481
Nebraska to per se did.
Is there something about your core

561
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,460
competence that made investing in the
perfect place for you to be?

562
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,920
It certainly wouldn't be a pro football
player.

563
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,690
I loved her.
It was a question of zeroing out the

564
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,800
other incompetencies and I was left with
one thing.

565
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,800
No,
I just allocation of capital.

566
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,720
I was actually wired in a way that was
just wouldn't be something I would be

567
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:08,030
good at.

568
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,620
What so what?
Why I didn't what way high.

569
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,100
I can't tell you precisely,
but I,

570
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,800
I,
I've got the right temperament for it,

571
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,340
which is much more important than Iq.
If you've got more than 120 points of

572
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,010
Iq,
so sell the rest of somebody else.

573
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,360
You don't need it investments,
which,

574
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,310
but you do need the right temperament.
You do it.

575
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,200
You don't have to be able to think for
yourself.

576
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,240
And getting back to the uh,
earlier question,

577
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,330
the first question I asked myself,
when I look at the businesses,

578
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,390
you know,
is it important and easy,

579
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,000
what I can determine about this
business?

580
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,500
And a lot of them don't make it.
Now Bill is looking for hard questions

581
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,320
that plague society and where intellect,
the money may make a difference.

582
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,390
They may not for awhile,
but he's taking on the tough things.

583
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:54,460
I take my job is to find easy things.

584
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,370
I'm looking for one foot bars to step
over,

585
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,440
you know,
rather than eight foot bar to jump over.

586
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,010
But that's not irrational if you're,
if you're looking at the investment

587
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,500
universe.
But reading is key.

588
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,200
I on the biography,
on the,

589
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,360
on the book thing.
I know I will tell you a wonderful book

590
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,410
to read.
I can tell you a number of intelligent

591
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,420
investor would obviously if you're in
the investment field,

592
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,600
but Katharine Graham's autobiography is
a marvelous book and that's absolutely

593
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,650
honest,
told by an incredible woman who had an

594
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,651
incredible life and then honestly and
someone who you knew very well adjusted

595
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,760
with him and she was a bit reluctant and
had to be assured that she was afraid of

596
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,870
me actually
a book.

597
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,290
But what makes that book so much?
It just,

598
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,370
it is such a broad range of human
experience,

599
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,100
honestly told.
I mean you couldn't have nobody in

600
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:53,680
Hollywood could write up a,
you know,

601
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,790
a scenario that she lived through and,
and just just see that world develop how

602
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,270
she reacted to it and you can learn so
much.

603
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,670
My partner,
Charlie Margaret just loves Ben

604
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:06,901
Franklin.
You know,

605
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:07,660
I mean,
he,

606
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,493
I mean,
you know,

607
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,560
it.
You can learn from other people and

608
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,300
their mistakes.
And I find a biography.

609
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,630
It was my favorite part of the reason
you love biographies,

610
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,240
Barbie.
Part of the reason you love biographies.

611
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,130
Where is it card?
Uh,

612
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,110
right here,
just come here.

613
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,850
I,
I'm having a hard time seeing the card.

614
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,430
So that right here where the hands are
raised.

615
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,640
Wow.

616
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,510
I'm a senior here at the college.
I'm also a gates millennium scholar.

617
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,250
My family over here.

618
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,550
So I'd like to ask.
So what both of you do and a lot of risk

619
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,660
and sometimes you have to face the fear
of failure without risks.

620
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,650
So I'm asking how did you overcome that
fear and what steps did you take to do

621
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:58,130
that?
Well,

622
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I think I was very lucky that uh,
when I was in high school,

623
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:08,891
the computer was brought in there and I
developed a fascination for,

624
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,010
became kind of fanatical about it so
that,

625
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,200
you know,
I didn't view it as risky.

626
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:19,610
I viewed it as this kind of fun hobby.
Even when I went to college,

627
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,920
which I didn't finish,
but I spent time

628
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,020
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts,

629
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,140
the,
I wasn't sure that would be my life's

630
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,990
work.
Now as the chip came along and made it

631
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:37,130
mainstream,
it became very obvious that something

632
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:40,760
dramatic was going to happen.
And so my,

633
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,600
my passion,
my hobby and the area I could start this

634
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:49,601
company right at the beginning of the
revolution that coincided in a nice way.

635
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,370
And I never felt it was risky.
I,

636
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,650
you know,
if Microsoft had failed,

637
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,070
I didn't have kids or anything,
I could go back to school and uh,

638
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,950
you know,
finished my degree and go get a job

639
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:08,360
somewhere.
I was very risk averse in,

640
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,350
in running the company.
I always made sure we had enough money

641
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:17,351
in the bank to pay everybody for at
least a year if nobody paid us at all

642
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,310
because this idea,
I was hiring people who had kids and

643
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,250
families and they were moving to work
there.

644
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:26,240
And here I was,
you know,

645
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,600
19,
20 years old and sort of telling these

646
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:34,470
people I'd be paying their salaries.
So I was actually very conservative on a

647
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:38,150
financial point of view.
And one of the few arguments I have with

648
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:41,060
Steve Balmer,
who came in and played a phenomenal role

649
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,020
in the success of the company was how
many people could he hire a [inaudible].

650
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,420
I was trying to be so conservative,
but I let him go full speed and uh,

651
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,730
you know,
it turns out our financial success meant

652
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:56,510
that we never had a conflict about that.
But,

653
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,080
you know,
I think it's great to be risk taking,

654
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,090
uh,
particularly when you're young trying

655
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:05,570
out different things,
fields that aren't very popular that you

656
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:09,280
might enjoy,
but I never got into a position where I

657
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,470
was taking a,
actually in any meaningful sense.

658
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:13,760
I was taking a big risk.
I mean,

659
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:17,000
the risk of you would not do have acted
because you felt the train was leaving

660
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,020
the station.
Yeah.

661
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:20,320
And it was so clear,
uh,

662
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,890
that,
you know,

663
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,200
this was going to happen and this was so
much fun.

664
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:25,210
I mean,
you know,

665
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,770
I was a fanatic.
I didn't believe in weekends.

666
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,350
I didn't believe in vacation.
Uh,

667
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,710
my mom had to negotiate with her.
I'd come once a week for dinner.

668
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,080
Uh,
no matter who the guest was.

669
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,920
That's right.
That's right.

670
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,400
But Warren,
you have often said you still tap dance

671
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:44,580
to work adequate.
You can paint with your own colors.

672
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,481
Yeah.
I,

673
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,830
I,
I get,

674
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,410
I'm as excited about tomorrow in terms
of what is going to happen if I wasn't

675
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:53,940
when I started.
I was having a lot of fun when I

676
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:57,460
started,
but I'm having just as much fun now and,

677
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,210
and I was.
When I was here at Columbia,

678
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,960
I had terrible fairer.
It was impossible for me to speak in

679
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,310
public.
I mean I wasn't able to do it.

680
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,560
I actually read an ad in the New York
Times.

681
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,480
I went down to midtown,
signed up for a course,

682
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:12,330
gave the guy a check and then stopped
payment on the check.

683
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:13,560
I mean it just,
I just petrified.

684
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:16,470
But finally I actually,
after you get through,

685
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,200
we're here with me today.
Maybe your wish I'd stayed afraid of

686
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,730
public speaking,
but that's another question.

687
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,610
When I got out of the home,
all I finally decided just had to do it.

688
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:27,060
So I gave a guy $100 in cash and once I
bartered with other dollars in cash,

689
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,320
I jump off the Grand Canyon to get my
money.

690
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,180
So
it changed my life.

691
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:37,950
But I would say this don't fear failure.
Almost everything that's turned out,

692
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,300
I got turned down by Harvard is the best
thing ever happened among others.

693
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,280
Some good things that happened that
seemed good at the time.

694
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,390
Don't worry about it.
Don't let it eat at you or look back.

695
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:52,050
Just keep going because you're going to
have some things and forgot them.

696
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,040
Go,
go forward.

697
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,860
I want to go to the back of the room.
I back there

698
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,500
wherever number three is.

699
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,430
Hi,
my name is matthew man.

700
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,170
I'm a first year at Columbia business
school.

701
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Both of you had a moment where you went
out on your own and I guess my question

702
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:11,420
would be if you were to do it all over
again,

703
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:14,450
you're in our shoes.
What industry would that be in?

704
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,490
Where would you start your own business
today?

705
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,760
I did the same thing.
Yeah,

706
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,660
but one thing I'd be a failure than
anything else probably.

707
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,090
I mean,
no,

708
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,390
I mean I've had.
I had fun when I was in my twenties,

709
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:30,760
in my thirties.
Now I made $86,

710
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,320
75,
so I,

711
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,740
I advise students as much as possible.
Look for the job that you would take if

712
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,430
you didn't need a job.
I mean you don't sleep,

713
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:41,680
walk through life,
but don't,

714
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,840
don't say it's all going to be great and
I'll do this and I'll do that,

715
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,250
you know,
I'm just marking time to get to be older

716
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,950
that I've told people.
That's like saving up sex for your old

717
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:51,784
age.

718
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,890
Yeah,
there's not a good idea.

719
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,530
What are you urging them to do?
I'll explain.

720
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,070
Guess what I'm talking about

721
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,250
it just,
yeah,

722
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,030
you really want to be doing what you
love doing and you can't necessarily

723
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:22,410
find it on your first job.
Right?

724
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,390
But don't give up before you find it.

725
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,290
No.
You've had the unique experience a

726
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,160
because of your curiosity be because of
your involvement in,

727
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,190
in global health.
Just see the impact of a lot of other

728
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:34,510
areas,
uh,

729
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,980
whether it's biomedicine

730
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,040
or whether it's,
you know,

731
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,680
a whole range of other things other than
computer science.

732
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,100
If you were going to drop out of Harvard
today,

733
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,260
which field would you be most likely
attracted to?

734
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,380
Well,
I love the hard sciences and there's

735
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:00,250
some phenomenal things that people will
get a chance to be part of a,

736
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,480
I'd still probably pick computer science
because the work in artificial

737
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:08,320
intelligence today is that a really
profound level,

738
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,271
uh,
in,

739
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:12,640
uh,
our ability not just to play games,

740
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,360
but that is a profound milestone.
The alphago work that the deep mine

741
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:21,520
people at Google were able to achieve
and that kind of technologies and all

742
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:25,630
the leading companies and a lot of the
universities with Ai,

743
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,480
creation of agents,
the ability to read and understand

744
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,310
material,
it is going to be phenomenal.

745
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:35,311
So anything connected with that I think
would be an exciting lifetime career.

746
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,300
I also think in energy we have the
imperative to have energy that's

747
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,360
reliable,
cheap and clean and no system available

748
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:49,440
today can provide that,
whether it's for rich countries or four

749
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,020
per poor countries.
And so the innovations there will be

750
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:57,190
profound and there's many paths that
could provide that solution.

751
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,710
Finally,
I think biology,

752
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,850
it's the most thrilling time,
you know,

753
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,780
we are going to figure out a obesity
cancer,

754
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,360
her,
even things that are very hard like

755
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,230
depression because the,
you know,

756
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,600
the mind is,
is,

757
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,350
is even more complicated than other
parts of the body.

758
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,570
I see this through the lens of the
diseases of the poor,

759
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:23,740
of the infectious disease where new
vaccines,

760
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:26,380
new drugs,
we are moving faster than ever.

761
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,220
And some of these are platform
technologies like DNA vaccines that are

762
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,740
going to give us,
just that one thing will give us lots

763
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:36,040
and lots of solutions.
And so working in that space,

764
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,530
uh,
is,

765
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,530
is phenomenal.
Now I say this to my children,

766
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,660
uh,
and you know,

767
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,700
they,
they may not want to do hard sciences.

768
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,670
The one who's picked wants to counsel
patients and,

769
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,760
and be a doctor and even more than the
science piece,

770
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,730
that relationship with patients is what
grabs her.

771
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:59,320
So everybody has their own taste.
But in terms of big impact,

772
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,530
those three higher science problems
would be at the top for me.

773
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,183
Alright,
next,

774
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,310
right here,
right next to number one.

775
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,863
Hello?
Uh,

776
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,300
thank you guys for being here.
Also,

777
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,310
thank you to Mr Gates.
I am also a gates scholar and without

778
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:16,210
your foundation I'm going to be here.
Uh,

779
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,350
many industrial based communities have
been severely affected with higher

780
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,650
levels of unemployment due to the
increasing utilization of automation

781
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,340
which ends up displacing workers.
What do you mean?

782
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,980
What do you believe is a possible
solution to unemployment arising from

783
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:32,760
automation?
It's a good question because there's a

784
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:36,500
lot of about globalization and all of
that and a lot of other people step

785
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,680
forward and,
and talk about how technology and the

786
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:44,120
impact technology is having on jobs and,
and the demand for new kinds of skills.

787
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,270
Yeah.
And we were here in 1800 and conducting

788
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:51,050
this
and somebody would point out that

789
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,930
eventually tractors would come along
and,

790
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:59,240
and better fertilizer and had that 80
percent of the people are now employed

791
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:02,960
on the farm and in a couple of hundred
years it's going to be two or three

792
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:04,850
percent.
And what are we going to do with all

793
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:05,451
these people?
Well,

794
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:09,580
the answer is we release them.
We Keynes wrote something about it and

795
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:12,920
something called essays on persuasion
and he wrote a 1930 about what a more

796
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:17,921
prosperous society would become,
like any actually postulated that,

797
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,690
uh,
in 100 years and we're now 87 years old

798
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,180
from the,
that there would be four to eight times

799
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,900
as much output per capita and he's
remarkable,

800
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,830
but he didn't quite get out my get
distributed.

801
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:35,831
But the idea more output per capita,
which is what the progress is made on

802
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,910
productivity,
that,

803
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,800
that should be harmful,
decide is,

804
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,520
is crazy.

805
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,260
I mean the distribution may be a
problem,

806
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,740
but if one person could push a button
and turn out everything we turned out

807
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,380
now is that good for the world,
are bad for the world.

808
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,790
You know,
you'd have to figure out how to

809
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,640
distribute it.
But,

810
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,380
but you'd free up all kinds of
possibilities for everything else.

811
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,640
So you,
every,

812
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,350
everything should be devoted initially
to getting greater productivity.

813
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:06,290
But people who fall by the wayside
through no fault of their own,

814
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,500
as the goose lays,
golden eggs should still get a chance to

815
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:12,440
participate in that prosper me.
And that's where government comes in,

816
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,060
right?
Building to add to that.

817
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,933
Yeah,

818
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,670
the problem of excess is a different
problem than a problem shortage.

819
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,440
You know,
if all the tractors,

820
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,670
computer stopped working,
then we would have problems of shortage

821
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,180
there.
Uh,

822
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,390
and you know,
we just wouldn't have enough people to,

823
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,750
to make the output a problem of excess
really forced us to look at the

824
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,650
individuals affected and take those
extra resources and make sure that

825
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:44,651
they're directed to them in terms of
reeducation and incomes policies and the

826
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:49,110
need for labor in terms of smaller class
size,

827
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:52,140
helping handicap kids,
reaching out to the elderly.

828
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,730
The demand for Labor is not at zero.
If you ever get to that point,

829
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:59,700
fine,
you can shorten the work week and uh,

830
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,490
you'll,
you'll be just fine with that.

831
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:06,720
And so the,
this idea of taking an individual who

832
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:10,440
during their generation is affected,
I think there's a lot to be learned

833
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:13,140
about that.
A lot of thinking we have to do,

834
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,490
but the macro picture that it enables,
uh,

835
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,460
is,
is,

836
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,030
is an opportunity number two.
Also,

837
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:25,110
I'm urging people at the back.
So you have a chance and we want to go

838
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,270
back up to the balcony as well.
Uh,

839
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:30,480
so when I see number six,
welcome to six after two.

840
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,890
Yes.
Hi,

841
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:34,560
my name is Sam.
I go to Columbia College and my question

842
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,780
is,
what steps did you think needs to be

843
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:39,690
taken in order to improve public
education,

844
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,160
particularly in a economically depressed
areas of the United States?

845
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:49,700
Yeah,

846
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,533
yeah.

847
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,120
I think this is a super important issue
because the uh,

848
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,960
dropout rates,
although they've gone down a little bit,

849
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,250
they're still very high end and very
based on income and even kids who

850
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:09,130
graduate,
a lot of them don't enter college or

851
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:14,131
they do enter college and they end up in
these remedial courses for their reading

852
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:17,770
or math capabilities.
And those people have an extremely high

853
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:22,060
dropout rate from higher education and,
and they can incur debt.

854
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:26,750
They have a negative experience.
So we have a long ways to go in

855
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:30,010
education.
There are some very strong points of

856
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:31,900
light,
like here in New York City,

857
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:36,460
some of the charter schools are with
even less resources.

858
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:41,290
Then schools that large doing a
phenomenal job of educating kids.

859
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,450
There are a lot of countries,
particularly in Asia who spending way

860
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:51,070
less of their GDP on education,
are doing a great job educating their

861
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:53,190
kids and it's not just the top 20
percent,

862
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:58,191
they're bottom 20 percent is pretty
phenomenal in the case of China,

863
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:00,490
South Korea and Singapore.

864
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,390
And so looking at what we've learned in
charter schools in terms of building the

865
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:06,520
culture,
giving teachers feedback,

866
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,310
uh,
what is good teaching look like?

867
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:13,120
Do we give teachers a chance to learn
from each other about that interactive

868
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:16,570
element that makes the subject seem
relevant and important?

869
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,410
There are
great teachers,

870
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:23,470
but spreading those practices is,
has been very,

871
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:26,000
very tough.
And so I'd say it's a,

872
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,120
a top priority and we've taken our
foundation has that for our work in the

873
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,990
United States.
Education is,

874
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,170
is the top priority.
Whereas outside the US,

875
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,000
uh,
we,

876
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,460
we take on health.
It's a tough problem because the

877
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:44,110
institution of education are fairly
resistant to change and people are,

878
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,070
are not yet convinced by various
approaches very easily.

879
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,930
Uh,
but we need to keep at it.

880
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,793
We're going to,
you know,

881
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
stay in actually putting in more money
into trying to help help models.

882
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,170
Okay.
I'm up number six.

883
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,620
Hey,

884
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,960
first they weren't the time.
Well,

885
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:07,070
I witnessed the role of your foundation
and eliminating polio in India and I'm

886
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,860
really thankful for that.
Uh,

887
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,140
my,
my question is more on how to set the

888
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:15,050
basic level of debate in any,
any public sense.

889
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,280
Like there are many trade of how to
explain climate change policy for people

890
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:23,690
who are losing,
losing jobs in the coal sector.

891
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,750
How do you balance the current current
short term economic goals with the

892
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,903
longterm

893
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,010
peaceful transition to renewable sources
of energy?

894
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,040
No,
it's a good question.

895
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,280
The certain topics are so complicated
like climate change,

896
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,390
that to really get a broad understanding
is a bit difficult.

897
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:53,020
I'm particularly when people take any of
that complexity and trying and create

898
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:55,270
uncertainty about it.
Uh,

899
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,140
and in,
uh,

900
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,350
for example,
India's kind of paradigmatic in that

901
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,210
they want to electrify for all sorts of
good reasons having to do with health

902
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,540
and reading at night and a quality of
life.

903
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,370
And the question of should they delay
electrification,

904
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:16,690
uh,
for climate issues is going to be very

905
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:20,140
difficult.
The ideal is to innovate in such a way

906
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,840
that they can go full speed ahead on
electrification without emitting the two

907
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,430
that a,
the natural path of them today,

908
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:32,431
which is coal is the way to go.
And so we have a lot of cost reduction

909
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:37,801
to do because rich countries may be able
to buy premium electricity when you get

910
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:42,310
to middle income or lower,
that's just not going to happen.

911
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,570
And you know,
democracy has this allocate these

912
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:51,571
resources in terms of investing in the
future and things like research and

913
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,890
investing in,
in the present.

914
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,460
And when you have a problem like the
financial crisis,

915
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,450
then you do get a little bit of more of
short term thinking.

916
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:04,660
And I'm hopeful.
I think it's better for the world and

917
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:09,661
for the country if we can get back into
a little bit more of a focus on the

918
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,300
longterm.
We have some question from facebook.

919
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,320
Warren central tenant of your investing
is to invest for the long term.

920
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,580
And this comes from Brian White who says
how my bill and weren't convinced

921
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:24,550
investors to think beyond short term
returns,

922
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,610
to encourage world changing innovation.

923
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,800
Well,
I've spent my life trying to convince

924
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:36,050
people on the testing for the longterm
and listen to vinyl,

925
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,260
how to double my money tomorrow.
I'd probably have most with the short

926
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:42,760
term,
it's much.

927
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,290
It's much easier to invest for the long
term if you're just talking pure

928
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:50,530
investment because you know what's going
on in my view,

929
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,450
be very high.
Probably what's going to happen 10,

930
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,850
20 years from now in a major way.
And I don't have the faintest idea

931
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:00,040
what's gonna happen tomorrow or next
week.

932
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,510
But you wouldn't get if you're talking
about societal,

933
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:05,591
uh,
it,

934
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:09,040
it's,
it's very tough because politicians,

935
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,620
they selections either every two years
or six years.

936
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:16,570
And the way the way a particular
integrational districts have been

937
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:18,760
organized,
primaries have become more and more

938
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:23,761
important.
And so it's very hard to have a

939
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:27,410
politicians think of something as
wonderful for the country for 20 years,

940
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:27,980
but will cost

941
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,200
them the election two years from now.
And that,

942
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:33,680
that's a basic problem in a democracy
and it gets to be more of a problem as,

943
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,900
as we get arraigned,
we've arranged congressional districts,

944
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:42,920
so the primary dominates because a very
limited number of people turned out in

945
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:45,320
their motive,
tend to be on the extremes of both

946
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,154
parties.
So it,

947
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,320
uh,
it's not easy whether you're going to

948
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:52,130
make an investment in a company or
whether you're going to buy the company.

949
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,960
What are the factors that you have to be
that you're looking for?

950
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,970
Which test?
I'm looking for durable,

951
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:01,310
competitive advantage.
I'm looking for something that has a

952
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:06,120
moat around it for a considerable period
of time and I'm looking for and I'm

953
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,450
honest,
enabled management to run it because I

954
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:11,960
don't know how to run it myself.
And I'm looking for a purchase price

955
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:14,600
that's not excessive,
but it's better to pay a little too much

956
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:18,470
for something that's a very good
business a than it is to buy some

957
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:20,690
bargain,
a but really the company,

958
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:21,740
but not much of a future.

959
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,740
And I don't know,
I don't have a ability to predict with a

960
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,730
high probability of success the future
of most companies,

961
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,760
so I'm looking for the exception.
But the nice thing is if there's

962
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,550
thousands of companies out there,
I really don't have to be right on a

963
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:40,990
couple of.
I mean it's exactly the opposite of,

964
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,210
of baseball where you have called
strikes and the pitcher is trying to

965
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:46,190
throw it to it.
The worst part of the strike zone for

966
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:49,910
you.
And if he succeeds in getting into that

967
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:52,940
corner three times and you don't swing,
you're out in investing.

968
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:54,890
It's a no,
it's an old called strike things.

969
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:58,370
I can sit there all day and somebody
confirming one company after another.

970
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:03,371
And finally I got one of my sweet spot.
Both of you have chosen both wives and

971
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,270
partners.
Well,

972
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,720
I'm Charlie monger added what?
Charlie Munger changed my views.

973
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,820
He'd be flying them in a huge way in
terms of looking for the quality

974
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:18,110
companies and,
and,

975
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,060
and looking for the ability to make an
investment that would work out well for

976
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:25,550
five or 10 or 20 years as opposed to
something that might.

977
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,490
There might be one I called it a cigar,
but investing,

978
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,360
whether it was one puff left in the
cigar,

979
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,990
the cigar was free.
So he picked up these disgusting looking

980
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:36,920
things and got one puff out of them,
went onto another one and that worked

981
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,740
okay.
But it was small scale and it really

982
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,540
doesn't build something satisfying.
So,

983
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,260
so he,
he kept forcing me in the direction of

984
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:45,741
saying,
you know,

985
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:49,190
is this really a business we want to own
for forever?

986
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,210
And,
and,

987
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,140
uh,
do we want to get.

988
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,490
So it's like a marriage.
I mean,

989
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:54,470
do you want to get associated with this
person forever?

990
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,630
And it's a great way to look at things.
A bill,

991
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,611
uh,
your wife,

992
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,230
Melinda has added what?

993
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,210
Well,
she's four children,

994
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,890
three children.
How much time do I have?

995
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,300
She is your partner and she was there in
the philanthropy from day one at

996
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:18,330
Microsoft.
I had two partners for Mason.

997
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,460
I had Paul Allen really early days and
then Steve bombers when

998
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,220
it got bigger and we would not have
achieved anything what we without those

999
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,370
partnerships,
because you know,

1000
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,090
when things are tough,
when you're making big decisions,

1001
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:35,091
having somebody who's really in there
with you committed a for me.

1002
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:39,000
I couldn't have done without that,
for the foundation.

1003
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,430
Melinda's an amazing partner.
She thinks about the people issues

1004
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,940
better than I do.
She knows when I get over excited about

1005
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:48,990
the science,
she can,

1006
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,490
uh,
you know,

1007
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,640
make sure we're,
we're being realistic about it and it

1008
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:54,940
makes it fun.
You know,

1009
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,210
last week,
uh,

1010
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,480
I went to Europe to world economic form.
She went to Nigeria and then this

1011
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,920
weekend we just sat and talked about,
okay,

1012
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:04,320
what did we see,
what does that say about the work we

1013
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,540
should do a.
and so,

1014
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,540
you know,
I don't think I'd enjoy it without a

1015
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,180
partner in particularly someone amazing
like her.

1016
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,670
It's more fun with a partner.
I'm in Charlotte and I've had more fun

1017
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,450
working together that neither one of us
would have had individually and we have

1018
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:21,070
never had an argument after

1019
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,470
being together for 58.
You could talk every day.

1020
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,050
Not Anymore.
We know what the other guy's going to

1021
00:54:26,051 --> 00:54:28,210
say.
We just got,

1022
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,770
we talked it all out 15 years ago.
So if you see trolley and he says,

1023
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:36,400
why haven't you called?
And you'd say,

1024
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,720
well,
I knew what you say anyway.

1025
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,650
No,
there's no question about it.

1026
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,200
What am.
I shall have a lot of fun together.

1027
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,303
Alright,
right there.

1028
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,363
Let's say number two.

1029
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,813
Hi.

1030
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,300
Hi,
my name is molly is anger.

1031
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:50,730
I'm a student at Barnard College.
Um,

1032
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:54,930
I guess what I'm basically wondering is
what your main considerations are when

1033
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:59,400
you're choosing where to donate and what
causes to donate to and what the main

1034
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:01,500
challenges are that are associated with
that.

1035
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,700
Yeah,
I wholesale it because I made a choice

1036
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:09,300
that I wanted to have a.
well originally my first wife and I

1037
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,540
planned that I would pile up and she
went on pile it.

1038
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,800
But uh,
and then,

1039
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,580
uh,
that was plan number one.

1040
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:15,930
But she,
she died,

1041
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,150
uh,
in,

1042
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,940
in 2004,
and then I had the problem of figuring

1043
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:25,500
out the best way to distribute what
turned out to be a lot of money and I

1044
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:28,980
wanted,
I wanted some people who had similar

1045
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:32,550
values and similar objectives and what I
have,

1046
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:35,010
but I also want to,
people would pour in intelligence and

1047
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:39,180
energy in case of bill and Melinda,
a lot of their own funds,

1048
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:44,110
we'll work out a full time,
but who really saw society as I sought,

1049
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,810
which was at every life is of equal
value in and that if you start with that

1050
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,770
and then you figure what your might be
good at changing whether it's medicine

1051
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:56,520
or education or early learning or
whatever it may be.

1052
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,810
A,
you know,

1053
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:02,811
that was my answer was that the
wholesale and retail philanthropy would

1054
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,440
drive me crazy.
But wholesale,

1055
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,603
we are really like

1056
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,240
bill.
Yeah.

1057
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,240
For our work at the foundation,
the belief in innovation,

1058
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,030
which,
uh,

1059
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,280
both Melinda and I sought Microsoft.
Our question was,

1060
00:56:21,281 --> 00:56:23,980
okay,
how do we bring that kind innovation to

1061
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:27,760
help the world's poorest in.
We learned that coming up with new

1062
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:31,600
vaccines that although you can pay a lot
to have them created,

1063
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,660
the marginal cost comes down to less
than a dollar,

1064
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,900
so great getting a new vaccine for the
main cause of diarrhea or our pneumonia,

1065
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,330
uh,
that can be a phenomenal thing.

1066
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:48,331
So you're looking for these super
nonlinear dramatic things because as you

1067
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,890
know,
per poor person are compared to

1068
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:55,300
government funding,
philanthropy is actually quite small and

1069
00:56:55,301 --> 00:57:00,301
yet the funding vaccine projects,
the government isn't as good as that as

1070
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,050
a philanthropist who assembles a team.
And over time it's learning how to do

1071
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:09,310
that very well.
And we had models in a Rockefeller

1072
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,440
Foundation was a phenomenal foundation.

1073
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,400
The green revolution is just one of many
things that they did,

1074
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:17,830
which raised agricultural productivity
and saved,

1075
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,650
avoided hundreds of millions,
a starving.

1076
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:24,700
And so studying the other foundations
that have taken these big breakthroughs,

1077
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
uh,
and created model out of those that was

1078
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:31,060
very informative to the,
to what we've gone after.

1079
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,190
What's the most important lesson you've
learned though,

1080
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,580
about making investments from the
foundation today that you learned along

1081
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:42,640
the way?
Well,

1082
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:43,750
I think,
uh,

1083
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,260
when we started out,
I thought that just coming up with the

1084
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:51,520
new vaccine or drug alone would be
enough and that the world would then

1085
00:57:51,521 --> 00:57:54,460
take that and get it out to all the
children of the world.

1086
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,140
Uh,
you know,

1087
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,470
partly through field this,
I did that Melinda did,

1088
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:02,560
looking at the statistics,
that delivery system,

1089
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:08,370
it doesn't get out to a lot of the kids.
And so having to figure out how people

1090
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:11,650
are hired or how that was funded and
measure this,

1091
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,440
what's called primary health care,
uh,

1092
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,290
we were drawn into that out of
necessity.

1093
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,230
It didn't fit the normal sort of in the
lab,

1094
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,650
you know,
come up with this great concoction and

1095
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,490
uh,
and yet in order to achieve our goals,

1096
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,610
we needed to,
to think about those delivery pieces.

1097
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,220
In fact,
sometimes the state of the product

1098
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,320
actually had to be simpler in some ways
in order to get through that very

1099
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:42,580
limited delivery capacity.
And now we're getting to 86 percent of

1100
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,290
the world's children with vaccines.
It was,

1101
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,960
uh,
about 70 percent when we got started.

1102
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:51,070
So that's good increase.
We still have have 14 percent to go,

1103
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,730
one that have amazing a convening and
persuasive powers as well.

1104
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:01,660
So I mean they,
they bring something far more to it than

1105
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:03,580
just money.
I mean they,

1106
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,600
they work incredibly hard and do my
three children in their foundations,

1107
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:12,601
but they work incredibly hard at getting
governments involved in vaccines or

1108
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,460
whatever it may take.
And that,

1109
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,410
uh,
that just as you know,

1110
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
it's an extra dimension that I think
very few people have in the field.

1111
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:27,650
It's a hands on travel to Melinda is in
Africa and she's holding a little baby.

1112
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,500
I mean she is actually thinking,
you know,

1113
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,740
this good needs to be vaccinated,
has a decent chance in education,

1114
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,750
all that.
I feel the same way about the kid,

1115
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:39,360
but what I really think is going to have
a pee on me and on head was going,

1116
00:59:39,361 --> 00:59:41,970
I had.
So you know,

1117
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,510
there's just a difference in that human
touch that makes a big difference.

1118
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:50,400
I'm halfway in between.
I think he's closer to me number three

1119
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:51,590
and number four,
first one,

1120
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,560
then three,
then four

1121
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,850
small me at the Columbia business
school.

1122
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:01,350
If the current government were to ask
for your advice on immigration or

1123
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,080
healthcare reform,
what would you recommend to them?

1124
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,343
Lauren?

1125
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,340
Well,
on him,

1126
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,900
on immigration.
Well,

1127
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,570
immigration.
I mean this country is built on it.

1128
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,820
I always say to people through
immigration,

1129
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,780
let's put it in retroactively.
Everybody leaves

1130
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,560
this country and you think about it.

1131
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,820
Overdose before from me,
but we're sitting here in part because

1132
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:35,680
of two.
George immigrants who in 1939 and August

1133
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:38,950
signed the most important letter perhaps
in the history of the United States and

1134
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:41,610
you can.
You can go to the Internet and go to

1135
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,600
search thing and

1136
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,970
yeah,

1137
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,160
and just type in Einstein.
Roosevelt 1939.

1138
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,730
Leo's Alard and Albert Einstein to
immigrants came here.

1139
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,060
They both.
They came directly from Germany,

1140
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:07,130
large came from Hungary before that and
they told President Roosevelt that the

1141
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:12,870
Germans were likely to develop an atom
bomb which was likely to work.

1142
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:16,680
It's less than a full page and we'd
better get to work on something fast and

1143
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:20,820
that the Manhattan project came out of
that and it hadn't been for those two

1144
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:23,400
immigrants.
Who knows whether we'd be sitting in

1145
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:24,234
this room,

1146
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,263
immigration,

1147
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,563
I'm gonna,
let him handle,

1148
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,930
can do Andy Grove.
You'd go up and down,

1149
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,790
right?
It's,

1150
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,990
this country has been built on the west.
Exactly why?

1151
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,140
By immigrants and you can take them from
any country.

1152
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,480
Pretty good one.
And then they'd come here and they've

1153
01:01:48,481 --> 01:01:51,710
found something that unleash the
potential that the place where they left

1154
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:54,240
did not have,
were the product of it.

1155
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,090
Let me,
the question also is about healthcare.

1156
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:01,120
I mean,
what can you tell us about healthcare

1157
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,760
that you think is important in terms of
the consideration of what might happen?

1158
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,510
I mean,
if you were building a healthcare plan

1159
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,240
for America,
what would be the elements that you

1160
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,080
would want to

1161
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,413
include?

1162
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,650
Well,
there's no doubt that in order to

1163
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,280
provide decent healthcare,

1164
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:26,420
the percentage of GDP devoted to it is
going to go up over time.

1165
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,650
It's already very high and yes,
there's some efficiencies to be gained,

1166
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,090
uh,
in that,

1167
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,330
you know,
18 percent are so number.

1168
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:41,550
But as society ages,
as we come up with new things like joint

1169
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:43,140
replacement,
organ transplant,

1170
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:45,990
which are going to create lots of human
benefits,

1171
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,450
we're going to have to have more
resources overall,

1172
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:50,730
including more government resources for
healthcare.

1173
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:56,510
And so it's a tough problem because you
have both access problems today and you

1174
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:02,400
have costs problems today.
And you know,

1175
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,390
whenever I look at a problem,
I have this one simple lens which has

1176
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:10,440
those innovation should help here,
but in this case,

1177
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:14,100
innovation,
while it will provide breakthrough drugs

1178
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,920
that will save costs,
like if you can cure Alzheimer's,

1179
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,450
which we certainly haven't done yet,
that will save on huge longterm care

1180
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:22,170
costs.

1181
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,830
So we have these chronic diseases that
we've made less progress on,

1182
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,090
uh,
than,

1183
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,810
than some of the others.
And you know,

1184
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,850
the market mechanism to get Pharma to go
after those things.

1185
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,350
And the basic research,
those funds,

1186
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,110
I am quite optimistic that we'll have
some advances,

1187
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:42,111
but they'll also give us some very
expensive things that will mean we're,

1188
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:47,280
we're spending more money against it.
And I do hope you know that at some

1189
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:52,281
point that we really are calling on the
best minds to look at the incentives for

1190
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:57,480
the breakthroughs,
the most efficient system we have here.

1191
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,050
I think there's a lot of unhappiness in
the country now.

1192
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,400
A stems from the fact that the
healthcare system isn't delivering.

1193
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,020
And yet,
uh,

1194
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,940
you know,
people are saying less government,

1195
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,120
more government,
uh,

1196
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,180
you know,
I don't think they're being given the

1197
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,220
depth of education about why it's so
tough that over time will help them a

1198
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,500
vote for the rest of the depth of
explanation.

1199
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,290
Let me go,
I'll go to facebook and just a moment,

1200
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,870
but where was I promised three,
four to six.

1201
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,770
A three is there and six is up there.
So go three,

1202
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:33,510
six and we'll go to facebook.

1203
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,070
Hi,
my name is Josh Schaffer and I'm a

1204
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:42,071
dental resident at Columbia.
My question is for future doctors and

1205
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:44,190
dentists of America.
What,

1206
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:48,920
what advice do you have in giving about
having a proper balance of providing

1207
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:52,010
that health care,
but also mastering the concepts of

1208
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:53,600
business and economics?

1209
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,310
Well,
it told Gawande is incredible.

1210
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:03,230
Author.
He,

1211
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,990
in the current issue of the New Yorker
has a,

1212
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:12,100
uh,
the latest in a wonderful articles about

1213
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:16,130
the healthcare system and he's talking
about the people who do sort of heroic

1214
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:19,660
surgery,
like are paid twice as much as the

1215
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:25,110
people who are on an ongoing basis and a
great incremental way learning about the

1216
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:28,780
patient and seeing what works for them.
And He,

1217
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,810
it's a calling to say,
hey though,

1218
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,850
that part of the system needs to be run
better,

1219
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,070
needs,
needs more resources.

1220
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,300
Uh,
and,

1221
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,750
you know,
so I think it's brilliant that he's

1222
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,280
saying that.
And it also corresponds to what,

1223
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:45,400
uh,
what is working in some other countries.

1224
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:46,960
A six.

1225
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,890
Hello,
my name is Columbia College.

1226
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,680
So you both have invested a great deal
of money abroad,

1227
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:58,270
but there is a prevailing belief by some
that there are pressing issues in

1228
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,850
America.
There are poor people here,

1229
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,430
there are sick people here and we should
deal with that first before even

1230
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:06,730
tackling anything abroad.
So what are your thoughts on that?

1231
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:13,210
My own personal thought is that every
life is of equal value and uh,

1232
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,653
in many ways,

1233
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,460
many ways,
if you have a limited number of dollars,

1234
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:28,060
you actually can do more for more people
outside the United States.

1235
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:33,040
We do have greater resources here for
our 320 million people that exists

1236
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,500
around the world for seven plus billion
people.

1237
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,490
So if,
if you,

1238
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:42,750
you can improve the lot of more people
by intelligently spending a billion

1239
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,900
dollars or any other number,
uh,

1240
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,230
in other areas of the world actually
then here.

1241
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:51,280
And I know coming from Omaha and having
the money,

1242
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:52,330
I have people say,
well,

1243
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:53,800
why not spend it all in?
You know,

1244
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,690
you grow up hearing,
almost done all kinds of things for you.

1245
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:59,740
And I absolutely acknowledge that.
But in the end,

1246
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,150
if I've got x dollars to spend,
I can make life better for more people

1247
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:08,500
if I can have it intelligently allocated
in other parts of the world actually

1248
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:10,570
than the United States.
And that draws a fair amount of

1249
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:13,260
criticism.
But I live with because I just.

1250
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,103
What I believe

1251
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,940
all lives have equal value is really the
driving force behind my foundation.

1252
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:22,720
I'm an accident.
I won the ovarian lottery when I was

1253
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,810
born in the United States in 1930.
He was 40 to one against me.

1254
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,280
I was male that now it's 80 to one
against being a male in the United

1255
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,370
States in 1930.
I was just plain lucky my life had been

1256
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:34,960
partnered with.
Bill always said if I had been born a

1257
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,200
long time ago,
I'd have been some animals lunch because

1258
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:39,490
I can't run fast and I can't climb trees
and everything.

1259
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:44,930
And I'd be saying I allocate capital
and wouldn't work.

1260
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:51,660
And I was lucky but 79 out of the 80
weren't as lucky as I was at that time.

1261
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,783
Bill,
go ahead bill.

1262
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:54,610
Is it

1263
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:59,610
the helping people in other countries?
The foreign aid budget of the US is,

1264
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,180
is point eight percent of the budget and
there will be in,

1265
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:12,330
in the years ahead and discussion about
is that we're doing it saves lives for

1266
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
typically about a thousand dollars of
life saved and in terms of stability and

1267
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,250
countries,
uh,

1268
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:24,140
eventually being self sufficient and be
part of the world economy.

1269
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,870
There are some,
some huge benefits to that.

1270
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,680
So if we were talking about should we
spend 20 or 30 percent overseas?

1271
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:31,641
Okay.
You know,

1272
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,740
that would be a very interesting
discussion.

1273
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,480
But what we're trying to preserve a is
something that's gotten smarter and

1274
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,520
smarter all the time,
has proven benefits,

1275
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,740
all of which are things that our
foundation core invests,

1276
01:08:43,741 --> 01:08:47,330
invests in the same things like,
like the polio thing is,

1277
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:52,420
is point eight percent.
So I'm hopeful that in a big world that

1278
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,350
can remain a priority.
Or.

1279
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:56,790
Let me go to another facebook question.
This is from uh,

1280
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,140
uh,
Nadia says,

1281
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,660
how might bill and Warren encouraged
innovation,

1282
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,390
particularly among teens and young
adults?

1283
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:07,520
How do you encourage innovation?

1284
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,930
Well,
I think you have a market system

1285
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,500
provides rewards for it yet and we
haven't,

1286
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:17,700
I mean we,
we have an incubator for innovation in

1287
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:21,480
the United States and you know,
broken of school.

1288
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:27,050
Andy Grove can come from Hungary and I
mean it just welcomes it and thank God,

1289
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:31,560
I mean that's why we have the kind of
prosperity that we have.

1290
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:34,500
I mean the question of how it gets
divided as a secondary question and that

1291
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,420
is not good solid as well by the market
system,

1292
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:41,430
but our system is just designed for it
and look at what is happening.

1293
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:45,910
Number one.
Also,

1294
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,490
I want to make sure we get the people
that back so we would only have five

1295
01:09:48,491 --> 01:09:52,480
minutes left so there's a couple of
hands up in the back so please recognize

1296
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:53,190
it.

1297
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,640
Hi,
my name is Scott here.

1298
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:59,720
I'm a senior and the junior school as
men have such great influence.

1299
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:00,751
Uh,
I'm curious,

1300
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:03,090
and we touched a little bit about this,
the last question,

1301
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:07,440
but how you deal with reconciling your
convictions with maybe what is believed

1302
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:10,230
by the public,
maybe even a majority considering that

1303
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:14,580
you have the wealth and power and fame
to make such great things happen

1304
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,670
either.
Well,

1305
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,460
I don't see,
you know,

1306
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:27,460
the,
the convictions I have a,

1307
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:30,700
you know,
I love sharing them and talking to

1308
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:33,760
people and understanding where people
disagree.

1309
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:34,930
Uh,
you know,

1310
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,170
I can be overly science centric about
things.

1311
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:39,130
I,
uh,

1312
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,660
you know,
there's all sorts of clauses that are

1313
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,680
super important that our foundation,
because we have limited resources,

1314
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:49,220
we don't get to go and do.
There's,

1315
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,620
there's lots of diseases.
Uh,

1316
01:10:51,621 --> 01:10:56,621
there's aspects of education in a part
of the strength of philanthropy is its

1317
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:58,270
diversity and,
and,

1318
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:02,410
and so just by sharing the fact that
it's fun,

1319
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,390
it really can have measurable impact.
I hope that sets an example for all of

1320
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:10,300
philanthropy.
I don't happen to believe that,

1321
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,530
you know,
my voice should be that much louder than

1322
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:14,960
other people.
Uh,

1323
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,230
you know,
and so,

1324
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,870
you know,
some of these big political donations,

1325
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,763
you know,
at least,

1326
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,100
uh,
you know,

1327
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,460
I and worn as well,
you know,

1328
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:28,461
we've chosen not to have that be a huge
way that we're spending our money.

1329
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:31,110
That's a personal choice.
Uh,

1330
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:34,080
you know,
the money's being saved for,

1331
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,530
not for the megaphone,
but for the work of the foundation.

1332
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,210
We got a podium over certain short,
but people do not

1333
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,490
with a partner like Charlie monger,
you don't have to worry about my views

1334
01:11:46,491 --> 01:11:49,910
being accepted,
automatically point out the shortcomings

1335
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:52,550
of the,
the influence of money in politics.

1336
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:53,360
I agree.
The thing is,

1337
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,360
is bad news for this country,
I think citizens united was a terrible

1338
01:11:56,361 --> 01:12:01,361
decision and the idea that somebody can
pour millions and millions of dollars

1339
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:06,950
into a campaign and in certain cases and
not even be identified,

1340
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,650
I think really kind of

1341
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:13,160
goes counter to kind of America,
I believe in the two of you created

1342
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:16,400
along with blend and others created the
giving pledge.

1343
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,660
How's that going?
Going?

1344
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,720
Terrific.
Go conducted.

1345
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,210
It really is going to.
Philanthropy is kind of where it is.

1346
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:25,941
Exactly.
Yeah.

1347
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:26,780
Okay.
This is,

1348
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:27,840
um,
you know,

1349
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:32,490
we love philanthropy of all types and
part of the strength American clamp is

1350
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:37,491
actually people with very little who are
incredibly generous here though we said,

1351
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,410
for the people who are,
are super lucky to have over a billion

1352
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:45,260
dollars,
we want a group who are working together

1353
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,100
who are committed to give the majority
of their wealth away to learn from each

1354
01:12:49,101 --> 01:12:50,690
other.
What's worked,

1355
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,930
what hasn't worked,
how do you involve your kids?

1356
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,360
Uh,
how do you hire staff?

1357
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:59,000
And they'll find areas that are working
on together and cooperate,

1358
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:03,200
but we're not pulling any money.
And we thought we'd get 20,

1359
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,960
25 people together.

1360
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,860
And in fact,
now we're at 156.

1361
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,780
So it is a wonderful yearly eventide
made some great people.

1362
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,950
I do think that the quantity and quality
has gone up because we're getting

1363
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:21,770
together.
We'll never be able to measure that in a

1364
01:13:21,771 --> 01:13:25,820
direct way in a,
we're making special efforts in China

1365
01:13:25,821 --> 01:13:30,230
and India because now we have a lot of
welfare and that wasn't there before.

1366
01:13:30,231 --> 01:13:32,150
And uh,
in their own way,

1367
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:35,420
I think they,
by having a strong philanthropic sector

1368
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:39,350
that will help those countries and
therefore help the world was

1369
01:13:39,351 --> 01:13:41,480
interesting.
Now build an I are having dinner

1370
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:42,980
actually with the group tonight for
example,

1371
01:13:42,981 --> 01:13:43,814
but

1372
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,090
you go back 100 or a hundred 50 years,
people got wealthy by making some money

1373
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,850
from the oil refinery are still a mill
and building another one and every Ford

1374
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:55,150
with Volvo plant them build cars and
then they,

1375
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,630
it would be from actually from retained
earnings which eventually turned into

1376
01:13:58,631 --> 01:14:01,660
cash.
Now you can get rich very young just by

1377
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:06,250
having an idea and you can get that idea
monetize and capitalize in a way that

1378
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:09,070
you cannot believe.
So we are particularly interested in

1379
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:13,330
getting younger people interested in
philanthropy because there will be huge.

1380
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:17,470
There are huge fortunes by people that
are now in their twenties and thirties.

1381
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,740
And just think of what those potential
for that group.

1382
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,290
And so this thing has worked out way,
way better,

1383
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,960
including getting younger people to join
us.

1384
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,100
Number six.

1385
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:31,590
Hello,
my name is Christina Nunez.

1386
01:14:31,591 --> 01:14:35,820
I'm a fellow dental student to Josh.
Thank you for speaking with us today.

1387
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,030
Um,
I'm curious about your insight related

1388
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:43,710
to relationships.
I'm personally given a desire to honor

1389
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:48,711
myself and respect other individuals
have found it difficult throughout life

1390
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:54,350
to discern which relationships to really
foster and invest in and accept

1391
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:59,781
challenges from and which to kind of
forgo and abandoned because there are

1392
01:14:59,931 --> 01:15:03,030
more harmful than helpful.
Um,

1393
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:07,800
so are there any major life lessons that
you two have learned through your

1394
01:15:07,801 --> 01:15:09,420
personal experiences?

1395
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,660
Well,
that's a very important question and the

1396
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:16,661
more you will move in the direction of
the people that you associate with site,

1397
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,110
it's important to associate with people
that are better than yourself.

1398
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:23,200
And actually the most important decision
met.

1399
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:25,060
Ado Bank.
Not all of you will be the spouse you

1400
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:25,894
choose.
Okay.

1401
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:27,150
And,
uh,

1402
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,940
you really,
you want to associate with people who

1403
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,830
are the kind of person you'd like to be.
You'll,

1404
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:37,820
you'll move in that direction.
And the most important person by far in

1405
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:41,180
that respect is you respond to that.
I can't over emphasize how important

1406
01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:44,240
that is.
You're right that the friends you have

1407
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:48,260
a,
they will form you as you go through

1408
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:51,280
life and uh,
uh,

1409
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,770
makes good friends,
keep them for the rest of your life

1410
01:15:54,771 --> 01:15:59,240
would have them be people that you
admire as well as why come,

1411
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,190
they'll do that to that.

1412
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,090
Yeah.
Some friends do bring out the best in

1413
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:04,630
you,

1414
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,463
uh,

1415
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:07,640
and,
and so those,

1416
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:10,070
it's good to invest in those
friendships.

1417
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,403
Uh,

1418
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,790
and you know,
some friends challenge you about things

1419
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,010
you're doing,
uh,

1420
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,991
and that,
you know,

1421
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:20,960
that level of intimacy is great.
I wouldn't say that,

1422
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:21,800
um,
you know,

1423
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:24,710
I was so obsessed with work.
I didn't invest.

1424
01:16:24,711 --> 01:16:27,620
I'd say in my twenties and thirties as
much as I should have.

1425
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:31,190
It's really through Melinda and seen
know other people.

1426
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:32,024
I realized,
okay,

1427
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:37,210
that is really worth the investment,
to have those people as a,

1428
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,550
you're always there to help them and
vice versa.
