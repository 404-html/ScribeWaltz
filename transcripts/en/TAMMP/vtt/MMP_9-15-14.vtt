1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:01.900
Okay.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.490
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday.</v>

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.220
Sorry,
that was obnoxious for Monday.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.530
September 15th,
2014 how's it going?
How are you?

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.940
What's up?
I'm fucking house is hot as shit.

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.590
Goddamn AC.
I don't know what's going on with it.
I really got to stop doing this.

7
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.550
I've got to stop trashing my house because someday you know,
maybe I'll sell it,

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.030
you know,
and no matter how many photos I put up,

9
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.550
that makes it look like it's all shiny and new.
Come aboard.

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.800
We want to sell it to you.

11
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.680
It's my shit.
Oh,

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.430
they added the bottom floor in the 50s my shit.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.910
<v 0>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.950
<v 1>are you willing to dry rot wood?</v>

15
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.320
Because that's what I have behind all the plaster.
You see?

16
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.154
Sorry.

17
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.690
Now we're actually turning the fucking corner downstairs.

18
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.950
They've roughed it up and they are ready to now put the final touches

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.170
on a downstairs.
That should have been built like this to begin with.

20
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.550
You know what my downstairs basically is because this originally was a one floor

21
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:25.430
house.
It's like an expansive expansion franchise.

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.240
My downstairs when I bought this House on bill notes to me was the Tampa Bay

23
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.430
Buccaneers in 1977.
Okay.
And Sam,
that's Sam huff.
Gary hough.

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.220
Gary Gary Hoffa.

25
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.370
I think this is the name of the original Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
quarterback.
Um,

26
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.310
that,
um,
of that team that went,
oh,
and 14.
He designed the downstairs.
All right.

27
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.300
Hey designed the fucker downstairs.
So anyways,
everything has been corrected.

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.070
Everything has been aligned,
everything is square.
Everything is true.

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.740
Learning all these construction words.
All right.
That and uh,
Hey,

30
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.650
uh,
I don't know if you saw the last invoice,
but we're still waiting for payment.

31
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600
That's another big construction term.

32
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.060
You know what kills me?
Those motherfuckers,

33
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.240
they somehow they put a flat on when I'm on my,
I,
uh,
my bicycle,

34
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.540
it's not my bicycle,
it's the one I bought for Nia and she never used it,

35
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.243
you know?

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.780
So I actually ride it now I write it through the canyons.
No,

37
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.200
every once in a while take it out for a spin and a,

38
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.110
I should have known because the front tie needed a little bit of air.

39
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.490
But the back one was just done and I pumped him back up and everything was good.

40
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.370
I listened,
I didn't hear any sound,
so I thought it was fucking fine.

41
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:43.700
And then I went down there and you know,

42
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.670
just one of the added costs and I got to tell you if I was a cunt,

43
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.690
not saying I'm not,
but if I was like a a motivated,

44
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.890
if I was trying to make all American in the current category,

45
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.890
I would actually take the whatever's going to cost me to have somebody put a new

46
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.950
fucking inner tube in it.
If it was the front tire,
I do it myself,

47
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.560
but it's the back tire and a,
you know,

48
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.680
old freckles doesn't have time for that shit.
I could go on Youtube share,

49
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.681
I could do it not to change back tire and move all of that shit out of the way

50
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.490
and I could get all fucking greasy and then have to go down to home depot and

51
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.980
buy that fucking that,
that,
that sad.

52
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.150
That cuts through the grace and I'd be down there for nine hours,
you know,

53
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.780
and afterwards,
yeah,
I'd feel like a man,
you know,

54
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.260
or I could just drop it off and have somebody fucking do it.
And um,

55
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.240
I could sit here and eat a pizza.
No,
not at pizza.
Not a piece.

56
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.890
I got to have a salad.
I got to turn this shit around.
Um,
a couple of weeks ago,

57
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.020
I don't know what happened,
like two and a half weeks ago,

58
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:51.130
I had whatever the meal was that sent me back down the road,

59
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.870
eating bad and been eaten bad for two weeks.

60
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.780
And the other day I walked by the mirror and I knew I'd put on a few and I just,

61
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.960
I just was so fucking disgusted with myself,
you know,

62
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.620
and fuck all you assholes out there that say that fat shaming doesn't work.

63
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.490
You know,
it doesn't work.
It's what it really is,

64
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.590
is know you're fat and you don't want to hear it.
That's what it is.
I,

65
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.130
whenever I say shit about fat people,
it's not a negative way.
All right.

66
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.980
I'm trying to motivate you.
It's how I motivate myself.

67
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.420
I walked by the mirror and I look at myself when I go,
you fucking piece of shit.

68
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.430
Really.
All that fucking work.

69
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.790
We did all those months of work,

70
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.470
all those pull ups,
all those pushups,
all those fucking hikes.

71
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.650
And what did she do?
What did you do?
You get it.
Oh wait,
no,
wait.

72
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.470
That's what kills me about when you're at my age is I can live,

73
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.060
I can negate three months of being at the gym in four meals,

74
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.320
not for meals,
but like in a week and a week of just being an asshole.

75
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.500
Everything that I gained,
I can just fucking lose.
It's the,

76
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.710
it's the absolute worst.
So then if you don't know how to dye it,

77
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.970
what you do is then you start lifting weights and that type of shit and you keep

78
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.560
eating bad and all you're doing is you're putting these pex and biceps on top of

79
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:09.160
the big belly,
right?
Roll out the barrel.

80
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.270
We'll have a barrel of fun.
Right?
And He'd just become that guy,

81
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.440
that guy who just keeps lifting weights and keeps eating shit food.

82
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.540
And all you're trying to do is keep your man packs just a little bit out in

83
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.480
front of your fucking stomach.
And then what do you do?

84
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:27.730
You start pushing down the fucking pants.

85
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.560
You Belt Line's fucking digging into your pubes.
So dude,

86
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.570
I'm still a fucking dirty to winch way saint j j side to and high school and

87
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:41.350
he'd just keep pushing it down and push until the point it looks like somebody

88
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.370
yanked your belt and all the fat when boiling up to yeah,

89
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.770
literally bleeding just like that.
It was a bad sound effect,

90
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.371
but you know what I'm saying?

91
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:53.200
All the way up into your gut and then it ran into your fucking man pecs that

92
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.210
held it down and it's just fucking sitting there
cry,

93
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.570
caught between a rock and a hard place.

94
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.850
That'd be a pecs and you declare sorry.
Um,

95
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.100
so I'm trying to avoid that.

96
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.480
That's the hardest fucking thing is to lose weight and not lose muscle,
you know,

97
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.200
and fuck all you guys who are going to come in and meet with your GNC chemicals.

98
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.610
All right.
And talking about protein,
the size of your hand.
I've heard all of it.

99
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.800
I've heard all of it.
All right,

100
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.300
but what are you supposed to do when that fucking redneck comes on TV and says,

101
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:30.080
I got big news.
They've now put bacon in,
in,

102
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.810
in fucking cheese,
in the crust,

103
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.010
whatever the fuck he said actually retweeted the quote.
Why don't I look it up?

104
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.910
This is how fucked up it is,
right?
And this guy's just sitting there,
hey,

105
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:44.000
I got big news.
I got big news people.
You know,

106
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.780
people who may be are in between jobs and can't afford quality food.

107
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.740
And rather than encouraging me to go out and get an apple or a banana,

108
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.470
you know what I'm going to say?
I'm going to where the fuck is a thick.

109
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.580
<v 0>Okay?</v>

110
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.510
<v 1>They'll find my tweet here.
I gotta find my fucking Twitter.</v>

111
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.930
Uh,
Jesus.
What the fuck is,
I apologize.
You know,
I have big news.

112
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.690
Bacon and cheese have been stuffed into a crust.

113
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.180
That's what this guy says is he sits in his fuck.

114
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.110
Do you think that fucking cunt is eaten?
Maybe he's eaten a little bit of it.

115
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.410
He gets from the south.
And I'll tell you he don't know no better.

116
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.220
<v 0>Okay?</v>

117
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.550
<v 2>I'll tell you what though.
I think better than that,</v>

118
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:29.551
greasy Italian food is if you shove a little biking integration across,

119
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.600
<v 1>there you go.
Did you like that joke?
I attack two fucking people.
Actually.</v>

120
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.520
I really was just making fun of southerners,
right?
I Dunno.

121
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.430
Anyways,
and he's just sitting there collecting the money.

122
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:48.320
Basically sitting in the guard tower is all of us fucking march into fucking eat

123
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.020
that poison.
How do you do that in good conscious.

124
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:54.830
How can you sit there as a country singer?
All right.

125
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.660
All about your family values and supporting the troops and denying global

126
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:01.760
warming.
How can you sit there,

127
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.210
cross your fucking wrangler jeans with just shit kicking boots on and say,

128
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:09.440
well America,
I have big news.

129
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.890
Bacon and cheese had been stuffed into a crust.

130
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.510
<v 0>Okay,</v>

131
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.350
<v 1>you mother fucker.
It was stuffed into a duffle bag,</v>

132
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.780
a bunch of fucking cash for you to go out and buy some scope,

133
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.370
band it right and go get a replica of the fucking dukes of Hazzard car while

134
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.550
everybody else goes in and they add to their fucking man tits.
How dare you,

135
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.310
you're already quit on your fucking music career.

136
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.730
The second you got in that lazy boy where you spin around and face the crowd,

137
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.190
then you come back around and tell somebody from the,

138
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.270
from a warehouse that they got a shot,
whatever,
fucking,
whatever that show is.

139
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.290
You know what's funny is back in the day whenever you did shows like that,

140
00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.040
you never made it and now people actually make it,
you know?

141
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.040
Do you remember a long time ago on MTV they had making the band?

142
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.720
Nobody ever made it.
Nobody ever fucking made it.

143
00:08:56.721 --> 00:09:00.860
That's why I never went on last comic standing.
I never went on that cause I,
I,

144
00:09:00.861 --> 00:09:02.810
that's all I thought about was MTV making the band.

145
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:07.510
Everybody who went on making the band never made it.
I was thinking,

146
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:10.360
you know,
Nirvana wasn't on making the band.

147
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:16.210
They didn't do a show like that did,
did you know good Cinderella?

148
00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:20.880
Go on making the bed.
I don't think they did.
You know,
went on the band.

149
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.840
Oh,
went on that fucking the real world.
So they still do that show.

150
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.420
We played seven fucking beat.
Atlanta has made me see what happens.
I love her.

151
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:34.020
They like a point of pride with MTV.

152
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.340
This is where it all started.
Oh,
you mean that Shit TV.

153
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.280
Will you take regular people and exploit them and have them scream at each
other?

154
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.090
Oh Bill,
get off your fucking high horse.
She watched it just like the rest of us.

155
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:48.510
All right.
You're right.
You're right.
I do.
And then I have,

156
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:51.150
I told you I started watching that fucking arm wrestling show,

157
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.040
Battle of arms or whatever it is.
It's the funniest shit I've ever seen in my,

158
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.110
at least guys are fucking out of their minds.

159
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:04.170
Get in each other's faces right before the arm wrestle war God screaming at each

160
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.870
other.
Fucking slamming the table around.

161
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.500
I love that show.
These fucking guys would rip your goddamn arm off.

162
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.850
Um,
I don't know what their deal is.
Some of them are actually like,

163
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.320
they can't help being like that.

164
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:22.950
And then there's other ones that are fucking terrified.
I don't know what it is.

165
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:27.180
They had a bad father and now they're going to try to become like as close as

166
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:31.620
they can do a God damn superheroes.
So they,
they,
they got us every pull up.

167
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:35.400
They got a scream.
Ahhh.
Right?

168
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.890
Shouting the fear out of them.
Whatever.
Good for them.
You know,
God bless them.

169
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:43.170
In other words,
I don't have anything else to say about that topic.

170
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.620
So whenever I don't,
I just gay.
You know what?
God bless him.

171
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.760
God bless those sons of bitches.
My arms all swollen.

172
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.680
I didn't know that that happened.
And when you arm wrestle to that point,

173
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.690
that one of your arms just blew up like a balloon.

174
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.680
I remember back in the day when you were out in the back Yad and a mosquito got

175
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.750
on you.
If you flex your muscle really quick,

176
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:06.630
they couldn't release and you'd blow him up with your own blood.

177
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.800
You remember doing that shit lie.
Do I remember?

178
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.610
Because I came up before the Internet.
Why isn't my fucking AC cool enough?

179
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:18.640
This room?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it humming in the background?
Oh,

180
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:22.360
it's trying that acs trying.
Just like I'm trying right now.

181
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:23.440
I'm trying to entertain you.

182
00:11:23.441 --> 00:11:27.310
Fucks for another God damn hour on another fucking Monday,

183
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.990
right bear.
It is people.
Congratulations.

184
00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:36.500
You lived in other week,
starting all over again.
What are you doing right now?

185
00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:38.930
How you sitting in your fucking car in traffic?

186
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.340
You behind that Douche bag who for some reason leaves two and a half car lengths

187
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.380
between him and the other car on a flat surface on a dry road for whatever

188
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:52.280
reason he's doing that and yet another person is cut into your lane.

189
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:53.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.263
<v 1>Do Your Lane</v>

191
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.770
<v 0>and you sit in,
they're gripping the steering wheel.
Go and you know what?</v>

192
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.590
In a perfect fucking world,

193
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.331
<v 1>perfect.</v>

194
00:12:02.331 --> 00:12:05.840
What can world I would punch through his side window like the terminator.

195
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.220
I would pull him up by his fucking throat.
Lift him high into the air.

196
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.610
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

197
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.550
<v 1>Choke the life.
Don't just almost to an inch of his life.</v>

198
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.100
Leave them by the side of the road and then get in his car.

199
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.750
Mine the only one thinks shit like that.
I don't think I am.

200
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.960
I think it's a very normal thought.
Um,
anyway,

201
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.480
so this is the Monday morning podcast and um,

202
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.210
it's football Sunday right now it's actually one 18.

203
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.920
I just watched the New England patriots.

204
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.760
Somehow after that first horrific drive,

205
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.810
they finished off the Minnesota Vikings.
I gotta tell you,
man,

206
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:45.060
I love seeing the vikings playing outside.
Again,

207
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.810
reminded me a way back in the day was Fran Tarkington,
Jim Masha,

208
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.650
Paul Crouch,
Chuck Foreman over that Alan Page,

209
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.140
Carl Eller.
You know all these guys.
As I'm saying them,

210
00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:04.780
I'm picturing football cards,
stu void or some shit.

211
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.700
Who's that?
Fucking Ron Yari.

212
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.950
Maybe he was in the 80s when they had Tony Kramer,
Tommy,

213
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.050
Tommy Kramer.
Um,
he played indoors.
They,
they,
I,

214
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.310
when I started watching football,

215
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.540
the vikings still still played outside I think for like one or two seasons.

216
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.650
It was the late seventies,

217
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.280
I think it was just the last season or it might've been,

218
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.480
I was just watching those NFL films all the time.
So I think I remembered it.

219
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.130
I have no idea.

220
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.500
Oh fuck the Seahawks and charges a plane.
Hang on.

221
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.620
I got to hit pause.
I gotta I gotta record this game.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on,

222
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:46.180
hold on.
Okay,
I'm back.

223
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.250
I'm back.
Sorry.
I had to make sure I recorded that game.

224
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.380
I want to watch that game.
Uh,
okay.

225
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.830
You know that's one of those games I got to tell you.
You know,

226
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.770
could go either way.

227
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:58.540
The Seattle Sea hawks have looked very impressive early this year and the

228
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:01.720
national football league season of 2014

229
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.623
<v 0>okay.</v>

230
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.260
<v 1>But you gotta remember these shoes,</v>

231
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.360
your division rivalry even know they're not in the same division.

232
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.680
They've played each other for years.
They know what each other does.

233
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.280
It's really good to come down to who's going to strap it on.

234
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.770
What did they mean by that?
Strap it on.

235
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.690
You got to strap it on,
looked at other guy on the eye.

236
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.830
You got to play some smash mouth football.
That's what they need to do.

237
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.870
You see any Diego charges for years had been trying to get over the hump,
the,

238
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.920
the of,
they've created a culture where they get to the big game,

239
00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:46.280
but they just cannot seem to get to the big dance.

240
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

241
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.090
<v 1>Sorry.
Um,</v>

242
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.630
you know what's funny is I make of it and the only way I know everything that

243
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:57.080
they say is because I watch it all the time and I can't stop fucking watching
it.

244
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.320
I can't stop fucking watch it know.
Um,
anyways,

245
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.580
plowing ahead here.
Uh,
let's get back to the fucking,

246
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.010
what did I want to talk about this week?

247
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.800
Let's just get out of football because I know it was a lot of people that don't

248
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:15.260
like football.
Not that I give a fuck,
but I,
you know,

249
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:19.420
I don't wanna I don't want to bore you 100%.
So,
uh,
what,

250
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:22.250
what are you doing this week?
You know what I'm doing,
uh,
coming up on,
uh,

251
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.560
coming up on all,
wait,
wait,
wait,
scatterbrained.
Scatterbrain hit the brakes.

252
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.760
Um,
I want to let you guys know on Twitter I announced it,
my,
uh,

253
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.060
my long awaited Carnegie Hall recording.

254
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.230
I did a show there on November 11th,

255
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.060
2011 and the album is finally coming out.

256
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.280
I did it on a third man records Jack White label in Nashville,

257
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:50.000
Tennessee.
And this was the thing,
um,
you know,

258
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.140
I was doing a show at Carnegie Hall and I was getting ready to do a special

259
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.390
video and shooting whatever a special at Carnegie Hall would.

260
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.670
It costs me $9 million.
Why?

261
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.600
Because their Carnegie hall and they know everybody wants to record there.

262
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.260
So they charge it 10 million times.
What the fuck they should be charging.

263
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.190
So it's Carnegie Hall.
I don't know if I'm ever going to be back.

264
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.970
It's like I got to record this.
I got a document that I'm going to be there.

265
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.690
Right?
So I did,
they charged me 10,

266
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:23.300
15,000 times.
What the fuck they should have charged.

267
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.330
But I didn't give a shit cause it was Carnegie Hall.
Lo and behold,
they will.

268
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.740
Right.
So,
uh,
three months later I recorded,

269
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.230
uh,
you people are all the same.

270
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.160
And then about like a year later,
I finally got the tapes.

271
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:40.280
That's how slow things move.
Um,

272
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.030
I could've got access into the White House quicker.
Then I got the tapes from my,

273
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.230
uh,
my show there.
And,

274
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.300
and it was one of the deals with just the overlap because it was like three,

275
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.590
four months between that recording and my next special that it was basically,

276
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:59.030
I don't know,
80,
85%,
75% the same shit.
I,
you know,

277
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:01.250
I tell it differently every night,
but it's the same shit.

278
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:04.460
So I want to fucking put it out there that I've been there.

279
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.940
I don't want to fuck people over by,
you know,

280
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.590
acting actually acting like this isn't,
this is new material.
It isn't,

281
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.940
it's just this performance of that material.
So,
uh,

282
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:21.630
I decided that I was putting it out on vinyl,
lonely and a that way it's,

283
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.290
you know,
even though it's the same thing,
it's like a different sort of,

284
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:25.820
I don't know.

285
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.180
I think albums are cool and I know everybody for some reason to quite some to

286
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:32.720
hipsters,
which I guess is fair.
But to be honest with you guys,

287
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.020
I'm 46 years old.
I grew up when,
you know,

288
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:40.190
I remember when cassette tapes came out,
um,
you know,

289
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.320
all of my shit when I first got it was on vinyl.
I don't think it sounds better.

290
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.440
I can't tell if it sounds better.
I have no fucking idea.

291
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.130
What I do like is I like,
I liked albums at first.

292
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.740
I liked the cassettes where it was all small and that type of Shit,

293
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.440
oh this is great.
I can take it in the car and all that type of thing.

294
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.030
Then after a while and went back to the vinyl and now this as much fucking cool.

295
00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:05.310
You get all these extra pictures,
you know,
who's a fucking event.
I liked it,

296
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.910
I liked it,
so whatever.
So some people giving me shit for doing it.

297
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.260
I don't give a fuck.
The fact that it's on vinyl,

298
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.770
I just look at it as if you actually buy this fucking thing,

299
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:20.610
he can't give me shit.
It's that is the,
the pretty much the same thing.

300
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.790
It's just I've told you from day one.
Okay,

301
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.940
so I don't want to fucking hear it even though I'm still going to hear it.

302
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:28.380
And all you guys with your dumb jokes.

303
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.040
Well you put your next special out on Betamax,

304
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.650
snort,
snort,
laughing my ass off.
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

305
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.370
it's really cool.
And uh,
so let me tell you a little bit about the album.

306
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.720
If you look at the cover of the album,

307
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.850
you'll see old Billy red face standing on stage,
grinning ear to ear,

308
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:50.150
but there's not a soul in the place.
Um,

309
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.750
because we could not shoot during the show.
Those were the rules.
Union house,

310
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:57.150
Carnegie Hall,
Go Fuck Yourself with Carnegie Hall.

311
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.210
So I had to take the photo then.
All right.
And uh,

312
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.770
my photographer was allowed to be,
I dunno,

313
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.960
there was a little hole in the wall.

314
00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:10.560
He was able to stick the camera through and take pictures.
It was fucking insane.

315
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.840
It was insane.
And the navel,

316
00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:18.150
the name of the album is called live at Andrew's house.
And,

317
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:23.010
um,
and then that was just another thing where I wanted to say live at Carnegie

318
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.480
Hall,
but that was going to be like,
you know,

319
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.710
I was just going to be another thing,
but we have to get that approved,
you know?

320
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.980
Oh,
you've got to approve that.
I was,
I mean I was there.

321
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:34.800
I paid the money to rent out the thing.
You know,
you saw the show.

322
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.690
He didn't have prompt while we still have to send it up,

323
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.980
send it up the flag pole,
but blah,
blah blah blah.
And I just said fuck it.

324
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.600
Fuck it.
I won't,
I don't need to say that.
I'll just say live at Andrew's house.

325
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.160
There you go.
Andrew Carnegie.
Alright.
There you go.
So there you go.

326
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:54.000
There's a little history there.
Okay.
Alrighty.
Okay,

327
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:58.130
so that's going to be available I think on September 30th.
Um,

328
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.530
the preordering is like,
ah,
Jesus.
Bill,
why don't you go,

329
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.340
why don't you just get the fucking information before you start talking about
it?

330
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:09.900
You dumb.
Fuck.
Um,
let me see here.
Let me see here.

331
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.970
Where is it?
My gravy that dawn Doma gravy.
No,

332
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.920
these aren't them.

333
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.600
German cars are the best German cars go to the next level.
By the way,

334
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.310
I'm back into that Mercedes Benz,
uh,

335
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.470
that Mercedes Benz fucking station wagon.
I just think that's the coolest thing.

336
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.210
All right.
Um,
is this it here?

337
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.890
Okay.
Presale is on September 16th,
which is tomorrow.
If you're listening to it,

338
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.200

you know,
if you listened to them the right time,
if you're not,

339
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:47.100
it's probably already out.
That's the presale is nine 16 and it's on sale.

340
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.190
Nine 30 full details,

Excuse me.

341
00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:54.960
Hiccups are@thirdmanrecords.com.
Um,
I hope you guys like it.

342
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.750
I've already given a couple of copies of people and they'd say it's awesome,

343
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.100
but they're also friends of mine,

344
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.930
so I imagine you costs will be a little more honest dude.

345
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:08.220
It fucking sucked.
Um,
all right,
back to the,
uh,

346
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.090
to the podcast.

347
00:21:09.091 --> 00:21:13.620
So this week after the ray rice scandal,

348
00:21:13.621 --> 00:21:17.270
now you got Adrian Peterson and um,

349
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.953
I got to admit,

350
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.760
I was absolutely shocked by that fucking story.

351
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.350
<v 1>Um,
I know that,
you know,</v>

353
00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:30.470
that's something that has gone on for a long fucking time.

354
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.370
Parents beating that children like that.
I just,

355
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.430
for some reason I just didn't think,
you know,

356
00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.570
with all this doctor Phil Shit,

357
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:45.800
all his pop psychology shit that's out there,

358
00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.220
how you could hit a kid with a switch that's four years old to the point that

359
00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:56.390
he's a bruised and bleeding is just fucking beyond

360
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.960
my comprehension.
That's just fucking nuts.

361
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.270
I think that that really fucks obviously really fucks people up when you,

362
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.540
when you,
when you do shit like that.
Um,
to that level.

363
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.440
Not Saying I didn't get hit as a kid,
but two things.
One,
it wasn't a switch.

364
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.400
It was a paddle and two,
I fucking deserve it.

365
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.230
I never felt after getting hit with the paddle that I never felt

366
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

367
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.230
<v 1>Um,
that it was wrong.
Now what is it?
What am I,</v>

368
00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:37.350
what's the word I'm searching for?
I never felt that I didn't,
uh,

369
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.580
didn't do something to deserve it.
I hated it because it hurt,

370
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.370
but I never felt that it was a,

371
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.460
<v 0>yeah.</v>

372
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.750
<v 1>Like it was,
um,
I dunno,
like all I did was this and then you did that.</v>

373
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:55.490
The only time I ever felt it was fucking wrong was one time my brother said that

374
00:22:55.491 --> 00:22:57.920
I kicked my other brother in the face and it was bullshit.

375
00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:00.890
I kicked him in the stomach.
I used to do a bit about that.

376
00:23:00.891 --> 00:23:04.670
And it was that which was considered working it out amongst yourselves.
And uh,

377
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.080
you know,
the face was in,
no,
no,

378
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.110
in my house was where'd you could punch in the side of the head if you bruised

379
00:23:09.111 --> 00:23:13.700
within the hair,
you know,
the parents wouldn't see it then you'd be all right.

380
00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:18.380
But if he hit in the face then you know,
then you had a big problem and um,

381
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:19.720
<v 0>okay.</v>

382
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.030
<v 1>Yeah.
My mother was brushing her hair at the time.
She turned around,</v>

383
00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:24.730
she went to whack me over the head with a brush and I ducked and she caught me

384
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:29.731
right between the shoulder blades and the brush was like this hard plastic and

385
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:33.250
it kind of exploded.
And,
um,

386
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.300
then my mother picked up the brush part,

387
00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:38.100
the rubber part with the thing sticking out.

388
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.520
And for I think another 10 years I,

389
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.970
she brushed her hair just holding onto that

390
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.480
rather than the whole with the handle and all that.
Like that's how,
um,

391
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.750
I dunno my parents,

392
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.260
their parents grew up in the depression so they just had that instilled in them

393
00:23:58.261 --> 00:24:00.960
that you,
you know,
if the brush breaks into a million pieces,

394
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:04.530
you still salvage it.
It still works.
You just hold it this way,

395
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.740
you know which rig,
you know,
maybe that's a smarter thing to do.
I have no idea.

396
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.600
But anyways,
taking it to that level.

397
00:24:09.601 --> 00:24:13.650
So I actually was reading about that and then that reminded me of the story.

398
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.580
Now this comes with a warning because you probably shouldn't watch this video,

399
00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:21.420
but it reminded me of which I thought was like seven,
eight years ago.

400
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.800
Turns out it was 20 years ago.

401
00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:27.010
Remember that kid was like Michael Fay or something like that.
Was that,
uh,

402
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

403
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.880
<v 1>It was a 19 year old kid.</v>

404
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:33.881
He was over in Singapore and he was accused of vandalizing some property or some

405
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:36.080
shit and the punishment,

406
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:40.820
what part of the punishment was he was going to get caned and you know,

407
00:24:40.821 --> 00:24:45.140
nobody over here and heard of it for the most part unless you'd traveled and it

408
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:50.141
was basically they hit you with this fucking stick and um,

409
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:51.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

410
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.640
<v 1>You know,
they hit hits you hard enough that after a couple of hits,</v>

411
00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:59.641
like basically like they said pieces of flesh or coming off you fucking ass in

412
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:02.770
the back of your legs and stuff and everybody thought it was fucking horrific.

413
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.070
He was supposed to get six hits and we were allowed to while we made enough of a

414
00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:12.130
stink that they went down to four hits.

415
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.800
And so I looked that up and then there was a link to a video that showed

416
00:25:17.801 --> 00:25:22.360
somebody getting caned and I got to tell you,
don't watch it.
Don't watch it.

417
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.840
I watched it.
It's like a four and a half minute video dude.

418
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.400
And I'm telling you because what happened with Michael Fay kid is like the day

419
00:25:30.401 --> 00:25:33.490
after or something,
he was sitting down it.
He's like,
oh that wasn't that bad.

420
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.780
That kid is a tough kid.
He's not like a 40 year old man.

421
00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:41.170
But I gotta tell you something.
I watched this video,
dude,

422
00:25:41.171 --> 00:25:45.880
it's you go out there right naked as a Jay bird,

423
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:47.020
whatever the fuck that means.

424
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:51.640
And then they put you in this thing that's almost like a,
it's like what they,

425
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.760
I dunno,
it's,
you're basically,
I don't know,

426
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:58.830
like if you had like a two wheel Dolly,

427
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.330
you remember how they wield Hannibal Lecter out marriages.

428
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.130
They wheeled him out except he was facing the other way.
All right,

429
00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:08.070
but there's no wheels on this thing and you walk and you stand on that thing.

430
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.270
Then you hang onto these two fucking handles and two people on either side hold

431
00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:16.860
on to your arms and then they put this thing over you with is basically,

432
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.970
I guess it's to protect your lower back and the back of your legs,
you know,

433
00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:24.750
so they don't hit that part and then just your ass is poking through the fucking

434
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:29.430
hole.
It's like a glory hole except it's your ass.

435
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.720
Um,
and then this fucking dude,

436
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.470
Singaporean dude,
Filipino dude,
whatever you call them,

437
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.530
he lines up ready to hit you.

438
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.670
Any weights for some fucking guy off camera to be like,
right.

439
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.860
And this fucking guy is just like in that classic Asian,

440
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:53.910
like martial arts.
I can't even describe it.

441
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:58.380
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon like I am.
I'm going to fucking,

442
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.350
I'm going to show the West what fucking torque is really capable of.

443
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:08.340
I can't even do it.
It looked like he was getting ready to do some dance.
He was,

444
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.070
fuck.
I'm literally trying,
I'm acting it out,
right.
I'm standing up right.

445
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.150
Basically you stand up,
he's turned sideways,

446
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.360
like he's gonna hit a fucking golf ball.
Then he fucking,

447
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.590
Ben's his back leg.
So his right leg,

448
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.460
his front leg is straight and his fucking arm is all the way up like this guy

449
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:28.470
and he's ready to just fuck.
And he just,

450
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.850
and the guy goes and this guy just goes fucking wop and the dude right by the

451
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:40.971
second one and then they fucking wait like 30 seconds is just sitting there and

452
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:45.070
this fucking guy is standing there.
He's supposed to hold the,

453
00:27:45.071 --> 00:27:46.470
the fucking Alma said switched the,

454
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:50.220
came a different way and he's standing there and then some guy mumbles some
shit,

455
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.530
right?
And then the fucking guy goes back into that,
that,
that priest stance.

456
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.000
It looks like a fucking marvel comic like action hero.
Right.

457
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.390
And then the guy goes and look,
fucking the guy goes,
wow,
hits him again.

458
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.570
The guy goes look like by the second one

459
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:13.180
you sound like a puppy getting kicked.
All right.
And I swear to God the camera,

460
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.840
cause I think they were trying to show how abusive it is.

461
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.960
Then zoomed in on this dude's ass and he's got like fucking two lines now.

462
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I think by the second hit it was getting raw and both of his butt cheeks were

463
00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:29.320
like fucking quivering,

464
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.740
like anticipation and through this was like a four and a half fucking,

465
00:28:32.741 --> 00:28:36.820
I lost count.
I think they hit him like five fucking times.

466
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.090
But uh,
literally by the fourth time the guy started to like crumpled.
Dude.

467
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:45.280
It was fucking brutal.
I don't even know why I'm telling,

468
00:28:45.281 --> 00:28:49.150
I'm just saying this is like classic Internet thing.
Like I went on NFL,

469
00:28:49.151 --> 00:28:54.151
nfl.com and then next thing you know I'm watching somebody get caned in

470
00:28:54.281 --> 00:28:58.480
Singapore.
Then that's what's great about the Internet is it just,

471
00:28:58.481 --> 00:29:03.250
it breaks down boundaries.
It brings people closer.
I don't know what to tell you.

472
00:29:03.251 --> 00:29:06.100
I don't even what the point of all of that was.
Um,

473
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.950
I told you what happened.
You can watch it if you want to watch it.

474
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.930
I'm not putting the link up because I never,

475
00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:16.620
I never watched shit like that and I don't know why I did.

476
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.980
It's just like one of those things,

477
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:22.410
cause it didn't seem like it was going to be that bad and you start going

478
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:26.760
through,
could I take that?
Could I sit there and for and for the,

479
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.040
for America not cry out.

480
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.733
<v 0>You know,</v>

481
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.540
<v 1>you just got to get the first one in to understand the level.</v>

482
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.970
I would think that that would be,
Nah,
after you got the first one,
then then,

483
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.080
then that's psychologically be like,
fuck,
I got like three this fucker.

484
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.060
I could tell you what the u s government did for that Michael Fay dude that
they,

485
00:29:47.061 --> 00:29:49.120
they,
they got rid of the last two.

486
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

487
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.340
<v 1>I mean Jesus fucking Christ like,
and the way I've described it now,</v>

488
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:55.540
there's no way you're not going to watch it,

489
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:57.820
but I'm not putting the fucking linkup but Jesus,

490
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.790
there's no how many you think you could take?

491
00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.150
Do you know the other kid that will got arrested with them?

492
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:06.320
I'm Louie talking about a fucking new story from 20 years ago.

493
00:30:06.321 --> 00:30:11.270
The other kid was lined up for 12 of those hits and they knocked his down to 10

494
00:30:11.271 --> 00:30:13.370
dude,
you fucking unconscious by eight.

495
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

496
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.590
<v 1>There's just no way.</v>

497
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.880
You either unconscious or you can't even feel your ass anymore.
Your ass

498
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:26.000
fucking voice cracking.
Um,
yeah,
do it.
There's,

499
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.610
that's a,
that's surprising that that is a,
I don't know,

500
00:30:28.611 --> 00:30:32.360
is it really surprising the only shit that's going on?

501
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.570
That's why I don't watch the fucking news.
I don't,
I have no idea.

502
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.510
Anything that's really going on,
I have to get better.

503
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.690
Especially now that I'm building an hour.
Um,

504
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.770
I got to sat watching it,

505
00:30:45.771 --> 00:30:49.760
but like I've never been one of those people that could watch like execution

506
00:30:49.761 --> 00:30:52.820
videos and fucking all like people who sit down and they watch those guys

507
00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:54.490
getting beheaded over there.
I mean,
that's,

508
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.520
that does something to you to sit down and watch that.
Um,

509
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.050
I dunno.
You know,
it's funny right now is the re,
you know,

510
00:31:04.051 --> 00:31:06.060
reason why I wish I didn't watch that video.

511
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:08.250
I'm gonna tell you what's going to happen if you watch that fucking video.

512
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.960
That dude's quivering ass is going to be burned into your fucking brain for like

513
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:16.050
three days because now that's just what I'm thinking right now.

514
00:31:16.051 --> 00:31:18.600
I'm trying to go on to the next subject.
Do you understand this?

515
00:31:18.601 --> 00:31:20.870
And there's a man's quivering ass.

516
00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.780
It's in my,
no disrespect to that guy.
This guy took it like a fucking champ.

517
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

518
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.660
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
You know what the,</v>

519
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.520
if you saw the way this guy was swinging this cane,

520
00:31:35.521 --> 00:31:39.690
like they go to school for it,
maximum fucking

521
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.910
velocity,
Torque,
whatever the fuck you going to call it.
All of that shit.

522
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.483
<v 0>Okay.</v>

523
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.850
<v 1>It's like they must have measured it out.
Jesus quite,
you know,</v>

524
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:56.800
you always hear about Singapore to how fucking clean.

525
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.850
I'm actually afraid to go over there cause that's one of those things like if

526
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:05.050
you spit gum out on the street,
you know that's considered,

527
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:10.080
that's a crime and next thing you know you're fucking bare ass sitting there

528
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:13.240
with a quiver and ash,
just some guys going,
hey,

529
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.970
fuck that.
Fuck that.
Not saying that bad people.

530
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.380
I'm just saying I can't live up to those standards.
I'm going to do something.

531
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.640
Stub my toe and then Kirsten public height.

532
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.310
Yeah,
I would,
I,
that's what I would do.

533
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:37.900
I'd be fucking screaming like a bitch.
My pasty quivering ass.

534
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.640
Isn't that what you wanted to think on a Monday morning?
Sorry.

535
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.470
How's your Danish?
Um,

536
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.750
anyways,
um,

537
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.380
<v 0>okay.</v>

538
00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.170
<v 3>Jesus Christ.
I bet that that guy has fucking,</v>

539
00:32:56.171 --> 00:32:58.210
that guy will get Kate or anybody who gets caned.

540
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.460
Anytime somebody old bends over to tie their shoes and they get a pain in their

541
00:33:02.461 --> 00:33:05.620
back and they go,
they like their asked starts just fucking tenses up.

542
00:33:05.621 --> 00:33:06.790
Like they're going to get fucking hit.

543
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.680
<v 1>Um,
we got a pill.
We got it.
They hit people with wood in Singapore.
There you go.</v>

544
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:16.250
You learn something.
Um,
all right,
let's get on.

545
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.370
Let's get onto something else here.
Um,
as always,
people,

546
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:20.990
if you want to donate to the podcast,

547
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:24.720
the best way to do it is to not have to give me any money.
Well,
God,

548
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.820
how do I do that?
Simple.
Next time you're going to buy something on amazon.com,

549
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:33.050
just go to [inaudible] dot com first click on the podcast page and then click on

550
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:35.240
the Amazon.
Lincoln.
We'll take you right to Amazon.

551
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.930
Doesn't cost you any extra money,
but if you come from my website,

552
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:41.060
they kicked me a few bucks.
There you go.

553
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.020
You kick me a few bucks and then I throw it into the basement.

554
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.130
Sorry.
Um,
anyways,
continuing on.

555
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.940
<v 3>Um,
I don't know if I mentioned this to you.
Um,
you know,</v>

556
00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:58.820
when we aren't at the house,
you know,

557
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.300
I can't bring my awesome dog with me everywhere I go.
So,
uh,

558
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:06.320
but I also didn't want a sticker in a little fucking Kennel thing.
Uh,

559
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:09.560
but she gets freaked out if she's in the house by herself because somebody left

560
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:13.910
or by a river.
So she does not like to be alone.
But,
uh,

561
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:17.120
the dog trainers say,
but if you put them in like a small sort of container,

562
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.690
they don't feel overwhelmed by the space.
They just curl up and go to sleep.

563
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.340
Well that's not my dog.
My dog then tries to fucking break out of it and it does.

564
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.750
And then it's upstairs and it's sitting there wagging its tail and you know,

565
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.840
it chipped a tooth or it's got a cut on his face and it fucking kills me.

566
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.960
So what I did was I had this guy,

567
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.570
I met this guy and he made these giant,

568
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:42.650
what looked like a fucking lion's cage and it was all this fucking rebar,

569
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.890
so it was this bigger place where she could ever bed and a place for a food,

570
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:48.950
you know,
it's like a studio apartment as opposed to a little case.

571
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:53.000
So I fucking put it used to put her in that and it was all good.

572
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:55.130
She tried to get out of it a little bit.
Then she realized that I,

573
00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:59.990
that I couldn't,
at least I thought that that was the case and um,

574
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.950
she fucking broke up.
She fucking,

575
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:08.180
she found the weakest bar because it wasn't attached on both sides.

576
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.550
It was only attached
just the way it was attached.

577
00:35:12.551 --> 00:35:13.780
I don't know how it figured it out,

578
00:35:13.781 --> 00:35:18.100
but it just used all of its body weight and it made both welds fail and then it

579
00:35:18.101 --> 00:35:23.020
took that bar and buried it under his bed and then squeezed itself at some
point.

580
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:24.610
I still a bit on this thing too.
Another one.

581
00:35:24.611 --> 00:35:28.480
At some point it did a pull up or a dad to do a pull up and then a dip and got

582
00:35:28.481 --> 00:35:30.070
out the top of the fucking cage.

583
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:35.790
So it then took this cage that I spent 700 bucks on and just rendered the whole

584
00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:37.330
fucking thing useless.

585
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.640
<v 1>It's an I just take her everywhere I go and cause eventually I was going to have</v>

586
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:46.630
that thing welded back on and uh,
I don't know what happened.

587
00:35:46.631 --> 00:35:49.810
I just started looking up for welders.
I stuck looking at welding.

588
00:35:49.811 --> 00:35:54.190
I got into this shit.
I think it's a school.
Oh cool.
A skill to learn.

589
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.380
So I'm going to take a six hour do it yourself fucking welding thing and I'm

590
00:35:59.381 --> 00:36:01.300
going to fucking,
well that thing back on myself.

591
00:36:01.301 --> 00:36:03.670
I'm going to give it a shot and I know what all you guys are thinking,
dude,

592
00:36:03.671 --> 00:36:05.200
you're going to burn your fucking house down.

593
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.880
There's no fucking way is dumb as I am.
Okay.

594
00:36:09.881 --> 00:36:10.900
Give me a little credit.

595
00:36:10.901 --> 00:36:15.820
There's no fucking way I would weld anything near my house.
Okay.

596
00:36:15.821 --> 00:36:20.170
I'll pay the guys down at the shop to let me do it at their shop under their

597
00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:21.430
supervision.
Okay.

598
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:25.780
Before you call me a moron and before you predict all this fucking disaster,

599
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.170
I'm not saying I'm not going to burn something down.
It just won't be mine.

600
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.710
All right.
That's the deal.
I think learn and Hardo I'm learning until,

601
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.350
well,
I think learning how to weld is a really fucking coolest skill.

602
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.150
It really is an a,

603
00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:44.920
I'll show you a link to a the best video of it that I've found.

604
00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:47.260
Unless I get rid of it,
please tell me I didn't get rid of it.

605
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:50.680
This guy was awesome.
He was totally clear.

606
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:55.060
He had a fucking mustache.
Oh,

607
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.570
Jesus Christ.
You motherfucker.
Bill,
you're the worst.

608
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:03.570

Here is,
it's uh,

676
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.290
there's a time for questions.
I don't know here.
Um,
yeah,

677
00:41:13.291 --> 00:41:17.310
I think it's time for questions.
You know what j law head is actually here.

678
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.120
He's over my house right now.
I think he's watching Seattle fucking challenges.

679
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:23.310
We're going to bring him in here to the podcast.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.880
After these not a message I just gave you messages.

681
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.550
I'm gonna bring him in here through the wonderful world of hitting pause.

682
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.010
All right,
we're back into the wonderful world,

683
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.100
<v 4>the magic of hitting the pause button.
Uh,</v>

684
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:41.900
we're now here with the Rosebowl tailgate legend and a gourmet chef of the

685
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:45.920
outdoor backyard festivities of the Rose Bowl.
The granddaddy of them all.

686
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:50.600
Jason Law had everybody
from the La Heads Court.

687
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:56.130
Um,
how's it,
how's it looking in there?
It's good man.
Uh,
San Diego's,

688
00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.520
uh,
they got their numbers.

689
00:41:57.521 --> 00:42:02.521
Seattle actually got a touchdown on literally the worst call in the history of

690
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:07.000
the NFL because these chairs are really squeaky,
by the way.
Sorry.
But what,

691
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.470
what was the call?
You know,
they review every touchdown.
If you score a touchdown,

692
00:42:10.471 --> 00:42:11.490
I review it now.

693
00:42:11.491 --> 00:42:15.480
They have a new system in New York City where they watch every single bit of

694
00:42:15.481 --> 00:42:19.680
film.
Percy Harvin set out on like the 36.
They didn't even reviewed it.

695
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.491
They didn't repeat as court.

696
00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:22.920
He put it on a board and then they go to Mike Perri afterwards.
They're like,

697
00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:26.750
oh yeah,
he stepped out of bounds.
They should uh know the automatic review.
Yeah.

698
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.000
<v 1>Got Fuck San Diego due.
Can I ask you a question?
What did San Diego do?
You know?</v>

699
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.290
Right.
Cause I know,
I know Cleveland,
you know,
you guys go,

700
00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.790
obviously you've been through a bunch of shit,

701
00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:39.300
but there's something like San Diego is always right there,

702
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:44.130
seven pro bowlers every year and then somehow like there's always either a call

703
00:42:44.131 --> 00:42:46.740
or they shoot themselves in the form of one year.
They had us beat,

704
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.510
they had US speed in a playoff game.

705
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.300
They stopped us on fourth down to get the ball to end of the game.

706
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.190
They took an unnecessary roughness,

707
00:42:53.191 --> 00:42:57.390
call Davis a first down and then we were able to kick a field goal to some

708
00:42:57.391 --> 00:42:59.870
bullshit and I was just like,
well why would you do that?

709
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.630
<v 4>Then there was like the three or four years ago when they hit that fumble Denver</v>

710
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:05.270
when they reviewed it and they were like,
yeah,
it was a fumble.

711
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.910
San Diego recovered,
but we're giving it to Denver.

712
00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:10.400
I used to do a whole bit out of when I was living in San Diego by Norv Turner

713
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:12.050
had a press conference.
How I would've reacted.

714
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.020
I mean they literally the ref went,
yeah,

715
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.460
San Diego recovered it but there was a whistle blown.

716
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.970
So we're giving it back to Denver.
Two plays later.

717
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:21.800
Denver scores kept San Diego out of the playoffs.

718
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.680
<v 1>No it's,
it's,
it's a special,
I don't know,
they did something down there that,</v>

719
00:43:26.681 --> 00:43:28.690
that they're getting that level of Karma.
I don't know.

720
00:43:28.691 --> 00:43:32.200
We went to that game a long time ago.
Did not have a good time,
did not,

721
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.530
did not talk game against the titans.
And uh,
I,

722
00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:38.440
we've talked about this I think on the last podcast with the Jersey coming off

723
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:41.020
in the fight,
that and jersey,

724
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.130
<v 4>but we got to have a,
the weather's starting to turn into that.</v>

725
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.900
We got to have a pre season tailgate,
you know,
to get us ready for the road

726
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
<v 1>ball.
I mean we gotta have something you want to go to USC game by the way.</v>

727
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.730
Oh good.
Cause I haven't been as a practice.
That's a good practice.

728
00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:58.410
We'll go to USC game,
but can you tailgate down there?
Yeah,
you can actually,

729
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.920
there's a,
it's not as convenient.
I'll go to UCLA.
Higher ranked.

730
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.460
Really do see beat you at USC.

731
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:10.870
USC is going to be out of the top 25 UCLA is 12th in the country so we should go

732
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.820
to UCLA game.
I know,
but I,
yeah,

733
00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.050
I mean the Superbowl one and two were played.

734
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.840
It's fucking Goddamn half hour ride down the street and it's just like I,

735
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:25.260
I only went there one time.
I saw them play a USC play.
Uh,

736
00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:29.580
Washington huskies in like 96 is the last time I've been there.

737
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.180
I went in La oh seven.
We went there,

738
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.120
we had a two year contract with them and they just waxed us.

739
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.750
That's a year they won a national title.
How State?

740
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:43.350
We went there with beanie wells,
but he didn't play first game of the season.

741
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.300
Any wells didn't play the first game of the season.

742
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:47.970
And we got worked over it and it was the only loss we had all year.

743
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.380
We went 12 and won that year.

744
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.590
It was a for a second game of the season at USC as the only time I've ever been

745
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:55.610
to the coliseum.
Alright,
well I gotta I got again,

746
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.080
tailgaters good tailgate's going on down at the coliseum.

747
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.810
They got a lot of room down there by campus.
It's fun.
Get spoiled yet you UCLA

748
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.890
through luck there.
I won't.
How did I,

749
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.010
I tell Andrew luck to you his senior year to,
how did I not remember that?

750
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.880
I wouldn't even took a little video.
I went down and did a little,
uh,
Nice luck,

751
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:14.610
luck video.
Like what do you,
what's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you?

752
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.850
I got to show you that the go to law,
head to court,

753
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.630
two page and you can find that.
All right.
Well,
fresh off the,
uh,
the,

754
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.180
the highly successful all in tour,
the first leg of it,

755
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:26.080
we're hoping to put together a second leg of it.
Uh,

756
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:30.210
we got the questions for this week.
Um,
let's see what we got here.
It says,

757
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.950
what's new Billy bonanza.

758
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.570
I live in Toronto and was able to see black and white.
It got me thinking,

759
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:38.160
why don't you have a TV show?

760
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:42.750
Surely the Hollywood system seems the sees the value in your song and dance.

761
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.550
Get off your lazy ass and come into my living room for 10 weeks out of the year.

762
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:49.830
Love you and love Nia.
I mean,
how do you answer that?

763
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.070
He would have been smart if he would've,
if he would've wrote lazy ass.

764
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.581
Like you say,

765
00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:58.100
lazy ass or ladies that say that would have been a little bit of flavor he could

766
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:02.880
have,
but there's no r in there.
Yeah,
that's true.
But ladies don't have an arm.

767
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.010
That's Jerry Lewis.
That's what I'm doing.
I know you are letting you know.

768
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:10.130
You throw out different references of the,

769
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.590
you stretch the words on different ones.
Well,
maybe he wrote it that way.

770
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:16.590
It was my read.
All I know is what look you saw the movie black and white.

771
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:17.011
You know what I love?

772
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:19.590
I love that I'm in a fucking movie and that's not enough for you.

773
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.460
That wasn't enough for you.
I can have a fucking TV show too.
And then you,

774
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:27.120
what you do is you'll bitch that my comedy isn't as good because I'd be spending

775
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:31.430
all my fucking time doing that shit,
pretending to be a fucking police officer.

776
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.700
Whatever the hell thing I would have.
I listen,
I gotta tell you something.
Uh,

777
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.920
I do have some Shit and works,
but uh,
you know,
sometimes a lot of,
you know,

778
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:42.030
it's a blessing to not have a TV show.
It's a blessing to,
in this business,

779
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.960
go on other people's shows because they deal with all the responsibilities,

780
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:50.100
the writing,
the conference calls,
all of that shit is a go.

781
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:53.190
When I have time to learn how to weld.
Ask yourself this.

782
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:56.310
When I have time to learn how to weld,
if I had my own teach TV show,

783
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.880
I could tell you right now the answer is no.
And a lot of you cons out there,

784
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:03.120
it'd be like,
yeah,
but you had to fucking money to tell somebody else to do it.

785
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.270
Well,
you know what,
I don't live my life that way.
I don't.

786
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:07.320
I'd like to learn how to do it.

787
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.840
It would reread it like Three Act Academy award winners in this movie.
Yeah.

788
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:17.470
What am I going back to?
Why we should go do TV?
Movies are great.
You do it.
It's,

789
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.460
it's we have you from this date to this date and then it's done right.

790
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:24.540
Those other people like who those people on one hour dramas are shooting a movie

791
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:29.040
that never ends.
Right and I get that.
It's a constant.
You're a constant critic.

792
00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.130
Like you get the one time critic.

793
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.840
<v 4>If it's a good movie,
it's a bad movie.
It's been different.</v>

794
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:34.450
Whatever that criticism comes in that one stretch.

795
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:39.490
The TV show is constant criticism.
Old photography,
how hard they,

796
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.850
I don't want to work that hard.
Yeah.
I did an episode of new girl,

797
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.220
I hate a great fucking time.
I think it was 40

798
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.530
<v 3>18 hour days and they had been,
I did it in February.
It's a half hour show.</v>

799
00:47:49.531 --> 00:47:52.470
They were doing 14 hour days and they had been going since August.

800
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.210
It's just like I thought I work

801
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.010
<v 4>tart and then I did an episode of that show.
It's like,
dude,
I am a bomb.</v>

802
00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:02.180
And I love it.
That was breaking bad coming back for sure.
They say right.

803
00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.490
<v 3>A better call.
Saul is coming back.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

804
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.620
it's coming back.

805
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.600
<v 4>Go to any word on it.
You're doing any Nanos Huh?</v>

806
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.990
<v 3>Uh,
I have no idea.
I mean if,
if I did,
I couldn't say that I was,
but I,</v>

807
00:48:14.991 --> 00:48:19.230
but to be honest with you,
I haven't heard anything.
No,
I haven't heard anything.

808
00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:23.250
Okay.
Silver.
Um,
alright.
Uh,

809
00:48:23.251 --> 00:48:27.990
Silverman props.
Good Day sir.
Ah,
good day.

810
00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:31.820
Good sir.
Sorry,
I saw your name and the end credits.
Uh,

811
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:36.510
slash thank you.
Have Sarah Silverman's latest comedy,
special,
special,

812
00:48:36.511 --> 00:48:39.630
and was curious if you had anything special to do with the show.

813
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.580
Love your comedy and hope it never ends.
Van.
Very good.
This guy from Germany,

814
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.480
Lars,
you have any,
uh,

815
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.670
I noticed your name and the others are credits.

816
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.350
<v 4>You know,
it was German guys.
They death.
Everybody they read all the way through,</v>

817
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.730
you know,

818
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.880
they read all the words because just in case there's any like that's why they

819
00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:01.210
can make a station wagon that goes zero to 60 in fucking three and a half

820
00:49:01.211 --> 00:49:04.600
seconds.
Any hidden messages in there they're looking for?
Um,

821
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:06.660
<v 3>yeah,
the uh,</v>

822
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:11.260
that opening bit that she did was she threw the ball against the wall.
Um,

823
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.110
I was down the comedy store like a week before she did,
uh,

824
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.200
her standup special and she was throwing a tennis ball against the wall or

825
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:20.200
whatever.
And so he's talked to her special.
I was like,
you know,

826
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:22.180
that could be cool if you're just sitting there throwing the ball against the

827
00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:23.860
wall,
blah,
blah.
Maybe that's why she did it.

828
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.810
Maybe she just thinks I'm a swell guy.

829
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.083
<v 4>I have no idea.</v>

830
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.480
I should have waited till she told that copy for the search engine optimization.

831
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.700
That's probably,
what is that?
No,
you're like,

832
00:49:32.701 --> 00:49:35.040
we know you tag like things like Bill Burr,
anything popular.

833
00:49:35.041 --> 00:49:38.850
If you'd like to put anything on.
We're like bill burr,
Comma,
um,
you know,

834
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:42.260
the all end tours.
So when people are searching things like bill burr,
her thing,

835
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:47.090
<v 3>ah,
just,
it was kids with the fucking Internet Seo,</v>

836
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:51.840
they call it search engine optimization.
All right.
Morbid obesity.
Uh,

837
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.670
dear Badass.
Billy Burke,
I guess I'm supposed to give you a nickname.
Yeah,

838
00:49:55.671 --> 00:49:57.710
we're running out here.
People.
You guys don't have to do that,
right?

839
00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.700
My brother has been dating a morbidly obese girl for two years now.

840
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.200
My parents are disgusted by this.
Oh,
Jesus.
This is brutal.
It's brutal.
Already.

841
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.430
My mother actually cried when she first met her.
Geez.
Is Christ dude.

842
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.500
And I get shit for fat shaming.

843
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.313
<v 2>Fuck,</v>

844
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.740
I
thought I raised you better.

845
00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.953
Oh yes.

846
00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.720
<v 3>Oh Shit.
Dude.
That's fucking brutal.
More importantly,</v>

847
00:50:31.721 --> 00:50:35.710
her health is clearly in great danger at her weight.
Uh,

848
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:40.090
it's likely she doesn't get to 40.
My brother's 120 pounds.

849
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:45.340
She's at least twice as weight.
I'd even say near 300 pounds.

850
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.140
What's a good way to convey the fact that if no one steps in with the harsh

851
00:50:50.141 --> 00:50:52.630
reality,
she's going to have a short life?
Also,

852
00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.350
she routinely stumbles out of a cheesecake factory.

853
00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:02.260
Um,
oh,
Jesus Christ.
Dude that's fucking brutal law.
First of all,

854
00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:02.951
I feel bad for her.

855
00:51:02.951 --> 00:51:07.660
I hope she loses the weight cause I get shift on this podcast j because I make

856
00:51:07.661 --> 00:51:10.660
fun of fat people the way I make fun of a lot of shit everything.

857
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.240
And everybody thinks that like out,

858
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.490
you know they don't think that but they say that I've been joking saying fat

859
00:51:15.491 --> 00:51:18.000
shaming works because I do it to myself and all of that type

860
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.260
<v 4>look at me.
Right.</v>

861
00:51:19.261 --> 00:51:22.890
I fat shaming myself at the beginning of the year cause I saw a picture of us at

862
00:51:22.891 --> 00:51:27.780
the Rose Bowl and I was like,
Hey,
we just go look at my fucking,
I don't know why.

863
00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:32.280
I just don't get how more people don't shame themselves in the foot like shaming

864
00:51:32.281 --> 00:51:33.990
themselves and to getting,
well dude,

865
00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:38.400
you ain't at one point you at one point where pushing 200 pounds and you went to

866
00:51:38.401 --> 00:51:41.520
the doctor and the guy said that 30 pounds overweight.
Yeah.
He was like,

867
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.490
technically I could write you in the or obese.

868
00:51:44.491 --> 00:51:46.470
That's a lot of living in San Diego and I was just like,

869
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:50.620
still had a real job and was doing comedy coming up and you know,

870
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.300
I had health insurance.
So he was like,
listen,
I with the job and he's like,

871
00:51:54.301 --> 00:51:58.610
I could technically tech with your height,
with your weight,

872
00:51:58.611 --> 00:51:59.670
you could be obese,

873
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:02.700
but I'm not going to write that in because it could affect your insurance,

874
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:06.630
you know?
Yeah.
Right.
So he goes,
just get out,
what do you do?
And I told I was,

875
00:52:06.631 --> 00:52:09.930
that's when I was drinking a lot of soda.
I mean,
tons of it.

876
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:13.200
And that's what if there's people out there,
I'm telling you,

877
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.140
drop that if you don't want,
you know why?

878
00:52:16.141 --> 00:52:20.370
She's wattle one out of a cheese factory because she had three freaking sodas on

879
00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:23.580
top of whatever else she had.
I bet.
And the diets are worse.
He said,

880
00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:24.780
my doctor looked at me and said,

881
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.220
the word diet is the biggest travesty that the food and drug administration

882
00:52:29.221 --> 00:52:33.450
allows because it doesn't mean anything.
Anything's a diet.
If you eat a cow,

883
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.410
that's your diet.

884
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:38.750
I mean a diet coke just doesn't mean that it's any better for you.
It ain't you.

885
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.610
It ain't going to make you lose weight.
You gain weight.

886
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.290
So that's the one thing that you cut out soda or pop is you guys call it pop.

887
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.960
I got off pop,
I was drinking like he was like,
Geez,
how many of you drink?

888
00:52:48.961 --> 00:52:50.850
And I was like,
I was under a diet.
Dr Pepper is man.

889
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:52.770
I was knocking back like three,
four day.

890
00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:56.430
And then when I would go golfing I would knock down,
you know,
six of per nine.

891
00:52:56.431 --> 00:53:00.510
I'd have like,
you know,
Plastic Cup.
I go through six,
seven,
eight 10 diet,
diet,

892
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:02.700
Dr Peppers on it.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
He's just,

893
00:53:02.701 --> 00:53:04.270
because I thought I was refreshing myself,
you know,

894
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:06.960
and it's diet and it tastes good.
I love that doctorate.
I was like,
okay,

895
00:53:06.961 --> 00:53:11.730
it's diet.
And then when I quit that March,
March 1st,

896
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.970
2010 I've only had like Ginger Rail and club soda.

897
00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:18.000
I've never had the like the high fructose and the colon was and I needed that

898
00:53:18.001 --> 00:53:21.960
sugary shit.
It's been and you took it all off and then not so what,
so what,

899
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:26.930
I just put a bunch on,
uh,
like I'll do one of fall cause just enjoying it,

900
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.460
you know what I mean?
Like we were,
you know,
we had a cook and a lot of holidays.

901
00:53:31.461 --> 00:53:35.090
I hit that holiday party,
that rose bowl.
I mean my birthday is on October 30th.

902
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.340
Right,
right.
So once my birthday hits,

903
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.070
this will be the first time this Halloween candy,
the next day,

904
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.430
the Halloween candy and it goes,
it doesn't stop.
It goes right into thanksgiving.

905
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:44.480
And before I know it,

906
00:53:44.481 --> 00:53:47.600
I'm a week after New Year's and I'm 30 pounds heavier than I was.

907
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:49.340
And the love that you acknowledge Hollywood candy,

908
00:53:49.341 --> 00:53:52.700
like you're still trick or treating,
I mean my whole,
my whole childhood,

909
00:53:52.701 --> 00:53:55.430
I was born the day before Halloween is just the weekend apart.

910
00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.810
And then when I turned old enough to drink,

911
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.870
this will be because I quit the drinking this year for an experiment.

912
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:03.750
This will be,
I'm going to turn 42 in October 30th.
Right.

913
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.060
This will be the first time.

914
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.360
I have not had alcohol on my birthday since I was 19 and I'm not going to do it.

915
00:54:11.841 --> 00:54:13.790
I'm not going to do it this year.
I'm going to just,
I'm going to live,

916
00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:16.940
I'm going to walk.
I'm going to walk through the day on my birthday and go,
wow.

917
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.200
Basically 23 years of straight partying because it's always been a party.

918
00:54:21.201 --> 00:54:25.740
It's been like two loves birthday.
Oh wait.
We can mix them together.
I,

919
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.760
there's been,
I don't even know is amazed though number.

920
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.560
Most of my birthdays in the toys by friends,
we were just,

921
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:37.770
it was a Halloween week.
I was dressed up just walking,
just plowed up.

922
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:39.200
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

923
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.200
<v 3>well do you know what amazed me was you,
you,</v>

924
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.540
you were on the wagon from Rosebowl right up until we did the,

925
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:49.220
the Vegas made though.
Yeah,
but you were so you were like,

926
00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:52.010
I'm drinking this weekend and I'm going right back to being on the wagon,

927
00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:54.300
which is what I said.
And you are able to do it.

928
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.660
<v 4>I haven't,
I haven't been able to do it.
You had a nice slug,</v>

929
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:01.470
but you had that part of the year for you was like you just finished a special,

930
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.530
you know,
you,
you knew you were coming with black and white was coming out.

931
00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:07.710
You had a lot of,
did.
There was a lot of reasons for you,
just not the,

932
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.610
you've been good for.
I mean since you started that quit one year,

933
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:14.070
a couple years ago,
you've been,

934
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:17.220
you've been able to go and get nice little stretches in,

935
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.440
I haven't been having a very sad but very Sooni key player can tell you.

936
00:55:20.441 --> 00:55:24.570
So the longest I've gone without drinking and this last run was,

937
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.750
I think I had just had a real bad flu for like eight or

938
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.170
<v 3>nine days that I didn't drink.
And then this has been the longest in my life.</v>

939
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.630
I mean this has been since since I was a teenager.

940
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.950
You've drank like basically three days.
This whole year.
40 minutes,
right?
Yeah,

941
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.740
three days.
Three days.
This whole year.
Oh,
awesome man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

942
00:55:40.741 --> 00:55:43.870
I wish I then,
I'm not going to have another drink I think until the Rose Bowl.

943
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:47.490
I think that's just fucking Miller high life.
So I just have like one a day.
Yeah,

944
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.490
but that's not,
you know,
but you know what it is.
It's right after you have it.

945
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.160
Right.
Right after you have that first one.
Yeah.

946
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:56.310
But the thing is if you just wait five minutes,
if you just drink a water,

947
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:59.980
if you force yourself to just grab a water or whatever,
your body likes,

948
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:04.020
stops craving it and you level out and you actually just had that one and you're

949
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:08.430
able to do it.
But the,
the,
the,
the thing is with food and all of that shit,

950
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.750
for the longest time I was like,
it's not a drug.
It's not drug.
It is,
it is.

951
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:15.540
It's like whatever you just ate,
you want fucking,
if it's bad for you,

952
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.780
that's how you know it's bad for you because you just ate it.
Now you want more,

953
00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:22.020
which doesn't make any sense because we eat is salad.
You never think like,

954
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.030
Oh dude,
I want salad.
You

955
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:28.830
<v 4>don't.
But later on,
if you're hungry,
you're thinking fruit salad,
vegetables.</v>

956
00:56:28.831 --> 00:56:32.010
But you,
you're not thinking like shit food.
But like if you eat,

957
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.600
I've just found if I,
if I did an apple or whatever,
I don't crave another apple.

958
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:41.670
If I eat a handful of chips,
cookies,
alcohol,
soda or any of that Shit,

959
00:56:41.671 --> 00:56:44.970
that's bad.
Salt or sugar,
you just like you fuck.
It's like you're feening for it.

960
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.910
Sugar.
I mean that's why people are fat.
They can't get off the sugar.

961
00:56:47.911 --> 00:56:50.770
And when you can get off the sugar and you can take it out and you,

962
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:53.940
the only sugar you get is the natural is like the fruits and vegetable sugars,

963
00:56:53.941 --> 00:56:58.350
the natural sugars.
Your body isn't looking at food like,
oh my God,

964
00:56:58.351 --> 00:57:02.290
I want that.
Your body tells you when it wants food.
So then what?

965
00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.330
What does he tell this?

966
00:57:03.331 --> 00:57:06.780
This tells her to get off the sugar and it's going to take a month and it's all

967
00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:11.310
being salt,
salt.
But definitely sugar first get off the sugar because sugar,

968
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:12.181
you have to match it.

969
00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:15.450
If you drink colas and if you eat lots of bread and pasta does,

970
00:57:15.451 --> 00:57:18.240
that's all tons of sugar in there and your body has to match that.

971
00:57:18.241 --> 00:57:19.230
It wants more sugar.

972
00:57:19.231 --> 00:57:21.890
So if you drink a bunch of coke than it wants to sugar foods.

973
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:26.550
So when this woman walks in,
if you were in the house and you got a yellow light,

974
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.960
<v 2>oh my gosh,
I gotta be in the back.</v>

975
00:57:29.961 --> 00:57:34.300
I got to shut up,
get off.
I will get in her face and be like,
get off the sugar.

976
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:38.500
Wipe it out of your,
during your hat around backwards.
Put the whistle in my mom.

977
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.810
Listen.
Kicked dirt over a cake.

978
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.160
It's hilarious.
The fuck are you looking at out there?
That's fucking great.

979
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:51.980
All Day.

This shit is hilarious.
Nah Man,

980
00:57:51.981 --> 00:57:56.260
You came in here but one reason and why was that?
Do I need all of our tanks?

981
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.510
That's in Earl weaver reference.

982
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:02.620
You came in here to fuck us up cause good and you got your chance of getting the

983
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:06.100
mark.
No,

Naral no,

984
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.490
You'll get your chance again tomorrow.
I love when he says that.
That,

985
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:10.750
that I'm fine.
It was so great.

986
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:14.170
Like what are you going to do or I'll lose another world.
Sarah.

987
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:19.120
I want more than I lost.
Not World Series Games.
Eagles Games.

988
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:19.954
Yeah.

989
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:24.370
<v 3>All right,
where are we going?
Video,
uh,
Bill this,</v>

990
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:27.240
this video isn't mine,
but I came across on Youtube.
I actually watched some,

991
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:30.140
it's the evolution of Walter White.
Um,

992
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.720
somebody did like this great like 15 minute video where they go from the very

993
00:58:33.721 --> 00:58:35.910
first episode and it just take like the key scenes.

994
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.760
I watched like a minute and a half of it before,

995
00:58:37.761 --> 00:58:39.090
but I was just getting chills and my guy,
right.

996
00:58:39.091 --> 00:58:42.660
I got one of the reasons why it's one of the great shows of all time.
Um,

997
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:47.310
all right,
two girls dare bill.
I'm just some kid in high school,

998
00:58:47.311 --> 00:58:49.380
doesn't know Jack all about dating.

999
00:58:49.381 --> 00:58:54.381
But a week ago I learned that a chick I knew but didn't like head put me on her

1000
00:58:54.391 --> 00:58:56.190
phone as a wallpaper.

1001
00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.010
This apparently has been going on for a year and I just learned about a,

1002
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.720
from one of her friends.
I knew this chick like me,
but I couldn't stand her.
Oh,

1003
00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:06.960
this is weird.
You said a,
I tried letting her down.

1004
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:12.090
I tried being a dick to her just to,
uh,
why can't you just be honest?

1005
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:14.490
Did you know what?
Cause you're young and just be like,
listen,

1006
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.050
I know you really liked me,
but I'm not feeling that way about you.
You say,

1007
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:18.660
which is a bitch.

1008
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1009
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:25.130
<v 3>Um,
she just acting like I am still all hers.
Yeah,
that would get annoying.</v>

1010
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.820
I knew she was into me while I was still a freshman,
but it was near summer,

1011
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:33.010
so I thought she would just forget all about it.
Um,
and if that wasn't enough,

1012
00:59:33.011 --> 00:59:36.650
her friends that told me this,
uh,

1013
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.480
tried hitting on me when she told him what is,
if this wasn't enough.

1014
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.010
Her friend told me

1015
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:48.980
this tea tried hitting on me.
Dude,
you guys got to proof read the shit.

1016
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.410
You gotta let me tell you something.
If you're in high school,

1017
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:54.530
you're not going to make it to college.
All right,
hang on.
Just keep talking.

1018
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:57.530
Like as I tried to dissect this,
whatever he wants,
he butchered it.

1019
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.670
Is this a guy that's talking about a girl with his phone?
It'd be glad.
Listen,

1020
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.700
do listen be,
oh,
I got it.
I got it.
Yeah.

1021
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.830
There's no common as if this wasn't enough.

1022
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:11.831
Her friend that told me this tried hitting on me when she told me.

1023
01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.510
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
See there was no punctuation in there.
Um,

1024
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:19.100
okay,

1025
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.040
so now the girl that tells you that this girl is obsessed with you then hits on

1026
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.050
you.
Okay.
First of all,

1027
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:27.590
I just learned some psycho had me on a wallpaper for a year and I didn't know.

1028
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.020
So the last thing I wanted to think about is dating second.

1029
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.350
What a bitch move on a friend's part.
Hitting on a guy.

1030
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.500
This guy is definitely the glass is half full.
Huh?
What the fuck?

1031
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.010
You got two women here.
I know dude.

1032
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.030
And it's have added and it's like you're hitting on a guy.

1033
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:44.390
Her friend has been stocking bill.
I'm ready to tell them the both go,

1034
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.410
go fuck themselves.
But what is your opinion on this?
Uh,

1035
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.740
you ignore the first girl,

1036
01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:51.170
you bang the second one and then you get on with your life.

1037
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.150
What do you think Jay?
I think you a,
I think you,
you,

1038
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.090
you play them into each other.
I mean,

1039
01:00:56.091 --> 01:01:00.350
I think that if these girls are friends together,
any other girls hitting on you?

1040
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:05.000
Right.
Thank you.
I think you,
I think you will,
you're going for the three way.

1041
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.670
Oh yeah,
man.
I'm going for,
I'm going for the threeway early.
I'm,

1042
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.670
I'm going to the hole,
get,
get together.

1043
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.060
Let's do this as like a group and hang out.
You know,
an onside kick play,

1044
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:16.370
a little dumb on starts to gain a little dumb on the whole,

1045
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:19.400
I don't know really everything about the phone and I'm not the girl with the

1046
01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:21.430
phone.
I'm not going to give up the fact that I,

1047
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.060
this other one was kind of hitting on me.

1048
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.420
I'm going to let this all come together and see where it goes and that had,

1049
01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:30.510
or if he's eating grass.
Yeah,
because you know why they're there.

1050
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.060
The ones that you're,
they're bringing it to you,

1051
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:35.420
they're serving it to you on a platter.
I mean,
they're literally,
you are,

1052
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:40.250
you're the,
you're the reason why this whole thing is developing.

1053
01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:44.930
So let it,
let these two Kinda,
Ya know,
just sit back.
Relax.

1054
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.790
All right,
so email la heads court.

1055
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:48.590
He'll tell you how to tell you how to bring them in.

1056
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.640
It's going to be instrument landing here up my sleeves.
Um,
all right.
Fat Shaming,

1057
01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:57.230

Dota.
Uh,
Billy Burrito.
What a good way to fat.
Shame.
Uh,

1058
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.690
what's a good way to fat.
Shame.
A sense.

1059
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:03.050
Why am I becoming the fat shame personnel,
right?
You're like,
fuck yeah.

1060
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.510
I don't want to make people feel bad about being fat.
I mean,

1061
01:02:05.511 --> 01:02:06.800
I'm joking around about this shit.

1062
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:10.750
I want people to be in shape so I don't fucking hang this thing around me.
Uh,

1063
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.920
I'm not going to read.
That's two in one week.
That'll be bad.

1064
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.720
The next thing you know,
I got some group.
Yeah.
You know,
I know it's jokes,

1065
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:20.150
but it sets a precedent.
Is a bunch

1066
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:23.300
<v 4>of people protesting in front of you?</v>

1067
01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:25.450
<v 3>They're not gonna.
They're not gonna because like,</v>

1068
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:26.920
that's another good reason not to have

1069
01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.530
<v 4>fucking goofy.
She's got people in scooters driving around.</v>

1070
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.580
<v 3>No.
But if he,
if he had a fucking TV show then they actually get it.</v>

1071
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.180
<v 4>This shit about,
cause they get,
they can't fire you from stand up</v>

1072
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:39.120
<v 3>or my podcasts,
they can they a take away the advertiser.
But I'd still do it.</v>

1073
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:43.950
I don't give a fuck,
uh,
advice on friends.
Hey Bill.
I'm a,
I'm in a junior,

1074
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.160
a junior in high school and I've got one group of really good friends,

1075
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:48.390
like eight or nine people.

1076
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.990
We are like the funny guys of our school always giving each other shit.

1077
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.100
Well there's one friend and he was an asshole for an entire summer to my other

1078
01:02:56.101 --> 01:03:00.120
friends who was a girl that he liked a lot.

1079
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.190
There you go.
That's,
that's American public schools right there.
There's one,

1080
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.410
well there's one for j.
Talk again,
tell these people,

1081
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.610
<v 4>it's unbelievable.
It's just a friend,
you know,</v>

1082
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.160
get read a book.

1083
01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:20.520
I mean all these auto corrects and grammar checks on compute.
I mean,

1084
01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:25.521
how do you not get out in front of right email that you want with every bit of

1085
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:29.070
technology that we have?
I just,
I'm stunned.

1086
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:32.080
<v 3>Okay.
I got it.
I figured it out.
Thank you.
Okay,
so there's,</v>

1087
01:03:32.081 --> 01:03:36.490
well his one friend and he was an asshole for an entire summer to my other

1088
01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:38.920
friend who was a girl that he liked a lot.

1089
01:03:38.921 --> 01:03:42.550
So this guy is friends with this girl and this other guy liked her lawn.

1090
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.710
He's been an asshole tour.
Um,
okay.

1091
01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:49.720
He started treating her like shit when she told him she didn't like him and
well,

1092
01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:53.650
things were heated all summer and it was weird.
Uh,

1093
01:03:53.651 --> 01:03:58.651
I was letting the girl know that he was saying what I was letting the girl know

1094
01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:04.710
what he was saying and due to her and now they are.

1095
01:04:05.081 --> 01:04:08.440
But at Jake talk again,
just,
just talk to the people here.

1096
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.300
<v 4>Well I don't even know what he started out by saying we got,</v>

1097
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.640
I got nine buddies that are like the funny guys that are group.

1098
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.870
I was more interested in that.

1099
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.000
Like I thought he was gonna go somewhere with like,
hey,

1100
01:04:17.001 --> 01:04:21.050
we're doing the like I don't,
I don't even know.
I mean,
he's just now,

1101
01:04:21.051 --> 01:04:21.884
he's just like,

1102
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.610
<v 3>he's guy basically whittled it down to three p buddy was saying was this kid</v>

1103
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:26.990
went over,
he ratted out the girl.

1104
01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:29.480
He's saying this and that to the other thing he said,

1105
01:04:29.481 --> 01:04:34.310
now this asshole guy and this girl who's a friend are like buddy buddy again,

1106
01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.080
because the other guy said that the dude writing this letter was lying and none

1107
01:04:39.081 --> 01:04:39.914
of it was true,

1108
01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.610
which of course she's gonna believe the other guy because she likes him.

1109
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:48.390
This guy's going to real or right in.
Oh no,
she doesn't.
He likes her.
Wow.

1110
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:48.950
That's weird.

1111
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:52.430
So why the fuck was she believed that he basically got everyone against me and I

1112
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:55.820
don't know what to do.
This guy's a psycho manipulating everyone.

1113
01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:59.570
He acts like he doesn't say anything and he acts overtly nice to me when he's

1114
01:04:59.571 --> 01:05:02.960
around me.
Yeah,
this guy's a psycho and it pisses me off.

1115
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.720
He won't tell the truth to anyone.
So my question is,

1116
01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:09.740
should I even try to fight back against this and try to win back my few close

1117
01:05:09.741 --> 01:05:13.100
friends or should I just tell them to go fuck themselves and try to make new

1118
01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:17.320
friends?
So you got ostracized by everybody?
Um,

1119
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.840
look who gives a fuck at this point?
If she doesn't believe you,
then fuck her.

1120
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.380
Let this guy do whatever the hell he wants to do with her.
Um,

1121
01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:32.100
<v 4>it's got to come back,
listen,
walk away,
beat a bigger and take the high road.</v>

1122
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.330
Walk away like that.

1123
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:37.290
Like that gun fighter in the West walking away by himself and this guy,

1124
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.250
the other guy will end up doing this to other people and he'll do it to her.

1125
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.460
And I'd be like,
dude,
you know,

1126
01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:49.050
whatever this guy's name is Johnny is man.
He's the,
he's the real deal.

1127
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.920
And you don't what?
You don't need people like that in your life.
Do that early.

1128
01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:57.300
Get used to that early,
getting those kinds of people.
No,
it is.
I'm telling you,

1129
01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:01.080
learn,
learn how to cut the weeds early,
man.
I tell you what,

1130
01:06:01.081 --> 01:06:04.830
because as you get older,
you don't want to get into those habits,
man.

1131
01:06:04.831 --> 01:06:07.260
It's just like a,
it's like,
you know,
what does it like abused women,
man,

1132
01:06:07.261 --> 01:06:09.760
they get into a habit and I'm not comparing it to that a little bit there,

1133
01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:13.780
but you know,
you don't want to get into that habit of being walked on and,

1134
01:06:13.781 --> 01:06:14.700
and treat it that way.

1135
01:06:14.701 --> 01:06:18.810
And just including yourself in a group of friends because you're like,
oh,

1136
01:06:18.811 --> 01:06:19.644
I don't know what else to do.

1137
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.570
<v 3>How will I get new friends?
That's that dude.
No,
no.</v>

1138
01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:27.850
And you got to cut the weeds.
You do,
Dude.
I did.
I took me to 40 to realize that.

1139
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:30.490
And I,
in the last just learning last five,
six years,

1140
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:36.060
I cut out all the negative people in my life and the level of drama that just,

1141
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:40.660
it was like a vacuum.
It just got sucked right out of the room.
And,
um,

1142
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.940
recently I was around,

1143
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.990
I was just doing some Gig and I end up just getting in like this social circle

1144
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.170
of just three or four people that were used to be like the kinds of people I

1145
01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:52.720
used to fucking hang out with.
And uh,

1146
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.840
I immediately sensed like negative energy,

1147
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:59.100
which I had never felt before because I was so used to it.
Right.
I was like,
I,

1148
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.880
I was one of those guys my whole fucking life,

1149
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:04.880
<v 4>just like,
you know,
when I fucking get out of this house,
I'm going to do it,</v>

1150
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:07.940
<v 3>blah blah.
And then you go out in the world because that's all,
you know,</v>

1151
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:10.040
you just recreate that whole fucking thing over again.

1152
01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:13.700
It's totally what I did and took me like 20 years to cut all of that shit out.

1153
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.200
And uh,
there's also that,
that,
you know,
I'm very forgiving of psychos.

1154
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:19.101
I am a psycho,

1155
01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:23.300
but I'm quite temperamental maniac for so many years in my twenties and early

1156
01:07:23.301 --> 01:07:24.134
thirties,
you know,

1157
01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:29.270
and it's like to be self sufficient and just become a complete fucking loner.

1158
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.690
Yeah,
that's what you did is you go out like that.
Fucking the hearse guy.

1159
01:07:32.691 --> 01:07:34.460
They're looking at a house he had.

1160
01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.400
<v 4>Yeah,
exactly.
But that's what the true though.</v>

1161
01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:40.820
You got like a gunfighter man and you just walk like,
you know,
shame man.

1162
01:07:40.821 --> 01:07:43.580
You just go,
go out and ride out.

To answer that one guy's first question on the Fan Mail doing Christ,</v>

1243
01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:42.650
to answer that one guy's first question on a fan mail,
but why don't you do TV?

1244
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.230
We know why he doesn't do commercials.
Yeah.

1245
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:52.590
Isn't that the fucking truth that's read there?
Yeah,
that's,

1246
01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:55.310
that's some heavy duty.
Uh,
I like that.

1247
01:12:55.311 --> 01:12:57.610
That is outside the dollar shave club though.
That's a good idea.

1248
01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:01.190
Even though I have a beard and I grew that because I literally grew my beard for

1249
01:13:01.191 --> 01:13:04.790
years ago because of the prices of razors.
I mean,
I'm like,

1250
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.730
<v 1>you know,
you,
you got to go date.</v>

1251
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:11.210
There's two things that they lock up in the store.
Did you know that?

1252
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.440
Liquor and razors,
I mean you got to go get a guy with a key.

1253
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.390
<v 4>Yeah.
That's how it's always been.
There always been a complete rip off.</v>

1254
01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.190
I've never understood it.
And you know,

1255
01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.190
it's funny drilling through these things with the offshore drill for rate,

1256
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:28.390
I mean the appraiser razors for what you get is,
is what I grew this beard.

1257
01:13:28.391 --> 01:13:29.224
It was because,

1258
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.640
<v 1>okay man,
I'm not.</v>

1259
01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:31.180
<v 3>Do you remember?</v>

1260
01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.600
Do you remember the late night they actually had that sharpener that you could

1261
01:13:34.601 --> 01:13:35.434
stick your rating?

1262
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.900
<v 4>That thing came and went in two seconds.
I bet the big race companies,</v>

1263
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.170
even the it bombed or they just bought it out.
Yup.
They bought it out.

1264
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:46.480
The or the Oh,
the creator of it was in a diner.

1265
01:13:46.481 --> 01:13:49.830
It was just like all of a sudden they poisoned me and fucking ran out and died

1266
01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:53.280
in the parking.
Well,
they probably just bought the patent to it and then just,

1267
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:53.760
you know,

1268
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.080
kept it under a lot of people by patents and then just hide them from everybody

1269
01:13:58.081 --> 01:13:58.914
so

1270
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.270
<v 1>they can't compete with them.</v>

1271
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:03.710
<v 4>I Dunno.
Wait,
let's talk browns before we get the fuck out of it.</v>

1272
01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:08.300
We'll get back up.
Oh Jesus.
That dog pound Horse Shit.
Sorry.

1273
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.420
No grown man.
I never liked it from the start.
We have a,

1274
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:14.990
we actually have a dog now.
The first time we have a dog.
That's cool.

1275
01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.520
Like a real dog.
We named.
Oh yeah,
we've got a bolt,

1276
01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:22.760
Matt Brown,
Bull mastiff named swagger is his first year as the like.

1277
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:26.750
So he kinda sits on the sidelines and just kind of licks himself.
I said,
Jesus,

1278
01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:29.840
this guy,
I said when I first got them on the guy,
just this dog,
you know,

1279
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.110
I don't know if this is a good timing with the way are these this things gonna

1280
01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.660
this thing's going to run out in front of a car after the week three,

1281
01:14:35.661 --> 01:14:40.640
probably just fucking throw himself in traffic on the,
on the,
uh,
what happened?

1282
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.180
I was in one man.
So,
uh,
you know,
we tried to give it away to New Orleans.

1283
01:14:44.181 --> 01:14:47.720
We had a great first half and then,
uh,
we just,

1284
01:14:47.721 --> 01:14:50.390
when you came in and start doing a POC as we made,
we went like,

1285
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:54.680
I just heard you yell.
Yeah.
87 yard.
Well we didn't go all 87 yards,

1286
01:14:54.681 --> 01:14:58.880
but we started I think on the 13 with about two and a half minutes ago and Hoyer

1287
01:14:58.881 --> 01:15:01.570
took us down the field and we had,
uh,
you know,
we would,

1288
01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.310
we had a great catch on the side.

1289
01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:07.850
Miles Austin at a great catch on the sidelines at about the 39 to keep the big

1290
01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.750
drive going.
And then we,
uh,
a big defensive breakdown.
We hit it,

1291
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:15.380
we hit a receiver down the middle to the 10 with four seconds ago and kind of

1292
01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:16.910
hit the game winning field goal 26,

1293
01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:20.810
24 browns over the saints who a lot of people think the saints are going to be

1294
01:15:20.811 --> 01:15:23.780
in that fucking vinyl for mixed one and one.
And we shouldn't be Pittsburgh.

1295
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.980
We lost a Pittsburgh.
You don't have a horrific defense or something.
Well,

1296
01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.020
it looked bad last week against Atlanta and it,

1297
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:33.100
it didn't look great against us today.
Well,
Rex Ryan,
or not rex Ryan,

1298
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:37.070
the fat one and the one that needs the one,
it needs to get off the sugar.

1299
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:42.040
The Ryan,
he fad.
I Dunno.
The ugly,
right?
The hair,

1300
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:45.470
they look the same.
They'll take no,
well,
rex went on that lap band.

1301
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:49.970
What's the guy's name?
Rob.
Rob has one of those light,

1302
01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.660
just disgusting stomachs.
You know what I mean?

1303
01:15:53.661 --> 01:15:55.070
Like he's got like the skinny legs,

1304
01:15:55.071 --> 01:15:59.900
the regular like neck and arms and then he's just got one of those man pregnant

1305
01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:02.450
bellies.
It's disgusting.
It's disgusting.

1306
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.720
<v 3>Well,
you're one on one.
I want to hear what I want.</v>

1307
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:07.040
Can I hear something positive from a Cleveland Browns?

1308
01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:08.690
<v 4>I like it.
I think we got a good coach on our hands.</v>

1309
01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.540
I said even after the first loss and,

1310
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:13.120
and watching a little bit is I twitch tweeted out,
I go,
I think,
you know,

1311
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:15.280
I think we actually have a well coached football team on our hands,

1312
01:16:15.281 --> 01:16:17.360
which we just haven't had.
We just,
I mean,
we,
we,

1313
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.340
we just haven't had a coach right,
since we've come back as the Brown.

1314
01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:24.340
We haven't had a coach since Bella check and now those are the guys that are

1315
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:24.501
right.

1316
01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:29.020
And the last time we won a playoff game as the Cleveland Browns who are now the

1317
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.850
Baltimore Ravens but has the Brown,
you beat us.
We beat,

1318
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.860
we beat the bill Parcells patriots in a wild card game at Cleveland and Bill

1319
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.190
Bellacheck is right.
Right.
All

1320
01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:40.930
<v 3>coach became the master 20 years ago.
That's 20 seasons ago.
Alright,
well I'm a,</v>

1321
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.650
I'm a closet Cleveland browns fan,
so I hope you guys have a great season.
Uh,

1322
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.310
I'm psyched.
The Patriots won and we were like,

1323
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:51.310
I got nervous after that first drive.
Um,
but you know,

1324
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.990
Adrian Peterson wasn't there,
so,
uh,
but I know we did do some things,

1325
01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:56.770
but I don't know when I,

1326
01:16:56.770 --> 01:17:00.850
when I saw Seattle on that first game and I then watched the 40 niners,

1327
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:03.310
I'm just like,
it's just so clear that the NFC,
you know,

1328
01:17:03.311 --> 01:17:06.180
if everybody stays healthy that the Superbowl is because I got that way again.

1329
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.040
It hadn't stopped playing from last year.
I said,
we have to have week one.
I'm,

1330
01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.230
they look like they're eight weeks.

1331
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:12.930
<v 4>Do peak hours.
I mean,
I've never been more wrong about that guy.
I was like,</v>

1332
01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:16.800
that guy.
And he's,
he just has that Nice guy look upon him.

1333
01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:19.230
When he coached the Patriots,
I was just like,
this guy doesn't have it.

1334
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.390
And then even when he did well at,
at,
uh,
uh,
USC,
I was just like,
well,
you know,

1335
01:17:24.391 --> 01:17:27.390
he's not,
he's not a fucking NFL coach.
Someone who never coached football.

1336
01:17:27.391 --> 01:17:29.620
I'm sitting there saying,
this guy is not an NFL coach.

1337
01:17:29.621 --> 01:17:32.760
And he won like two or three championships.
Well,
the crazy thing is,

1338
01:17:32.761 --> 01:17:34.890
is now the NFL,
that was always the hit.

1339
01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.700
You couldn't be a college because the college coach,
other than Jimmy Johnson,

1340
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:43.910
the college boy college coach never came in and did it any,

1341
01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.630
anything in the NFL.
And none of them.
Nick Saban,
Lou Holtz,

1342
01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.740
none of them very swept.
That was Jimmy's team.
That was,
come on,
that's sad.

1343
01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.600
But none of them could do that.

1344
01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:55.030
But the trend has changed because football has changed.

1345
01:17:55.031 --> 01:17:58.290
The quarterback in football has changed to a college style quarterbacks.

1346
01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:02.230
So now you got Pete Carroll ultimately successful,
Jim Harbaugh arch,

1347
01:18:02.231 --> 01:18:03.170
really successful.

1348
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:06.610
You got chip Kelly now the eagles turning that thing around real quick.

1349
01:18:06.611 --> 01:18:10.390
So you're going to see more turning around the culture in the law.

1350
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.510
College coaches are successful now in the NFL and it,
you know,

1351
01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:17.640
what more do they give Johnny Manziel a chance.
No,
nicely horror.

1352
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.360
He screwed the pooch on the side of the fucking field there.
Yeah.
You know,

1353
01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:23.980
listen to Brian Hall or Brian Hoyer.
It looks great and to,

1354
01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:27.010
he knows the playbook and the team is playing for him.

1355
01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.760
And you tried to suggest that Johnny was not learning the playbook.
He isn't.

1356
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:31.630
Where did you hear that?

1357
01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.650
We heard that in some articles that came out of training camp.

1358
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:38.620
Why he was shooting himself in the foot because they were giving him chances to

1359
01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:41.620
win this job even though Hoyer,
she was the number one guy.

1360
01:18:41.621 --> 01:18:44.200
Putin was a new coach and he was giving him a chance to win a job.

1361
01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.280
And some of the,

1362
01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.490
some of the articles coming out of cleveland.com it was saying that he was not

1363
01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:49.960
grasping the playbook.

1364
01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:54.280
I think that means he's not learning the playbook or you know,
he's a,

1365
01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.910
I'll tell you this kid has had every opportunity in the world,

1366
01:18:57.911 --> 01:19:00.400
but if you're not going to sit down and learn your x's and o's,

1367
01:19:00.401 --> 01:19:02.890
I mean the team's not going to get behind you.
And if that doesn't happen,

1368
01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:07.710
it is very difficult to win in this league.
These guys.
Okay.

1369
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:11.650
They will hurt you.
They weren't,

1370
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:16.230
they are terrific in punk coverage and they are excellent creativity on fourth

1371
01:19:16.231 --> 01:19:20.850
and well as a Huey Brown with doing football.
There's not one woman left.

1372
01:19:20.851 --> 01:19:24.510
It listens to this podcast.
This is just a sausage fest.
I got,
fuck it.

1373
01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:26.370
I can have a fight.
I don't think I've ever had a female guest.

1374
01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:28.920
How by I don't think I ever heard your wife.

1375
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.650
<v 3>No,
no.
I mean like a,
like a fucking outside of somebody I live with.
Um,</v>

1376
