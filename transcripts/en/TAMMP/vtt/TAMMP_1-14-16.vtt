00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.850
Hey,

It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.830
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.470
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.130
<v 0>yeah.
How are you?
How's your week going?
Ah,</v>

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.340

Back to the fucking grind.
You too.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.390
Oh yeah.
How was,
how was your,
how was your,
how was your time off?

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.250
Do you have a nice holiday?
Did Ya,
did Ya dead yet?
Oh yeah.

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.370
How old is she now?
Really?
Really?
Can I check off door yet?
Just kidding.

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.610
I'll see it break.
All right.
Oh,
you haven't those fucking conversations.

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.620
Oh,
the holidays are over and it's back to the grind.

11
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.290
Sitting in traffic though,
into your cubicle.

12
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:55.291
I think I'm going to kill my boss if I don't drive into the wall.

13
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.170
Um,
I actually had a fucking panic attack.
Not a semi panic attack.

14
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:03.310
Sorta like I fucking nose dives into a bit of a depression yesterday.

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.790
Just stick another fucking year.
Here we go.
Here we go again.

16
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.530
Here we fucking go again.
Uh,

17
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.020
we have a mechanical problem with the aircraft.

18
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.720
We're just going to pull over here on the tarmac.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.220
We have a landing light that is inoperable at this moment.

20
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:28.140
We're gonna sit tight here and wait to learn the mechanics come out here,

21
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:32.600
which I do not have a estimated time on at this point,
but a well,
we deal.

22
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.430
Guess what information will lack.
In fact,
his Sudeley cat had died till that.

23
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.080
Now it's getting me apologize for the delay at,
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.000
just try and sit back and relax,
especially Canada.

25
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.140
I've got to try to keep the air on.
Uh,

26
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.810
apologize if it gets a little hot back there.
Now the fucking year of that,

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.490
another fucking year of that.
The show's a great,

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
it's the getting the,
getting to the shows.
Um,

29
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.500
oh God.
People taking their fucking shoes.
I look,

30
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.110
if you take your shoes off and you have socks on,
I fucking get it.
All right.

31
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.570
Just don't rub your feet together.
I've talked about it before.

32
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.620
My just can you not rub your fucking feet together?
Foot,
foot,
foot,
foot,
foot,

33
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:12.800
foot.
It fucking drives me nuts that just,
uh,

34
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.840
just want to punch the back of the fucking chair.
Um,
anyways,

35
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.180
uh,
what is going on with me?
I'm going to be on the cow,
Colin cowherd show,

36
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.120
uh,
today.
Hyping a F is for family.

37
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.170
I'm going into Netflix today and we're going to do our little song and dance and

38
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:36.171
pitch them our season arc for a season two.

39
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.530
Basically.
Uh,
that's what you do after you do the first one.
And they go,
hey,

40
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.940
Yo were pretty good.
Pretty good,
but now where are you going to go?
Well,

41
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.760
you're going to go with it now and then you got to get in the eye.
He had a dead,

42
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.150
a dead I would to do to do to,
he does this.
She does that.

43
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.820
Give it some more fucking money please.
Then they go,
oh,

44
00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:59.070
we'll think about it then.
Yeah.
Everybody walks.
Outcome.
I think there were good.

45
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.980
You think we're good?
I think it

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.120
<v 2>went good.
I don't know here.
What should we here Tuesday,
Wednesday at the latest?</v>

47
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.490
Uh,
we don't think every bloody for Ra flat a frameless gas here the day.

48
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:11.320
Yeah.

49
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.210
Fortunately you were at dealing with little bit of weather in the Dallas Fort

50
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.070
Worth area.
Uh,
who number 72 in line?
Um,

51
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.540
unfortunately it's really nothing we could do here.
Be patient,

52
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.740
we can try and make up some table or in the air you gonna Trust Loulou faster,

53
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.180
poured a little more fuel,
we can try and put her own hole in the ozone layer.

54
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.710
You know what I'm saying?
Now the year that,
but you know what else?

55
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.090
You know sometimes,
you know,
I don't know.

56
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.340
Every once in a while I just fucking drive down the street.

57
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.090
I just see a homeless guy laying on the sidewalk sleeping,
you know?

58
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.040
And as much as uncomfortable as is,
you just look and just like,
you know,

59
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.010
I would fucking love to do that right now.

60
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.000
Just pull over and laid down on the ground and take a fucking nap.

61
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.770
Now I don't want to live outside.

62
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.980
<v 2>And granted,</v>

64
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.970
I know that that homeless guy is sleeping during the day because at night that's

65
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:09.260
when the people come up out of the sewer drains,
like in fucking,
uh,

66
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.750
escape from New York,
you know,
cause they have to feed.
So when you're homeless,

67
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.530
she got to be up at night,
you know,
a lot of pill.

68
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.050
It is Bob taking a nap in the middle of the fucking afternoon.

69
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:24.000
That's because it night,
right?
These have been like a fucking,

70
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.700
you know,
a two by four fight fighting off.

71
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.640
All right.
He's dealing with that shit.

72
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.890
So,
uh,
but I like the nap part of it.

73
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.780
I'm actually looking at the homeless guy's life,

74
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:43.570
the way a woman looks at a man's life.
Like,
that looks fun.

75
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:47.880
I want to do that.
I don't want to pay the price for it,

76
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.340
but I'd like that.
And my

77
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.430
equal rights,

78
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.130
I am in a fucking mood.
Um,

79
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.960
all right.
I go on Facebook because I'm an old white guy.
I love,

80
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.370
I love the Facebook.
I absolutely love it.
I don't give a fuck.

81
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.810
Even if I delete my account,

82
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:14.811
they never deleted cause or that creepy cunt who I judged by the actor who

83
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.080
played him.
I don't even know what the real Zuckerberg looks like.

84
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.720
Is that his name?
Oh,
I fucked up the other day.

85
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.350
I said Lamar London instead of Lamar Hunt.
He was the original owner of the,

86
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.790
of the,
uh,
Dallas,
Texas.
Lamar Lundy was part of the fearsome foursome.

87
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.810
And what's funny is that's the fucking name I can never remember.

88
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.970
You know,
when they go name the first and force them,
I'm always like,
oh,

89
00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:41.110
hi Rosie Greer,
Merlin Ocean,

90
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.810
uh,
Deca Joe.

91
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.050
<v 2>And</v>

93
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.073
<v 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.520
<v 2>Lamar Lundy's like the bass player and a huge bad,
right?</v>

95
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:00.360
You can never the bass player,
you know,
unless they're really,
if they're,

96
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.810
unless they're like one of those front man bass players like Steve Harris,

97
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.280
you know,
Billy sheen and you know,
back in the day,

98
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.730
John and twist,
you know,

99
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.900
or they play in a trio because then you only have to remember three names.

100
00:06:15.901 --> 00:06:17.760
But if they play in a band of four or more people,

101
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:22.710
you just can never remember the bass player's name.
You know,
Lamar Lundy.

102
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.810
Is that all right?

103
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.960
What's switch the front floor for the Steelers?

104
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.260
I don't think I can name that was me.
Joe Greene,
LC,
Greenwood.

105
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.420
Dwight White,
Eh,
uh,

106
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.050
and the bass player.
What the fuck was his name?
It's a great name too.
Uh,

107
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.820
it's a fucking shame.
I'm,
I'm gonna have to look that up.
I have to look that up.

108
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:49.050
Like,

They went forward.
Oh,

109
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:52.560
and titles.
You can't,
you can't disrespect the team.

110
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.540
You know who's fan base?
I'm not going to get into it area right.
Here we go.

111
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112

113
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.590

114
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.480
the steel curtain.
Who,

115
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.750
The steel curtain,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.913
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

120
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:34.630

Anyways,

121
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.630
they're going to be man's name's left anymore.
Do they?

122
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.040
This is coming from a guy named bill.
Won't you will come home.
Bill Bailey.

123
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.760
Um,
go back here.
What did I want?
Oh,

124
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:49.700
here's what I wanted to talk about.
The uh,

125
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.720
the Los Angeles Rams.
They,
the Saint Louis Rams.

126
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.230
<v 2>Slash Los Angeles Rams.
Slash Cleveland brands.</v>

128
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.930
Hi.
Slash Cleveland Rams.
They comment back there.

129
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.230
Gum it back.
I'm so psyched that they're coming back.

130
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:16.231
I'm so psyched that it was the rams and not the chargers or the Raiders there.

131
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.700
A's.
I'm so fucking excited.
Okay.

132
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.950
La does not need the chargers or hey,

133
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.560
we don't need him to stay away.
Okay.

134
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.100
La needs the rams,
blue and yellow.

135
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.240
The Rams,
the Los Angeles Rams.
That's what they need.

136
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.540
They don't need,
they don't need the fucking,

137
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.420
they don't need to bring the Raiders.
But if you bring the Raiders back,

138
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.200
the city of Los Angeles,
if you bring the Raiders back,

139
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:54.640
you're basically signing off on the fact that someone's going to get stabbed or

140
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:56.480
shot.
It's just,
it's a fact.

141
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.390
Just watch the 30 for 30 on the fucking Los Angeles Rams,
the one that ice cube,

142
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.850
uh,
narrates the way he's talking and all that shit.
It's fucking,

143
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:10.550
it's actually inadvertently like hilarious.

144
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.790
It's just the level of like,

145
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.280
La doesn't eat.
You don't,
you don't fucking need it.
Somebody is going to like,

146
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.560
they can't handle,
they can't handle those colors.

147
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.360
They can't handle the pirate on the side of the,

148
00:09:23.361 --> 00:09:26.420
keep it in fucking Oakland where people just dress up.

149
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:27.800
Like it's going to be a musical.

150
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.580
And even then somebody got shot at a fucking 40 niners Raiders,

151
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.600
like a pregame thank you.
You,
you don't need it.
You know,
it's funny,

152
00:09:35.601 --> 00:09:39.860
everybody always talks about the Philly fans and how east coast fans.
Oh,
Yankees,

153
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:42.680
red sox.
It's nothing compared to out here.
People die out here.

154
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.360
Guy went to a fucking Dodger's game with this kid and had on a giants Jersey and

155
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:47.720
he had,

156
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.310
he has brain damage for the rest of his fucking life because this fucking two,

157
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.240
two guys jumped up while his kid sat there and watched.

158
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.970
That was at a fucking baseball game.
The rams.

159
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.770
That's it.
Hi.
Where are the rams?
Perfect.

160
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.850
<v 2>You don't need the autumn wind was Erie.</v>

162
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.450
You don't need to bring that to the inland empire.

163
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.630
They don't need to do that.
I'm telling you.

164
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.520
And I'm basing charger fans on the one fucking charger game that I fucking went

165
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.010
to add.
Um,
I,
oh,
you know,

166
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.630
me and La head almost got into a fight when we were there and I was rooting for

167
00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:30.910
the chargers.
I just had a patriots hat on.

168
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.900
It was an old school patriots had,
it was all fucking beat up.

169
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.220
They will play in the fucking colts.
I'm cheering the charges.
That alone.

170
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.710
I mean I expected to get a little bit of shit right,
a little bit of Shit,

171
00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:48.490
but to get to the point that it's going to be a physical confrontation and

172
00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:51.700
somebody dumps a beer on you and that type of shit.
All my bad,

173
00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:54.340
but they did it on purpose.
Like,
yeah,
fuck that.

174
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.630
Keep those fucking animals where they're at.
Keep them where they're at.

175
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.050
Like just,
you know,
keep the rocky horror picture show in the end zone.

176
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:05.650
Keep that up and fucking Oakland.
Plus it's the Oakland Raiders.

177
00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:06.500
That's their fucking say.

178
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:08.830
I'm kind of giving the I inadvertently given Oakland's shit.

179
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:12.140
I don't mean to do that.
It's the Oakland Raiders.
All right.

180
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.030
They came down here before they tried to make it in Hollywood.
They couldn't,

181
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.320
you know,
they got a couple of guest stars on the fall guy,
you know.

182
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.160
Then they did an episode of full House and then it just sort of dried up for him

183
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.120
and then they put their tail between their legs.
They went back home,

184
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:34.470
they took over their dad's business.
I don't understand why they coming back

185
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.030
and why everybody all at once.
All of a sudden everybody wants to come here.

186
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.670
We've been sitting here for 20 fucking years without a team.

187
00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:47.500
Now all of a sudden everybody wants to come back.
The Ram should come back there.

188
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.940
Los Angeles team,
all right.

189
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.690
Now I know the charges started here in la,

190
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.880
like their first or first year or two on the AFL,
but uh,

191
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.590
yeah,
keep it down in San Diego,
you know,
and said,
hey,

192
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.990
you don't understand my standing with San Diego's a great place.

193
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.030
It's one of them met most mellow,
great places.
When you go down there,
you like,

194
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:14.260
this is everything that Ellis should be.
It's chill,
it's fucking relaxed.

195
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:18.100
You've got the weather.
This is great.
It's not the grind of La.

196
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.000
That's what San Diego feels like when I go down there.
Fucking love it.

197
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.040
But then for whatever fucking reason,

198
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.970
you go to a sporting event and these people turn into fucking maniacs,

199
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.210
not a padre games just to charger games.
They just,
if fucking animals.
Um,

200
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.010
I dunno.

201
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.950
Maybe if they built them a nicer stadium and then they gave him a mascot.

202
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.400
I have no idea.
But I do think it's really fucked up that,
you know,

203
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.410
the Raiders are going to leave because you know,

204
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.970
in the charges are going to leave and Saint Louis is leaving basically.

205
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.790
Cause they don't like their stadiums and they're throwing a fucking temper

206
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:58.000
tantrum.
It's the NFL is so fucked up,

207
00:12:58.001 --> 00:13:02.200
man was sports in general that they do that to people.
It's like,
dude,

208
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:06.460
it's your league.
It's your fucking business.
You know what I mean?

209
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.810
You don't like you fucking place of work,
you know,
build another one.

210
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.020
I don't know,
there's that,

211
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.360
but there's no way to organize people to get them just to,
to stand up to owners.

212
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.493
Right.

213
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.770
Like I remember hearing when I was working in Indianapolis in Indianapolis,

214
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.580
you know,
they played at the,
I was at the Hoosier dome or whatever.
Um,

215
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.940
when they were building that Lucas oil field,

216
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.520
this taxi driver when I was there was telling me that,
that the city will,

217
00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:38.830
they weren't even done paying off the RCA dome or whatever the fuck they called

218
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.460
it.
They weren't even done paying that off.
And then they had this fucking thing.

219
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.810
If you've never been to Indianapolis,
I don't know if,
uh,
the,
the Hoosier dome,

220
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:49.450
Rca Dome,
whatever the fuck it was called,
if that's still standing,

221
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.081
but when they've,

222
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:54.010
we'll fucking building Lucas oil field and it was right next to the,
uh,

223
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:56.050
the old one,
which I believe is torn down.

224
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.480
You could fit like two of those inside the new one and stack two on top of each

225
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.420
other.
Um,
the size of this fucking new one.

226
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.790
I only can only imagine how much tax payers have to pay for that shit.

227
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:10.760
And it's fucking stupid.
The whole thing's fucking stupid.
I,

228
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:15.010
I really believe that once you make a stadium that should be a stadium and he

229
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:19.450
just keep fixing the fucking thing up the way I'm fixing up my shed hall of Aha.

230
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.300
Sorry,
I just discovered something else that was fucked up with my house.

231
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:29.650
But you know what,
right now,
the stubborn German Irish guy in me,
I'm just like,

232
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.570
you know what,
bring it up.
Sync every fucking dime I have into this goddamn

233
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.390
taken on water.
Shit.
Hole of a boat.
I'm,
I'm done.
I'm fucking done.
Like,

234
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.960
uh,
I'm having somebody come over today to look at my garage.
And uh,

235
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.150
somebody built off of,
uh,
my office here,

236
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.650
they built this closet and they extended this room itself.

237
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.120
And uh,
I don't know who's friend of a friend built this fucking thing,

238
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.360
but it literally sits,
uh,

239
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.190
right above my garage and on these two wooden,
like,

240
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.490
I don't even know what the terminology is there.

241
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.130
Not Two by fours was a four by sixes,
whatever.

242
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.020
It's wood and it's always bothered me.
And then down,

243
00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:18.730
I talked about this in the last podcast,

244
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.210
but beneath that is my garage.

245
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:27.211
And in my garage right underneath that wood is a steel beam that goes across the

246
00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:28.220
garage,

247
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.220
does a steel beam going down one side and not on the other cause there's a

248
00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:38.020
window there.
So they said,
well,
forget supporting the entire fucking structure.

249
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.460
Let's put a window here so I can look at my neighbor's house that's fucking six

250
00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:43.294
inches away.

251
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

252
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.050
<v 2>Yeah.
One of the first things I did when I bought the houses,</v>

253
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.540
I put a shade up and pulled it down and I've never brought it back up again

254
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.190
until the other day when the guy looked.
Um,
so anyways,

255
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:58.670
I think when you get like a stadium,
like just,
just fix the fucking thing up.

256
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

257
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.100
<v 2>Just fix it up and keep fixing the fucking thing up.</v>

258
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.140
<v 2>And that's it.</v>

260
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.970
<v 2>What do you do if you ever,
ever gotten tickets into a luxury box?
It sucks.</v>

262
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.800
It sucks.
The food socks.
You're 9 million miles away from the game.

263
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.420
You now the upper deck is further away from the game.
It fucking blows.

264
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.750
I wish you guys,
you,
you young people out there.

265
00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:30.130
I wish back in the day you could've gone to like,
uh,
like the Boston Garden.

266
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.130
Maple Leaf Garden.
Um,

267
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:34.460
<v 1>okay.</v>

268
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.750
<v 2>I mean,
I never went to a game there.
I took a tour of the place,
but I,</v>

269
00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:40.270
I'll just go with the ones that I went to,
the old fucking Boston Garden.
Dude,

270
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.140
you are on top of the fucking game.

271
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

272
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.880
<v 2>It was like thunder dome when you were,</v>

273
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.480
you were in the upper deck of those fucking stadium stood it.

274
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.830
You literally felt like if you lean too far forward,

275
00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:53.580
you can have fall down and you would hit the ice.
That's how steep it was.

276
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:57.890
But now they're like the fire code and you know,

277
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.730
to get the fucking elephants out,
you know,
it's got to be fucking more chill,

278
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.380
you know,
of relaxed grade.
I don't know.
I'm not into it,

279
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:10.200
but I'm psyched at the rams are back.
I feel like the ram should be there.

280
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.180
I feel like San Diego should be in San Diego.

281
00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:13.830
I feel like Oakland should be an Oakland,
you know,

282
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.020
like the way it was when I was a kid.
Um,
and that's it.

283
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:23.630
And I know I was kind of fucking rough on fucking la fans,
but it's true.
Anaheim,

284
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.040
I went down to Anaheim one time,
we would share it on the red sox.

285
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.280
We had on our red sock shit,
you know,
but we weren't conscious about it.

286
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.220
I used to wear red shocks,

287
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:34.890
suck stuff into a Yankee Stadium and people would break my balls,

288
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.640
chance some shit and point at me when I laughed it off and they saw that I was a

289
00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.980
good shit or whatever.
And then they would,
then they would do that anyway.

290
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.770
How long are you down here in New York?
I lived down here,
I really blah blah,

291
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.540
blah,
blah,
blah,
you know,

292
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:48.300
and then they'd score and they'd fucking laugh at me and give me shit or

293
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:51.210
whatever and know and if we scored and won the game,

294
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.190
I wouldn't fucking point Adam and stuff.
I wasn't,
uh,
I wasn't a dick.

295
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.070
All right.
Cause this is my thing.
If you go into a stadium with the other jersey,

296
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.930
you got to expect to get some shit.
All right.

297
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.440
But like once you demonstrate that you're not going to be a fucking obnoxious

298
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:06.810
ask.
People should leave you alone.
You know what I mean?

299
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:07.890
You're just making a road trip.

300
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.230
You're showing the other stadium respect that you wanted to come.

301
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:11.910
And see it and that should be the fucking end of it.

302
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.060
And that was my experience when I was living in New York.

303
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.810
I came out here and it's just like,
no,
I'm going to stab you in the fucking neck.

304
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.210
So,
well actually,
you know,

305
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:27.030
I'm always bitching about the population prompts.
You know what,
fuck all that.

306
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:29.700
Fuck the last 18 minutes of this podcast,
bring their a,

307
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:32.360
it's bring them down here.
Maybe some people will fucking die.

308
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.120
It'll be a couple less people procreating,
you know,
Bill,

309
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:40.230
did you really have to take it today?
Yeah,
I think I did.
Um,
all right.

310
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.300
You know what that kind of reminds me of though is the,
uh,

311
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.000
these fucking people who are baiting Trump supporters.
Now I'm not,

312
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.790
I'm not going to get into politics here,
but you know,

313
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.170
you got to call a spade a spade here.

314
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:56.780
I mean that those people are mouth breathing morons.
Uh,

315
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.870
and Trump is up there not saying anything and getting them to go absolutely

316
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:03.160
fucking nuts.
Uh,

317
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.180
and it's actually a,

318
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:12.530
it's like watching a movie where they're kind of warning you about,

319
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.430
I dunno,
when I watched Trump,
when I listened to what he says,
it,

320
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.670
it reminds me of like some couple of Hollywood movies that I've seen

321
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:27.000
and the person running for office.
It's just so over the top and ridiculous.

322
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:29.160
It just reminds you that you're watching a movie and just like,

323
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:32.400
why did they go that far?
If they just fucking dialed it back a little bit,
I,

324
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.790
this could be a little more believable and a,
you'd have a much better,

325
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.440
much better movie.
And then along came Trump and,
uh,
you know,
I owe all of those,

326
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:44.850
uh,
movies and apology,
but I do have to say this,

327
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.230
the fucking nerds who went to the,

328
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:51.090
one of the latest Trump rallies and had a sign,

329
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.950
Obama's a good president.
This country already is great,
but they,

330
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:58.770
you just went in there,
you know,

331
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.300
you went in there to pick a fight and then they videotaped it.

332
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:06.180
And when they tore up your signs,
what's,
you knew they weren't going to do?

333
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.620
You get to be like Trump supporters.
His hit a new low,

334
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.160
I guess the reason why they're doing that right now,

335
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.280
which is really what that is,
is basically entrapment.

336
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.150
That's like they throw drugs at your feet.
Oh,
what's that?
Um,
no,

337
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:25.530
that's actually not so well what if like some smoking hot chick,

338
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:28.170
he just walk up to some fatty and she's just like,
Hey,

339
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:32.400
you want me to suck your Dick?
Give me 20 bucks.
And he's like,
okay,

340
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.050
let me finish this muffin and the cops just come in.
You can't fucking do that.

341
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.990
You can't tempt,
he can't tempt somebody like that.

342
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.300
And I feel like that's kind of what they did with them.
But um,

343
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.200
having said all that,
yeah.
Um,
that thinks stopped being funny,

344
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.780
like a good four to six months ago and it's just like,
wait a minute,

345
00:20:50.781 --> 00:20:53.810
is this guy going to get the nomination?
You know,

346
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.710
all are begging for is just give me two reasonable human beings to sane,

347
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.070
reasonable human beings.
You know what I mean?

348
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.490
That,
that,
you know,
on either fucking side.

349
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:13.060
And they gave me that third fucking option.
Just be fucking reasonable.

350
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.210
Then walk around.
I'm going to bomb the shit out of.
So it's,

351
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.440
the fuck is wrong with you.

352
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.820
It's always the guys who don't have to go over there and do well.
You know,

353
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.570
I'm fucking,
I'm the tough guy behind the fucking desk.
Um,

354
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.220
I don't know.
I can't believe nobody slept that wig off yet,
you know?

355
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.090
Um,
all right,
let's,
uh,
let's plow ahead.

356
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.020
As somebody who's trying to keep up with both hockey and basketball,

357
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.100
this is what ends up happening.

358
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:42.490
You just end up watching your own teams and you don't know what the rest of the

359
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:43.151
League is doing.

360
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.540
And that's what's going on with me because I used to check in with the Dallas

361
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:50.830
Stars and uh,
and the,
uh,
the Black Hawks and the,
um,

362
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.843
and the La Kings,

363
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.390
just teams I really like watching and I haven't had a chance to,

364
00:21:56.391 --> 00:22:00.350
so I've just been watching the Bruins fucking lose,
lose,
lose on this road trip.

365
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.310
We lost a jersey,
then we lost to a

366
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.300
fuck.
Did we lose?
No,
he beat Jersey,
right?

367
00:22:08.301 --> 00:22:12.980
We beat Jersey and we've lost three in a row.
We lost to the flyers,

368
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.150
the rages and Ottawa.
I will say auto was the,

369
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:21.260
was the most enjoyable loss because it's my belief that the best thing in sports

370
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:24.140
right now is three on three overtime hockey.

371
00:22:24.141 --> 00:22:27.710
Even if you fucking everybody who bitches about hockey,
this is the hockey.

372
00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:31.670
You want to see no fights racing up and down the ice and someone's can basically

373
00:22:31.671 --> 00:22:35.840
going to score within five fucking minutes.
You'll love it.
Um,

374
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.980
I don't know if there's any youtube videos you could watch the whole fucking

375
00:22:39.981 --> 00:22:42.980
overtime.
They,
the Ottawa Bruins over time it was,
it was,
it was,

376
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.340
we lost and I was,
I almost stood up and applauded.

377
00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:49.580
It was that fucking enjoyable to see.
Um,

378
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.923
was incredible.

379
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.690
<v 2>It's almost like when you watch it,
you're like,
you know what?</v>

381
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:58.270
Maybe there's too many people playing professional hockey.

382
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.800
I want to take anybody's job.

383
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.160
But if it was three on three from the get go of Jesus Christ,

384
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:05.680
the whole fucking game,
you know what,
what happened?

385
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.460
Somebody would die it to cardio would just be off the fucking,

386
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.630
has anybody interviewed a Nhl player yet to say like,
what is it like,

387
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.150
what's it like to,
to,
to,
um,

388
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.990
to take a shift or in like three on three overtime versus when it's a five on

389
00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:24.950
five,
not including the goaltenders.
Okay.

390
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.670
For all you fucking number nerds out there.
Like what is that like?

391
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.000
Are you more winded?
Is there an unbelievable freedom?

392
00:23:32.001 --> 00:23:33.800
Because you don't have to worry about getting checked.

393
00:23:33.801 --> 00:23:37.880
It's got to be fucking incredible feeling like you're playing pond hockey.

394
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:43.040
Um,
anyways.
And then the fucking Celtics,
they finally,
one last night,

395
00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:44.690
of course I missed the Goddamn game.

396
00:23:44.691 --> 00:23:48.740
I just them to fucking lost to the Knicks do that Porzingis guy.

397
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:53.090
Holy Fuck.
He's like a 10 foot Larry Bird.

398
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:56.540
He was looking like that in the first quarter.
Guy was just hitting one,

399
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.620
three after another and then he,
he took one shot,
three point shot.
This guy,

400
00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:02.000
it's like seven foot two or three or something.

401
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.890
He took a three pointer from like,

402
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:08.270
fuck it looked like he was like eight feet behind the Ark and they just want

403
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:08.810
wash.

404
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.810
And what's funny is it's each three daddy hit the fucking noises that the crowd

405
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:20.000
was making.
Like basically this is the guy,
I think this is the guy.

406
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.220
Like he'd hit one,
they like,
they cheer,

407
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:26.000
but you hear it like underneath the chair here.
Oh.
Then he hits a second.

408
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.690
Then the third one I like freaking the fuck out

409
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.800
and you can tell a mellow loves fucking play with them.
They're past,

410
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:38.690
knew each other.
It was fucking great.

411
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.150
So I'm sitting there watching it going like,
all right,

412
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:45.170
if we're going to lose these guys,
at least I get to watch,
you know,

413
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.930
the oldest star having fun with the new kid.
Um,

414
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.270
you know,
it was,
it was just really fun to watch the two of them playing and uh,

415
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.060
Jesus Christ,
God help the League if they get a fucking point guard,
Huh?

416
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.630
Well I'm not the whole league,
but I mean they could fuck with the Cavaliers,

417
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:06.320
couldn't they?
Maybe.
I don't know shit about hoop.
I'm going to shut up.

418
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.600
But I enjoyed watching them play and everything's going great.
And I got it.

419
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.920
So you know what?
I'm going to watch the rest of this fucking game.
And who knows?

420
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:16.940
Maybe I'll watch one of these guys put up 40.
Right?
Who knows?

421
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.970
And uh,
and then I'll send it all went to shit.

422
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.290
Mallows backing up the fucking court,
the ref standing there,

423
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.890
he steps on the refs 40 turns his fucking ankle and then that's it.

424
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.050
It's fucking it.
He tried coming back out after the half and then he just said,

425
00:25:33.051 --> 00:25:36.290
fuck it left.
I'm out.

426
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.190
I dropped my fucking 20 for the evening.
I'll see you.
And he fucking leaves.

427
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.450
I saw the other night,

428
00:25:41.451 --> 00:25:43.760
he's still not fucking playing because he stepped on the refs foot,

429
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.730
so he keeps fucking leaves.
So I'm like,
all right,

430
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:49.310
let's see if the kid can lead the team era.
And then next thing you know,

431
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:54.260
he's got like five fucking files and he's sitting down.
And this is funny.

432
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.240
That's funny thing is we still lost the Goddamn game.

433
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.880
I actually love the Celtics.
They're young and everything,
but they,
uh,

434
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.460
they love scoring like 35 and the first quarter,
you know,

435
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:06.800
and going up by 10,
12,
19,

436
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:12.510
I watched him lose to Memphis to having a 19 point fucking lead and uh,

437
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.900
I dunno,
I still like them and to think it just fucking hang onto a goddamn lead.

438
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.150
I could enjoy it a little bit more,
but by the way,

439
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:23.870
so last night they were playing the paces and um,

440
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.530
one of the fuck most fucked up things ever.

441
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:31.310
I was sitting there looking at the pacers wearing these uniforms and I'm like,

442
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.290
where do I know those uniforms from?
And it looked it up online.

443
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.810
They were wearing the uniforms,
the same uniforms that they wear in that movie.

444
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:42.770
Hoosiers,
right.
Am I correct in assuming that?

445
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.230
Let me look this up before I make fun of them for actually doing that.

446
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

447
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.130
<v 2>Hoosiers movie.</v>

448
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.400
<v 2>Images.
It's all going to be gene Hackman's face,
right?
Yeah.</v>

450
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.660
They were wearing those things.
Do you really sell fucked up?
That is,

451
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.981
hey black guys,

452
00:27:03.981 --> 00:27:07.040
why don't you put on these uniforms that white people used to wear when you

453
00:27:07.041 --> 00:27:08.090
weren't allowed to play?

454
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.523
<v 0>Second,</v>

455
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.160
<v 2>Sean,</v>

456
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.160
I want to say of away and those are fucking what was fucking a white why verse

457
00:27:17.201 --> 00:27:20.230
yt they all White Days,
right?

458
00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.270
Look at the pictures.

459
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.990
A picture of the fucking team in black and white that they were doing.
All right.

460
00:27:25.991 --> 00:27:30.520
Number 43 white number 15 white number 53 white,
25 white,

461
00:27:30.521 --> 00:27:33.700
13 wide,
12 white,
14 white.
The other guy can read his number

462
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:40.570
are all white.
Why?
Why would you have them?
Where those,

463
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.200
what did,
what are you going to have the uh,
the color barrier?

464
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.730
Broken uniforms one day this year.
I don't know.

465
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:51.370
It seemed like an odd fucking choice to me.
However,

466
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.510
Indiana has such a weird fucking ah,
it's such a weird fucking state.
You know,

467
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.240
it's really just like a,
you know,

468
00:28:00.241 --> 00:28:05.241
just odd golly gee shucks white people slash

469
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.450
astoundingly racist.
You know,
like as much shit as Boston.

470
00:28:10.451 --> 00:28:13.150
Like the only places that get shit for being racist.
Basically.

471
00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:17.740
It's the south and Boston,
Massachusetts and not having been on the road.

472
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.070
I don't know if I'll,
how fucking long as she can

473
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.850
we,
yeah,
no,
there's no worse is when the,
uh,

474
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.040
when you're still at the gate and they're just like

475
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.790
<v 0>touching everybody on American Airlines flight one,
nine or seven,</v>

476
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.130
six to Albuquerque.
Um,

477
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:40.280
we're still waiting for our flight crew to show up.

478
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.950
So it's probably going to be another 40 minutes if you'd like to get something

479
00:28:45.951 --> 00:28:47.840
to eat,
but don't want it too far.

480
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.373
<v 1>That's shit.</v>

481
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.000
<v 2>I don't even know why I just went into that.
Um,
I don't even fucking remember.</v>

482
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.450
You know what?
And I've,
I've been,

483
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.110
I've been doing this long enough to just say fuck that idea and I'm just going

484
00:29:00.111 --> 00:29:02.400
to continue one.
All right.

485
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:06.810
So we got a patriots versus the chiefs this weekend in playoffs,

486
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:10.630
football playoffs.
Um,
and I think that,
uh,

487
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.320
we could possibly win that game by the skin of our teeth.

488
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:16.050
It all depends on who comes back.
Uh,

489
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:20.120
but if we do not have an offensive line,
then uh,
our,

490
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.150
our goose is cooked because our starting running back,

491
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.580
who I can't even remember his fucking name,
he's been out for so long.
I,

492
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.630
I,
you know,
I really need to just pick a sport.
You can't fucking watch him off.

493
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.210
That's what I'm trying to do.
And watching the Patriots,
Bruins and Celtics,

494
00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:36.560
and I don't even know anybody's fucking name,

495
00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:38.780
any mice to know the fucking lines or the Bruins.
I don't even know.

496
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:43.100
I'm just sitting there.
You know what it is it,

497
00:29:43.101 --> 00:29:47.150
this is my fucking,
I dunno what the,
that the psychological term is.
It's like,
oh,

498
00:29:47.151 --> 00:29:49.190
I'm going to,
I'm going to get them,
I don't know,
watch the Bruins much.

499
00:29:49.191 --> 00:29:51.710
All the Bruins Games,
watch all the Bruins games and then first he comes out,

500
00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:54.090
I'll get the basketball watch off.
Rose.

501
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.780
I'm just fucking sitting here binge watching this shit like a maniac.

502
00:29:59.781 --> 00:30:03.590
I think I need to step back for a second and get my priorities in order and

503
00:30:03.591 --> 00:30:07.400
realize that the Patriots are in the fucking playoffs and the Bruins and Celtics

504
00:30:07.401 --> 00:30:10.490
is still in the regular season.
I just be paying attention to the Patriots.
Right,

505
00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:11.324
right.

506
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.763
<v 1>MMM.</v>

507
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.560
<v 2>I Dunno.
I think,
uh,
I think,
see,
I think it's Seattle.
I think Seattle,</v>

508
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.930
they had their fucking little,
you know,

509
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.260
when you win a game the way Seattle one last week,

510
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:26.770
which is basically the other team basically screws to poach.

511
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.850
You got to start to feel like,
yeah,
you're kind of a team of destiny.
Right.

512
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.520
And I know one year the Patriots,
you know,

513
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.420
the ravens missed to field goal and that got us into a Superbowl.
But uh,

514
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.460
that one made me feel like we backed in,
but like I really think like Seattle,

515
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:46.930
if it wasn't fucking nine degrees out or 10 below zero,

516
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.280
I thought that was really in the vikings favor kind of slowed them down a little

517
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:55.960
bit,
evened out the field.
And I can say that knowing nothing about the vikings,

518
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:59.230
I'm going to shut the fuck up right now.
How about that?
Would that be all right?

519
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.390
Um,
anyways,
well that's the half hour here.
I got to,
uh,

520
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.380
I gotta go fucking,
uh,
put on my monkey suit here.

521
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.790
It makes sure that I look like I'm from Indiana when I go in to go pitch the

522
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:15.970
second season here.
So anyways,

523
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.410
thank you everybody for listening to the,
uh,

uh,
episode.
Uh,

525
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:26.760
now we're going to do a little throwback shit.
Um,

526
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.430
I didn't see any advertising for this week.
Um,

527
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.690
maybe you listen to some advertising right now that it recorded on my phone on

528
00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:34.590
the way to the fucking meeting.

529
00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:36.180
I have no fucking idea what you're going to hear right now,

530
00:31:36.181 --> 00:31:40.650
but I know eventually you're going to hear some throwback shit from a podcast

531
00:31:40.651 --> 00:31:44.980
from a year gone by.
All right,

You cuts.

The advertisements here,</v>

533
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:53.140
this is not the throwback part.
This is the advertising part.

534
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:55.630

She,

659
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.333
<v 5>yeah,</v>

660
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.660
<v 2>I don't know if the APP,
the cock blocks all been defined,</v>

661
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.670
like the different kind of cock blocks.
I don't know if this,
this names thrown,

662
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:08.250
but I got a new,
I got a new cock block for you.
Uh,
this,

663
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.970
this cock block in for a special and a very obvious one.

664
00:40:11.971 --> 00:40:15.390
And I think like this happens all the time,

665
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:18.780
but for some reason I've never heard anybody name it.
So I'm,
I'm gonna,

666
00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:23.520
I'm gonna kick off the creative process.
I call this guy the announcer.

667
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:28.200
That's the,
uh,
that's,
that's the name of this cock block.

668
00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:29.250
This is what happened to me.

669
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:30.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

670
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.100
<v 2>I was,
I did a Gig in Jersey and at the end of the night,</v>

671
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:39.660
these two girls who waited to be at the back of the line came up and they said,

672
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:42.880
hey,
you want to go out and get banana pancakes?
You know,

673
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:45.690
making a reference to my joke saying if I wanted to go out and hang out with

674
00:40:45.691 --> 00:40:50.190
both of them,
right.
And the second day said it,
I was like,

675
00:40:50.191 --> 00:40:54.060
Holy Shit,
he's a fucking,
here's something I never had.

676
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:58.050
Here's a two on one and I can't fucking do it cause I'm with Nia.

677
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.530
Whose kid?
Noco not cause I'm with Nias because everybody's got a cell phone,

678
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:02.850
fucking camera.
And I get caught.

679
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.560
<v 3>Honesty.</v>

680
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.320
<v 2>Um,
no,
I couldn't deal with the guilt.
Um,
I bought,
I got it.</v>

681
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.590
I'll be honest with you.
And I would say this,
if Neil was here,

682
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:18.790
if two fucking tens came up to me and said,
let's do this.
I,
I,
you know,

683
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.410
yeah,
fuck it.
Let's do it.
I never did it,
you know,
fuck it.

684
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.270
So anyways,
so they said,
hey,
you want to get a,

685
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:30.940
you want to go on and get bananas and pancakes or something like that.

686
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.370
And then this fucking guy like 10 feet or way just goes like,

687
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.643
<v 5>ah,</v>

688
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.560
<v 2>you know those guys.
Like if a girl just comes up to you,
just like you know,</v>

689
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.640
you know I've always loved guys in green shirts and your thinking raise your

690
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:48.680
thinking like holy fuck,
this is going to happen.

691
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.450
Just some other guy like five minutes,

692
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:51.703
<v 5>hey</v>

693
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.510
<v 2>and just makes the whole file of the whole fucking room look over at you.</v>

694
00:41:57.511 --> 00:41:59.280
The fucking announcer

695
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:05.730
fucking cock block mother fucker.
You know who would do that?

696
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.280
If I was standing there and her two girls said to a guy and be like God damn,

697
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:13.310
it's going down right side of my mouth at lucky motherfucker.

698
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.470
<v 5>I mean why would you do that?</v>

699
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.080
<v 2>The fucking announcer.
And if you have a friend like that,
all right.</v>

700
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.000
The only way you can still hang out with them is if he goes out.

701
00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:35.740
If you guys are going out trying to meet women,

702
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:41.310
he has to wear one of those old ABC bright yellow Monday night football sport

703
00:42:41.411 --> 00:42:46.040
coats.
And if the girls,
why is he wearing that?
You'll see,

704
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.590
you'll see.
And that'll be the,
that would be the funniest fucking thing ever.

705
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.170
Like if somehow if he couldn't figure out the joke and he just thought the coat

706
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.420
look good and just the whole night you just saw him,

707
00:42:56.421 --> 00:43:00.830
anytime you heard in the,
you know,
10 feet away,

708
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.470
a just look over and you'd see this guy dressed like Howard Cosell and you'd be

709
00:43:07.471 --> 00:43:09.630
like,
oh,
that's the announcer.
He's the,
he's the,

710
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.900
he's the guy he can cock block from.
Like,

711
00:43:15.901 --> 00:43:18.720
he's almost like a sniper if he wasn't so fucking loud,

712
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:23.070
he's at the same distance as a fucking marksman.
But uh,

713
00:43:23.071 --> 00:43:27.930
he kills it with a,
with loudness.
Oh my God.
Did that guy fucking annoying me?

714
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.530
Hey Nia,
come here.
Come here.
She just came in shaking her head.

715
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.120
What I am beyond,
come on over here.

716
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.240
I was just telling that story with that Guy Cock blocked me with those two

717
00:43:39.241 --> 00:43:42.020
chicks out in a Jersey when they would just go,

718
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.300
I told you this story.
No,

719
00:43:45.301 --> 00:43:48.630
but you're making it seem like you were going to do something.
No,
no,

720
00:43:48.631 --> 00:43:50.130
I wasn't going to do something.
This is the thing,

721
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:54.030
but I just admitted cock blocking.
Yeah,
but this is what I did admit.

722
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:57.750
If they were both tens,
I would've,
I would've,
I would've done it.

723
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.090
I never had a fucking two on one.
And you know something.

724
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:04.590
Would you be that mad if they were both smoking hot and the cell phone video got

725
00:44:04.591 --> 00:44:08.910
out?
The video is even need to get out when you got the announcer.
They,
the guy,

726
00:44:08.911 --> 00:44:12.520
he just literally goes like,
yeah,
we'd like to get pancakes with Yoda.

727
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.480
And he said something like,

728
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.363
<v 1>okay,</v>

729
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.260
<v 2>nothing.
Why am I a jerk?
So pajamas</v>

730
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.240
talking about cock blocking and ones,
what kind of podcasts is this turning into?

731
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.990
You know what,
it's turning into a very honest podcast.
I was very honest.
I said,

732
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.820
this is the thing I said I couldn't,
uh,

733
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.750
I couldn't deal with the guilt unless if they,
if,

734
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.020
unless they were both tens,
if they're both fucking tends,
give me a break.

735
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.390
Let me tell you something.
If you hooked up with Brad Pitt,

736
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:52.260
there's only so mad I could get.
It's fucking Brad Pitt.

737
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.030
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,
you know what,
if I just,

738
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.450
if I just said some generic good looking guy.

739
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:03.030
If I just said some generic good looking guy and you,

740
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:04.980
and you just said that that would have scared me.

741
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:07.320
But the way you just acted like you had Brad Pitt's phone number.

742
00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:09.720
That doesn't scare me.
Oh really?
Okay.

743
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.890
It's going down like the regular guy version of Brad Pitt.

744
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:15.560
Is that okay?

745
00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.750
Like he's just as good if you want to go live out on the street and get the fuck

746
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:20.220
out of this house.
Absolutely.

747
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.020
But you're allowed to have some sort of crazy two one one.
Yes.
That's bull said.

748
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.880
No it isn't.
If you just,
you know what,

749
00:45:26.881 --> 00:45:30.780
cause you're your thinking on it unlike like a,
a very basic level.

750
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.170
But if you really,
if you really think about it,
just think about it.

751
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:35.610
It makes sense.
Bill.

752
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:39.390
You're not going to try to mind fuck means and thinking that it's okay for you

753
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:41.910
to have some sort of two on one and I can't,
that's not,
no,

754
00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:46.180
it's not going down like that.
Women are beautiful.
We lust after you.

755
00:45:46.181 --> 00:45:49.530
A totally makes sense.
You guys find like Dick's or weird.
They're gross.

756
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.780
It's all hanging out there.
It's disgusting.
You don't want that.

757
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.330
You know nothing about you.
You don't want that.

758
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.740
It's been proven time and time and again and your stand up and in your podcast.

759
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.250
But that's a,
that's another discussion.
You know what you,

760
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:05.160
you just set yourself up like you're going to make some huge point and then you

761
00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:07.470
just tapped out.
You know nothing about women.

762
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.520
But that's just another discussion and I just don't want him to get into that.

763
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.630
So now what?
You just gave me the face.
What are you doing today?

764
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:19.690
Lazy Nini.
Kubrick.

765
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.030
So my short film over the weekend.
Screw you.

766
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:28.560
I'm working hard while you're in here in your pajamas talking about two on ones.

767
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.990
Yeah.
Well I have to do an hour's worth of shit here.
I'm coming up on it.

768
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.120
Let me go an hour and two minutes.
An hour and two minutes.
Have you done?

769
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.670
You're a deer via emails yet?
Yeah,

770
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:45.990
I did listen their emails.
You did that already.
Oh,
cause you want to chime in?

771
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.040
I don't know.
I already did it.
I already did it.
What about overrated?
Underrated.

772
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.640
Didn't do it.
They didn't have any this week.
Oh,
look at you.

773
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.060
I think you a fan of this podcast.
No,
I'm not.

774
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.840
Listen,
it didn't go down.
All right.

775
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:09.600
I'm telling you right now,
Nia,
if two tens come up to me,
it's going down.

776
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.320
Okay.
All right.
Well just be prepared for the retaliation.

777
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:16.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

778
00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:21.380
<v 2>Game set.
Match.
Really,
you're going to deny me that?</v>

779
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:26.480
Can I just buy you some stuff?
Wow.
Really?
Yes.

780
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:31.060
Really not some sort of fucking basketball that can be placated with material

781
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:35.410
things.
Uh,
to a point.
Yeah,
exactly.
If I'm going to be fucking honest here,

782
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.160
come on.
This guy would be something that I can buy.
You know something.

783
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.520
This should be our Valentine's Day.
All right.
For the guide,

784
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:43.930
the Guide Valentine's Day,

785
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:48.100
this is what Valentine's Day should be every year is the guy gets a two on one

786
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.410
and then you get some nice stuff.

787
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.880
Well why can't I have it's due on one cause you don't like that.

788
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.480
What do you mean?
What do you know?
Women don't like sex?

789
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.200
You don't find like when you guys fantasize,

790
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:08.680
you think about the guys in your life.
You don't think about other things.

791
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.370
Okay.
Um,
come on near just one.
Just give me one.

792
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.750
You get one and I get one.
No you don't.
Yeah you don't.
Yeah,

793
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.900
cause you don't want one.
What do you mean?
I don't want you just being childish.

794
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.940
No,
I'm not.
Yeah,
you are.
You do.
You see,
you see,

795
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:27.220
you think you think you want to hook up with,

796
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.200
with Jake Gyllenhaal and a bread face,
whatever the fuck his name is,
Brad Pitt.

797
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:35.830
Brad thread.
Face pit.
If you just think you do.

798
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.290
See you don't want to think about me is,

799
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.360
is like you have to hook up with somebody famous.

800
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.600
I'm actually just regular people.
See I'm down to earth with this shit.

801
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.680
See that's what I'm saying.
You liked stuff.
You like shiny,
shiny things.

802
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.190
Oh this is the deal.
I got a two on one and you,
you get some,

803
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.780
some cracked up face old man in Vegas like Robert Redford.

804
00:48:55.781 --> 00:48:59.620
Like I used to be good looking when Nixon was in office.
No,
no,

805
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.120
that's not how negotiating works.

806
00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:03.430
Now you've got to come with something else here.
No,

807
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:07.180
I think we should both get an equal opportunity thing going on.
Yeah,

808
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:11.290
but this isn't an equal relationship.
Why?
Why is it not an equal relationship?

809
00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:12.190
Cause I wanted to,

810
00:49:12.191 --> 00:49:15.610
I could pin you down to the ground right now and tickle you until you passed
out.

811
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:18.610
And it's not a fucking thing you can do about it.
What did that,

812
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:21.280
that has nothing to do with anything.
That's how the world works.
Nia,

813
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.740
why do you think America is on top?
Because we're right.

814
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.370
Well because we could all because,
because we can blow you up more times.

815
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.890
So it's your,
your physical presence.

816
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:32.500
That's what makes it like an unequal relationship.
Yeah.

817
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:35.620
Cause I can beat you down.
Well maybe you're physically stronger,

818
00:49:35.621 --> 00:49:38.920
but I'm mentally stronger than you.
Oh snap.

819
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:44.230
I'm smarter than you.
Yeah.
So whatever physical power.
Let me ask you this.

820
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:48.550
What you have are trumped by my mental fucking Goliath.
Ines,

821
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.530
suck on that red.

822
00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.560
<v 5>What do you think?
You're smarter than,
Oh,
that was good though.</v>

823
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.050
You got a good one.
[inaudible] storming off taught you.
Well,

824
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.600
<v 2>let's get to the complaints this week.
Everybody has,</v>

825
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.700
some lady just absolutely lost her mind.

826
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.090
Hates my guts now and won't listen to this podcast anymore.

827
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:04.700
And I apologized to her,
but she says she's not listening anymore.

828
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:06.830
There's no way that she's listening.

829
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.800
Despite that she wrote like a five page email that I'm now going to read.

830
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:15.080
She has a huge problem with me.
Everybody so settle it.
Want me to wait?

831
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.160
You want to go down to the break room?
Go get yourself a little coffee cake.
I'll,

832
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:22.700
I can wait.
I'm on vacation.
I got nothing better to do.
Good.
I'll wait.

833
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.530
Fucking dogs been farting all day today.
I don't know what his deal is.

834
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:31.790
And it keeps looking at me like,
dude,

835
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.250
you gotta help me out and I keep going to take it outside.

836
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:37.100
And then it just sniffs the grass and then I bring it back in.

837
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:39.290
It starts farting again and it keeps looking at me like,
dude,

838
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.280
I'm really trying not to shit on your rug.
Like,
I mean,

839
00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:46.850
that's how I'm reading her face.
I think that's what she's saying.
I have no idea.

840
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:49.460
So anyways,
uh,
so anyways,
here we go.

841
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:56.500
Um,
subject,
your podcast is hate speech.
Oh,
geesh.

842
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.540
Bill,
you probably won't read this or if you do,

843
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.240
you will just dismiss me as a stupid contour,

844
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.150
but no matter seat right there,

845
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:09.290
she's already draped herself in the OMD brave and I'm going to plow ahead.
Flag.

846
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:13.550
Um,
your podcast as of lace has morphed into hate speech.

847
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.410
He used to be funny and I could brush off your hateful comments with the cringe

848
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:22.940
and a shrug.
Now wait a minute,
if it would,

849
00:52:22.941 --> 00:52:25.730
if they were hateful right along,
why would you add that?
Okay,

850
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:26.623
let's just plow ahead,

851
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:30.830
but now you've gone too far for me to feature a segment on your podcast devoted

852
00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:35.060
to the deplorable behavior of women is intolerable.
Uh,

853
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:39.650
for those of you new to my podcast,
uh,
I've been doing this segment,

854
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:44.651
which I think is hilarious and needs to be done just to get you caught up before

855
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:49.790
this lady gives me both barrels hill.
Cause believe me,
she does.
Uh,
you know,

856
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:52.670
there's a bunch of,
there's a bunch of shows out there that,
that,

857
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:57.530
that shine a light on men who beat their women.
Those pieces is shit,
right?

858
00:52:57.531 --> 00:52:59.690
Trying to stop them from that behavior.

859
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:03.890
There's a bunch of shows out there that we'll talk about how,
uh,

860
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.800
who are these guys,
you know,

861
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.110
to say what a woman could do with their body.

862
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:10.910
They'll talk about the glass ceiling,

863
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:14.420
the old boys network and all that type of stuff when they shine a light on all

864
00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:17.900
of that.
Okay.
Which they should,

865
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:22.160
because that is guys doing things that they should not be doing.

866
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:26.730
That is not fair to women.
Okay.
But my,

867
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.560
so my problem is not that they do that.

868
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.080
My problem is that they never shine a light on shit that,

869
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:36.150
that women do that is not fair to men.
So recently.
Um,

870
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.510
if I can rate my drape myself in some sort of brave flag,

871
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.080
I've been reading these stories about guys who are married,

872
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.830
their wife goes out,
cheats on him,
has unprotected sex,

873
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.220
has a kid with another fucking guy,
doesn't tell their husband,

874
00:53:51.221 --> 00:53:53.070
and that by the time he figures it out,

875
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.790
he has to pay child support for a kid that is isn't even his,

876
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:57.900
and it's totally legal.

877
00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:03.330
And then I had the audacity to say that a woman who would do that to her husband

878
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.260
is a cunt.

879
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:10.110
Evidently that's hateful speech towards all women according to this person.

880
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.890
All right?
Because she continues and Oh,
does she ever continue

881
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.810
to feature segment on your podcast devoted to the deplorable behavior of women

882
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:19.644
is intolerable.

883
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.370
How is that any different than someone spending 20 minutes a week on a different

884
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.690
podcast featuring the deplorable behavior behavior of black people?

885
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.020
Why do they always go to black people?
That's always a,

886
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.810
that's just like calling me the n word.

887
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.690
This is no different than slavery.

888
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.970
That's people in other groups.
Always do that.
Always do that.
All right.

889
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.640
Gimme a goddamn break.
All right that she could,
she goes,
women are,

890
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:51.040
I mean,
how is that different?
How was it?

891
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:55.980
How was when I'm doing any different by by featuring a segment of women who are

892
00:54:55.981 --> 00:54:59.010
doing something absolutely reprehensible demand.

893
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.810
How is that any different than a show that focuses on men doing anything

894
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:08.070
reprehensible to women when they show wife beaters?
I don't look at that like,

895
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.350
oh my God,
they're saying I'm doing it too.

896
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.200
I think you know something.

897
00:55:13.201 --> 00:55:16.710
I really think you're being really selfish here and the fact that you could sit

898
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:21.240
here and listen to my podcast for this long as I've gone off on fat people,

899
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:22.980
I mean Jesus Christ,
once I about hate speech,

900
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.320
how much shit have I talked about Peyton Manning,

901
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:29.880
despite the fact I can't even throw a football.
You know,
if he sent me an email,

902
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:34.200
I would understand and I bet it wouldn't even be as crazy as this.
She says,

903
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:38.280
women are treated like second class citizens all over the world.

904
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.120
When did I ever say they weren't?
And even still in this country yet,

905
00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:47.121
you have no problem in citing further hate and disgust towards your fellow human

906
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:48.240
beings on this earth.

907
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:53.690
How am I inciting hate when when shows show wife beaters is that inciting hatred

908
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:58.800
towards men?
If you look at those shows and that makes you hate all men,

909
00:55:58.830 --> 00:55:59.850
then you're a moron.

910
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.500
So basically what you're saying is that I'm a moron and that all my listeners

911
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:07.890
are morons.
That if I call a woman who cheats on her husband,

912
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.770
has a baby with another guy,
it makes her husband pay for that.

913
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.560
If I call her a cunt,
that means I'm calling all women cunts,
you know?

914
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.230
Is that what you're saying?
Are you saying we're all that stupid?
She said,

915
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:22.380
right now there are men and that is written in capital letters,
men,

916
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:27.381
men in this country still capital s t I l l discussing whether or not women

917
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:30.580
should have the right to contraception and abortion.
Yeah,
I understand that.

918
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:33.880
And those people freak me out.
Those people freak me out.

919
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.390
And I am a guy and I've never said that a woman shouldn't have a right to that.

920
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:40.120
So I don't know what you're talking about.
This has nothing to do.

921
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:44.470
I'm talking about these fucking whores that cheat on their husbands.

922
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.840
Ma'Am.
You know what I love about all this?

923
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:51.940
How come you don't address what I talked about?
How come I can't hear?

924
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.760
What do you think about a woman who would do something like that?

925
00:56:55.270 --> 00:57:00.270
I saw a stat the other day that said 13% of kids in this country are not with

926
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:06.700
their biological father.
Meet.
Meaning that not just like,

927
00:57:06.701 --> 00:57:11.330
you know that,
that their wife got divorced and uh,
and,

928
00:57:11.331 --> 00:57:16.270
and then remarried and they mean like there's a guy either knows or doesn't

929
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:19.450
know.
Like the woman had a kid with somebody else while they were married,

930
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:24.820
like 13% of kids.
I mean that means 80% of women on the up and up.

931
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.010
All right,
God bless them.
They're angels.

932
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:31.150
But that 13% needs to be taken tasks.
I mean,
I would,

933
00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.830
I mean how many guys are beaten women?

934
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.290
I would guess that probably be right around that same,
you know,

935
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:38.050
maybe a little higher.
I have no idea.
Let's just,

936
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:43.110
let's say it's 20 let's say 20% of guys beat their women,

937
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.740
should they not be called out and be called cowardly pieces of Shit,

938
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:52.060
you know?
And if you call them cowardly piece of Shit,
what?

939
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:55.900
I have a right to sit there and look at that and be like,
well that's,
now you're,

940
00:57:55.901 --> 00:57:59.800
you're inciting further hate and disgust toward all men.

941
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.480
You're being really selfish here,
man,
because I go off on everybody.

942
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.060
This podcast is over the top and it's crazy.

943
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:11.800
I call guys cuts on this podcast and you're being really selfish right now.

944
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:13.430
And now you know,

945
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.840
you make this big long speech and then you're gonna take your ball and go home.

946
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.840
I look,
look at this,
look at all she's bringing up here.

947
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:23.380
Women are still earning only 70 cents for every dollar a man earns.

948
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.920
I think you guys should make the same amount,
but I also don't think that that,

949
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:28.150
that number is accurate.

950
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:33.780
$77 77 cents for every dollar that a man or it's because if you include divorce

951
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:35.380
settlements,
uh,

952
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:39.760
you get to keep your 77 cents plus his 50% his 50 cents.

953
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:43.030
So then he's down to 50 and then you're up to a dollar 37.

954
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:50.860
That's what I'm talking about right there.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You're oversensitive.

955
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:55.780
Jackass.
Good Lord.
Go buy a bigger Brah.

956
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.230
I don't know what your fucking problem is.
I hope that bugged you to that.

957
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:01.840
I said that that was deliberately supposed to be offensive.
All right,

958
00:59:01.841 --> 00:59:06.610
so go fucking write a letter to a fucking cut hair.com cause I don't give a
shit.

959
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.840
All right?
In short,

960
00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:12.400
we are still not equal to our male counterparts and we will forever be labeled

961
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:17.020
the weaker sex.
While with that attitude,
of course you will.
You know,

962
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.560
I don't think you're the weaker sex.
I think that that's all a myth.

963
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.600
I think that that actually makes you stronger.
You know,

964
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.550
because guys are fucking idiots and they think has,

965
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:28.460
they can do more pushups than their woman that they're actually,
you know,

966
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:32.990
that makes them smarter.
You know,
I dunno.
Ah,

967
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:37.460
my fucking door bells ringing and you serious.
Hang on a second.

968
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:40.630
I got to go up here and then I get up.
I get to read the rest of this whole line.

969
00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:45.110
All right,
sound back.
Little winded,
but I'm back.
I'm back.

970
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:49.160
So anyways Blahblahblahblahblah it just keeps going on and on and on and on.

971
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.190
Um,
where the hell is it?

972
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:57.860
Where the hell was I a weaker sex and then she tries to break me down

973
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:02.750
psychologically,
but my mom not hugging me.
If that's the case,

974
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:05.060
then I'm sorry for you.
I hate when people do that.

975
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.190
It's like you're not sorry for me.
You hate me right now.
Okay,

976
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:09.350
so stop acting like you're really sorry for me.

977
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.990
And you're showing some sort of empathy.
You're not showing empathy,

978
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:16.880
you're being really selfish.
Like I said,
I go off on everything here.

979
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:20.870
I've never said that a woman shouldn't make the same amount an hour as a guy.

980
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:23.660
I never should said that a guy should be able to hit a woman.

981
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.680
I've never said that.

982
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:28.370
What the thing I'm trying to shine a light too is that some of these divorce

983
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:32.300
settlements are absolutely fucking ridiculous and,

984
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.450
and that when a woman cheats on a guy and has a,

985
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:39.170
has a kid with another person and then the poor SAP who married or has to pay

986
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:40.640
for that,
you don't think that's fucked up.

987
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.070
Howard stern just did a great story on it.
Uh,

988
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.960
last week somebody sent me an email,

989
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:49.961
he did a story about a guy who was in that situation and he refused to play,

990
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:53.390
pay the child support and they said we're going to send you to jail.

991
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.760
He's going to go to jail.
Cause his wife cheated on him,
had unprotected sex.

992
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:03.560
Hey to hell with aids.
Let's roll the dice with my husband's life.
Right.

993
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.960
Has unprotected sex,
has a kid,

994
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.490
he doesn't realize it figures it's his cause it's his,
his wife's pregnant.

995
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:13.670
Why would he think that it's somebody else's?
He starts making the payments.

996
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.660
Next thing you know,
you know,

997
01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:18.620
he's such raising the kid figures out it's not his kid and has a natural

998
01:01:18.621 --> 01:01:21.500
reaction.
I don't want to pay for that.
And the like,
the law is just like,
no,

999
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.330
you have to pay for it.
Let me ask you this ma'am.

1000
01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:24.500
Do you have any empathy for that?

1001
01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:29.501
You seem to have all this empathy for women and women's issues and like somehow

1002
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.600
I'm supposed to still respect you despite the fact that you could give a fuck if

1003
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:39.170
this injustice is done on the other side.
It doesn't make any sense.

1004
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.553
I want to see like

1005
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.840
this is like focusing on this issue.

1006
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:49.990
This is an issue for some reason that is just not talked about whatsoever.

1007
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.380
It's just sort of accepted and I think it's an absolute,

1008
01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:57.590
I think it's absolutely deplorable.
I think it's deplorable.
So I,

1009
01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:00.650
I have the right to talk about it.
You know what I mean?

1010
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:04.550
And if you want to get offended and you want to be selfish and just be like,

1011
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:05.420
well that isn't fair.

1012
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:09.530
What if I had a whole segment every week and all I did was talk about wife

1013
01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:11.930
beaters.
You know what?
You'd probably send me email.

1014
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:16.430
I just want you to tell you I love your podcast even more.
It is just,
it's,

1015
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:21.140
you are just,
you are a hero to hear a man out there.

1016
01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.390
Just,
just letting these,
these,

1017
01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:26.600
these cowardly pieces of shit know that it's,

1018
01:02:26.601 --> 01:02:28.770
you be fucking over the motorbike.

1019
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1020
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:33.910
<v 2>But now all of a sudden I'm talking about women who were doing shit that you're</v>

1021
01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:34.810
not even doing.

1022
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.420
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1023
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.240
<v 2>At what point in any of these stupid fucking ranch</v>

1024
01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:42.180
<v 0>done,
have I ever said that all women are doing this?
I never have.</v>

1025
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.231
I never said that.

1026
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:47.070
All women cheat on their husbands and an advocate out of wedlock.
I didn't.

1027
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:51.930
All right.
Do I make generalizations?
Apps,
a fucking Luli.
It's a comedy.

1028
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.880
I paint with a broad brush.
I'm fucking around.
Okay.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1029
01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:58.500
Stop being so God damn selfish.
Okay.

1030
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.240
And if you don't want to listen to my podcasts,

1031
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:05.280
don't listen to my podcast anymore.
And uh,
other than that,
you know,

1032
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:08.550
I mean go fuck yourself.
I,
I don't,
I don't,

1033
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.020
I dunno this what she's doing is,
is,
is a,

1034
01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:17.490
is a pet peeve that I have.
Um,

1035
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.140
like that happens to me.
Like,

1036
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:21.360
sometimes when I do shows and at the end of my shows,

1037
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.380
some will come up to me and just be like,
look,
you know,

1038
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:29.580
I have a good sense of humor,
but,
but subject,
whatever.

1039
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.900
Oh my fucking phone.
They'll just be like,
you know what?
That's never funny.

1040
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:39.120
That is never,
oh the lovely Nia.
Everybody,
hang on one second.
Hang on one second.

1041
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:45.120
Hello.
Hey,
I'm taping my podcast right now.

1042
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.700
Is this urgent?
Are you on the side of the road?
We got AAA.

1043
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.423
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1044
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.850
<v 0>No,
no,
I,
I,
the dog was farting and I thought I'd had to shit in the house.</v>

1045
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:00.420
So I took it outside and then it just sniffed around and peed.
Yeah,

1046
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:03.120
it was a pain in the ass.
So I'm going to get back to the podcast.
All right.

1047
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.150
All right.
I'll call you in like a half.
All right.
Um,

1048
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:11.250
anyways.
Oh,

1049
01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:15.400
and then she goes on to say that the terms I use will then cause you know,

1050
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:19.150
people to use.
So you know,
it's,
I fuck around and use these terms.

1051
01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.370
She then thinks that people are going to use them seriously.

1052
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:25.660
You know what I mean?
And I'm sure a few wealth,
but that's not on me.

1053
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:29.500
Somebody who does that,
it's because you're a moron.
And I like,

1054
01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:34.090
it's not my responsibility to fucking babysit anybody once they're an adult.

1055
01:04:34.091 --> 01:04:37.480
If you don't know not to call women these terms.
Okay.

1056
01:04:37.481 --> 01:04:41.140
Although I will tell you this,
if,
uh,

1057
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:46.720
you know,
there is a time to call a woman a cunt,

1058
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.590
<v 2>okay,
ed.</v>

1059
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:51.640
And that's when you find out that your son is not your son and you still have to

1060
01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:55.960
pay for it.
There's a reason that that word does.
It does exist.
All right?

1061
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:58.870
All right,
this sweetheart.
So I hope you come back to the podcast.

1062
01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:02.080
I hope that you actually listen and we'll respond and I don't want to hear

1063
01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:06.100
another fucking word out of you unless you tell me what you think about those

1064
01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:08.020
kinds of fucking women.
He'd do that.
Okay?

1065
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.640
It stopped bringing up slavery and all this other shit and try to drag all this

1066
01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:16.990
other crap into it.
All right?
You stay in your own.
God Damn lame sweetheart.

1067
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:18.503
All right,

1068
01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:20.310
<v 0>good Lord.</v>

1069
01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:26.460
So to compare yourself not being able to vote,
to being enslaved.

1070
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.640
Really,
that's another one that gets to,

1071
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:32.190
that's a whole nother fucking topic.

1072
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.640
Every fucking person out there just tries to fucking jump on that,

1073
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.880
you know,
that's our n word.
Cow.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1074
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.940
Um,
Eddie,

1075
01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.160
I can't believe you just did that.
Why did you flick that big right in my face?

1076
01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:54.870
You burned off to eyebrow hairs.

1077
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.953
<v 5>That's fine.</v>

1078
01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.593
Yeah.

1079
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:40.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
