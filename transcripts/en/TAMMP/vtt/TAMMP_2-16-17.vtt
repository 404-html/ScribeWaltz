00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.870
Hey,

It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.510
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.610
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.
This isn't even a podcast.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.630
This is just me poking my head into your cubicle or your office door.

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.840
You're fucking cardboard box wherever you live in,
wherever you work,

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.530
whatever you're doing.
Are you making American great again?

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.830
We go make it great again.

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.890
Remember what it was great bad's going to happen again.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
Making America great again.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.160
Um,
what's going on?
How are you?
I'm in a good mood.
My,

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.570
my,

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.250
my lovely daughter is entered a new phase of just nonstop crying.

13
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.913
Um,

14
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.230
<v 0>okay.</v>

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.410
<v 1>I think she's going to be a ric flair fan because the only thing I could do to</v>

16
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:04.270
get her to stop was,
you know those exercise balls that uh,

17
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.130
the ladies use them.
You know,

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.010
cause they're always trying to work their glutes and their fucking thighs cause

19
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.230
that's where they put the weight on.
You know,

20
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:12.700
guys are always over there doing sit ups

21
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.880
doing that shit right there.
Would Shit from rocky hanging upside down.
Well,

22
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:22.780
maybe if I hang upside down and fucking do is sit up,
you know,

23
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.930
that will offset the fucking nine slices of pizza I'm going to have tonight.

24
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.590
The pizza winds.
Okay.
You don't need to hang upside down.

25
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:32.080
You don't even need to do fucking,
you don't really even need to do sit ups,

26
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:35.860
which you need to do is you need to get some salads and your life,

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.770
<v 0>okay?</v>

28
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.210
<v 1>You got to start looking at bad food.</v>

29
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:43.130
Like it's some fucking chick that you know is great in the rack.
Right.
But it,

30
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.840
she's just that you can't bring it home to your parents.
She's a fucking lunatic.

31
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:49.260
That's,
that's what bad food is in the food version of great.

32
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.010
And the rack is salt,
sugar high.
That's all it is,
right?

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.230
Just send you shit through the roof.
You like,
you know,

34
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.010
and you just keep grabbing one fucking handful after another as something in the

35
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.590
back of your head.
In the Bacchae head is just screaming.
No.

36
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.150
Like when you're dating a psycho,

37
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.540
why am I going to go out to a farmer's market with this fucking lunatic?

38
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230
Why am I pretending that there's a relationship here?

39
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.160
You have a bag of chicken.

40
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:19.900
She's got a window right behind her bed and halfway through banger or you're

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.110
like,
what am I just opened this and fucking crawled out?

42
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.870
Yeah,
I'm sure women have thought that.
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.850
Blade on that backs getting fucking railed by some sweaty fucking,
I don't know,

44
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.950
Banker Assistant.
And then he's got a skylight.
Go.

45
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:37.330
What if I was like Spiderman right now?

46
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:40.810
I could just some fucking webs and just go right up and out of here.

47
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.920
Leave them all confused.
Half excited on the bed.

48
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.140
<v 1>That's what they need to have with the future.
Everybody,</v>

50
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:51.740
they're trying to have better cameras on your cell.
Phone's better.

51
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.010
Recorders bucket.
I Dunno.
Something else.
Whatever the fuck out.

52
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.940
He always has to be three examples.
So you,
you fill in your last one.

53
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.930
This podcast will be interactive.
What are they?

54
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.540
Come up with something that when you're with somebody,
right,
you could just,

55
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.360
you just hit a fucking eject button.
Look,

56
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.700
every house has like a fucking,

57
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.510
like even if you're on the bottom floor and you just got to stand in the right

58
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.600
place in.
Remember that those old school offices,

59
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.290
what they would like send messages around through that little fucking vacuum

60
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.640
thing.
You know,
you put the thing in the tube,

61
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.660
it just disappear and go into somebody else's office.

62
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.400
Sort of the original fucking emails.
They should have that for people you know

63
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.550
<v 2>and you and tell you,</v>

64
00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:35.740
I didn't like the way you talked to my sister and just remember we had that dead

65
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.290
for satellite Saturday and you just say,
ah,

66
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.780
<v 1>go over to the fucking porthole and you just gone,
hi.</v>

67
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.250
<v 2>Hi.
How are you?
Stop it.
You're scaring me.</v>

68
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.180
<v 1>Hi.
Are you still there?
She walks over and he just fucking gone.</v>

69
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.710
Then it'd be the new thing instead of getting dumped.
You got port hold.

70
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.840
What's wrong with Maggie?
Oh,
she got bored.
Hold.

71
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.980
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.410
<v 1>bright in the middle.
I think she was nagging him.
You know how Maggie is?</v>

73
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:13.270
She's very,
very particular and she,
she,
I know.
I love her too.

74
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:18.180
I love her too,
but she can be hot.
She can be,
she's a lot.
She,

75
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.710
she is.
And then that's when the other girlfriends go.
She gets a lot.

76
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.990
She's definitely a lot,
you know,

77
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.690
from then they fucking clink that little fucking glass,
a rosy,
whatever it is.

78
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:29.680
Women doing the afternoon ladies,
what do you do in the afternoon?

79
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.620
What is that little wind break you take?
You know,

80
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:35.120
like you fucking Ernest Hemingway.

81
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.910
<v 1>You know,
that's why I want to say,
uh,
I got it.</v>

83
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.340
I'm going to say something like that at that writer's thing on Sunday.

84
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.270
Just talking about how much I booze now,
because I fucking sit in a writer's room

85
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.550
anyway,
so going through that keeps my,

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.520
my daughter quiet during this phase that she's going through,

87
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.190
which is fucking awesome.
Even when she's crying her brains out now,
she's like,

88
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.720
she's like looking at Shit,
you know,
she's like taking it in and everything.

89
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.440
It's an amazing thing,
right?
So we got this exercise ball.

90
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:07.260
The thing that the ladies have right now,

91
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.130
maybe someone like Bill Clinton who puts on weight like a bitch,
right?
Um,

92
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.110
number is big milky fucking thighs.
The,
uh,

93
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.730
is during his first semester,

94
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.440
whatever the fuck they call it is first trimester of being president.

95
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:23.430
Remember that Shit when he'd go jogging and those fucking shorts,
shorts,

96
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.300
um,
all I do anyways,
uh,

97
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.470
you sit on that exercise ball okay.
And you bounce up and down.

98
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:34.160
And the only thing that keeps it quiet as if I did,
if I don't want,

99
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.640
I'm bouncing up and down.
If I just keep going,

100
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.270
<v 3>whoo,
whoo.</v>

101
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.580
<v 1>You know?
And as much as it was driving me nuts,</v>

102
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:47.600
as much as I was feeling my old spine compacting every time we went down,

103
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.093
um,

104
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.180
<v 0>okay,</v>

105
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.991
<v 1>I held out this,</v>

106
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:54.980
this glimmer of hope that maybe she's going to be a ric flair fan.
Ric flair fan.

107
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.120
It's not easy to say.
So anyways,
um,
how is your Thursday?

108
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.270
You're almost there to get,
they give you a paycheck yet.

109
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.290
That was always the best.
You get your paycheck,
then he'd go out for lunch.
Right.

110
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.170
Dude,
you want to get a beer too?
Which I'm more but just have one.

111
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.610
We'll just have one.
You know,
that whole fucking thing.

112
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.650
What the fuck is it in order to is quality of life?
I was gonna say,

113
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:19.870
what is it about life that you just can't,

114
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.440
you can 90% of the time you're not doing what you want to be doing.

115
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.470
You know?
If there was no,

116
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.940
I guess if there was no infrastructure or society,
man,

117
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.160
we probably only live for fucking 30 years,

118
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:38.040
but just imagine for 30 years you could do whatever the fuck you want,

119
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.040
but then no one would have done anything and no one had taken the time to make a

120
00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:44.490
beer factory.
So then you wouldn't have a bar and then what would you do?

121
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.840
You just be sitting around trying not to get eaten by animals.

122
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

123
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.300
<v 1>All right,
so a,
there we go.</v>

124
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.600
We just figured out why you have to go to work every week but isn't Thursday

125
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.940
exciting?
I think that's the point I'm trying to make here.

126
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:59.870
Thursday's are exciting because they give you that piece of paper with the

127
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.010
numbers on it and then you write your name on the back of it and then you go

128
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:06.170
down to those fucking crooked banker console.

129
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.680
You give them that piece of paper with the numbers on it and then they give you

130
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:13.490
a piece of paper back that added more numbers to the numbers that were

131
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:17.120
previously on that piece of paper.
And then you walk around buying shit.

132
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.583
Isn't that what you do?

133
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.133
<v 0>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.430
<v 1>I have no fucking idea.</v>

135
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.900
That was another thing I liked about that old guy who smoked 12 cigars a day and

136
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.370
he lived,
he's 109.

137
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:31.510
He's still going like one of the oldest World War II veterans out there.
Um,

138
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.430
what I liked about him was he paid cash for everything,
paid cash for everything,

139
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.540
you know,
just completely,
you know,

140
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.820
I wonder if you just slip through the cracks after awhile.

141
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.050
<v 1>You came into this world and you just paid cash for everything and you never</v>

143
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.270
went on the Internet.
You know,

144
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.410
somebody is still take a fucking selfie with you.
And then that would be it.

145
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:54.921
And everybody,
like,

146
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:59.180
who's this guy who is this mysterious guy that's never been on the Internet and

147
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.940
pays cash for everything?
You know,

148
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.910
all the advertising world would be all obsessed.

149
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.140
We don't know what kind of toothpaste he uses.
We can't have that

150
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.990
starts fucking spying on him with like a drone and shit.
Um,

151
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:16.060
I don't know what's going on here.
I just had a bowl of cereal.

152
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:18.160
Maybe that's what it is.
I thought it was a healthy bowl.

153
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.700
Do you guys like the checks?
Family of cereals?
I'm big on the checks families.

154
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.080
Speaking of which so many cereals have just fucking disappeared.

155
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.070
When my wife was pregnant,
when she was pregnant.
Oh my God.

156
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

157
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.010
<v 1>When she was pregnant,
um,</v>

158
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.890
she was requesting all these fucking cereals,
you know,
from back in the day.

159
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:44.730
For some reason I'm thinking it'd be the ending of Star Trek right now.

160
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.983
<v 0>Wow.</v>

161
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.370
<v 1>She wanted alphabets.
They don't fucking make those anymore.
Some,</v>

162
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:56.010
some how you can go to target,
you know,
that involves,
that

163
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.060
involves like,
you know,
going to a mall.
It's one of those anchor stores,

164
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.930
you know,
which is the goal of anybody with a small business.

165
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.080
Some day I'm going to be an anchor store and a fucking mall,

166
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.900
then then I'll be happy.
Right?

167
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.950
And you got to fucking deal with the parking garage and then you're like

168
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.170
following somebody like a serial killer.

169
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.180
Is it trying to get back to their fucking car?

170
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.780
And then they get in there and they start checked in the text messages and the

171
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:26.130
person behind you starts beeping and it just becomes like,
you know what?

172
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.830
It just becomes one of those things where you just have to be like,

173
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.880
you know what?
Fuck this cereal.
Fuck alphabets.

174
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.860
Fuck booberry count.

175
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.360
Chocula Franken berry sugar corn smacks,
honeycomb.

176
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.210
Fuck all of these cereals.
I Dunno where they are anymore.

177
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.650
You know what they like?
They like old music acts that play casinos.

178
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.210
You know what I mean?
Like lover boy.

179
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.830
<v 0>Okay,</v>

180
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.570
<v 1>there's somewhere right now,
this weekend,</v>

181
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.800
and they're going to sing Abbott as well.
Good for the weekend.

182
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:01.210
Right there somewhere.
Dododododo Ludo do

183
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.370
you want a piece of my heart?

184
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.190
Tell me that lead singer didn't kind of look like Dan Marino back in the day.
Um,

185
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.000
anyways,
that's where like old cereal is like they're there on the casino tour.

186
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.800
Did Not grow my grocery stores.
But as far as serial goes,
food in general,

187
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:23.410
when you're in all the grocery stores,

188
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.750
that's you're at the height of your career,
right?
You're Bruno Mars,

189
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.710
you doing the fucking prince,
staying at the grammys.
Right.

190
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

191
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.640
<v 1>And then somewhere,
you know,
but you're on the year,</v>

192
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:36.430
right at the fucking mid level shelf to headline headlining,

193
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.370
maybe even the top shelf,
but right at fucking eyeball level,

194
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.970
whatever average hiatus,
you're right fucking there.

195
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.050
Sandwiched between the CEC serials of uh,

196
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.310
check family of cereals.
Hey,
then you got the corn flakes on the other side.

197
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:53.440
You're right there.
You're big stupid fucking face.

198
00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:56.980
And whenever sugary horse shit are selling to the public,
right?

199
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.850
And then somewhere along the line it just,
you know,
you run out of hits,

200
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.430
you collaborate with the wrong people,
people's palettes change and then you get,

201
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.940
you get,
you get pushed out.
You know,

202
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.200
you start going to those places where you know you can only get them in certain

203
00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:16.750
cities.
You were only in target like Michelob.

204
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.653
<v 0>MMM.</v>

205
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.400
<v 1>Michelob light.
Michelob light.</v>

206
00:11:21.401 --> 00:11:24.820
The only place I've been able to buy that was in the city of New Orleans.

207
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.410
Once Michelob ultra came along,
it just completely fucked over Michelob light.

208
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.010
I don't know where it went.
So first beer I ever got drunk on.

209
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.900
I love that beer.

210
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

211
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.720
<v 1>I love me.
Some make a low black and um,</v>

212
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.020
<v 0>yeah,</v>

213
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.310
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

214
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:46.280
I was just asking if you guys,
you'd like to check cereals.
You know,

215
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.180
I didn't want to do a whole eighties fucking comedy routine on cereal.
Did I?

216
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.490
You know what?
Fuck it.
Let's keep going.

217
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:57.280
Then he got Wheaties is like the Frank Sinatra,
you know,
like the rat pack.

218
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.120
Like they're never going away.
The timeless fucking classics,
you know,

219
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:03.330
fly me towed.
I'm home.

220
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.323
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

221
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.550
<v 1>he does fucking shit.
That's really not good for you.</v>

222
00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:11.960
Fucking Bruce Jenner did and eat this.
That's not why he won the gold medal.

223
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

224
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.820
<v 1>Um,
in other words,
he's a whore.
Um,
anyway,</v>

225
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.010
she got weedies.
What are the classics?
Grape nuts.
They're hanging in there.

226
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:26.430
They're on the bottom shelf.
Grape nuts,
his bottom shelf.
You know,

227
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.510
they're still there.
They're still playing the fucking,
you know,

228
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.040
the play in the big rooms,
but not the AA rooms.
You know,

229
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.860
what's another one that's hung around for a long fucking time?

230
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:39.480
Breaking up flakes.
So the Billy Carter of the fucking great nut family.

231
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.480
All right.
I'm done with this fucking shit.
Anyways,

237
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.420
It's called inflammatory.

238
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.660
It's debuting today February 16th at 8:00 PM on Seeso TV,

I want to know what you're doing,

244
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:30.810
but that's what the fuck I'm doing.
Um,

245
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.710
oh Joey roses also has a special on comedy central,

246
00:13:34.711 --> 00:13:37.980
but comedy central is weird cause they don't stream.
They're not weird.

247
00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.920
They're old school.
You know what I mean?
You know what?

248
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:44.760
They're not streaming anymore.
So that channel there at target right now

249
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.460
and Netflix,
Netflix elbowed him out.

250
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.300
CSOS elbow that dare the new,
the new,
uh,

251
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.660
though they're like the millennials of fucking TV networks and they just cutting

252
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.360
all these cuts out,
you know,
and these other guys cared.
Yeah.
To buy a cable.

253
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.330
Oh,
you to watch commercials.
Um,
all right.

254
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.950
There's the elephant in the room that I have to address and I know every fucking

255
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:15.450
French cunt from Montreal with your silly socks.
All you're clapping right now,

256
00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:19.410
aren't ya?
Huh.
Alright.

257
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.240
So as I,
you know,
not everybody saw common,

258
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.520
you know,

259
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.360
Clo Julian was going to take the fall for some of the moves that we've made and

260
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.210
uh,
you know,
in a van,

261
00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:37.890
and I was saying the entire fucking time that this guy won us our first cup in

262
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.730
40 years,
you know,
um,

263
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.100
why are we blaming this fucking guy?
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
Please don't fucking fire.

264
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:49.290
And what do they do?
They fire him.
So I tweeted out,

265
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:54.291
congratulations to any NHL out there that's looking for a Greg coach that knows

266
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.700
how to win a cup.
All right.
Now having said that,

267
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:00.020
I had no fucking idea.

268
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.180
I ain't no fucking idea that the Montreal Canadians,

269
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:08.810
we're going to fire their coach was a Terry and they fired him

270
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.880
all right?
And fucking picked him up.
And um,

271
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.180
as much as I hate to say this is a Bruins fan,
we fucking deserve it,

272
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:18.460
<v 0>okay.</v>

273
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.760
<v 1>You know,
I don't know.
You know what happens is everybody does it.
They,</v>

274
00:15:20.761 --> 00:15:24.270
they were doing well with Pat Burns and Pat Barnes got fucking sick of them.

275
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.700
I always thought pat one a copy than 86 and 93 with them.
I guess he didn't,

276
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.860
he existed in the middle like don Mattingly.
Um,

277
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.120
and um,
I dunno,
I have no idea,
but I think I'm going to say right now,

278
00:15:37.121 --> 00:15:42.100
the Canadians are going to win a cup with Cloe.
Julian,
if before you get excited,

279
00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:46.480
you Montreal fans,
if they will want a cup,
if they're dumb ass fans in the media,

280
00:15:46.481 --> 00:15:49.810
don't run them out of town first.
God knows they love doing that.

281
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.860
Fucking dopes have you concept there.
You know what I mean?

282
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:56.560
Why don't you get out there and skate around with your little fucking pocket

283
00:15:56.561 --> 00:16:01.561
square fucking bitch moaning and complaining the most arrogant fans on the face

284
00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:08.050
of the fucking earth without a fucking doubt up Montreal Canadien fans.

285
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.430
New York fans are pretty bad,
but there's just something about them.
They're dumb.

286
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.450
You just hear it.
They fucking breathe through their mouths.
The big sandwiches.

287
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.000
They walk around in sweatpants that get,
you know,

288
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.130
a guy like Paul Versey you considers dressing up or putting on a new pair of

289
00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:27.040
jeans and some Air Jordans and a sweater.

290
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.690
I swear to God,
if Paul put that outfit on,
he'd be like,

291
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:34.870
I'm ready to meet the president.
Okay,
that's your average New Yorker.

292
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.490
But they've written so many songs blowing that city that people think they're a

293
00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:43.660
cut above just cause they,
you know,
their parents had unprotected sex there.

294
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.990
You know all those songs.
Yeah.
Five can make it.

295
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.420
Hi Again,
dad.
Do William William make it anywhere.

296
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.270
Most New Yorkers can't even live outside of New York.

297
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:59.170
They have a fucking panic attack.
The second they get out of the two,
one,
two,

298
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.860
seven,
one eight fucking area code.
They're horrific.

299
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.280
They hold onto it like they move out here to La and they keep wearing this

300
00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:09.640
stupid fucking New York badge.
You know,

301
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.750
like some washed up athletes still wearing his highschool fucking jacket.

302
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:17.020
They just keep,
they come out to La and all they do is shit all over.
It's like,

303
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.340
so go back.
You're dumb cunt.
You know you're going to go back.
You're out of here.

304
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:25.830
Why don't you enjoy it?
Go learn how to surf.
Go have a fucking Burrito.

305
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:29.610
Go on a hike.
I'll write already with the fucking New York Shit.

306
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.150
Oh Damn.
He's welcomed.
Blaze.
We did the full Gullah.
You the full consent.
What?

307
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.140
He ain't been fucking him for the day.
Um,

308
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.310
I don't know.
Look,
I'm fucking,

309
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:44.100
I'm not going to take responsibility for anything that I say in this podcast,

310
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.480
first of all,
because,
uh,
I'm not an adult.
And second of all,

311
00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:52.890
because the lack of sleep I've had,
uh,
recently.
Um,
yeah,

312
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:56.220
so the New York,
France,
there's,
there's still an element of,
of just,
you know,

313
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.370
they're morons still like Boston fence,
Philly fans.

314
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.660
We're all mouth breathing fucking morons now.
The Canadian fans,
okay.

315
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:06.480
The Canadian fans,
because they don't live in the United States,

316
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:07.410
they live in Canada.

317
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.620
They actually have to take the time to learn about other countries.

318
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.770
You know what I mean?
Which makes them appear to be more intelligent.

319
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:14.520
But I'll tell you,

320
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.400
there's some of the most racist fucking people ever met my life.

321
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.460
They lose a playoff series.
They burned down their fucking city.

322
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.010
They ran Patrick wa out of town.
Okay.

323
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:26.580
The fucking Hornets nest that Clode Julian just stepped into.

324
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.780
If they could somehow keep those people at bay and their stupid ass media,

325
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.240
the fucking media,
those Fed Fox,

326
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.240
like they're going to go out there and start skating if they don't run him out

327
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.440
of town.
I'm telling you right now,

328
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.390
if Allah you fucking Montreal counts can give,

329
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.170
just keep your fucking Yap shut.
Okay,

330
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.830
go buy yourself another pair of loafers and some silly fucking socks.

331
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:53.160
If he could just shut your fucking miles and stop acting like,

332
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:57.840
you know how to run a team,
this guy could bring you a cup.
I'd say you got a 50,

333
00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:59.910
50 chance cause they're not gonna be,
they,
they,
you know,

334
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.790
they can't sit on their hands.
They can't,

335
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.690
they speak French.
You don't do something about speaking French.

336
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:10.020
All of a sudden you think you know stuff.
Unless you're in France,

337
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.480
I want to go to France.
Those people are cool.
You go to Montreal.

338
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.780
I don't know what the deal is.
Um,

339
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.600
so much of that was just absolute misinformation and I really enjoyed all of it.

340
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.400
Um,
you know what?
Congratulations to Clode Julian.

341
00:19:24.401 --> 00:19:27.400
I'm really happy we went to another original 16.
I hate the fucking Canadians,

342
00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:30.910
but I'm adult enough to not to not sit there.
I mean,

343
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.850
I hope he went to another fucking cup.
I don't want the Canadians to do it,

344
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.090
but I like him too much to,
to have to fucking root against him.

345
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.870
I will only root against him when,
uh,
it's hard because he's with doe Canadians.

346
00:19:40.871 --> 00:19:43.700
But like,
obviously if the Bruins a plane,
I'm going to root against him,
but,
uh,

347
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.320
he's just a fucking class act,
you know,

348
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:47.860
he said he's going to keep the rivalry going on,

349
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:51.880
but he said something nice about the players and all of that.
And we'll see.

350
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.020
We'll see.
The only thing that can screw this up is the moron,

351
00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.310
Canadian fans and their media.
You know,
if you can run Patrick,

352
00:20:00.311 --> 00:20:05.230
why out of town?
Maybe this ends the curse,
the curse of Patrick Walk,
who knows?

353
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.880
We shall see.
But,
uh,
I just became a,
when he went to Montreal,

354
00:20:09.881 --> 00:20:13.660
I just became a huge penguins and Washington capitol Fan.

355
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.590
I will be rooting hard,
not against cloud.
I just don't want to see the fucking,

356
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.480
I loved it.
They haven't won one in 20,
24 fucking years.

357
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.510
They're going on a quarter of a century for any other franchise.

358
00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:30.820
That's totally acceptable,
but not for them.

359
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.700
They have to win a cup.
That's all they have.

360
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.420
I,
this is what one thing of sympathy,
I will say,
actually,
I,
you know,

361
00:20:40.421 --> 00:20:43.690
I love the city Montreal.
I'm fucking around with you guys.
Beautiful women.

362
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:48.691
And you guys got fucked in 1994 and that would have been so for baseball if the

363
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:52.210
Montreal expos even made it to a world series,
forget about winning.

364
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.930
I'm winning the whole damn thing.
And they had a young Pedro Young Randy Johnson.

365
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:59.620
I mean,
they won't fucking stacked.
And um,

366
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.850
I love National League Baseball.
My whole time growing up,

367
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:06.750
whenever I used to watch this week in baseball,
it was always a faster game.

368
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:09.210
It was hit and run.
They had all the astro turf,

369
00:21:09.211 --> 00:21:13.690
which I thought was cool when I was a kid.
And uh,
you know,
I w you know,

370
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.260
I watched the Red Sox,
we were all American league.

371
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.260
We QC just keeps signing one fucking home run hitter after another,

372
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.700
another lefty.
I'll tell you if this guy plays in Fenway park,

373
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.010
he's going to hit 80 home runs and all they did was just ground into double

374
00:21:29.011 --> 00:21:32.820
place.
Like the pitcher doesn't know why he was brought to town.

375
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.410
They just fucking low and inside higher and inside those kinds always loved

376
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:40.510
those pitches.
Low,
the low ball,

377
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:42.690
they'd fucking whatever the fuck they would don't sync around.

378
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.020
My a big baseball guy,
they'd always would ground out and then they just work.

379
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:49.720
I'm right up the ladder and that fucking high heat on the inside,

380
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:52.660
they could never lay off.
It's cheap.
Three end of the inning.

381
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.890
Red sox leaving another six runners stranded.
It's not possible,

382
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:01.700
but that's what it felt like.
Two runners Bram.
Alright,
right.
Whatever.

383
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.330
I was never good at math.
All right,
let's read some advertising here,
shall we?

384
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.770

Jai Ho

450
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.910
talk about how a Ma made to measure suit fits compared to a generic off the rack

451
00:25:59.911 --> 00:26:03.780
suit.
Well,
isn't that self explanatory?
You know,

452
00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:05.730
unless you're a mannequin measurements,

<v 1>They got like the shredded ones.</v>

457
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.620
They finally don't just have all white mannequins.

458
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:19.950
They blood other races of people.
You know,
that aren't allowed,

459
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.350
that aren't alive to be allowed to fucking model clothes.
Um,

460
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.730
I don't need to talk about what obviously,
hey,

461
00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:29.310
if he just grabbed a random fucking suit,
that sort of fits.

462
00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:31.950
Is that not as good as having one?
That's fucking Taylormade.

00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:44.130
And then you got to stop eating.
We're not stop eating.

467
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:47.570
You've got to keep your calorie intake the exact fucking same way you can get a

We won the fucking cop.

550
00:31:51.711 --> 00:31:54.570
The guy would go to the White House and then took a year off to go find himself.

551
00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:58.140
And then I never heard from him again.
I think you went to the panthers.

552
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.720
Anyways,
let's fucking plow ahead here.
Shall We?
Um,
oh Billy,

553
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.480
no booze.
No cigars is still fucking cruising along.

554
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:11.100

00:32:11.101 --> 00:32:12.830

He was,
I couldn't find the vein.

556
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:16.830
You fucking hacked up my arm big time because that's going to bruise a little

557
00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:19.890
bit.
Uh,
and you know what?
He was right.
But anyways,

558
00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:24.390
I kind of liken not smoking cigars.
I haven't smoked since last year.

559
00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:28.530
I like saying that.
So I'm thinking when you go,

563
00:32:38.751 --> 00:32:41.420
Now are you thinking about is oh my God,

564
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.340
when this go kid goes to sleep,

565
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.730
I'm going to sleep and I am going to have fog in front.
Oh fuck.
Or Norway.

566
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.740
That's all I,
that's all I care about right now.

567
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.810
He's just getting a little bit of sleep.
But uh,
but it's been fucking awesome at,

568
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.990
I'm already watched and change in watching and now when she looks at stuff she

569
00:32:56.991 --> 00:33:01.730
could really like kind of take it in and I was still waiting for the first
smile.

570
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.750
I still think it's,
she just has gas.
If she's going to the bathroom,
um,

571
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.100
he starts smiling and you'd think this smiling at you and you're like,
oh my God,

572
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:11.870
you smelling me.
And then you know,

573
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:14.600
you kind of drifted out of their line of vision to see if there's still looking

574
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:14.870
at you.

575
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.510
And then they just continue looking where your head was and it's just like,
oh,

576
00:33:18.511 --> 00:33:22.050
all right.
I guess you're not.
Um,
so anyways,

577
00:33:22.051 --> 00:33:26.870
so if I'd done my contractually obligation obligated 33 minutes,
30 minutes,

578
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:31.190
whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do on this.
Um,
by the way,
still loving my car.

579
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.050
I'm loving it more than ever.
I had to put my truck in storage.

580
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.490
Uh,
so what I do is on the weekends I just drive my car over to the storage,

581
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:44.780
I switch them out and um,
eventually,
eventually my next,

582
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.110
my next house,
cause the layout of my house.

583
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:51.410
I don't know if this is going to work with one kid or if we decide to have

584
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:51.801
another one.

585
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:55.370
I don't know if it's gonna work out because it's either were upstairs and the

586
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:56.260
kids downstairs,

587
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.100
we're downstairs in the kids upstairs and that just doesn't fucking work out.

588
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.540
So I dunno,
maybe often move.
I have no idea.
But I will tell you this,

589
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:06.620
the next fucking place that I move,
I don't give a fuck about a view.

590
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.720
All I give a shit about is a fucking driveway that,

591
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:12.824
you know,

592
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.810
is act that isn't built for a model t fucking fort that is built from modern day

593
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:22.340
cars.
I would love to have the fucking circle driveway.

594
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.650
You know those people like on Dallas,
a Bob,

595
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:31.220
a mandate of a big fucking ranch,
you know,

596
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.280
they had their own fucking street just driving all the way down there.

597
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.620
And I'm just have anything,
a little carport someplace in my truck that,
that is,

598
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.930
that's all.
I don't give it any,
when I picture my dream house,

599
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.730
I don't even think about the house.
All I think about is the driveway,

600
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.570
the garage,
the garage.
I got a gym and I got a fucking,
uh,

601
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.710
a little drum room,
you know,

602
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.550
and I got a place in my truck and my car,
and when I come out,

603
00:34:58.551 --> 00:35:02.090
I don't have to move like 20 fucking cars to get my fucking car on.

604
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.200
I don't have to move 20 guys have to move my car,
my wife's car.

605
00:35:04.201 --> 00:35:08.750
But I feel like a valet,
you know,
that's all I give a shit about.

606
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.060
I don't give a,
I don't give a fuck about the rest of the house.

607
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.130
The rest of the house is for your wife.
They liked that shit.
This social,
okay,

608
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.030
men need to get away from shit and I can have in in this fucking garage.

609
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.021
All right,

610
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:24.770
if I can just have a little place where I could work out and I got a place where

611
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:28.460
I can play drums and I got my old truck and I got my car.
I mean,

612
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:32.180
what the fuck else do I need?
You know,
right there.
I'm good.

613
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:38.230
Like I actually think my dream house is just a garage with a room above it,

614
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.030
you know?
And the garage has enough room for two cars,

615
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.470
a modern and a classic.
The back is the gym and then the drum room.

616
00:35:47.471 --> 00:35:51.820
And then upstairs is a little fucking kitchen,
flat screen TV,
right.

617
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:58.180
Little fucking humidor and whatever the fuck else Sinead
do,
maybe that's,

618
00:35:58.181 --> 00:36:00.910
you know,
something.
All this whole downsizing in life.

619
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.400
That's a fucking great idea.
Oh Shit.

620
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.240
That fucking divorce guy's house.

621
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.790
That's all it is.
And you just make an entire fucking street,

622
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.690
you know?
So they can still make the child support payments.

623
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.000
They can still pay their alimony and all that.

624
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:23.990
All these fucking women out there whining about,
Hey Leo,

625
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:28.510
that'll make as much money.
Yay,
you're dope.
You get your check and his check.

626
00:36:28.511 --> 00:36:32.600
So many of you do and you're still going to those fucking rallies standing out

627
00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:35.030
in the rain,
listening to Alicia keys.

628
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.930
This the fuck Outta here.

629
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.490
Um,
what Nia,
everything that I've said,

630
00:36:43.491 --> 00:36:47.600
you're going to stare at me for that.
I need it.
Listen to this idea.
Come here.

631
00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.493
Come here

632
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.473
<v 0>Nia.</v>

633
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.390
<v 1>Oh come on.
Don't be like that.
Come here.
I have a great idea.</v>

634
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.120
She goes,
don't be liquid.
It's all like you.
Ooh.
What do we at the bus stop?

635
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.283
Come here.

636
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.610
I'm saying that that insult was on the level of somebody standing at a bus stop.

637
00:37:07.611 --> 00:37:12.110
I'll look at blue QT cakes.
What do you say there?
I love her softer feeder.

638
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.130
You have a daughter now.
So what does that mean?
You know what that means?
Yeah,

639
00:37:16.131 --> 00:37:19.520
it means I have to be extra funny cause now I got two of you ladies I'm paying

640
00:37:19.521 --> 00:37:23.000
for you.
Funny is this,
is this what you consider funny?
We were out of the way.

641
00:37:23.001 --> 00:37:26.960
I want to put it down.
Don't kiss me and try to make it cute.
Oh,
shut up.

642
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.640
Listen to me.
Sit down.

643
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.900
I get an idea that to force the divorce guys house.

644
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.123
<v 0>Okay.</v>

645
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.430
<v 1>All right,</v>

646
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:40.430
so all it is is it's a two car garage and in the back there's a little gym.

647
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.680
If you play drums like me,
there's a little drum room and above it is just this,

648
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.920
just like almost like a loft and that's your kitchen.
You flat screen TV,

649
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.140
your bed,
just you know anything that you need.

650
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:54.630
Because when I think of our dream house,
I don't even think of the house.
That's,

651
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.130
that's all I want.
Is that,

652
00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.600
do you think that would work if I had a whole street of fucking divorce?

653
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:03.630
A divorce guys,
they're all paying alimony.
All playing child support.

654
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.990
All you strong women go into court.
Girl,
a woman I can't afford to do,

655
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.690
what am I going to do in the real world?

656
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:14.400
And they have to give no idea what anyone he goes through and divorce and having

657
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:18.520
to get alimony or any of that kind of,
yes,
I do.
Cause I've divorced men.

658
00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:21.700
I've talked to divorcement or have you talked to any divorce women about it or

659
00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:24.200
are you just hop on one side?
Yes,
I did.
Oh,

660
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:28.750
I talked to a lot of them on Rodeo drive.
A man,

661
00:38:28.751 --> 00:38:31.120
the money I'm in the money,

662
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.980
I get my check and I get his fucking check to Towncars in front of the baby.

663
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.480
Okay.
A man,
the money man,
the money.

664
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:44.990
I get my check and I get his freaking too.
That's better.
Huh?

665
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.720
You liked that?
That was take two.
You guys just got the extra the outtake.

666
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.900
All right.
Um,

Look how cute she is.
All right.

667
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.670
I gotta I gotta close this up yet.
Um,
thank you guys for a,
for listening.

668
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.720
I can't say this word for my daughter.
You know what I say?

congratulations to Clode Julian,

672

675
00:39:24.051 --> 00:39:25.330

676

677
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.520
Don't vote.

678
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.540
Star Gal.

679
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.143
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

680
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.060
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?
It is</v>

681
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.270
<v 7>edit is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

682
00:40:12.271 --> 00:40:16.350
February 16th,

683
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:20.070
2009 in the year of the fucking,
what is it?

684
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.850
What is it the year of
in China?

685
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.030
What animal is it?
Do you have it?

686
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:30.090
That's one of those dumb conversations you have in a bar when they'll have like

687
00:40:30.091 --> 00:40:34.080
a poster of lat on the wall.
Like what year are you born in?

688
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.120
You were born the year of the monkey.
I can see that.
I can see that.

689
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.740
No,
totally.
I can see that.
Shut up.
You're dumb cunt.

690
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.050
Okay.
You don't have anything to say.
It's okay to just not say anything.

691
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.010
You don't have to just start looking at shit on the walls and trying to force a

692
00:40:53.011 --> 00:40:53.844
conversation.

693
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.200
Why don't you just stare straight ahead and think about how you ended up here.

694
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.710
You know how you can change things in the future so you won't have this

695
00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:08.961
screaming sound of fucking regret in your head all the time to the point that

696
00:41:09.421 --> 00:41:13.800
you're going to need to try to drown it out with some stupid fucking shit about

697
00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:18.270
a poster on the wall in this shithole bar.
Oh God.

698
00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:21.930
That felt good.
Um,
it's raining out here right now in California.

699
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:27.220
Rainy days and Mondays always get me out.

700
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.300
I fucking hated that song.
Who Sang that song?
That was the carpenters.

701
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.060
There's a woman to let shit get to her.
Huh?
Oh,
it's raining out.

702
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:42.490
I think I'll go throw up my breakfast.
That's your fucking I was,

703
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.520
that was really,
really fucking mean.
That was really mean.

704
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:49.430
I apologize to the Karen Carpenter's a state for that one.

705
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:54.250
I'm going to make a donation to a,
the bulemia fund.
You know what?

706
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.480
Someone's going to take that joke really seriously and I'm going to get some

707
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:59.120
more fucking hate mail,
which I get on these things quite a bit,

708
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:02.120
sometimes quite a bit sometimes.
Oh you like that?

709
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.330
I said quite a bit and I'm thinking in my head,
no,
I really don't quite a bit.

710
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.930
It's actually sometimes,
so I try to fix the lie,
but anyway,

711
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:12.530
someone's going to fucking,
uh,
not even a lie.
It was just like,

712
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:16.220
I was just exaggerating cause you know,
that's just what you do.

713
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.990
You know what I mean?
Like you just exaggerate.

714
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:21.140
You just get used to exaggerating whatever the fuck it is.
Should do.

715
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.330
You know what I'm doing right now doing the exact thing.

716
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:28.510
I just was given that hypothetical woman who was talking about the poster in the

717
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:31.550
bar.
I was giving her shit about doing it and then I turned around and I did it,

718
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.301
you know?

719
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:36.620
So now someone else has to have a podcast trashing me and that's how it starts.

720
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.870
Did that make sense?
I didn't think so.
Um,
yeah.
So if you guys,

721
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:46.160
if you've never been out here to California,
at least the southern part of it,

722
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.920
people always,
you know,
they talk about the weather out here,

723
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:53.900
how it's like groundhog day,
how,
you know,
every day is the exact same.

724
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:57.680
Oh my good.
Every day it's 70 and beautiful.
You get sick of it.

725
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.600
And I used to be that person,

726
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:03.200
but I kind of am starting to understand the weather out here and it's pretty

727
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:04.280
fucking fascinating.

728
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:08.240
Basically what happens is at the beginning of the year,

729
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.870
usually I guess this time of year around January,
February,

730
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.410
it rains almost every day for a month.

731
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.740
Almost every fucking day it rains.

732
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:24.170
And what it does is obviously it builds up a Jesus.

733
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:25.820
I've really talked myself into a corner here.

734
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.440
I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,

735
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:29.710
but it's not going to stop me from plowing through this.
I was going,
it's,

736
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.960
it builds up the shrubs and green things.

737
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.120
Like I didn't even know what fucking word to use there.

738
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.670
Just basically the Hollywood hills,
you know,
they usually like,
you know,

739
00:43:37.671 --> 00:43:42.260
Brown and that type of shit because we live in a desert.
But,
uh,

740
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:43.460
after a month of this stuff,

741
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:48.461
everything becomes really green and really beautiful and uh,

742
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:49.340
you know,

743
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.820
then it stops raining and then it's 70 degrees out and everything's green and

744
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:54.410
it's fucking gorgeous out here.

745
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.220
But what happens is over the m over the course of the year,

746
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.550
because we live in a desert,
a,

747
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:05.180
all that green shit starts to turn Brown and it starts drying out.

748
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:08.660
And then when the Santa Ana winds come across,

749
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.660
it drives the shit out of it.
And then that's around fall.

750
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:15.800
And that's when we have fires out here.
And the funny thing is,

751
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:20.660
is the fires are completely natural.
People out of here,
for some reason,

752
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.940
they act like they're fucked up.
Like,
oh my God,
the fire just jumped over the,

753
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.950
Oh shit,
what's going to happen?
And we sit there and we try to the fire out,

754
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:33.300
which we shouldn't be doing.

755
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.050
Nature is taking it's fucking course.

756
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.480
It's burning out all that green shit.

757
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:43.650
And what the firemen do is they put the fucking fires out and they leave a bunch

758
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:48.470
of brown shit.
You know,
that should have burned up,
but now isn't.

759
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.230
And the next year the is going to be even worse.
And it's just the typical shit.

760
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:56.700
Like we think it's a tragedy because nature is doing what it naturally does.

761
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.250
And it's not nature's fault.

762
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.280
Some fucking idiot built a house in the middle of Shit that turns brown every

763
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:10.530
year and catches on fire.
You know what I mean?
Would you know,

764
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.160
would you sit in a fireplace?
Would you build a house in a giant fireplace?

765
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:14.994
I wouldn't do that.

766
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.370
So what I'm trying to say is the fucking living in the hills is overrated.

767
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.290
You want to live down here in the flatlands while the apartment buildings I,

768
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.030
well,
one palm tree catches on fire.

769
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.350
I mean the amount of people jogging by with water bottles can put that shit up.

770
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:35.880
But those fucking people who live up in the hills,
the crazy,

771
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.130
not to mention all the fucking,

772
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.640
the soil dries out because there's so little water,
right?

773
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.140
Because we live in a desert,
the soil dries out.

774
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:50.820
So like literally like the top six inches is like fucking bone dry.

775
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:52.500
So then when it rains like this,

776
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.880
that's what causes your mud slack because evidently it can't absorb it.

777
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.940
It's like Dandruff and it just washes down and it goes into the side of the

778
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:05.670
guy's house.
And I watch it on the news and I laugh.

779
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.200
What the fuck?
What the fuck am I talking about?
What do I read?

780
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:11.970
Some stories that got,
you know,
something.
I got to tell you something.

781
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.000
I got some great questions this week.

782
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.450
I got some great stories and some great underrated overrated.

783
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.280
I really feel like my 14 listeners,
which I think is actually up to 22.

784
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.770
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I just like saying 14.

785
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.060
You guys are really up in your game here.
And um,
Oh,

786
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:31.140
before we get into the stories,

787
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.790
everyone who submitted me who made the finals for that DVD competition,

788
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:39.090
could you please resend me your addresses?
Half of you haven't.

789
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.810
Two of you sent me your addresses and I lost the emails because I'm a fucking

790
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.740
moron.
But um,
I don't want to get,
I don't want to get charged with some sort of,

791
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.990
I don't want to be on like the news,
you know,

792
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:52.290
those investigative reporting things that you had a podcast.

793
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.760
It was only doing okay.
So they decided to give away some DVDs,

794
00:46:56.761 --> 00:47:01.190
but the DVDs never came.
Um,
I want to,

795
00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:04.470
I want to send them out.
So for the love of God.
All right,
Bill,

796
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:06.300
why don't you shut the fuck up and read the story?
Okay.

797
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:10.890
Here's a great story for you.
Um,
you know,
I do my whole little rants about the,

798
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:11.610
uh,

799
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.610
the automated checkout lines and a in grocery stores and how they're bullshit.

800
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.130
I don't think it's technological advancement.

801
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:24.900
It's technical or technological advancement will be if I just walked up and

802
00:47:24.901 --> 00:47:29.901
somehow I just stood there and magically this machine knew what the fuck I owed

803
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.390
and then I paid and then I left.
That would be an advancement.

804
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:38.110
But to come up with an automated machine where now I go up,

805
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:40.690
there is no cashier and then I become the cashier.

806
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.180
To me it's not technological advancements.

807
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.490
That's me working at the grocery store for free.

808
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:50.320
So one of my disciples who actually believed in this said,
hey bill,

809
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:52.930
here's something that happened to you yesterday.
You might appreciate.
He said,

810
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:54.910
I was in a stop and shop yesterday.

811
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.620
So I'm guessing that's east coast right though.
That's going to stop and shop,

812
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.250
get a fucking 30 factors throws.
Dude,

813
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.480
I was in stop and shop yesterday and just grabbing a couple of things.

814
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.250
There was one lane open and the four empty self check registers.

815
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.140
So basically one lane's open with the cashier and then there's four of those

816
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:20.500
automated things that are wide open and uh,
so he says reminding,

817
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.250
remembering the point you made in the podcast a few weeks ago about the whole

818
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:25.510
self check concept.

819
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.110
I got back into the open line behind five or six people,

820
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.770
I guess that's the cashier line.

821
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.320
The girl who stays by the self check lanes came over and said she noticed that

822
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:42.100
only had a few things and that I could just use the self checker and be out of

823
00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:45.250
there quicker.
I just said,
no,
that's okay.

824
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:47.560
I'm not going to do your people's job for you.

825
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.250
After she heard that,
she was like,
excuse me.
So I was like,
nothing.

826
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.910
I have no problem waiting.
I'm just not doing your job for you.

827
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:03.580
So she walks away and about a minute or two later a manager comes over to me and

828
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.780
ask if there's a problem,

829
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:09.070
so I keep my composure at this point and tell him there's no problem.

830
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.510
Then I just rather wait online then ring up my own stuff.

831
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.070
He then goes on to tell me that his employee told him that I was being rude and

832
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:22.810
disrespectful and that he was going to ask me to leave the store.
I said to him,

833
00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:24.580
are you serious?
I didn't even raise my voice.

834
00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:28.420
I just told her I'd rather wait in line and that the other people online

835
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.780
standing next to me can vouch for me.
Of course,

836
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.060
when he asks the other people what happened,

837
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:38.380
nobody said a Goddamn word to defend me because I was apparently in align with a

838
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:42.130
group of Helen Keller's typical spineless fucking pussies.
Right.

839
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.950
So this is his final point.
He says,

840
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:48.430
I understand that the girl was just trying to help me out by suggesting that I,

841
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.040
I use that line to get out of the store quicker.

842
00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:53.890
But when I calmly told her that I was fine,

843
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:57.040
she didn't have to make up some bullshit story to spite me.

844
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.930
When the day comes,

845
00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:03.931
when cashiers are phased out and all there is a self check registers and that

846
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:07.930
cunt is out of a job,
I will have a nice chuckle to myself.

847
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:11.620
You know something,
Mike,
I can't get Maddie on that one.

848
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.510
I actually got annoyed

849
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.940
by that girl and if she lost a job,
but you know,
I don't know.

850
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.020
I think you're right on that one.
Although I got to admit,
you know,
you,

851
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:30.410
you know to use the narrows line and a good fellas,
you a,
yeah,

852
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:33.680
he was sheltered a little bit,
a little pig.
He kind of insulted her.

853
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.640
You got to go nicer next time and just say,
listen,
you know what I mean?

854
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.890
I don't want you to lose your job.
Those sure.

855
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.640
Those machines I take in your job and I don't want to be a part of that,

856
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:47.480
so I'd rather stand in line here so you guys can keep making a paycheck if you

857
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:50.000
set it that way.
But you kind of went on a little bit,

858
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.970
little bit and a little hostile and you will like,
yeah,

859
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:57.260
I'm not doing your job for you.
You know,
I mean,
I don't know.
Did you have,

860
00:50:57.261 --> 00:51:00.920
you know,
so go fuck yourself tone.
I have no idea.
But you know something,

861
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.700
I totally back you when you think that,
you know,

862
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.380
I,
I would've been living in that situation.

863
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:13.010
I wouldn't have been able to control myself when that manager came over,

864
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:17.320
I would have been like,
I didn't say anything and I would swim in like,
you know,

865
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.880
these machines are bullshit and that point I would have cursed and they'd be

866
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:23.900
like,
I'm sorry sir,
you need to,
you need to leave the store.
So,
um,

867
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.430
I don't know that make any sense.
It's like,
I agree with you and I scolded you.

868
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.610
I agree with you.
When she doesn't have a job,
I'll be fucking happy too.

869
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.790
And you know,
I don't know.

870
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.620
I don't what the,
well as such.
That's what,
that's a rough one.

871
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.620
That was a rough one.
I'm just fucking out of it today.

872
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.620
I had a real fucking bad time last night at comedy clubs.

873
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.660
I had two different people coming up to me saying shit like,
uh,
you know,

874
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.140
I'm not even going to fucking say.

875
00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.760
It's just one of those things where another comic comes up to you and as they

876
00:51:55.761 --> 00:51:58.490
compliment you on a joke,
you know that they're going to steal it.

877
00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.340
You know they do that shit.
You know?
You know,

878
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.530
I really liked that joke you did about the blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
You know,

879
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:08.240
it's just amazing.
You know when I watched comics,

880
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:10.700
all the different takes people have on things.

881
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.090
Let me guess.
Your take is the same as my take except the switch to words.

882
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:21.590
You fucking Cock sucker.
I'm all right.
Next story.
Hey Bill,

883
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.170
thanks for driving that faggy hybrid.

884
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.470
This is always nice to read on a fucking Monday.
Hey Bill,

885
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:32.471
thanks for driving that faggy hybrid every bit you guys save ensures that that

886
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.420
insurance just that much more for me to use in my muscle car.

887
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.650
Was wondering if you've got something that looks like a car or did you get the

888
00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:46.770
one shape like a butt plug?
All kidding aside.

889
00:52:46.771 --> 00:52:51.380
I digger stand up,
podcasts,
all that shit.
Awesome.
Um,
no hybrid.

890
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:53.780
Looks like a buck plug.
I even asked you,

891
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:55.220
I didn't know what a butt plug looks like.

892
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:59.280
I imagined it looks like something that you stick in the sink and then what a

893
00:52:59.281 --> 00:53:00.320
butt plug looks like.

894
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.280
I like how he's calling me a fag,
but he knows what a butt plug looks like.

895
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.390
You know something?
I'm going to chime in early on.
The underrated overrated.

896
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:13.400
You know what's overrated?
Muscle cars.

897
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.480
Muscle cars are so fucking overrated.
It's ridiculous.

898
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.370
If you've seen those things,
those auctions,

899
00:53:19.371 --> 00:53:24.371
they have these fucking baby boomer Geek fucking rich douche bags are spending

900
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.130
like 150 grand to get a 68 Mustang.

901
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.080
The fuck is wrong with you.

902
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.130
Fucking idiots probably can't even change the oil.

903
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.540
They want to go in there and get the,
you know,

904
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:41.541
the body off restoration playing 150 fucking thousand dollars for a Mustang,

905
00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.530
a Mustang.
You know what I mean?
If fucking idiot,

906
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:51.210
you can literally go buy a piece of Shit Mustang,
you know,

907
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:51.931
not piece of shit,

908
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:54.420
but it's got a decent body and just throw a new fucking engine in it.

909
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:59.010
Why would you spend 150 grand?
Well,
I got to,
it's got the original or a roll,

910
00:53:59.011 --> 00:54:01.770
the window down handles.
You know,

911
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:06.720
in 1968 these were actually shut up.
It's not worth 150 grand.

912
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:11.160
Those cars are so fucking grossly overpriced.
Those are overpriced.

913
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.250
Those vintage guitars don't.
If there's any musicians,

914
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.910
those fucking beat up fucking fenders and Les Pauls from 40 50 years ago that,

915
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:24.510
you know,
he can't play,
can't fucking play.

916
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.990
There's no reason that there's no guitar that's worth 50 fucking thousand

917
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:31.590
dollars and they got the shit kicked out of them.
They're all worn out.

918
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.090
They look like shit.
I don't understand it.
So we bought the point the other day.

919
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:40.110
We'll let Stevie,
Ray Vaughn,
he used to play an old guitar.
He got an a pawn shop.

920
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.070
He probably paid fucking 30 bucks for it and tell you why not.

921
00:54:44.071 --> 00:54:45.120
That thing was 50 grand.

922
00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:49.230
He would've been playing a Ukulele on the Texas flood album.
Um,

923
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.000
but anyways,
I lot of people think that's so manly.
If they have a muscle car,
I,

924
00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.510
I don't fucking understand it.
It's like you can get one for 15 grand.

925
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.390
It's not like I couldn't afford to buy one

926
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.250
that's just fucking idiot and it just automatically makes you gay.

927
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:06.630
I got to miss the little tires,

928
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.170
this a little tires and make it faggy and you know what the guys,
right?

929
00:55:10.171 --> 00:55:13.620
They are faggy they all saggy.
Look,
I don't know if they looked like buck plugs,

930
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.740
you know?
All right.
You know what?

931
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:23.150
At the risk of having the FBI come to my door to find out what I'm doing,

932
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.520
I'm actually going to go on the Internet right now and I'm going to fucking

933
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.490
Google images but plugs,

934
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.990
you know what I picture I picture like I literally picture like a little plug
in.

935
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.690
It has like the threads,
like you'd literally screw it in

936
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:43.620
and then it's got that little metal ring.
He just see this sort of pull it out.

937
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:48.390
All right is,
but with two butt plug,

938
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.430
I'm going to have to fucking burn this fucking iPod after I do this images.

939
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:59.130
All right,
but plug search images for a buck plug.
Here we go.

940
00:55:59.131 --> 00:56:02.070
Jesus Christ.
That looks like a fucking grenade.

941
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:08.490
Custom buck.
There's a Paris Hilton,
but plug and it's,

942
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:12.630
it's shaped like a hand.
Oh my God.

943
00:56:12.631 --> 00:56:15.180
He's a horrific Fox tail buck plug.

944
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:21.780
There's a family circus oof with a buttload.
Wow.

945
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:25.150
These are creepy sex toys.
A creepy.

946
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.830
Okay.
These are gross.
Um,
and to save you guys

947
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.350
well,
I can explain what they look like.
I guess they look like

948
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:44.350
they look like Christmas trees with the stand.

949
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:49.450
That's the only way I can describe it.
It's the same shape.
That's gross.

950
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.680
That's fucking gross seed.

951
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:54.720
See what to see the level you just fucking brought this podcast down to.

952
00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.770
It was really disgusting.
Anyways,
we know something.

953
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.800
The audio of this will save me if the FBI comes.
I'm like,
Pete Townsend.

954
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:07.530
I was just the one research.
Um,
all right,
next one.
Hey Bill,
I saw you on,
uh,

955
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:10.930
on comedy central and December and I've been listening to you ever since.

956
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.440
I know how strongly you feel about people.

957
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:18.070
What the fuck is this using the self checkout,

958
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:22.210
which I agree with and I was wondering how you feel about people paying bills

959
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:25.600
online.
This is a great question.
How do you,
what,

960
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:30.340
what do you feel about people paying bills online?
Um,
I'll tell you what I feel.

961
00:57:30.341 --> 00:57:35.260
I think you're out of your fucking mind.
If you pay your bills online.
Um,

962
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:39.610
I know it's easier and it's more convenient,
but,
uh,

963
00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.660
you know that bullshit where they sit there and they try to say like,

964
00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:47.320
this is a completely secure site.
You don't have to worry.

965
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.580
But this fucking nerds out there breaking into the fucking computer at the

966
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:54.730
Pentagon,
he should never pay your bills online.

967
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.210
He shouldn't buy anything online.
You shouldn't do any of that.

968
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:02.590
You're rolling the dice.
Cause I'm not gonna lie to you.
I do it,
I do it.

969
00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:06.130
But every time it's fucking stupid.
I,
I,
I won't pay my bills online.

970
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:10.150
I certainly won't do that.
Online banking,
you're going to put your fucking,

971
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:14.170
your balance.
If you're fucking,
uh,

972
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:19.330
account number,
all of that shit,
you're going to put that online yet.

973
00:58:19.331 --> 00:58:22.120
You're Roddy,
you're writing your mind,
you're out of your mind.

974
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.870
But this guy is basically saying,
ah,
I'm probably beating a dead horse,

975
00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:29.470
but the less mail that needs to be delivered,
the less carriers they need.

976
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.820
My brother is a mail carrier and it fucking pisses me off that people don't want

977
00:58:33.821 --> 00:58:37.720
to pay 42 cents to mail a letter.
I mean,
come on,
I'm a tight ass myself,

978
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:42.580
but you can't,
you can't buy shit with 42 cents.
What do you think?
Um,

979
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:47.230
I dunno man.
Email,
email people back and forth.
I mean,

980
00:58:47.231 --> 00:58:50.890
there is an element of technology to,
but I will tell you this,

981
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:55.891
like I will forever pay bills by you using uh,

982
00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:00.100
the mail.
I mail a mail man.
I just,
I dunno.
It just seems,
I mean,

983
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:04.210
not saying that people can't fuck with you mail,
but
I dunno.

984
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.000
I think you're out of your fucking mind.
If at the very least,

985
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:09.610
if you do your banking online,
you're out of your fucking mind.

986
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:12.670
Unless you don't have shit anyway,
so you don't have any money.
Who gives a fuck?

987
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:16.300
Right.
That's one of the great things about being broke.
You know,

988
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.150
when you want to punch someone in the face,
you can't,

989
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.650
you don't have to worry about getting sued soup.
I guess.

990
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:23.000
You've got to worry going to jail and he can't afford a good lawyer.

991
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.470
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,
anyways,

992
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.550
let's talk about shit I have coming up.
Um,

993
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.190
I'm going to be at a wise Guy Comedy Club,
uh,

994
00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.720
this weekend in Ogden,
Utah.
And this is my,
uh,

995
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.360
it's the first time I've ever been out.
I did a college,

996
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:44.200
there are a number of years ago,
uh,

997
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.540
but I can't remember the last time I was out when the fuck was I owned in Utah.

998
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:52.340
I don't remember.
But anyways,
it's,
the show was on a February 20th.

999
00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:57.920
And the website is www.wiseguyscomedy.com.

1000
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.770
If you're on my website,
you can click on the link.

1001
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:06.320
It's right to the left hand side of the page and clicked on Ogden.
Uh,

1002
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:09.950
I'm going to be there for one night,
one night,
only two shows.

1003
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.690
And uh,
and that's it.
Wait a second.

1004
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:17.000
What the fuck are they saying here on the website?
Oh,
they got it right.

1005
01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:20.120
They got it right.
So there you go.
So if you saw me in comedy central,

1006
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:24.410
wrote a whole new fucking hour and a,
yeah,
so all you Mormons,

1007
01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:28.910
whatever the hell you guys are out there,
you Byu fans,

1008
01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:32.420
come on out to the show and I'll make you fucking laugh and then I'll go back to

1009
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.840
my hotel room and stare out the window.
Wonder what happened.

1010
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.010
It's actually a scary place to land.
If I remember correctly.

1011
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.850
Salt Lake City is surrounded by mountains,
so they kind of have to fly over them.

1012
01:00:43.851 --> 01:00:47.000
And then at the last second,
do like a military landing,

1013
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:51.260
just dropped like 10,000 feet,
I believe.

1014
01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:55.490
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Let's get into the podcast.
Questions for the week,

1015
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:59.960
for the week.
All Right,
Bill,
question number one.
Uh,
every now and then,

1016
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:05.180
every now and again on shows like access Hollywood entertainment tonight or x or

1017
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.043
extra,

1018
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.740
they let the everyday working class person know how much television and movie

1019
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:16.190
stars make.
Every time I hear the ungodly amounts,

1020
01:01:16.191 --> 01:01:20.090
I'm disgusted as well.
I should be Alrighty.

1021
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.230
Fully understanding the gluttony involving the government and the banks.

1022
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.300
Uh,
what about these repulsive repulsively overpaid stars?

1023
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.310
Um,
I don't,

1024
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:36.311
why are you comparing celebrities to a banks that stole from everybody's 401k?

1025
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.920
You know,
what's the worst to star can do?
Put out a movie hybrid.

1026
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.430
Say It's good and you're out 10 bucks.
You know what I mean?
And they usually,

1027
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:51.290
most of them fall off after three years.
And um,
I dunno,

1028
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.150
I don't think they're grossly overpaid.

1029
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:56.330
I think they are overpaid because the actors underneath them don't make as much

1030
01:01:56.331 --> 01:02:00.410
as they used to.
And the main person,
I guess gets most of the money.
But you know,

1031
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.960
look,
if you fucking make a movie and you have me star in it,

1032
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.140
or you have Tom Cruise star in it,
you know what I mean?
You can't say,

1033
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:13.430
Tom Cruise isn't worth the fucking money.
He put Tom Cruise in it.

1034
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:17.600
It's guaranteed the fucking things going to make $100 million.
Basically.

1035
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:22.210
He's been doing that for 25 years.
I don't think that that guy's overpaid.
So,
uh,

1036
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.230
I don't,
I don't,
I don't agree with that.
I don't think that you could,
you know,

1037
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.940
government stealing money and bank stealing money.
You can say that.
Celebrities,

1038
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.810
uh,
I dunno,
I don't think that's the same thing.

1039
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.700
Not to mention celebrities have no privacy.
What's so fucking ever,
and uh,

1040
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.930
I think they get paid right about what they deserve because when you get to that

1041
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:45.810
level of fame,
you need a huge house with a wall around it.

1042
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.230
You need your own movie theater,
you need your own tennis courts,

1043
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.540
cause you can't fucking go anywhere.
You know,

1044
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:55.110
because eventually you're going to have to pick your nose and it's going to be

1045
01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:58.020
on the cover of a magazine.
So do you need,
you know,

1046
01:02:58.021 --> 01:03:02.910
200 foot shrubs so you can comfortably get the underwear out of your ass and do

1047
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:07.710
what fucking human beings do.
Does that make any sense?

1048
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.800
All right,
Bill,
I watched a lot of standup comedy.

1049
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:15.450
I critique it to death.
I analyze the joke,
delivery,

1050
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:17.280
wording,
timing,
everything does a size.

1051
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:19.860
What could have been done differently to make it funnier when I watched you

1052
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:22.230
perform a,

1053
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:26.130
everything you do and say seems to be spot on and it went perfectly.
Planning.

1054
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:28.030
I was wondering,
when you watch your own specialist,

1055
01:03:28.031 --> 01:03:32.100
do you find parts that you are unhappy with or feel you could've done much

1056
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:35.940
better or differently?
Yeah,
the whole fucking thing.
I won't.
Well,
I,

1057
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:38.070
when I go to edit it,
I watched it one time.

1058
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.660
I want you at one time with one eye closed and uh,

1059
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:46.740
and then I never watch it again.
I'm going to be one of those people,

1060
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.270
like if I ever get my own TV show,
I will never watch one episode of it.

1061
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.003
Yeah.

1062
01:03:56.130 --> 01:04:00.930
It's not a fucking natural thing to see the back of your head or see what the

1063
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:05.070
side of your face looks like or to hear what your voice sounds like.
Oh,

1064
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:06.600
to watch you holding a glass.

1065
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.520
It's not natural to be outside of yourself watching yourself.
It's just fucking,

1066
01:04:11.521 --> 01:04:15.690
you know,
you're having,
it's like this outer body experience.
It's just,

1067
01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:20.570
it's fucking weird.
And uh,
I dunno if you're comfortable doing it.
I don't,

1068
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.870
I think that's,
I dunno,
more power to you,
but I can't fucking do it.

1069
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:30.180
So yeah,
I always think of,
I think about stuff all the time.
Well My,
uh,

1070
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.790
you know,
certain times my Hbo Special Man,
I,
I,

1071
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:36.960
I that that one was a nun.

1072
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.600
One wasn't too hard to watch because that one went great.
Why do I do this?

1073
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:44.010
Wasn't too hard to watch.
But those,
I only watched him one time,
but like a,

1074
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.300
a bunch of shit earlier,
earlier on in my career.
You know what it is,

1075
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.610
it's when it's on TV,
that's when it freaks me out.

1076
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.000
Like if I fill my scent self last night,
you know,

1077
01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:55.440
at the comedy store or whatever,

1078
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.560
I could go home and I could watch it and I wouldn't have a problem watching it

1079
01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.760
and I could actually enjoy it.

1080
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:05.300
But the second I know it's going to be on TV and a as a fucking cell phone.

1081
01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.400
It's my girlfriend's cellphone,
California dream and home gays.
US.

1082
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.090
Why it's your phone

1083
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:20.440
anywhere.
What was I going to say?
Yeah.
So,

1084
01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:23.080
but the second I know it's going to be on TV,
that's when it freaks me out.

1085
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.610
And then I'm like,
oh my God,
you know,

1086
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.570
anywhere from fucking a thousand people to fucking whatever.

1087
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.600
How many people fucking watch comedy central,
however many of that is,

1088
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:38.320
are going to see this shit.
And then everything I do,

1089
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.130
any little screw up that I do becomes,
you know,

1090
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.990
900 feet tall and I freaked the fuck out and probably comes down to the fact

1091
01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:51.370
that I don't like myself.
Ah,
that's sad though.
Why don't you like yourself?

1092
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.480
Um,
I don't know.
Working on it.
All right,
Bill,

1093
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:57.790
what would you attempt to this?

1094
01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:59.920
This person asked me a bunch of new agey questions.

1095
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:04.921
What would you attempt to do if you knew you would not fail a jump off a tall

1096
01:06:05.771 --> 01:06:09.850
building?
You know,
I guess I wouldn't fail by jumping up,

1097
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.510
jumping off a building and living,
you know,

1098
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.760
I just want to feel like that adrenaline,
adrenaline rush fields.

1099
01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:20.110
I cause you're like,
fuck,
because you're going down.
I do something like that.

1100
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.650
Um,
I know that person when it's something a lot deeper than that.

1101
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:24.640
Let me see here.
What would you,

1102
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.590
would you attempt to do if you knew you would not fail?
Uh,

1103
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:34.600
what would I do?
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1104
01:06:34.601 --> 01:06:37.480
I'd probably try to do some Gandy Shit,
you know,

1105
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.640
if I wouldn't get assassinated,
I wish I had that kind of charisma.

1106
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.300
If I could lead a Gandhi revolt against these fucking automated cashier

1107
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:51.490
machines,
you know,
I shoot small,
you know what I mean?

1108
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:56.620
Gandhi,
you know,
what did he get?
He got England to fucking leave India.

1109
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.060
What's Nice?
Does he get,

1110
01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:01.120
he gets shot in the back of the fucking head or at least Ben Kingsley did.

1111
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.630
I never,
I don't know much about the real Gandy.
Actually,
you know,

1112
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:09.390
it's funny when I pictured Gandia picture Ben Kingsley as Gandy,
um,
number two,

1113
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.520
Bill,
you had two identities.
If you had two identities,

1114
01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:16.030
one is yourself and one is an animal.
What kind of animal would you be?

1115
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:20.520
You know something.
I feel like I'm in a really bad date right now.
Uh,

1116
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:21.850
what kind of animal would I be?

1117
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:26.260
Something that can run the fuck away really fast from these questions.
Um,

1118
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.340
if I can be one animal,
I think that'd be a bird.

1119
01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:31.850
Cause I've always thought as a fraud,

1120
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.440
what kind of animal would I be?
Uh,

1121
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:43.570
something poisonous so I can fucking bite you and your ankle.
No,
that's mean,

1122
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:48.970
I don't know.
What's my favorite animal?
I like bears.
So stupid.

1123
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.350
Question number three,
Bill,

1124
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:55.351
what is one of the most valuable lessons you have learned so far to proof?

1125
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.800
Read the questions.
Now what is in the mall?
I'm really trashing this person.

1126
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:03.460
These are good questions.
You know what?
Don't don't,
don't be if you,

1127
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:05.710
if you're the person who wrote this,
you listen to me right now.

1128
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.740
Don't feel bad that you wrote these.
Okay,
this has nothing to do with you.

1129
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.090
This has to do with me.

1130
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:13.840
And all of a sudden you're tapping into an emotional level in me that I'm not

1131
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:16.490
comfortable exposing.
All right.

1132
01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:19.940
This is feeling like I have to relax and open up and it's just really fucking

1133
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:21.740
creeping me out.
All right.

1134
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:24.470
Let me fucking white knock on my way through this last one.
Bill,

1135
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:27.830
what is one of the most valuable lessons you have learned so far?

1136
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.180
Whether you learned it,

1137
01:08:29.181 --> 01:08:33.950
watching someone else go through the situation or you expected it yourself,

1138
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:39.050
experienced that yourself.
Uh,
oh,
uh,

1139
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:41.450
I would say that a life doesn't have to be hard.

1140
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:46.910
That you don't have to be miserable and that you don't have to be surrounded by

1141
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:51.530
a bunch of cons and that a,
if that's how you grew up,

1142
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.770
you know,
without even realizing it,

1143
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:59.480
you go out into the world and you surround yourself with those same kinds of

1144
01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:00.890
people just because you're used to it.

1145
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:05.480
And then maybe one day you get to what I figured out about a year ago,

1146
01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:06.470
it was like,
hey,
you know,

1147
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:10.370
I really don't have to hang out with a bunch of assholes.
You know?

1148
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.340
I think that's why so many marriages don't work out.

1149
01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.420
It's because you just want to get away from your family and then you go out and

1150
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:22.070
you end up marrying the exact same kind of,

1151
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.970
ah,
fuck.
I was just having a conversation last night over a couple of beers.

1152
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.370
You know,
whatever misery you grew up with,
if you're not careful,

1153
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:36.260
you go out and you marry it.
You know,
expecting change.
Don't,
don't,

1154
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.550
uh,
I guess that's what I,
I've,
I've,
uh,
I can't even say I learned it.

1155
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:44.180
I noticed it.
I noticed that.
I was like,
Hey,
look at that shit over there.

1156
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:48.050
All right,
good.
That's,
uh,
if you guys really want to freak me out,

1157
01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:51.840
ask me some new agey questions and that'll be a new section of the podcast we

1158
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:55.970
get to watch me squirm and be fucking uncomfortable roaming up to right now.

1159
01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:59.090
29 minutes.
All right.
I'm gonna try to keep these a little bit shorter here.

1160
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.440
All right.
Hey,
bill,

1161
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:05.300
have you ever gotten revenge on a person on an object or an object,

1162
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:10.400
like a printer,
an office space,
that movie?
Um,
I got to admit,

1163
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:15.320
I'm not a big revenge person.
Uh,
I don't feel comfortable with it.

1164
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.470
I always like that goes to a really dark,

1165
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.330
dark place that's like a,
you holding the hand of the devil when you,

1166
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:25.970
when you do some shit like that.
Like I,
I walk away.

1167
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:31.640
If someone really fucks me over,
I just let them learn.
I walk away.

1168
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.670
Like I've never,
uh,
you know,
you know,

1169
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.680
if I ever dated a girl and she fucked me over something,
I just always,

1170
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.210
I just said,
fuck it.
I walked away.
It's just not worth it.
It's not worth it.

1171
01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:48.380
I'm not doing it.
And I know me is not only,

1172
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:49.910
you know,

1173
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:53.810
have I just gotten fucked over and now I'm going to seek revenge and his odds

1174
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:56.060
are that I'm going to get caught seeking revenge.

1175
01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.290
And that's the worst because that's like one time I had like a,

1176
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.300
I want to have a first time I lived out here in la.

1177
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.240
I came back from being on the road for two weeks and there was,
uh,
there was,
uh,

1178
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.940
uh,

1179
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.940
a note on my door saying that they needed to check my smoke alarms and that they

1180
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:16.380
were,
they needed to check them by this certain date.

1181
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:21.000
And by the time I got off the road,
that date was literally like a week earlier,

1182
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.953
right.

1183
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:27.620
So evidently they had the legal right to go into my apartment because if there

1184
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:30.570
was a,
if my smoke detectors,
you know,
are faulty,
a fire,

1185
01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:34.350
my apartment affects the other units.
That was their reasoning.

1186
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:39.240
So I walked in there and I could just immediately tell that someone had been in

1187
01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:42.420
my apartment.
And,
uh,

1188
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:45.240
there's one of these deals back in the day when I really did the road for a long

1189
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:48.990
time.
Like when I came back,
you know,
from the,
I've been on the road so long,

1190
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:52.140
like all the water and basically evaporated out of my toilet,

1191
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.970
you know what I mean?
There was like half an inch of water,

1192
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:55.170
like that type of shit.
Right?

1193
01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:00.990
And I was sitting there and I sat down,
I was like fucking eat.

1194
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.640
I don't know what it was.
Some sort of a,

1195
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:06.390
so say ESPN and with the fucking proper term is,

1196
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:11.220
but I could just feel it.
I was like,
something's not right.

1197
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.120
And I got up and I,

1198
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.830
and I looked through my apartment and I was mentioned missing a camera.

1199
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.280
I was missing a watch and the person had picked through my CD collections.

1200
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:27.660
Evidently they were a rap fan,
cause that's all they took.
And uh,
you know,

1201
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:31.620
nickel and dime shit.
So I went downstairs to the management and I was like,

1202
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.920
you know,
I come back from being on the road.

1203
01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:37.240
You say you're gonna check my smoke detectors and I walk in them.

1204
01:12:37.241 --> 01:12:39.840
It's in a watch,
MRS CDs,
I missed some cameras.

1205
01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:44.100
The place is still locked from the inside and the guy immediately just snapped

1206
01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:45.790
on me.
So look,
I don't know,

1207
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.800
pretty sure that you come and go here accusing booboo booboo.
And I'm like,

1208
01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:52.350
I didn't accuse anybody.
I didn't accuse anybody.

1209
01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:57.210
I don't appreciate you standing here getting upset with me.
Like on this guy.

1210
01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:59.820
Just he,
he totally tried to grill in his way through the shit.

1211
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:03.720
And at one point he's just like,
whatever.
He's like,
I have the power,

1212
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:04.560
I have the power.

1213
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.370
He literally said that and I wanted to reach across and just rip this guy's

1214
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.213
fucking throat out.

1215
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:14.250
So my girlfriend at the time goes,
you know who the guy is?
I'm like,
yes.

1216
01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:16.470
She goes,
you know where his car is?
Yeah.
She goes,

1217
01:13:16.471 --> 01:13:20.040
you should go down and fuck up his car.
And I really thought about doing it,

1218
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.420
but I was like,
all right,
you just went down to the guy's office.

1219
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:28.800
You just had a really heated argument with that fucking guy.

1220
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.250
There was people there witnessed it.
You know what I mean?

1221
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:35.670
There's cameras in the garage.
If I do it,
I know I'm going to get fucking caught.

1222
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:39.570
So,
uh,
actually I did get revenge.
What am I talking about?

1223
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:43.380
I know what I did instead I stood outside the office

1224
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.870
and,
uh,

1225
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.020
what did I do that's no,
no,
no.
I think it was still part of the argument.

1226
01:13:52.021 --> 01:13:55.830
Someone came walking in and they were getting ready to rent an apartment in the

1227
01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.200
building.
And I told them the story.

1228
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:02.160
I go and I came back off the road and there's stuff missing and I'm talking to

1229
01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:06.030
this guy and this guy is yelling at me.
I'm telling you the elevators to slow.

1230
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.610
And the two people like thanks a lot.
And they walked out.

1231
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.710
And then I looked at the guy and I said,
let me tell you something.

1232
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.490
I'm a comedian.
I don't work days.

1233
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.210
I will sit out here every single day in a lawn chair and I'll tell every person

1234
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:18.700
who comes walking in there.
And I saw the guy get nervous.

1235
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.750
And I knew I was completely full of shit because I had to go on the road again

1236
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:27.520
the next day.
And uh,
so yeah,

1237
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:31.240
I never seek revenge and it still bugs me.
And I tried to lie to myself going,

1238
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:34.180
you know what?
He'll get his,
that guy,
he'll get his.

1239
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.500
And you know what I've realized,
uh,
those guys don't get this.

1240
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:41.440
They continue to rob and steal,
but I don't know,
maybe they're miserable.

1241
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:43.450
Do you guys believe in that shit?

1242
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:46.530
Do you think that they don't rent vengeances mindset?

1243
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.510
If the Lord you believe in that Shit,

1244
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:53.200
I kind of believe in it and then I'll let them.
Sometimes I think,
well,

1245
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:55.300
it didn't just some rich people,
right?
The Bible.

1246
01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.310
So I would feel comfortable being poor.
Yeah,
we fuck you over.

1247
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.840
Don't take vengeance on us.
Don't worry.
This invisible guy,
after we're dead,

1248
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.460
we're dead.
He'll take care of us.

1249
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:09.160
That's the one thing why I don't believe in the Bible.

1250
01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:11.320
Cause everyone who preaches it is living this,
this,

1251
01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:16.280
this lifestyle that they would not get into heaven.
You know,
like,

1252
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.400
look at George Bush.
George Bush is a Jesus Freak.

1253
01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:23.110
The guy's out of his fucking mind.
You know,
he's out of his fucking mind.

1254
01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.340
Would Jesus,
you know,
somehow take us to war.

1255
01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:28.600
I'm not trying to get political here.

1256
01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.460
I'm not saying the guy did the right thing or the wrong thing.

1257
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.600
I don't fucking know.
But I'm just saying,
you know,
if I was truly a Jesus Freak,

1258
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:36.370
I would not advocate going to war.

1259
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.330
And one of the things that scares me about fucking people get into religion is

1260
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:44.410
the more religious they get,
the more violent and unaccepting they get up.

1261
01:15:44.411 --> 01:15:45.244
Other people.

1262
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.160
That is one of the most hackiest things I've ever said because other people have

1263
01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:51.280
made that point.
But it's fucking true.
It's true.

1264
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:53.020
Like I don't give a shit about gay guys,
you know,

1265
01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:55.690
they can fucking blow each other all day long.
What the fuck do I care?

1266
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:59.110
They're not hurting anybody.
You know?
I don't want to see it,

1267
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:01.930
but we have and against that,

1268
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.720
don't blow your boyfriend out in the fucking street,
you know?

1269
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.700
But I think you ought to be able to do it on a Futon,
you know,
behind some walls.

1270
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.430
I don't think you're going to hell.

1271
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:16.890
I mean for me it would be a whole hellacious experience,
but you know,

1272
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:20.950
just continue on.
Bill,
you made your point and now you're going to ruin it.

1273
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.620
All right,
plow ahead.
All right.
Hey Bill.
On TV,

1274
01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:28.621
they sometimes talk about how it costs $11 trillion to have Chris rock come to

1275
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:32.020
your house and do 15 minutes of stand up.

1276
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:36.490
How much will it cost to have bill burr come over to a fan's house and perform

1277
01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:39.910
standup for 50 minutes?
When a great fucking question.

1278
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:45.400
Um,
it would cost you,
I do it for,
I do it for 12 bucks,

1279
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:52.430
but I would have some riders attached to it that would up the performance price.

1280
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.470
Okay.
First off,
um,
there has to be some sort of stage.

1281
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:58.090
Okay.

1282
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:03.040
And it literally could be that brick part that comes out from your fireplace.

1283
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.980
I'll stand on that or maybe an Ottoman,
you know,

1284
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.861
what's an Ottoman?

1285
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:11.420
Is that the thing you put your clothes in or is that the thing you put your feet

1286
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:15.470
on?
I'm talking about the thing you put your feet on one of those things.

1287
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.480
And also I have to be helicoptered in.

1288
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.570
You have to have a backyard as big enough.

1289
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.040
It's big enough for me to land in.
Okay.

1290
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.570
And then I'm going to get off the helicopter and I'm going to be wearing a
scarf.

1291
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:34.130
Silk scarf that you pay for that I will never address during my performance.

1292
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:38.210
No one at the party is allowed to make eye contact with me.

1293
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:42.110
Everyone will sit around the fucking Ottoman or that thing.

1294
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:47.111
You put your feet on Indian style and I will do my jokes and I will not look at

1295
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:50.240
any of you.
I will.
I will fucking be staring at the toaster the entire,

1296
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.450
I want to toaster in the back of the room.
I'll do this to 12 bucks.

1297
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:58.610
You pay me $12.
You helicopter me and you buy the scarf.

1298
01:17:58.611 --> 01:18:00.830
I will stand on a fucking Ottoman and I will do,

1299
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.890
I'll do 25 minutes for 12 bucks.
All right,

1300
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:08.000
you've got the fucking 12 bucks and the money to book the helicopter.

1301
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:08.834
I will do it.

1302
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.100
I'm really talking to myself and do a fucking youtube moment and

1303
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.510
that's it.
And no one can make eye contact with me.

1304
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.480
Just like Popa,
Greenwich,
Greenwich Village.

1305
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:26.150
And you don't say good night to nobody that when she got his stare at the

1306
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:31.130
fucking floor,
when she walks out child,
um,

1307
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:34.100
you know something that's,
that's the tandem.
I'm waiting to get back together.

1308
01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:37.070
Everybody talks about Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon back in the day.

1309
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:39.980
What about Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts?
Can they get together again?

1310
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.450
Mickey Rourke is back.

1311
01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:44.980
I think it's time for those guys to do another fucking movie before that too.

1312
01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:48.200
God Damn old.
So there you go.
There's your,
there's your answer.

1313
01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:52.070
12 bucks a helicopter ride.
No eye contact,

1314
01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:55.790
a scarf and a fucking Ottoman.
And you've got yourself a comedian,

1315
01:18:55.850 --> 01:19:00.380
but not for 50 minutes.
All right,
give me 24 bucks.

1316
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:05.180
I'll do the 15 minutes.
All right,
here we go.

1317
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:11.090
Um,
overrated.
Underrated.
Okay.
Uh,

1318
01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:13.820
underrated.
Um,
how awesome.

1319
01:19:13.821 --> 01:19:17.690
Whoever the first guy was to coin the phrase mustache ride.

1320
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:20.840
I have to admit,
I've never heard of this,
this phrase,

1321
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:25.280
how much confidence and creepiness does one half to ooze in order to say

1322
01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:28.730
something like that to an actual living,
breathing woman?

1323
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.900
Probably happen sometime during this,

1324
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:34.940
the 70s when everyone was sporting a mustache and a leisure suit.

1325
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.790
Oh,
is that what you did back in the day?
It's,
we,

1326
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.030
and I do like to think of mustache ride.
I don't know.

1327
01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:47.630
I've never heard of that one.
Um,
oh,
here's a good one.
Uh,
underrated.

1328
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:52.100
What red wine will do to your erection.
True Story.
A while back.

1329
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:54.950
I had a girl over for dinner at my place.

1330
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.640
I drank about three glasses of wine I was expecting to make out with her.

1331
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.740
It was kind of a first date,
so I wasn't expecting the opportunity to get laid.

1332
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:06.980
So evidently this guy kept drinking.
So while the opportunity arose to get,

1333
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.310
and I didn't,

1334
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.080
I was sitting on the edge of my bed pulling my dick like I was trying to get an

1335
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:16.140
old lawnmower to start and nothing,
you know,

1336
01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:19.770
embarrassing this to be jerking off in front of a girl while apologize.
I think

1337
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:26.790
I've been there.
Um,
I can never look that girl in the eye again.

1338
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.740
I've heard the term whiskey Dick,
but never heard a mention of red wine.

1339
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.090
How come?
No one ever told me that that could happen.
Um,

1340
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.010
I think whiskey Dick just sort of was supposed to be all encompassing of alcohol

1341
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:44.190
in general.
I think whiskey Dick,
I guess has a decent ring to it.

1342
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:47.970
Beer Dick doesn't sound good wine.
Dick

1343
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.410
actually whiskey Dick doesn't sound good either.
I never liked that either.

1344
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.881
I don't like that.

1345
01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:58.881
Expression can be some sort of alliteration going on there for beer cock.

1346
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:05.520
That's not good wine.
Willie,
Willie,
Willie.
Why?
No,
I don't know what it is.

1347
01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:08.220
And with no whiskey,
Dick Means all alcohol,

1348
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:12.540
but no one ever explained that because you,
you took it literally like,
oh,

1349
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:15.180
don't drink whiskey.
I won't be able to get an erection.

1350
01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:18.390
But evidently I can drink fucking red wine all night.

1351
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:22.290
Like some fucking divorced 48 year old woman with two kids.

1352
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:24.960
What's wrong with you as a man that you sit in that drinking red wine,

1353
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.530
but that her idea
were you wearing a scarf?

1354
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:33.510
I bet you where you should have been helicoptered in.

1355
01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:37.530
You have bottle of red wine.
All right,
overrated.

1356
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.550
How excited people get over getting their tax refund.

1357
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:44.460
You know something that's one of the best overrated sever.

1358
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.450
That's a fucking great one.
Uh,
someone's like,

1359
01:21:48.451 --> 01:21:50.580
I'm getting 3000 back from the government,

1360
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:53.610
3000 bad from the 16,000 they,

1361
01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:56.070
they took from me throughout the year.

1362
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.760
And the kicker is that while I was sitting in my accountant's office,

1363
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:03.570
I don't really use government.
I realized I don't really use government services.

1364
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.150
I don't have any kids in school.
I live in New York City,

1365
01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:07.770
so I don't drive on state roads.

1366
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.880
I'm 27 and I've never needed a cop throughout my whole life.

1367
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.120
I never called the fire department.
I'd never been on welfare.

1368
01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:18.720
The only thing the government has done for me in the past year is pick up my

1369
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:21.840
garbage and make sure I get more HD channels.

1370
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:25.620
I realized I have to pay taxes and ultimately I don't mind doing it,

1371
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:27.030
but in the hindsight,

1372
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:31.770
13,000 is way too much to pay to have someone take away your garbage.

1373
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.750
That's more than a thousand bucks a month.

1374
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:38.460
I could drive a top of the line Lexus for that type of money.
Yeah,

1375
01:22:38.461 --> 01:22:42.240
and put your garbage in the trunk and take it over to the dump.
Exactly.
Well,

1376
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:45.030
you know what the funny thing is about people getting their tax refund back.

1377
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.530
They're all excited and they don't,

1378
01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:50.670
they never stopped to think that you gave the government an interest free loan.

1379
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.990
Like you could've had that three grand plus the money that you owed the

1380
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:57.960
government sitting in your bank account or whatever,

1381
01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:00.150
earning interest,

1382
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.120
and then the end of the year you could just give him the money that you owed
him.

1383
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.460
He should wait.
What does that you zero.
Is that what it is?

1384
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.420
That's what you should do.
And then you,

1385
01:23:08.421 --> 01:23:13.421
you get some sort of psycho accountant to widdle the fucking charges down and

1386
01:23:15.011 --> 01:23:18.520
then you pay him.
That's how you do it.
You know what it is?
Most people,

1387
01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:21.790
they don't want to deal,
you know,
and they just kind of look at that dude,

1388
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:25.390
it's money in the bank.
No it isn't.
It isn't money in the bank.
It's money lost.

1389
01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.230
That's what it is.

1390
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:28.390
And then what did they do when they get their fucking money back?

1391
01:23:28.391 --> 01:23:29.224
What do they do?

1392
01:23:29.290 --> 01:23:32.860
They go out and they take it and they go out and buy a shiny liability.

1393
01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:37.450
I went out and I bought a fucking flat screen dead.
That's what I did.

1394
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.770
And that's great.
It's great.
He realized the second you hung it on your wall,

1395
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:46.030
it's worth 600 bucks.
Now you dumb fuck um,

1396
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.120
underrated mom and pop hardware stores emailing classic Bruce Lee Kung Fu movies

1397
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.070
and good girls.
All good girls are so underrated,

1398
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:02.770
so underrated.
Why do we always pick the horse fellows?
Huh?

1399
01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.970
Why?
You know why?
Because your Dick,
you're a dick.

1400
01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:12.070
It's gift fucking Dick.
I can't even explain it.
I don't even need to explain it.

1401
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.110
It just goes back to that dump discovery channel thing.
The same way the lions,

1402
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:20.590
the lionesses is sitting there and when they look at the herd,

1403
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.960
do they go after the best gazelle?

1404
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:26.260
Now if they go after the weakest one cause it's the easiest kill.

1405
01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.880
That's what it is.
It's fucking one.
It is.
All right.

1406
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.630
A overrated giant corporate stores.

1407
01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:38.890
I phones Jackie Chan movies and Valentine's Day.

1408
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:42.070
Really?
One day out of the year where the price of roses,

1409
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:46.210
teddy bears and chocolates skyrockets because some naked baby wants to fly

1410
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.130
around shooting arrows and people's asses.

1411
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:52.720
Just surprise your girl on a random day with that shit.

1412
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.130
She won't expect it and will appreciate it a hundred times more than if you did

1413
01:24:57.131 --> 01:25:00.880
it on Valentine's Day.
Could not agree with you more.
I got to say something.

1414
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:05.290
You guys are really up in your fucking game here.
You know,
great questions,

1415
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:09.820
great underrated,
overrated,
great stories.
I mean,

1416
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:11.200
I didn't have to do shit this week.

1417
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:15.880
I just sat here and fucking read it like a fucking local newscaster,

1418
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.170
which is kind of good because I think I was kind of off my game today,

1419
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.030
sitting here and my freezing fucking cold apartment.
I've got this awful heater.

1420
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.510
You know what I mean?
It's the only place where I live in.

1421
01:25:28.511 --> 01:25:30.940
It's a really cool building,
but it's old as fuck.

1422
01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:34.420
It's like one of those old time Hollywood,
you know,

1423
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:38.170
back when it said Hollywood land,
that's when this thing was built.

1424
01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:42.140
It was made in the,
uh,
late 1930.
[inaudible].

1425
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.400
I like living in an old places like that,
but you know,
sucks the heat.

1426
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:49.450
Him and I always like think about the conversations,
you know what I mean?

1427
01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:52.780
Oh,
like shit that happened.
Like,
you know,

1428
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:54.790
I bet Charlie chaplain came over here and bang,

1429
01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:56.740
some want to be starlet in my shower.

1430
01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.660
Is Little Hitler mustache getting all fucking wet.
You know,

1431
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:09.030
I was just picturing Charlie Chaplin still wearing that fucking that hat and

1432
01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:11.600
making that I'm fucking you real good face.

1433
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.100
You know when you bite your lower lip,

1434
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:21.860
uh,
use probably all nervous too because what happened to fatty Arbuckle but he

1435
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:25.340
still had to do it.
You know,
cause he didn't pick a good girl.
He doesn't,

1436
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:28.910
he went over here and fucked the whore.
You know,

1437
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.250
that's what I always want.
You ever wonder about,

1438
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:33.650
do you ever get an old apartment?
You just wonder what the fuck happened.

1439
01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.100
You know,
like this,
this place was around

1440
01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:43.970
right before World War II.
All the conversations that are taking place,

1441
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:44.833
all that stuff,

1442
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:48.710
the amount of people from different generations bitching about how this heater

1443
01:26:48.711 --> 01:26:53.390
doesn't work.
I don't know.
The red scare,

1444
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.580
Kennedy getting whacked
the White Flight and Detroit.

1445
01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:00.110
I don't know why I just brought that up.
You know why?

1446
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:03.740
Cause the guy fucking shaves my heads from Detroit and he lived through all that

1447
01:27:03.741 --> 01:27:06.020
shit to try and it's such a sad fucking city.

1448
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.480
This guy was telling me how back in the day,

1449
01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:12.140
some of the richest people in the world lived in Detroit back when the big three

1450
01:27:12.141 --> 01:27:15.140
was the big three.
And the Ford family,
they all lived there.

1451
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:18.320
And because they had all this cash,
all these great department stores,

1452
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:23.120
all these museums in Detroit,
look at it years later,

1453
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:26.510
eight mile m and m kid rock,

1454
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.810
these angry fucking white kids cause they grew up in a fucking BFI been

1455
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.810
once a [inaudible] been bill.

1456
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.700
Well that's the name of the fucking waste management in Massachusetts.
Uh,

1457
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.660
garbage dumpster dumpster.
Right.
All right.

1458
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:49.190
I guess that's it.
That's,
you know,
I had rainy Monday energy on this one,

1459
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:51.580
but um,

1460
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.500
You can't have a bitch about these fucking thanks cause they're free.
All right.

1461
01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:59.150

You know,

1462
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:01.430
I've actually had,
you know,
people criticize my podcasts.

1463
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.570
Dylan wasn't as good as last week's.
Rarely do you feel cheated on a money.

1464
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:09.830
You fucking cunt.
You know at Howard it is the Babel by yourself.

1494
01:30:02.641 --> 01:30:07.530

People don't have any food,

1495
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:11.100
you know,
and it's not starving people either.
It's just,

01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:14.100
like you have a been driving around tiny like,
ah,

1497
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.140

People who actually knew,
like have eaten that day,

1498
01:30:19.141 --> 01:30:22.050
but they haven't eaten in six hours.
So they feel like they're starving.
