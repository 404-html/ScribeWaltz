1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.840
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.830
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

3
00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:10.690
July 1st,
2013 oh my God.
Is it July already?

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.150
I feel like this summer's going by and I haven't even put on a strapless yet.

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.060
Oh,
have another fucking Kevin.

6
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.310
Another vodka and fucking something stupid drank.
All right.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.110
Now why are all the wires tangled up to Christ?

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.520
And this is no way to start a podcast.

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.290
What's going on?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Isn't this amazing?

10
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:39.820
Just how fucking tangled up some shit can get.
You know,

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.270
how does snakes do it?
It's going around.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.430
They're basically like a fucking Mike.
Why aren't they that could kill you,

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
some of them.
Sorry on and do this.
Fuck.

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760
Is this any way to start a podcast?
Is it putting a wind screen back on it?

15
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.650
I have.
I use a wind screen inside.
All right,
so if you're new to my podcast,

16
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:05.890
that's the level of intelligence that you're going to be dealing with.

17
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.450
Do you think as a snake,
right?
If you're not poisonous,

18
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.120
that's gotta be like suck in it's sports,
you know,
for a human being.

19
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.280
And you go into gym class,

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.550
what exactly do you do if you're a non poisonous snake?

21
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:25.260
You mean you can't fucking grab anybody cause you ain't got no.

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.860
What do you do?
What does,
how does a gardener garter snake.

23
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.580
There's a gardener.
Oh Jesus.

24
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.170
How the fuck does a non poisonous snake eat?

25
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.810
<v 1>It just has to eat shit alive.
Just,
you know,</v>

27
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.580
shit that isn't tougher than it and it's just got to lash out at it

28
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.820
is the fucking thing squirming around.
God.
What a life.
You know,

29
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:55.271
and I tell you,

30
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.980
you got to commend the Gartner or Gardner or Garner,

31
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.960
James Garner,
snake.
You really have to commend them for the,
um,

32
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.380
for their attitudes.
Like you meet them.
They're not,

33
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.630
they're not really bad people.
You know what I think I'm going to do?

34
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.720
I think I'm going to write a thank you letter.

35
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.200
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.050
<v 1>And I'm going to put it in the fucking Gartner snake,
garter snake,</v>

37
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.190
whatever the fuck it is,
newspaper.
And just thank them.

38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.073
You know,

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
just try and shine a little light on the snake and then I'm going to sign it

40
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:31.280
myself.
Dude,
what's the,

41
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.610
I really have to fucking address this right out of the gate.

42
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.730
I used to like the Blackhawks organization.

43
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.700
I sat there through six fucking games watching that phenomenal team basically

44
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.020
kicked the Bruins ass.
I mean we,
I mean they beat us is six games,

45
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.300
nine know that weren't blowout games but still,
you know,

46
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.710
they just were better than us.

47
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
And here I am coming to the acceptance that we were two games short,

48
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.820
that we were two games to one up,
you know,

49
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.090
three games in.
All we got to do is split the next two.

50
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.880
And we went in and we fucking,
we didn't,
we never win another game.

51
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.120
Lost three games in a row.
That's fucking tough.

52
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.430
And then that ends NBA is over and now I have to somehow come out of the high

53
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.431
paced level of Nhl Hockey and excitement of the NBA finals too.

54
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.740
Like the dog days of summer baseball.
Hi,

55
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.860
an inside ball to daddy day for a ball game.

56
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.880
If you're a dao cub,
dow this Saturday,

57
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.030
this Saturday is a hat with a propeller on it day verse 40 douchebags that show

58
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.680
up.
Get one of these,
I don't know why you'd want,
but they're afraid.
So you know,

59
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:48.400
people are going to come anytime it's free.

60
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.890
Oh,
the fatty show up.
Um,
so I'm sitting here trying,

61
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.510
you know,
to all right.
But it's a great thing.
You know,
we're competitive,

62
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:02.990
we've got a great team,
we've got a great base,
so we can build on who knows,

63
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:07.640
maybe next year,
right?
So I'm starting the healing process of it.

64
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.470
And what are these do?
The Chicago Blackhawks,

65
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.480
they take out a full page ad in like the fucking Boston Globe.

66
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.530
And this is the best part.
Rather than just saying,
oh,
by the way,

67
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:26.430
in case you forgot,
we kicked your ass in the Stanley Cup finals,

68
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.850
these fucking cunts have the nerve to write a thank you letter to the Boston

69
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.500
Bruins organization.
And to all there,
this is the greatest thing ever.

70
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.000
Classy fans.

71
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.840
It was one of the biggest douchebag,

72
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.590
deuce chill inducing events in sports.

73
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:57.090
I since,
I dunno when,
since maybe Lebron James,
the decision,

74
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.910
can you fucking believe that?
First of all,
first of all,

75
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
let's just act like this was sincere and this was not grand standing by the

76
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.610
Chicago Blackhawks organization to just shine a light on them.

77
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.310
So everyone got to be like those guys.

78
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:17.100
Classy isn't that swell?

79
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.030
Because that's basically all that letter achieved.

80
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.320
<v 2>Okay?</v>

81
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.410
<v 1>Okay.
I don't wanna speak for the entire Bruins fan base,</v>

82
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:30.411
but we don't need a fucking pat on the head telling us we're classy.

83
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.850
But you fucking brought Eaton conch out there with your Freddie Mercury

84
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:39.600
mustaches.
The fuck do you think we need that for?

85
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.370
We played a seven game series.
It only went sick.
You were the better team.

86
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.950
Our team shook hands with your team.

87
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.270
What's it classy?
Faint.

88
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.750
Do you fucking believe the balls

89
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.040
on those fucking black cock cons?
Can you believe?
First

90
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.530
<v 3>of all,
I want you to find an article out there,</v>

91
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.770
cause I know all the Blackhawk fans will like,
it was a play.
She moved gay.

92
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.000
Gay was Shane.
Thanks to the Brood Day.
Didn't have to do that.

93
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.590
Let me ask you fat open heart surgery cuts out there.

94
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.583
Huh?

95
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.680
Every nine out of 10 people out in Chicago have that Zipper scar right up the

96
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.940
middle of their fat fucking torsos.
All right,

97
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.950
and I was nice to them.
The whole fucking playoffs.
Playoffs,
right?

98
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.421
Dude,

99
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:34.421
I want you to find one fucking article out there about the Blackhawks thanking

100
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:42.071
the Bruins that actually has the writer then talking about like,

101
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.560
wow,
what a great organization the Bruins are,
man,

102
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.840
they're fans are so classy.

103
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.700
The Blackhawks actually had to address it a week after the series was over.

104
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.190
What is it about the Bruins organization that makes them so classy?
Marv?

105
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.610
All I got to tell you,
ever since the days of heady shore,

106
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.730
I want you to find one of those articles because I'll tell you there's not one.

107
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.180
All that letter of apology did was facilitate more fucking praise for the

108
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.420
Blackhawks.
Like,
well you can,
you pull leaves.
These guys,

109
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 4>they wouldn't have</v>

110
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.950
<v 3>the Stanley Cup.
They just take,
they have the tussle.</v>

111
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.080
A lot of flack,

112
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.870
that fucking horse shit just heaping more fucking praise on him.
It was actually,

113
00:07:30.871 --> 00:07:34.720
it was a brilliant move by them.
You know what I mean?

114
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.620
You know what it looked like?
Like debt.

115
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.500
They'll look like they were drunk texting,

116
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.710
like Dave won the Stanley Cup and then they would have had so much booze.

117
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.950
They get to that point right before you pass out.

118
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:50.040
We just thinking of all the great people in your life and you want to start

119
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:52.890
crying.
So you start calling people up,

120
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.490
call your buddy up who doesn't have a drinking problem like two in the morning

121
00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:59.430
and he's freaking out.
That is fucking something happened to his mom.

122
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.040
And how did she fall down again?
Picks up till now.

123
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.330
<v 4>Really mark,
I didn't want to tell you.
You know,
look,
I'm drunk.</v>

124
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.500
I don't jog based way.
Thank you.
You know what?

125
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.000
It's going to be my friend,
man.
That's what the fuck they did

126
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:19.910
<v 3>to it.</v>

127
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.910
That letter of apology is a fucking embarrassment to hockey.

128
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.830
And if this starts a trend

129
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.200
where every year I swear to God,

130
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:33.680
next year somebody's going to win and they're gonna be a,
well no.

131
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.460
Now we have to write a letter of thanks.

132
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.750
Can you fuck if they wrote a letter of thanks telling how classy broods fencer,

133
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.270
can you just take that in for a second?

134
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.300
I'm actually going to wait five minutes of silence to have to wait from Montreal

135
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.830
Canadien fans to stop fucking rolling on the ground laughing.

136
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.120
Okay,
you're back.
You're blue block.
Eight doses up there,
right.

137
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.220
I've been watching the Bruins since the early eighties I'm going on 30 years of

138
00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:10.054
being a fan.

139
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.870
Never has anyone ever even remotely suggested that Bruins fans are classy.

140
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.370
We're a bunch of fucking animals now.
I left.

141
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.020
I left Massachusetts in 1995 okay.

142
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.900
So there was a disconnect to me with that city.

143
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:33.901
But do you remember last year when the Bruins got knocked out of the playoffs?

144
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.190
Playoffs.
We lost in overtime and that Dude Ward,

145
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.480
forget his first name,

146
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.280
scored for the Washington capitals and unfortunately

147
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.890
the dude was African American,

148
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.880
any beat the Bruins and literally like an eighth of our fan base went on Twitter

149
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.720
and started dropping the n word like it was 1938,

150
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.630
you know,
I don't know why I picked 1938,
you know what I mean?

151
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.380
It's somehow within a fucking year,

152
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.670
we are so God damn classy that the Chicago Blackhawks have to take time off from

153
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:21.040
drinking out of that cup.
That you know,
she fucking,
Ciara took a shit in it,

154
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.230
right?
I hope he did.
Um,

155
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.820
they had to take time out to see how classy we are now.
Either did Chicago,

156
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:33.880
Black Hawks are the biggest bunch of fucking morons ever,

157
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.960
which there's no way they are because they want it three years ago.

158
00:10:37.961 --> 00:10:41.740
Completely dismantled their team and what we're able to build it back up again,

159
00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:46.360
like the fucking mom,
right.

160
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.320
Or the Chicago Black Hawks and the city of Chicago is so fucking racist that

161
00:10:55.301 --> 00:11:00.301
even that absolute public relations debacle of last fucking year,

162
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:04.840
that absolute embarrassment that made me feel shameful that I was from that

163
00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:05.710
fucking city.

164
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

165
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.010
<v 3>It's so pale.</v>

166
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:14.011
So in comparison to the unbelievable fucking level of racism in Chicago that day

167
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:20.550
didn't even notice it.
You know,
I bet this is how race is.

168
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:21.384
Chicago is,

169
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.630
I bet last year when they saw some Bruins fans reaction towards scoring that

170
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.730
goal that they,
they're so fucking racist that they,

171
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.440
that actually warmed their heart a little bit and they probably already penned

172
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:37.500
the first draft of that thank you fucking letter.

173
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.280
I don't know if you've ever been to Chicago,
but it is brutally fucking racist,

174
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.780
you know,
as his boss the,

175
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:45.750
but we somehow we get all the fucking attention about it.

176
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:50.370
Like the racism is in the south and it's in Boston,
you know,

177
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.880
like they don't go to Pittsburgh where the other side of the tracks is literally

178
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.920
the other side of railroad tracks.

179
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.870
Literally walk across railroad tracks and instantly you're the only white person

180
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.990
on that side of the tracks.
Um,
anyways,

181
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.810
that was,
you know,
I still like the Black Hawks,

182
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:15.340
but if you think I fell for that on any fucking level,
that letter of apology.

183
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.940
Do you remember earlier this year where Jeroma Gillnet had the choice of maybe

184
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:25.300
going to the Boston Bruins?
Oh maybe go into the Pittsburgh Penguins,

185
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.030
you know,
and it was a close decision and he decided to go to Pittsburgh.

186
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.180
Wouldn't you think that maybe that horrific reaction that Bruins,

187
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:40.990
some,
some Bruins fans to be fair had after losing last year?

188
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.590
Maybe tip the scale cause you got two great teams,
you know,

189
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.610
I know a lot of people,
well I guess Pittsburgh's fucking racist too,

190
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:52.480
but they never,
they never get,
they never get it.
They don't get any press on it.

191
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.110
You know,
all they talk about there is a hardworking steel town at,

192
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.810
there's no steel mills anymore.

193
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:04.811
And anybody who had balls and made steel and built the bridges is at least in

194
00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:06.170
their eighties at this point.

195
00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:10.460
So it's a bunch of button pushing computer conch downtown at this point.
But uh,

196
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.960
they still wear hard hats to the game.
Um,

197
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.630
I'm sorry.
People like that,
that,
that fucking look the end of the day,

198
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.070
all that letter of apology did was just heat more praise

199
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.380
on the Blackhawks.
It was the Ron Burgundy moment.
I look good.

200
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.840
I mean really good.

201
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.740
Oh God,
I love,
that's what they did.

202
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.160
So let me tell you something.

203
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.810
Chicago Blackhawks Organization and your entire fan base,

204
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.180
you can take your fucking,
thank you.

205
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.650
You're a whatever the fuck that was that letter you wrote from summer camp.

206
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.800
You can fuck and crumble it up.

207
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.400
<v 3>How did,
how did the rock used to do that and shoved straight up your candy?
Yes.</v>

209
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.980
Please don't ever do that again.
Other,

210
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:13.410
if any other organisations are listening to this,
please don't do that.
That,

211
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:18.070
that fucking just please don't do it.
It was such a great finals.

212
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.560
Two original six teams.

213
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.370
One of my favorite moments of the playoffs was when that whatever that,
that,

214
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.340
that content that I respect that passed on a Chicago was holding up.

215
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.460
He's holding up the fucking Stanley Cup and he's still bleeding from the series.

216
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.010
Even in boxing,
they stopped the fucking blood.
You know,

217
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:48.420
they got some guy that pressing down on it with that fucking that compress thing

218
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:50.800
and he's got his gloves and shit and it's just talky

219
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.680
guys fucking bleeding and like it doesn't even,
you know,
white owl I guess UFC,

220
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.390
UFC,
that could be bleeding pretty bad.
I'm just what?
Look,

221
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.660
you have to go to literally sports where they're beating the shit out of each

222
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.720
other.
Um,
and by the way too,

223
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.710
all you fucking non hockey fans who still think it's the slapshot error.

224
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.630
There was not one fight the entire series.

225
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.380
It was phenomenal for all you fucking pansies out there.
You know,

226
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:20.360
sitting in your Afghans while wearing aprons who wait for Olympic hockey and

227
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:24.410
then lie.
It's true hockey fans going,
you know,
if this is the way hockey was,

228
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:27.140
you know,
I would watch it now.
You wouldn't,

229
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.470
you wouldn't because that is the way it is.
You fucking idiot.

230
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.640
Those are all NHL players in the fucking game.
You asshole.

231
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.190
Oh,
I am on a tear this week.
So they,
you'd go,
fuck you,

232
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.690
Chicago.
Congratulations.
Congrats.
You know what I should do?
Hey,

233
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.170
why don't we have a donation thing here.
Everybody fucking,
uh,

234
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.380
donates money to the Monday morning podcast and I'm going to put,

235
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:55.160
I'm going to buy out some ad space in the Chicago Tribune and write a thank you

236
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.830
letter for the thank you letter so I can see somehow,
well,

237
00:15:58.831 --> 00:16:01.640
what would a classy podcast,
I know he says cunt,

238
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.660
every other word I know he can't read out loud.
Well,

239
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:08.400
this is just a decorative on the blah,

240
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.250
Blah rock fucking losers.
Uh Oh,

241
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.150
deuce chills.
I got halfway through the letter and I had to stop reading.

242
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:18.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

243
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.230
<v 3>I just stopped.
It was like,
it was like,</v>

244
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.670
it was like eating lemons and that there's no fucking way.

245
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.460
How do you not know how country you fucking move?
That is,

246
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.170
it's actually hilarious if that's how they meant it to just,
hey,
you know what?

247
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:38.710
I bet they're just starting to get over losing in the finals.

248
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.650
Let's fucking remind them.
You know what it's like?

249
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.600
It's like when you break up with some chick,
right?

250
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.840
And it's like the women have that sixth sense when they can tell you start to

251
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:51.310
have good days and you get in past them.

252
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.540
So they fucking call you up and just mind,
fuck you all over again.

253
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.040
All right,
I'm done.

254
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.160
I still can't hate the Blackhawks cause I fucking have always liked that team

255
00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:06.580
and I've always loved that uniform.
But Jesus,
that is a fucking,

256
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.480
I don't know what to tell you.
They already traded Dave Bowling.

257
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:17.140
Can you believe that?
He's fucking guys getting draft picks.

258
00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:18.640
You're going to trade a fucking guy.

259
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.790
You're going to trade a guy with ice water in his veins at the most crucial

260
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:27.440
moment in the season.

261
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.630
He's just such a fucking great player,
I think.

262
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.910
I think the maple leafs got a fucking steel and I think they learned something

263
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.080
with that,
that uh oh wait a minute now.
They've always been doing,

264
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:43.900
they got Phil Kessel and they gave us a bunch of draft picks,
but we drafted,

265
00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:47.920
well,
all right,
just wait,
strike all of that.
But I think the,

266
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:51.180
I think the maple leafs got a lot better and the Blackhawks got a lot worse.

267
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.590
I am not a big fan of draft picks.
Like,
Hey,

268
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:59.820
let's take this proven Guy Dave Bolen.
He's one of those guy.

269
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.900
He's one of those guys.
Those are the guys that when you're the fucking cup,

270
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.850
you know everybody always looks at the stars and all its stills.

271
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.280
Fucking those fucking guys like him.

272
00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:12.780
<v 4>Okay?</v>

273
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.470
<v 3>You just come in and fucking knock,</v>

274
00:18:14.471 --> 00:18:18.610
you stick off the puck and all of a sudden he's got the puck right over to the

275
00:18:18.611 --> 00:18:21.340
slot.
And then the big fucking shiny superstar scores.

276
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.470
Those fucking guys in the corner.
I'm telling you,
I wish the Bruins got him.

277
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.160
You know I'm going to write a letter of thank you to the Chicago Blackhawks for

278
00:18:30.161 --> 00:18:34.870
getting rid of one of their best players.
Uh,
Blackhawks.

279
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.470
Thanks Bruins.
City of Boston in open letter.

280
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.400
Okay,
so basically this article,
this is an a Toronto,

281
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.330
they say the Chicago Blackhawks pen to full page open.
Thank you.

282
00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:50.050
Letter to the Boston Bruins and the city of Boston Friday just four days after

283
00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:54.580
being the Bruins to win the Stanley Cup.
It's signed by and all they have a guys.

284
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.170
So they basically quote the entire thank you.

285
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.710
And then the last paragraph,
it's gotta be about the Bruins.
Right?

286
00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:06.100
It's gotta be because there so fucking classy right now.
It goes,

287
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.250
it was a classy way for the hawks to wrap up a season that culminated with their

288
00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:15.460
second cup in four years.
Chicago won the best sear,
uh,

289
00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:17.320
the best of seven series 42.

290
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.250
After gutting out a three to come back from behind winning game six,

291
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.370
Monday in Boston.
You see what I'm set?
That's how all of them were.

292
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.910
There was nothing about the Bruins and had all to do with Chicago.

293
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.470
You fucking did it.
That was like a chick move I got to give you.

294
00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:35.920
That was definitely,
ah,
that makes it even worse.

295
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.410
We lost to a bunch of brides.

296
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.300
Oh my God.

297
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.970
<v 4>Okay.</v>

298
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.190
<v 3>Dude,
that was right up there.
That,
thank you.</v>

299
00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:49.540
I'm gonna just keep going on this thing.

300
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.060
That fucking thank you letter was right up there with Sally field going,

301
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.940
you like me?
You really liked me.
You know those moments where you're like,

302
00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.803
Oh God,

303
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.393
<v 4>you know</v>

304
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.350
<v 3>that big drunk woman who married the fucking old guy?</v>

305
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.030
Do you have like I buy the

306
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.170
Oh,
getting uncomfortable.
Just thinking about her

307
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.800
gross fucking Gross Chicago that that letter was fucking gross.

308
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.540
And if,
if this was the attention to make me feel this way,

309
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.070
then hats off to you are by your fucking around a drinks,

310
00:20:31.071 --> 00:20:32.150
the whole fucking city.

311
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.240
I'll buy your fucking round of drinks if this is what you wanted to achieve,

312
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.950
that that letter was worse than losing the fucking series.
That's how bad it was.

313
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.993
<v 4>Ah.</v>

314
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.760
<v 3>All right.
Did I get it all out of me?
I don't know.</v>

315
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

316
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.283
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

317
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.300
<v 0>Um,
what a fuck did we go from here?
Let's just just,</v>

318
00:20:53.301 --> 00:20:57.560
just dive right into it.
So I've been keeping up on the Snowden thing,

319
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.860
trying to see where this guy's going to land.
I'm rooting for,

320
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.090
I don't know about you guys

321
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.330
<v 3>and I'm sick of people talking about him like he's a fucking rat.</v>

322
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.480
I think the guy,
I think he's a hero.
You know,

323
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.480
this should be more whistle blowers.

324
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.460
This is just an unbelievable fucking amount of power to give anybody.

325
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.280
They've got a great article,
the whole who's watching the watchers,

326
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.890
you know what I mean?
Dude,

327
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:27.891
this is like what this guy was working on that I've basically glanced over and

328
00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:33.420
articles because once I get intimidated by high long shit is I have to stop

329
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:34.890
reading.
Um,

330
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.030
what this guy is fucking working on.

331
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.320
You have to understand that like that's game set and match.

332
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.670
They don't even have to whack people anymore.
They don't,

333
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.480
if they just have every fucking thing you ever did and ever said on the phone,

334
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.290
text,
it's fucking over.

335
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

336
00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.340
<v 3>Fucking over.
Don't look at me.
What,</v>

337
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.290
what office could I run for?
Let's just say I didn't do a podcast,

338
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.430
but you guys know my sense of humor.
All right?
How arrogant was that?
Uh,

339
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.510
you guys know me.
I'm a fucking loose cannon,

340
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.350
but a douchebag.
Um,
anyways,

341
00:22:16.351 --> 00:22:20.250
I'm rooting for this fucker guy right now.
He's looking to land,

342
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.570
I believe in Ecuador,

343
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.560
which is really hard when even everybody down to my level knows where the fuck

344
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:26.460
he's trying to go.

345
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.870
I think this kid's heart was in the right place and I think he saw what he was

346
00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:35.760
building.
He saw it for what it was.
As much as it could stop terrorism,

347
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:40.761
it also gave a bunch of fucking potential sociopaths and ability to build up or

348
00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:49.470
absolutely fucking destroy anybody that they wanted to.
And um,

349
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.250
you know,
that's just a,
uh,
it's too much power.
If you,

350
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:56.300
if you look around the world,

351
00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:59.180
the amount of places right now where people are protesting because they are

352
00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:04.181
absolutely sick of the people in power and how they're running things,

353
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.640
you know,
can you imagine being in that situation?

354
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.493
<v 0>Like</v>

355
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:16.090
<v 3>just having a fucking dictator and the guys get know kidnapping and raping and</v>

356
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.620
just gassing your own fucking,

357
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:22.450
people just can imagine being in that fucking situation.
Like that's,
you know,

358
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:23.560
when your life starts,

359
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.650
that's what's going on in your country and you've got to spend your whole

360
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:28.330
fucking life trying to topple that.

361
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.440
And now you're going to have something in place like this where,

362
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:37.441
I mean everybody's got to try to like start an entire revolution by talking,

363
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.000
you know,
sitting there with their hands over their mouth,

364
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:43.840
like Joe Pesci and Deniro and casino.
You know,

365
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.560
I think that Arab,
they saw it for what it was,
is like Jesus Christ,

366
00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:50.760
he's fucking guys.
These guys look out.

367
00:23:50.761 --> 00:23:53.430
Look at what can happen with these social networks.
Now

368
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.610
I saw a thing over and uh,
Bahrain or something,

369
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.850
these people go to prison for criticizing the king.
First of all,

370
00:24:02.851 --> 00:24:06.390
you shouldn't have a fucking king this day and age.
You know,

371
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:12.000
a king.
How fucking older you grow up,
get a fucking job,
right?

372
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.310
So people tweet a,

373
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.580
I think the king's a bit of a con and they go to jail for a year.

374
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.520
And I might be paranoid,
but I think this is the road we're going down.
You know?

375
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.630
Ah,
Jesus,
Bill,
you're in way over your head.
I know I am,
but it's fun.

376
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.640
That's what this section is every,
every fucking week.
Now when I,
when I,
uh,

377
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.330
do world,
uh,
when I do world politics,
not discuss him,

378
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.100
not read about them when I do them,

379
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.020
no,
seriously,
I'm rooting for that guy.
You know,

380
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:48.340
and I'm a paranoid fucking psychopaths,
so take it for what it is.
But uh,

381
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.860
you know,
I see all the average Douche bag.
You just,

382
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.570
he goes from nobody to be in a bouncer at a club.
Nine out of 10 people,

383
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.500
human beings can't even handle that level of power and they become a dick.

384
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.470
You know,
the next thing you know,

385
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.590
they're trying to finagle fucking blow jobs out of girls dressed like whores for

386
00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:08.920
whatever particular reason,

387
00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:12.590
just so they can get in this club and go in there and damage their hearing and

388
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.620
possibly get herpes right.
Isn't that the club scene,
man?

389
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.710
All right.
Two advertisers this week,

390
00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:25.150
everybody settle it to advertisers that are going to change your life and how

391
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:29.320
you feel about it.
Eva [inaudible] everyone.
All right,
look,

392
00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:33.580
having your own receptionist would be great.
Hell,
it even be phenomenal.

393
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.580
But paying their salary is really expensive.

394
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.300
That's why hundreds of thousand of this goes into sweatshop labor.

395
00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:41.440
I'm quitting this podcast.

441
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.480
where did we go from

442
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.350
<v 3>here?
Oh Man,
I hate a fucking had a bad day yesterday.</v>

443
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.230
I had been trying to drop weight.
You know,
I got all the way up to a buck 85.

444
00:28:50.231 --> 00:28:55.150
So now back into the one seventies,
cause that's how I do it.
You know,

445
00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.440
I don't know about you guys,
but I,

446
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.500
there's no goal in my life that includes me wanting to be a fucking lard ass.

447
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.020
I just don't want to do it,
you know,
be that guide,

448
00:29:08.021 --> 00:29:09.520
bending over to tie his shoes,
like

449
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.500
fucking head turning all red.
You know,

450
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.860
I don't want to do that.
I want to be that guy rolling over on my woman.

451
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.690
Right?
She can't even breathe does,
she's got to get on top of me.

452
00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:27.850
I still want to fucking do that,
you know,

453
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:31.030
pushing my gut up towards my face and she could find my dick.

454
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.020
I don't want to be that guy.
This is like a testimonial.

455
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:41.220
So I've been eating pretty much as good as I can as far as bike,

456
00:29:41.271 --> 00:29:41.560
uh,

457
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.500
knowing what's bad for me and sort of knowing something more about what's good

458
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:49.000
about,
about food for me,
good about food,
you know,
try and eat the right foods.

459
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.630
Just,
just,
just bear with me people.
All right.
I'm not a smart man.

460
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.540
Okay.
Half.
The reason why I do this podcast gives a fuck.

461
00:29:56.541 --> 00:30:00.260
I do this podcast to promote me and all my standup gigs.
But one of the,

462
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.150
in an unintentional upsides to this podcast is it really has to make you feel

463
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:08.480
better about yourself.
Certainly your re your reading out loud skills.

464
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:13.280
Did you hear the particular moment where I started mind fucking myself during

465
00:30:13.281 --> 00:30:14.270
the voice read?

466
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.070
But did you notice how I went Dave Bolen and I fucking collected myself and then

467
00:30:19.071 --> 00:30:22.940
I delivered during Hulu plus.
Did you notice that?
Um,

468
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.360
anyway,
so tell him I talking about,
so I've been trying to work out here.

469
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.240
They'd going on hikes and each day I go on a little bit longer of a hike and a,

470
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.350
these are the real hot months and I wasn't even thinking and I brought my dog

471
00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:40.700
out and went on this long hike and you know,

472
00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:42.440
I brought her water and all that type of stuff.

473
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.460
But I didn't know a dog could get a sunburn.
I know,
I know.
I've,

474
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.880
I just made a great podcast.
Now you're all going,
whoa,
she's fine.

475
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.220
But the top of her nose,
she has little flakes on it.
I feel fucking horrible.

476
00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.541
Horrible.

477
00:30:56.541 --> 00:30:59.930
And then I think she was walking on the dirt for too long and it was hot.

478
00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:02.000
Like she was walking real gingerly last night.

479
00:31:02.001 --> 00:31:05.030
So she had a flaky knows and she had a little tender pause.

480
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.580
Do you know what it's like to see a jacked pit bulk or

481
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.800
is it's walking down the fucking street and not complaining.

482
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.610
Still wagging its tail.
I feel fucking horrible.

483
00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.240
So this morning I literally carry my dog like a baby out to the grass and I let

484
00:31:24.201 --> 00:31:28.310
it do its thing and I carry it fucking back.
And one of my neighbors like,
oh,

485
00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:31.820
what happened your dog?
And I'm like,
Oh,
you know,
feed her.
I couldn't be like,

486
00:31:31.821 --> 00:31:34.390
I'm a terrible person.
That's what happened.

487
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:35.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

488
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.620
<v 3>Cause my own vanity,
you know,</v>

489
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.170
cause I don't want to have a head the size of a mini keg.

490
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.100
I took my dog on too long of a fucking walk.
You know,

491
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.800
I'll tell you what's great about a fucking dog is if right now,

492
00:31:48.801 --> 00:31:52.550
if I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk,
like her head would pop up,

493
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:57.020
she'd absolutely freak out and she toughed it out again because that's the level

494
00:31:57.021 --> 00:32:01.130
of loyalty that a dog has.
The kind of loyalty

495
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.190
that a cat would never happen.
You know that Jesus will you,

496
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.660
you're going to do dog and cat material.
What is it?
The eighties.

497
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.790
Why don't you go upstairs and go put on a blazer?

498
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.200
Pull up you fucking sleeves to the elbow.
Ah,
get some hair extensions.

499
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:20.510
Seek can actually grow a fucking mullet
and compare the two.

500
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.670
Um,
yes,
I feel fucking horrible,
but I haven't losing weight.
Everybody.

501
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:34.940
My goal,
I want to get down to about a buck 68 but I want to be fucking shredded.

502
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.020
Just one more time.
I want to do it all.
Do it.
Tell me

503
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:44.540
<v 1>what,
give me fuck head as being far.</v>

504
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:47.930
I go completely ball.
Oh,

505
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:52.931
I won't chicks to look at me and like my Frat goop stomach.

506
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.550
Just one more fucking,

507
00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.770
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

508
00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:03.010
<v 3>Haven't had abs since early nineties.
Sorry.</v>

509
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.653
Um,

510
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.420
you know,
sometimes when I'm in a fucking silly mood I like to come out on stage.

511
00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:17.200
So that stuff to captain,
it's a kneel like the second show on a Saturday night.

512
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:22.360
Do that to me one more time.
It just puts everybody in a silly,
goofy boot.

513
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.550
I start dancing around like an idiot.

514
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.820
Girls put their head on somebody's shoulder,
you know,

515
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:31.120
girls do that shit when they just see somebody and joy in life and they just go,

516
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.770
hey,
what do you enjoy life too?
They just put their head on their shoulder.

517
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.590
All right.
Um,

518
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.110
<v 1>Joe Head on my show.</v>

519
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:47.540
Why your make up off on my shirt

520
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.120
<v 3>Bu du,
Du,
Du.
It will never come out.</v>

521
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.610
You Selfish Lady Lady.

522
00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.930
<v 1>Um,
all right,
let's get to some sort of um,
oh,
this is kind of weird.
You know,</v>

523
00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:03.450
cause I'm trying to learn the uh,
all the capitals.

524
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.250
I can go from fucking uh,
Rick Avik Iceland,

525
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.690
however the fuck you pronounce it,

526
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.080
all the way over to the Philippines at this point.
It's great.

527
00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:17.280
Now I kind of like know where they are.
I always get like,
uh,

528
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.410
<v 3>Asia was a Middle East was rough</v>

529
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.790
<v 1>and you'd think about how many times we've gone over there and we bomb shit that</v>

530
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:27.240
I would kind of touch,
start to look at the other fucking yeah.

531
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.130
<v 3>The other countries around there.
But you just don't,
you know,</v>

532
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.020
you know what it is,
is wherever you live.
That's what,
you know,
GI bill.

533
00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:41.790
That was really deep.
You got any more fucking literally,
literally,

534
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.990
hopefully enough.
I'm such a fucking moron.
Why do you listen to this?
Huh?

535
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.440
Um,
no.
You know,
wherever you are,

536
00:34:50.441 --> 00:34:53.920
you just sit there and you watch the weather and they'll have least in the

537
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:57.340
United States of America.
I met Rick,

538
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.860
um,
White America.
What the fuck?

539
00:35:02.861 --> 00:35:07.570
Who did that one?
That's one of those songs I listened to like two seconds of it.

540
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:09.783
Oh,
by the way,

541
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.410
is there a white Al Sharpton out there that I can call for being offended?

542
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:17.560
I watched that devious maids last night because I was just,

543
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.080
I just got to see how they're going to get five years out of that.

544
00:35:20.081 --> 00:35:22.120
Absolutely horrific fucking premise.

545
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.040
And if you can just see how they make the fucking,
the,

546
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.410
the white characters on that show.

547
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:33.370
I swear to God it's the fuck you got to watch it.

548
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.760
All right.
Devious maids.

549
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.760
Put that on your watch list.
You have to watch the white characters on that show.

550
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.190
It's fucking hilarious.

551
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.130
They make them so cartoonishly evil like order the maids,

552
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.490
all the maids are Latino.

553
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.940
The whole fucking show really if you look at stereotypes is probably pretty

554
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:58.260
fucking annoying.
Um,
so all the maids a Latino,
right?

555
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.240
They work in for these fucking rich white people.

556
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:05.241
I think they had one Latino couple just to fucking level it off just beyond evil

557
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.061
white people.

558
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:10.500
So this is one of them is like a movie star and she needs to get a facial and

559
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.740
her Latino made is for Casey Latino.
One more time.

560
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.840
Her fucking made is crying.

561
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

562
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.340
<v 3>Cause she's trying to get her kid up from like Honduras or wherever the fuck</v>

563
00:36:21.341 --> 00:36:24.340
they're from,
but they're dead.
Dad died.

564
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:28.300
It's basically good times set in Central America,
you know.

565
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.920
Damn Damn.
Damn.
However you say damn it.
Spanish

566
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.880
both nods.
Bitch.
I don't know what the fuck you anyways,

567
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:41.860
so she's sitting there crying cause she wants to get a kid up there and,
and the,

568
00:36:41.861 --> 00:36:46.861
and the fucking little white lady is listening and use your seeing emotions on

569
00:36:48.221 --> 00:36:49.031
her face.
You Think,

570
00:36:49.031 --> 00:36:52.420
oh finally they're going to actually show that a white person can have a heart

571
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.270
on this show.
And then the person she just goes like,

572
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.490
yeah,

573
00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.780
so where's the father is the abutted and she's just like,

574
00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.410
oh

575
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:11.680
okay well I can't give you time off to reach out to your kid cause I have to get

576
00:37:11.681 --> 00:37:12.670
a facial.

577
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.420
Oh it's a fucking phenomenal shelf.
Meow everybody.

578
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.570
Me fucking Yo.

579
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.030
And I know that there's a bunch of morons watching the show,

580
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.800
you know from the Latin community.
Go and see.
That's how white people are.

581
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.400
They don't take care of their kids.

582
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:38.240
They're all rich and they're all getting fate.
Not saying every Latino person,

583
00:37:38.241 --> 00:37:41.300
but I know a good certain percentage.
You know what?

584
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:44.720
I get white people deserve it though.
Cause we've been doing that forever.
Right.

585
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:46.280
It's about time to stereotypes.

586
00:37:46.281 --> 00:37:49.430
And the ignorance came back around to our neck of the woods.
You know what?

587
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.790
Good on you.
Good on you.
Horny housemaids of the fucking Osi,

588
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.490
whatever the fuck it's called.
Devious housemates.
They're devious.
Everybody.

589
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

590
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.570
<v 3>You,
you fucking pay attention when they do that turndown service.</v>

591
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.340
You don't know what they're liable to do those devious maids.
Um,

592
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.650
anyway,
so let's go also.
Anyways,
I've,
I've been trying to keep up on,
uh,
you know,

593
00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.180
learning the capitols and no one where shit is like all these years to listen to

594
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:22.620
fucking Bob Seger singing about cat.
Man Do.
I didn't even know where it was.

595
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.460
So Naipaul everybody.
Do you remember Bob Seger?

596
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.390
Speaking of fucking Kevin,
that roast beef torso,

597
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.330
you know the buttons Burston on his fucking Western shirt,
swam and the cat man,

598
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.600
I used to sing that in the warehouse that the way I ran it down to,
hey man.
Hey,

599
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:45.220
get outta here.
I'll go on a cat,
man.
And I,

600
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.500
I always thought I'd,
okay,
you're a good dude.
He's code.

601
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.880
I always thought it was in like Mexico.

602
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:58.180
It's in Naipaul.
I've thought Naipaul was the capital of fucking India.

603
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.490
It isn't Naipaul's a fucking country.
New Delhi is everybody New Delhi.

604
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:06.710
I always thought,
you know,
it'd be,

605
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.200
that'd be a great idea for a fucking sandwich place.

606
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.130
You get a bunch of guys from India,
from New Delhi come over here.

607
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.090
They started deli,

608
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:18.620
they make American sandwich is better than Americans and they call it New Delhi.

609
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.490
You get it,
it's a new Dell.
But after a year it'd be like,
Whoa,

610
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.080
this is still the new day.
Um,
anyways,

611
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.050
so I was looking up some shit and somehow,

612
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.220
<v 2>okay,</v>

613
00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.750
<v 3>I'm getting so into the geography.</v>

614
00:39:32.751 --> 00:39:37.520
I'm starting to look up like islands in Guam.
And I remember,
I,
you know,

615
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.460
a few weeks ago when I was talking about the Spanish American war that I thought

616
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:45.020
took place in like fucking Texas,
you know,
and involve the Alamo.

617
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:49.700
And then I discovered that it was fought over in the Philippines and I believe

618
00:39:49.701 --> 00:39:53.840
Guam,
I can't even remember in Puerto Rico,
something fucking nuts like that.

619
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.620
Something had a fucking remember.
Um,

620
00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.290
so I started looking up on Guam.

621
00:40:00.291 --> 00:40:02.420
Do you know that they actually had trials over there?

622
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.130
War crime trials for Japanese soldiers and actually not soldiers.
The A,

623
00:40:07.131 --> 00:40:07.964
the higher ups,

624
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.800
just like Nuremberg and people got put to death and hung,
you know,

625
00:40:12.801 --> 00:40:14.330
not a lot of them,
but they still did.

626
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.390
And there was all kinds of fucking atrocities that happened over there.

627
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:22.940
I had no idea.
I think basically for the most part,

628
00:40:22.941 --> 00:40:27.410
you can Google any country anywhere and just type in war crimes after it.

629
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:29.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

630
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.180
<v 3>You know,
that's what blows my mind about all of that shake.</v>

631
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.880
And they've said it before,
like what we did in Dresden and all that.

632
00:40:35.881 --> 00:40:39.980
If we lost like the,
when we fire bomb that city,
they were just like,
yeah,

633
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.080
you realize if we lose that,
we're going to be sitting there waiting to get honk.

634
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.260
You realize this shit.
And then they just go,
you know what?

635
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.830
It's like a roulette wheel and they just push all their chips on red,

636
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.350
fucking spin the wheel and drop the marble.
You know,

637
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.950
how do you sleep at night running a fucking war.

638
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

639
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.210
<v 3>You know,
just knowing that if you lose,</v>

640
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.500
you're going to be sitting there with your head down,
you know,

641
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.850
with your fucking headphones on,
listening to people,

642
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:11.710
talking about what a monster you are.

643
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

644
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.790
<v 3>The same people who did basically what the fuck you did.</v>

645
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:17.630
<v 2>Okay?</v>

646
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.360
<v 3>To a certain extent,
except now they're,
they're considered heroes.</v>

647
00:41:20.361 --> 00:41:23.480
And then you'll get that.
It's the fucking worst,
you know?

648
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.590
And then those guys write a letter of thank you for being such a class act or

649
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.470
your fucking during your trial.

650
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.210
So anyways,

651
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:38.240
<v 1>day you'd go.
So now you know people,
one capital I taught you this week,
cat man,</v>

652
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:38.451
dude,

653
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:43.451
there was some reason it's spelled k a t h m a n d o Kathmandu.

654
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.900
Swap going to cat man.
Um,

655
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.580
let's give to the letters for this week,
everybody and it starting off.

656
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.850
Speaking of war crimes,
speaking of death,

657
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.190
speaking of things,
um,
what do we got here?
Cadaver lab.

658
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:02.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

659
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.150
<v 3>It's a good name for a band that isn't that good.
You know,</v>

660
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.200
meet some chick.

661
00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:10.960
You want to fuck her and she can't because she's dating the lead singer of

662
00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:15.790
cadaver lab.
And you're just sitting in your head like going cadaver lab,

663
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.663
like,

664
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:17.470
<v 2>okay,</v>

665
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.990
<v 3>that's the name of the band.
Let me guess.</v>

666
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:23.080
Do they have a bunch of props on stage of people bleeding?

667
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.560
Did an Alice Cooper already do that 40 fucking years ago?

668
00:42:26.561 --> 00:42:29.800
Can you just spread your legs and get some normal dick in you,
sweetheart?

669
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.323
You know?

670
00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:33.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

671
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:38.040
<v 1>Okay.
Local heroes,
cadaver lab signed to Electra elect records,</v>

672
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.480
a dear billion.

673
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.670
I work at a medical device company and southern Massachusetts and I know you

674
00:42:44.671 --> 00:42:46.920
will be in the area for your shows.
All that's great.

675
00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:50.310
You've just crossed promoted by shows.
That's like a Jimmy Norton.

676
00:42:50.311 --> 00:42:55.080
Bit from way back in the day on Opie and Anthony Show on the opie and Anthony

677
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.620
Show,
the opie and Anthony Program,
if you want to get official,
he goes,

678
00:42:58.621 --> 00:43:01.290
I see you're going to be in the area doing some shows and want to see if you're

679
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:05.370
interested in coming into a cadaver lab.
Knees,

680
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:10.320
shoulders only.
No faces or bodies.
Well,
what the fuck,

681
00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.420
dude?
That's just just like watching a movie trailer,

682
00:43:12.421 --> 00:43:14.820
but you don't get to see the movie.
He said,

683
00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:19.590
I designed a screw to repair slash rebuild your ACL.

684
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:24.600
I know you and Joe Rogan talked about it.
I taught,
I didn't talk about it.

685
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.620
That's definitely some Rogan's stuff right there.
Uh,

686
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.270
I'm too dumb to talk about shit like that.

687
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.930
This podcast is the exact,

688
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.180
<v 3>it's opposite of the Joe Rogan experience where Joe actually facts checks like</v>

689
00:43:40.181 --> 00:43:44.640
shit.
Did I say my fact checks?
Shit.

690
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.670
I can't even get through this sentence.
I don't,
I just sort of,
you know,

691
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.330
overhear things and then I just presented as fact.
So anyways,

692
00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:52.830
I know you and Joe Rogan talked about it,

693
00:43:52.831 --> 00:43:56.280
but if you would like to see a jackass like me,

694
00:43:56.281 --> 00:44:01.110
try to repair one in a lab,
please let me know.
You don't have to touch anything

695
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:06.280
<v 1>or you can,
if you want,
let me know.</v>

696
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.280
<v 3>Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
You know what,
dude?</v>

697
00:44:08.281 --> 00:44:11.880
I think you've been working in a cadaver lab too long that you feel that you can

698
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:13.380
just openly invite me to this.

699
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:14.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

700
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.000
<v 3>I don't have to touch anything,
but I can if I want.</v>

701
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:19.430
Like I just want to fucking squeeze somebody's dead knee.

702
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:20.720
That's not attached to anything.

703
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:23.960
Why in God's name would I want that on my hard drive?

704
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.210
Why would I want to know what that feels like?

705
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:27.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

706
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.930
<v 3>To squeeze a rigor.
Mortor I fucking neek</v>

707
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:36.600
sir.
Are you like a serial killer?
And you're looking for a partner,

708
00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.293
<v 4>you know,</v>

709
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.990
<v 3>like that fucking classic one that I watch where they,</v>

710
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:47.050
one of the greatest lines ever uttered on television when they were talking

711
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:50.990
about when the first serial killer met the second serial killer,

712
00:44:50.991 --> 00:44:55.520
cause he went to a new town,
said move to some new town there.
He made it.

713
00:44:56.270 --> 00:45:01.180
He made a pyromaniac and sometimes transvestite or a transvestite and sometimes

714
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.010
pyromaniac.
That's how they described this guy.

715
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.210
He was a cross dressed and sometimes pyromaniac.

716
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:14.090
Um,
and then they hooked up and they did a bunch of murders together.
Um,
you know,

717
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:14.310
I,

718
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.720
I do find that fascinating and I know that your work is leading to a better good

719
00:45:17.721 --> 00:45:19.550
for people who are alive.
But,
uh,

720
00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:21.693
<v 4>you know,</v>

721
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.240
<v 3>there's things in comedy that I know you wouldn't want to see.</v>

722
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.900
So I would invite you backstage during particular fucking moments,
you know?

723
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.500
And that's what you're basically doing it

724
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.323
<v 4>all right.</v>

725
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.260
<v 3>Now if you had the entire fucking body that that's another thing that's just,</v>

726
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.620
it's just disrespectful for me to go down there.

727
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.070
Like I'm going to see world looking at body parts.

728
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:50.940
So that's what happens.
Like when fump is somebody a

729
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.830
<v 0>okay,</v>

730
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.870
<v 3>like donates their body to science.</v>

731
00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

732
00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.980
<v 3>Like they just take your fucking,
yeah,
we'll just take the knee.</v>

733
00:45:59.981 --> 00:46:03.370
Like do you guys go to like the butcher?
Yeah,

734
00:46:03.371 --> 00:46:05.920
let me get a pork shoulder and a somebody kneecap.

735
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

736
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.760
<v 3>Hey,
feel like working on acs,
man.
It gets a great thing that you do that.</v>

737
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:13.560
Just that,
you know,
it's funny,

738
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:16.980
I have no problem getting cremated because even some fucked up reason,

739
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:19.470
you still feel it.
I mean it's gonna suck.

740
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

741
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.540
<v 3>For like 45 minutes or a couple hours,</v>

742
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:25.550
however long it takes to burn you down to ash,

743
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.973
<v 4>you know,</v>

744
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.070
<v 3>and is awful.
And as horrific as that sounds,</v>

745
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.250
being slowly burned for fucking two hours.

746
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.233
<v 4>MMM.</v>

747
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:41.990
<v 3>It's over in two hours.
Whereas if you fucking lane in a box,
completely intact,</v>

748
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.820
full of preservatives,
you just slowly decomposing over a hundred fucking years.

749
00:46:46.821 --> 00:46:48.350
I don't want to do that.
Get it over with,

750
00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.630
but that does freak me out that you're going to sit there and you know,

751
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.530
have my fucking knee on one table,
my shoulder on the other [inaudible]

752
00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.393
<v 4>you know,</v>

753
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.580
<v 3>so drew Brees can fucking throw a better pass and I was just fucking weird.</v>

754
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.450
Um,
you know,
if that was really country,

755
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.780
you invited me and a I didn't accept and then I was a deck and I trashed what

756
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:17.090
the fuck you do obviously to come on dude.
You got to understand.
All right.
I'm,

757
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:21.690
I'm,
yeah,
that's,
I can't do that.

758
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.020
I preach.
Thank you for the invitation.
They would just be weird.

759
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:26.640
I'd show up with DVDs.
There you go.

760
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:30.340
And appreciation that you've shown me this ankle.
Um,

761
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.750
<v 1>married women.
Hey Bill,
I know what I'm doing is wrong.</v>

762
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.640
<v 6>Oh,</v>

763
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.840
<v 1>I'm a single guy who became friends with a married woman at work.
Here we go.</v>

764
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.860
Devious maids.
We have a ton of stupid shit and common.

765
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.090
We even like the same flavor chips.
I know it's retarded.

766
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:56.340
Uh,
we became Facebook friends.
How did you become Facebook friends?

767
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.860
But just be honest with me.
You,
sorry.

768
00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:01.590
You wanted to fuck her and you knew she was married and you didn't give a shit.

769
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:07.030
All right.
I've been there.
Um,
here we go.
We,
yeah,

770
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.150
we have like the same flavor chips.

771
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.790
We became Facebook friends and little by little her messages starting getting

772
00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:18.860
sexual.
Yeah.
And I'm sure you didn't facilitate that on any,
you,

773
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.440
you weren't stoking those fucking flames or whatever the expression goes.

774
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.400
You weren't fucking blowing on the hot coals at all.
Right?

775
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.740
You were just sitting there talking about earth,

776
00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:31.710
wind and fire and all of a sudden she's like,
speaking of fire,

777
00:48:31.711 --> 00:48:36.090
my pussy is raging right now for your cock to be in it.
And you were like,
whoa.

778
00:48:36.091 --> 00:48:40.110
Hey,
where did that come from?
I,
I was just talking old R and B music.

779
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:46.020
Um,
it's at the point where she comes right out and told me she wants to fuck me.

780
00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

781
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.380
<v 1>She's smoking hot with no kids.
And it's so fucking hard not to do something.</v>

782
00:48:51.381 --> 00:48:54.500
It goes against all my beliefs,
but I can't stop thinking about it.

783
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.540
I have a feeling she wants out of her marriage,

784
00:48:56.541 --> 00:48:59.000
but I don't want to be a homewrecker.
Uh,

785
00:48:59.001 --> 00:49:03.890
I've also have to see her at work,
so it's extra hard to tell her.

786
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.960
Just tell her to fuck off.

787
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.940
I listened to you every Monday and usually tell guys to whack it and see if the

788
00:49:10.941 --> 00:49:14.000
feeling goes away.
Well,
I already did that and it didn't work.

789
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.860
I'm just an average attractive guy and want to fuck her.
But like I said,

790
00:49:18.861 --> 00:49:22.550
I know it's wrong.
Can you just come to Canada and shoot me in the fucking head?

791
00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.440
That's hilarious.
Oh,

792
00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:31.130
and he said from Scotland and also she's loving that accent.

793
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:37.260
Um,
all right,
dude,
not only are you going to be the fucking a married woman,

794
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:41.220
it's where you work and the odds of that coming out and once you start fucking

795
00:49:41.221 --> 00:49:43.560
somebody at work,
as much as you try and keep it on the down low,

796
00:49:43.561 --> 00:49:46.380
everybody knows they can tell by your body language.

797
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.470
Everybody at work already knows that you guys want to fuck each other.

798
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.820
They already know that.
So when you do fuck,
everybody's going to know that.

799
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.870
And then in six months when you go to get a raise and you walk in there and it's

800
00:49:58.871 --> 00:49:59.950
either gonna be a,

801
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.550
you're sitting across the desk from some other guy that wanted to fuck her but

802
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:06.250
didn't in,
is jealous of you.
Or B,

803
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:09.560
it's a woman who's jealous of that hot pitch that you fucked and wants to be as

804
00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:13.660
skinny as her and is actually annoyed on some subconscious level that you didn't

805
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:16.750
try to fuck her,
even though she wouldn't have fucked you either way.

806
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:19.900
It's going to affect your money.
Uh,
don't do it.

807
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.983
<v 0>Don't do it.</v>

808
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.830
<v 1>Been there,
done that.
Trust me.
Don't fucking do it.
It does not end well.</v>

809
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:31.490
All right?
You don't want that on your resume.
It's awful.
It's awful.

810
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.620
It's an unforgivable act.
Um,
don't do it.
All right?

811
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.840
You don't want to do it.
Your deck wants to do it.

812
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.820
And this is a great opportunity to beat the fucking steal from the Seinfeld

813
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.220
Shell to be master of your domain.
All right?

814
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.480
You don't have to tell her to fuck off.
Just say listen.
All right.

815
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.560
I would love to have sex with you too,

816
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:53.270
but I can't do it while you're still married.

817
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:57.710
So when that situation changes come by and knock on the nonexistent door of my

818
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:01.580
cubicle and I will put you right on my fucking generic plastic desks that

819
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:06.470
everybody else has that was fucking bulk ordered from some staple somewhere and

820
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:07.880
I'll fuck you in front of everybody.

821
00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.630
I'll have my fucking aux face right over the top of it

822
00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.573
<v 7>cubicle</v>

823
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.960
<v 1>and I'll fuck you right here at work.
But until then,</v>

824
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:22.360
get out of my career.
What movie was that?
Get Out of my crib.

825
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:26.290
Um,
all right,
wild bill.

826
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.740
I'm 28 and had been living in Japan for five years.

827
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:34.210
I was probably pretty cool.
What an experience,
uh,
for the past year and a half,

828
00:51:34.211 --> 00:51:38.200
I've been dating a fine specimen of a woman from your country,

829
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.590
but recently ended things.
Well,
I'm glad you did.
Considering you,

830
00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:46.780
you look at her like she's something you've collected in a lab.
Do this.

831
00:51:46.781 --> 00:51:49.840
So many people who are so close to being in a fucking serial killer,

832
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.090
a fine specimen.

833
00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:57.070
You sound like one of those Nazi fucking doctors once that's,

834
00:51:57.071 --> 00:52:01.870
it's a very fine specimen.
It's a human being man.
Um,

835
00:52:01.871 --> 00:52:05.110
a large part of this was due to us being from different countries,

836
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.130
her being from the Good Ole USA,
me being from another guy from Scotland,

837
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.430
these guys from Scotland are fucking killing it.

838
00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.330
I wish I could do a good Scottish accent.

839
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

840
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.330
<v 1>I can't,
only thing I could,</v>

841
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.910
the only thing I can kind of do in a Scottish accent is,

842
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:27.100
is the shit that they said to me.
What the fuck is the fucking podcast?

843
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:32.740
Um,
and that was probably terrible.
Right?
Oh my God,

844
00:52:32.741 --> 00:52:36.490
that's more like northern Iln shut up.
Nobody cares.

845
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

846
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.950
<v 1>All right.
Where am I going here?</v>

847
00:52:38.951 --> 00:52:42.730
A large part of this was due to us being from different countries and her being

848
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:43.870
from the good old USA,

849
00:52:43.871 --> 00:52:48.190
me being from Scotland and our employment contracts coming to an end in a few

850
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.950
weeks.
Originally,
she planned to come back with me,

851
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.850
but now I'll be braving Scotland alone.
Since the breakup I been,

852
00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.130
I've been feeling down and generally acting like a little emo bitch,

853
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:00.881
crying,

854
00:53:00.881 --> 00:53:04.930
drowning my sorrows and worrying that I'll never get with anyone ever again.

855
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:07.930
Let's stop right here,
sir.
There's no raw.
There's,

856
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:11.860
there's nothing wrong with feeling like that and addressing it and crying.

857
00:53:11.861 --> 00:53:13.510
That's exactly what you supposed to do.

858
00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:17.630
That's what the ladies though and that's why they're more,
they,
they,

859
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.090
they don't die as soon as we do.
You can't push that shit down.

860
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:27.990
Cry Like literally to not cry ism you're denying a natural emotion.

861
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:34.250
It'd be like,
would you ever deny being happy?
I like,
you know,
I'm going to laugh.

862
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.740
I got to go to four.
Can tough it out and not left.
He got to let it out.

863
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:40.260
That's your body trying to heal itself.
If you don't,

864
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.000
that shit just stays in your,
it just spoons around your fucking arteries.

865
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.140
I'm telling you,
dude,
that was one of the greatest things I saw when Chris Bosch,

866
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:53.040
when they lost the fucking NBA championship and he walked down the tunnel,

867
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.950
it just collapsed and just fucking cried it out.

868
00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.270
Do you understand how advanced of a human being that guy is a man that he could

869
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:05.130
do that and did it?
TV,
cameras,
whatever and just said,
yeah,
I was disappointed.

870
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.000
I just needed to cry it out of me and I feel better.
You know,

871
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.160
I think it's a great thing.
Oh,
by the way,
if,
yeah,
if you miss that.

872
00:54:13.161 --> 00:54:17.840
I was on Conan this week.
Um,
the wonderful people over there.

873
00:54:17.841 --> 00:54:21.440
I had me on the show again.
God,
she's somewhat of,
I'm an asshole.

874
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.800
Don't even thinking here.
Um,
the movie,
the heat,

875
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.090
everybody is the number one movie in the country.
From what I heard.

876
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.790
I didn't look it up,
but I heard it did really well.

877
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.310
So I want to thank everybody for going out to see it.

878
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.850
I want to thank Conan O'brien and everybody at the corner of Brian Show for

879
00:54:37.851 --> 00:54:41.660
letting me come on the show.
Run my mouth.
And a hype,

880
00:54:41.661 --> 00:54:43.880
the movie like to thank Paul Feig,

881
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:49.490
the director for putting me in the movie and everybody else that I got to work

882
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:52.490
with.
Um,
it's,
I,

883
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.120
I went to a screening of it last week.
It was fucking awesome.

884
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.540
Bunch of big laughs.
Please go see it.
Um,

885
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.190
cause it would help me out and everybody else in the movie would really help it

886
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:06.200
out.
So thank you to everybody who went to go see it.

887
00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:10.700
Thank you to anybody even thought about seed it and a whatever.
Chris Bosch was,

888
00:55:10.701 --> 00:55:14.020
um,
was one of the guests on a,

889
00:55:14.021 --> 00:55:16.520
on the show and I was going to say hello to him,
but I always,

890
00:55:16.521 --> 00:55:21.521
I always get like a little freaked out before I have to go do a panel.

891
00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:25.360
You know,
it's like you gotta
I was trying to think like,

892
00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:27.100
what the fuck am I going to talk about?

893
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:32.550
And I don't like going out there having like,
I dunno,

894
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.750
I like going out there and just saying something because then that sets me into

895
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.960
just be in there rather than,
you know,
like when you do that,

896
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:43.890
they do these things where they do like a pre interview,

897
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:47.670
they'll do it on radio and everything and then it just becomes this weird phony

898
00:55:47.671 --> 00:55:51.630
conversation where you come walking out there and they just go,
you know,

899
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:54.330
hey bill,
have you ever,
uh,

900
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:59.250
let your foot on fire while Mowing Alon?
And then I go,
as a matter of fact,

901
00:55:59.251 --> 00:56:03.420
I have,
I was of my lunch,
it's like,
it's almost like delta host is,

902
00:56:03.421 --> 00:56:07.680
has like ESP,
you know what I mean?
And there's that whole,

903
00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:12.060
just trying to fucking fake your way into doing this thing that everybody knows

904
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.100
you're going to do.
So,
uh,

905
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:19.101
I always try to fucking throw something out there and uh,

906
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:20.610
and Conan's awesome.

907
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.980
Cause he just fucking rolls with it and I always have a great time.
So,
um,

908
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.400
and always get more fans by doing that show.
So,
uh,

909
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.460
thanks again to everybody over there and Kona for getting me on it.

910
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:35.200
If you missed it,
I reteach.
I retweeted the,
uh,
the,

911
00:56:35.201 --> 00:56:37.660
uh,
whatever,
whatever your kids call it,
the clip there.

912
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:41.650
And I'll be doing it again this week on the podcast page and you could watch my

913
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:44.500
little interview there.
You should actually watch the whole show.

914
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:48.840
It's a great shell.
Um,
anyways,
let's,

915
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:51.580
let's plow ahead here.
Uh,

916
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:55.570
where the fuck am I sensed the breakup of feeling down crime above however,

917
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.880
now that those feelings have subsided,

918
00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:02.410
the real worry is not whether I'll find someone,
but what kind of person?
Yeah,

919
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.440
I'm talking about looks here.
Okay.

920
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.840
I currently live in an area of Japan.

921
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:11.950
Famed for its beauty through this guy is just crushing it.

922
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.740
This is what you do when you're a young man,

923
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.700
is you move to another country with beautiful.
Every country has beautiful women.

924
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:22.030
You just move there and all of a sudden you're fucking interesting.

925
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:22.560
Just cause you,

926
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.560
you're asking them where the restroom is just cause you have an accent right

927
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:32.050
there.
You're going to get 40% more pussy if even remotely have any game,

928
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:36.760
it's going to happen for you.
All right?
I currently live in an area of Japan,

929
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.110
famed for its beauties.

930
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.340
Scotland on the other hand does not boast this distinction and also has the

931
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:46.090
highest level of obesity in Europe.
Does it?

932
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:48.910
I didn't notice any fat people over there.
I mean,
I just think in general,

933
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:53.710
Great Britain,
just people have that fish and chips torso.
Then again,

934
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:57.550
I am coming from the states,
you know,
we go hard out here.
Um,

935
00:57:57.551 --> 00:58:01.930
so what advice can you give to a poor wee laddie for returning to a country of

936
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:02.680
bad food?

937
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:07.030
Even worse weather and now also finding himself having to wade through a dating

938
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:09.490
pool of biological clock ticking,

939
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.690
tanning challenged third round draft pick ladies.

940
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.750
That's Hilarious,
dude.
You know what?

941
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:21.310
The only thing I can tell you save up your money and you gotta go back.

942
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.620
You got to go back.

943
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:27.400
Not only you got to go back to where they have even better looking women than

944
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:29.980
where you were in Japan.
You know,

945
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:32.860
maybe go down to the Caribbean or something like that.
This is what it is.

946
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:37.060
You opened Pandora's box,
no pun intended.

947
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:42.010
And you know,
the selections that are out there see people who never traveled,

948
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.900
they just end up fucking somebody in their hometown and then they get married,

949
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.460
you know,
and it's just like they ate the same food their entire fucking life.

950
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.390
They don't know any better.

951
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:58.110
They don't understand how long the buffet table is of ladies that are out there.

952
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:05.140
You know?
Like if I was a guy right now getting,
I am a guy.
All right,

953
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.140
but let's just say I wasn't a guy.
No.

954
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:13.170
If I was some dude getting divorced and I didn't know where to turn and I was a

955
00:59:14.261 --> 00:59:17.560
little bit older and that type of thing,
like that is what I would do.

956
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:20.830
I would fucking,
I'd go to,
I get a personal trainer,

957
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:25.700
I would get an unbelievable fucking shape and I would get my ass down to the

958
00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:28.970
fucking Caribbean and I would find myself some island girl.

959
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:34.030
Absolute stunning beauty who's on island time is completely laid back and that

960
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:39.530
type of shit.
Right.
And uh,
I would fucking marry her.

961
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:43.310
I'd find love down there.
Start all over again.

962
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:48.980
It just fuck it.
You know,
it just given to their vibe.

963
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:53.570
Start walking around barefoot,
start chilling out.

964
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.230
Just relax it,
going out,
doing your fucking job,

965
00:59:57.231 --> 01:00:02.231
making the money and then fucking common home did this absolute exotic beauty.

966
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.860
That's what the fuck I would do rather than they'd come home and go,

967
01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:08.570
fuck the female version of you.

968
01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:14.723
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

969
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.650
<v 1>You know,
that's what I learned through travel.
So there you go,
sir.</v>

970
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:20.880
That's what I would do.

971
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.260
I will get a job there and I would tough it out,

972
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.480
save up some fucking money and I would,

973
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:31.470
I would just literally Google where the most beautiful women are in the world.

974
01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.760
Look at the pictures,

975
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.850
make the judgment for yourself and didn't just fucking move there.

976
01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:40.140
You're young,
you don't have,
you're not tied down what?

977
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.620
He can always go back to Scotland,
you know,

978
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.040
but you could have some fucking beautiful lady on your arm.

979
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:52.320
It can happen.
All right,
but you got to take that first step,
sir.

980
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.760
You got to put your freckled foot down and just make that decision that you know

981
01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:02.430
you're,
you're,
you're going to bet on yourself.
Give yourself a better life.

982
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.420
All right?
God bless you.
Good luck to you,
sir.
All right,

983
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:09.780
girlfriend hits me.
Jesus Christ.

984
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:15.120
How do you know soul having motherfucker?
Uh,
can we stop with the Hacky,

985
01:01:15.121 --> 01:01:17.190
redheaded jokes?
You know what I mean?

986
01:01:17.191 --> 01:01:20.430
Do you know how many times I've fucking heard that?
That we don't have any salt?

987
01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:22.050
I don't have any soul.
Did you hear that sir?

988
01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:24.360
Did you hear the wonderful advice that just came from my heart?

989
01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.270
How could you say that?
You know what?
Just for that,

990
01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:29.880
I'm not giving you any good advice.
I'm going to give you some terrible,

991
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.900
terrible advice here.

992
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.740
I'm 26 and I've been dating the same girl for almost a year.

993
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:38.400
She's a dime fucks like a champ.
Great job and family,

994
01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:43.460
sweetest corn syrups and the whole fucking nine yards.
Anyways,

995
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:48.210
about three months ago into the relationship,
that's what he called it.

996
01:01:48.211 --> 01:01:50.580
Everybody at the relationship.
You see what he did there?

997
01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:54.780
He took the p out and put a t.
What's the deal with relationships?
He goes,

998
01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:58.800
we get drunk at her friend's house and she starts going fucking nuts running

999
01:01:58.801 --> 01:01:59.634
around.

1000
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:05.520
I tried to talk to her and she slaps me right across the face.

1001
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:09.870
I was seeing red,
bad enough self control to let it slide.

1002
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.310
And the past two weeks,

1003
01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:15.780
however she is slapped me in front of my friends and squeeze my nuts to the

1004
01:02:15.781 --> 01:02:20.240
point of vomiting
cause I was playing

1005
01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.920
<v 3>around and pissed her off.</v>

1006
01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.520
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1007
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.180
<v 3>Wow.
She squeezed you and not so hard.</v>

1008
01:02:28.181 --> 01:02:29.770
You puked.
Were you drinking?

1009
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:31.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1010
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.351
<v 3>He goes,</v>

1011
01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:35.950
this is completely turned me off and it had made me seriously considered dumping

1012
01:02:35.951 --> 01:02:39.490
this broad too.
She grabbed your balls in,

1013
01:02:39.491 --> 01:02:44.110
squeeze to the point that you puked and you're still writing.
Make for advice.

1014
01:02:44.111 --> 01:02:46.030
How fucking hot is this girl?

1015
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:47.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1016
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.630
<v 3>He goes,
I'm a big guy and obviously can't respond.</v>

1017
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.250
So I got to stand there like a Dildo and just take this shit.
Oh Dude.

1018
01:02:55.251 --> 01:03:00.000
At what size do you feel like you could come back with an overhand right?
Uh,

1019
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:03.130
although I got to tell you that there really is nothing funnier though.

1020
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.830
If a guy's slaps her,
fuck it.
He's seen that video on the,

1021
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.450
on the Internet with that woman's slap said security guard and he fucking slaps

1022
01:03:12.491 --> 01:03:17.491
her right back and she is stunned for like a second and a half and then just

1023
01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:20.300
puts her hands up like a little kid just goes,

1024
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.630
<v 8>uh,</v>

1025
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.610
<v 3>I am not pro violence towards women.
I am not,</v>

1026
01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:37.760
but that is some funny shit and I stand by it.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1027
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:40.220
It's fucking hilarious.
All right.

1028
01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.530
She got the old right there Fred.
Um,

1029
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.150
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1030
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:50.660
<v 3>Oh right there Fred.
For New People,
I've told you what that expression means,</v>

1031
01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.790
but before I do that,
I really need to fucking,

1032
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.910
you guys are using cold lotion incorrectly.

1033
01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.270
You'll be like Chicago Blackhawks speed the Bruins and six games.

1034
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:03.380
That's some cold lotion.
That's not cold lotion.
Alright.

1035
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:08.150
Cold Lotion is when somebody goes to do something nice for you and then they,

1036
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:12.470
it's this like something bad about it.
Like Nia said,

1037
01:04:12.471 --> 01:04:16.280
can you put some lotion on my back?
That's a beautiful,
loving,
nice thing to do.

1038
01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:20.330
But I didn't warm it up in my hands and I just put it on her back and it was

1039
01:04:20.331 --> 01:04:23.960
cold lotion to get it.
So I still put lotion on her back.

1040
01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.990
Her skin wasn't dry.
I did a re solid,

1041
01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:31.610
but the way I did it cost like this fucking jolt,
this uncomfortableness.

1042
01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.530
That is the definition.

1043
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:38.770
It's actually the definition of is up on what the urban dictionary or whatever

1044
01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:40.880
it is up there.
All right,

1045
01:04:40.881 --> 01:04:45.881
so the Blackhawks speeding the Bruins and six games is not cold lotion because

1046
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.420
that,
that would be like,
they would have let us win on some level,

1047
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:56.070
but also fucking,
uh,
blew out one of our guys knees.

1048
01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.030
But they did let us win.
That would be,
I guess,
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

1049
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:03.480
let's get back to this shit,
shall we?
So anyways,

1050
01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:06.870
to refresh your memory before I went off on that tangent.
All right.

1051
01:05:06.871 --> 01:05:11.460
She's slapping him in front of friends and squeezes nuts to the point of

1052
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:15.450
vomiting and evidently,
um,
you know,

1053
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.340
they're not in the same weight class,
so he can't hit her back.

1054
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:19.271
<v 1>He goes,</v>

1055
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:23.860
I'm just afraid someday in the future I'll go into rage mode and end up crushing

1056
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:27.490
your head on the stove or something and ruin my life.
Yeah,
dude,

1057
01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:32.350
you have to get out of this.
And he goes,
I might go into rage.

1058
01:05:32.351 --> 01:05:36.880
Moe's end up crushing your head on the stove or something and ruined my life.

1059
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.620
Anyways,
love you.

1060
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:41.430
And looking forward to hearing you read this in your own clown voice.

1061
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.270
Um,
all right,
well sir,

1062
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.880
uh,
you have to break up with this woman.

1063
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:56.460
It's not even a question dude.
She quit.
She quit.

1064
01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:00.600
She squeezed your balls to the point of view puking.
It's fucking over.

1065
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.930
It's over.
All right.
You need the dumper.
And the problem is,

1066
01:06:05.931 --> 01:06:08.670
is you know what probably nobody has ever dumped her and that's why she's so

1067
01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:12.360
fucking out of line.
So why don't you do it?
You know,

1068
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:17.210
you kind of fucked up now cause you didn't do it
in the moment.

1069
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:20.000
You should have done it the next day and just been like,

1070
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:22.180
do you realize how fucking hot align,
they don't even know.
Don't curse.

1071
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:24.100
You just stay really calm and just say,
listen,
Nah,

1072
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.253
<v 0>okay.</v>

1073
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:31.080
<v 1>Um,
I don't want to see you anymore.
I just don't,
I just,
you know,</v>

1074
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:35.070
uh,
I don't know how to fucking do it.
I,

1075
01:06:35.071 --> 01:06:39.670
I can't do it without Carson.
You know,
you're fucking psycho and a,

1076
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.670
you squeezed my balls until I puked.
And um,

1077
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.960
you haven't even apologized.
You like that much of a dumb cunt.
And

1078
01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.070
no matter how smart I am,

1079
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:57.260
my kids are going to be cut with your half a dump.

1080
01:06:57.261 --> 01:07:00.270
Qantas.
So,
you know,

1081
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.090
and whenever I see them do something dumb,
I go,

1082
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:05.490
I'm going to know that it's you and that I shouldn't have dumped a load new.

1083
01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:09.510
So I,
yeah,
I,
I just can't see it anymore

1084
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.820
duty.
Are you going when you break up with you,

1085
01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:15.220
it can be wearing one of those dog,
you know,

1086
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:18.100
let those suits you wear when you're training a dog.
How to attack people.

1087
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.320
Little beekeeper hat and a cup.

1088
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.890
No,
sir.
If,
if you're actually,
you know,

1089
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:30.130
having fantasies of slamming her head on a stove top.
Yeah,

1090
01:07:30.131 --> 01:07:34.810
I would definitely get out of it before you ruin your life.
Um,

1091
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.253
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1092
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.790
<v 1>Unreal,
ashy and you don't do,
you don't want to do that.</v>

1093
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:44.791
After watching the unbelievably depressing and sad story of Aaron Hernandez,

1094
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.290
you know,

1095
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:52.060
just watching somebody losing their life and then somebody else just throwing

1096
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:57.061
their life away and that fucking depression depression where you're just like,

1097
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.910
you know,
is everybody's out there chasing money.
You just feel like,
you know,

1098
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:03.280
if I had all that money and I had a big house,

1099
01:08:03.281 --> 01:08:06.100
I would finally be happy and my life would be perfect.

1100
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:09.610
And just seeing somebody have all of that and,
and just throwing it all away,

1101
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:14.580
it was one of the most depressing fucking things I've ever seen in my life.
Um,

1102
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.880
creepy chilling,
the whole,
the whole fucking nine yards,

1103
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:23.703
<v 4>you know?</v>

1104
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.280
<v 1>And this is how fucking hilarious Boston fans are.</v>

1105
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.360
My friends are calling me up going,
you bleed this Hernandez story.
Go,
yeah.

1106
01:08:30.361 --> 01:08:33.730
Oh my God,
I can't believe.
And they just go,
yeah,
you know,
what the fuck,

1107
01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.610
now what do we do?
Gronk so always getting hurt.

1108
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:40.750
Who's Brady going to throw to if he fucking,

1109
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:42.041
it's like,
you know,

1110
01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:45.550
I think there's something a little bigger than trying to beat the dolphins have

1111
01:08:45.551 --> 01:08:47.740
the jets this year.
I think the fact that,
uh,

1112
01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:49.940
<v 4>okay,</v>

1113
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:53.450
<v 1>you know that people died and it just,
it's unbelievable.</v>

1114
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:56.510
I'm fucking believe that like,
if,
if what they're saying is true,

1115
01:08:56.511 --> 01:09:00.350
this guy literally like killed two people in the next week.

1116
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:03.710
He's on sports center,
you know,
talking to some,
you know,

1117
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.660
report it and then some lady,
they always have,

1118
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:10.320
they always have the ladies down on the sidelines,
you know,

1119
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.890
and he's sitting there smiling and waving and then his head,
he's like,
yeah,

1120
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:17.310
I just killed two people.
Um,
creepy.
Anyways,

1121
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:21.390
odd question.
Hey Bill.
Hey Billy.

1122
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.930
I've been enjoying your podcast and stand up for a while and have some odd

1123
01:09:24.931 --> 01:09:25.470
issues.

1124
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:30.180
I'm a 17 year old guy and haven't really been social or outgoing most of my
life.

1125
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:34.800
Well did you're only 17.
I W I was walled off too.
Um,

1126
01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:39.060
but recently I've had about three girls start making advances towards me and not

1127
01:09:39.061 --> 01:09:42.810
really sure how to manage that.
Uh,
go with the dude.

1128
01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:46.470
Just go with it.
Just take them out to you.
Let's sweat.
You have to do,

1129
01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:50.900
you have to push through your first fucking date.
All right.

1130
01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.470
And the longer you go,
the more fucking more of a mountain.

1131
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.800
It's going to seem like it really isn't.
Dude.
You're stepping over a rake.

1132
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:03.020
That's all it is.
You know,
it's fucking,
it's,

1133
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:05.340
it's an eighth of an inch off the ground.
Just go out there.

1134
01:10:05.341 --> 01:10:09.300
Everybody makes an ass of themselves when they first start fucking courting a

1135
01:10:09.301 --> 01:10:14.280
lady,
just take them out.
Go to a fucking movie,
Go see the heat.

1136
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.820
I heard it's a wonderful movie.
Um,
anyways,
he says,

1137
01:10:17.821 --> 01:10:20.700
and not really sure how to manage that,
but now the more issues,

1138
01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:25.850
the one girl in particular who I really like has been getting pretty physical.

1139
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.950
We had some pretty close moments that,

1140
01:10:28.951 --> 01:10:33.150
a couple of sleepovers and during the last one she started taking off my belt.

1141
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.440
I gently moved her hands away and brought them up to my chest level,

1142
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:42.441
but she's been more sexually aggressive in terms of initiating stuff than me.

1143
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.860
Why am I you ask,
you'd be probably,
where did you get molested?

1144
01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.180
I'm going to guess.
He goes,
why am I you ass?

1145
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.720
Don't I want to give up it up to this girl?
He goes,
well,
I have a small Dick.

1146
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.890
<v 4>Oh Man.</v>

1147
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.010
<v 1>He goes,
laugh it up,
whatever.
Go.
Fuck Dude.
I would never laugh at you like that.</v>

1148
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.040
Having a big Dick of a small dick is not a skill.
It's just luck of the draw.

1149
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:09.743
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1150
01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.780
<v 1>He goes,
I make up for it in character.</v>

1151
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:16.080
So not asking for a from experience cause you sound,

1152
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:21.520
because from the sound of it,
you're doing just fine,
dude.
I'm average.

1153
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.020
I'm fucking right down the middle.
You know,
my Dick was a car.

1154
01:11:26.021 --> 01:11:29.890
It would be a fucking tourists.
No,
that's a full sized car.
What am I saying?

1155
01:11:29.891 --> 01:11:31.820
It would just be like,
you know,
an ultima.
Yes.

1156
01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:42.370
You know,
it's not going to scare you.
It's not going to disappoint you.
You know,

1157
01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:46.030
it's a friend.
Um,

1158
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:52.510
all right,
well it's dependable.
What am I going here?
Uh,

1159
01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.890
do you have any advice what to do?
I really want to be with this girl,

1160
01:11:56.891 --> 01:12:00.940
but I feel like she may lose interest in me or write me off because of it and

1161
01:12:00.941 --> 01:12:02.560
I'm destined to die a virgin.

1162
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:07.330
I got to know what to do and I can't ask my friends for obvious reasons.

1163
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.940
Any response would mean the world to me.

1164
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:13.960
Thanks for making the world a little brighter by the way.
You make people smile,

1165
01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:18.490
Bill.
And that's pretty important.
Some fans,
some fan with the development issue.

1166
01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:21.510
Um,
though this is a uh,

1167
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:23.370
<v 0>okay,</v>

1168
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:24.600
<v 1>this is,
this is</v>

1169
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:26.420
<v 0>okay</v>

1170
01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:31.250
<v 1>beyond my capabilities other than to say like,
I would really talk to somebody,</v>

1171
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.630
you know what I mean?

1172
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:35.150
Because this is really like a crucial fucking thing where yeah,

1173
01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:39.110
you could be so embarrassed or something like that that it's going to cause you

1174
01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:43.250
to miss out on being with somebody.
Look,

1175
01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:46.910
there's guys with little dig said get married all the fucking time who find love

1176
01:12:46.911 --> 01:12:50.570
and that type of thing.
So your situation is not hopeless.
You know,

1177
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.730
there's guys with fucking big bleed it,

1178
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:57.310
there's women with big Dick Women big that this women with it,

1179
01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:00.980
with guys with beer,
there's women out there with big dicks toe.
You know,

1180
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:04.140
there's just a whole bunch of fucking people out there.
Everybody.

1181
01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.180
And I don't judge any of them.

1182
01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.830
There's women out there with guys who have fucking big dicks that,

1183
01:13:09.831 --> 01:13:11.090
uh,
you know,

1184
01:13:11.091 --> 01:13:14.120
they're out there fucking around on them or they don't have a fucking job.

1185
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:19.250
You know,
there's,
it's not all roses.
All right.

1186
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:22.100
And after awhile,
I swear to God,

1187
01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:27.030
after awhile all the fuck a woman wants you to do is just bring home some God

1188
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:29.510
damn money.
Just have a fucking job.

1189
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:33.800
Treat me with respect and raise our kids.
Right?
If you do that,

1190
01:13:33.801 --> 01:13:38.030
you're hitting a fucking home run.
All right?
So,

1191
01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:42.440
um,
I would seek out some professional advice and then,
um,

1192
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:47.110
I dunno,
dude,
I,
I,
you know what I,
if I had a fucking little Dick,

1193
01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:48.070
I would just own it.

1194
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:49.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1195
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.960
<v 1>I don't,
it,
it just get it out there.</v>

1196
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.860
Just fucking tell her right off the bat,
you know,

1197
01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:00.330
and then I would fucking please her at least two,

1198
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:04.290
three times before I fucking went to go do my business.

1199
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.030
And uh,

1200
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

1201
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.930
<v 1>Yeah.
I this,
I think that's just something,
you just got to get it out there.
I,</v>

1202
01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.200
that's

1203
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:12.741
<v 0>what I would guess,</v>

1204
01:14:12.741 --> 01:14:15.860
but I would definitely talk to somebody about it because this is obviously,

1205
01:14:15.861 --> 01:14:17.390
I mean,
obviously it's bothering you.

1206
01:14:17.391 --> 01:14:22.310
Would fucking bother anybody and I want you to succeed,
you know?

1207
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:25.880
So that's what I would do.
Does that make sense?

1208
01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.380
I hope that fucking helped you out.

1209
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:33.810
<v 1>The fuck did I do with my goddamn questions here?
It was still am the worst.</v>

1210
01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.530
Um,
Jesus not going to look this.
Yeah,
seriously,
dude.

1211
01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:41.900
I,
I wouldn't,
I would never make fun of somebody for something like that.

1212
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:46.810
You know what I mean?
I pick on people for,
for,
for writing.
Thank you.

1213
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:49.810
Letters after winning a championship under the guise that they're actually

1214
01:14:49.811 --> 01:14:54.630
trying to do to us a fucking favor.
Jeez.
Jesus.
She'll swell.

1215
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:59.750
Um,
all right,
let's get back to this here.
So good luck with that,
sir.
And,

1216
01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.800
um,
where the hell am I?

1217
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:09.040
Odd Question.
Yeah.
All right.
I did that.
All right.
So that they go there.
There's,

1218
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.930
there's the advice.
I hope that that was a positive thing for you.
All right.

1219
01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:14.950
Cause that's what I'm trying to say.

1220
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:18.430
I would that I would never make fun of somebody for like something like that.

1221
01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:22.150
All right.
I think that's the end of the podcast people.
Um,

1222
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:26.320
what do I got coming up?
Actually,
you know what,
I'm not on the road for a minute.

1223
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.990
I got some big shows back east.
If you'd like to know about him,

1224

he can go to bill bird.com.
Um,

1225
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.620
I'm going to be at the Cape Cod melody tent and a,

1226
01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:41.350
I can't even tell you how thrilled I am to be doing that place.
Like I told you,

1227
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:45.910
that's the place where the one and only time I ever saw George Carlin.
Uh,

1228
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.490
so that's going to be an unbelievably special night for me.

1229
01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:52.540
So it will be a great show obviously.
And then,
uh,

1230
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:58.120
um,
at the Hampton Beach Ball Room Casino,
this is all the weekend of July 12th.

1231
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:02.800
And then I got,
uh,
the Newport yachting center.

1232
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.470
So like I said,
that weekend I'm playing two tents and an addict.
All right?

1233
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.700
That's the weekend of July 12th,
13th,
14th or 11th,
12th and 13th.

1234
01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:18.960

1253
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:26.540
and with that,
I'm trying to get into a baseball everybody.

1254
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:30.680
I'm slowly getting back into it and wanting to start watching the Dodgers.

1255
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:33.550
I actually watched the red sox beat the Blue Jays at,

1256
01:17:33.551 --> 01:17:36.260
believe it was yesterday on the final play.
The game,

1257
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.990
somebody hit a little flair.
I'm going to get back into it.
I'll get back into it.

1258
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.050
If the fucking Black Hawks would stop sending fucking thank you letters

1259
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:50.030
reminding me of what I already know,
you know,
picking that fucking scab.

1260
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:54.950
Um,
yeah,
that's it.
I've decided I'm going to win brace baseball.

1261
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:58.820
You know,
I got a nice little time off here.
I'm going to lose some weight,

1262
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:04.250
you know,
take my dog on a short hike and then I'm going to go on the longer one,

1263
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:08.630
like what I did today and I'm getting up myself in great fucking shape here for

1264
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:10.940
the summer and I'm going to watch some baseball.

1265
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.670
I'm actually gonna try to go back east.
Uh,
well,
I'm going to go back.

1266
01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:16.580
He said I'm would try to take it maybe a red sox game when I'm back there.

1267
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:20.210
I haven't gone to a game and a couple of years,
but,
uh,
that's what I'm up to.

1268
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.351
All right.

1269
01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:25.640
And that right there was the lackluster ending to this hopefully wonderful

1270
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.970
podcast.
Once again,
thanks to Paul Feig and everyone who worked on the heat,

1271
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.860
forget me in that.
