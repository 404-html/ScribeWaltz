00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.430
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.420
March 18th,
2013 I it go and how are you?

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.250
I'm upstairs in my half a house at this point.
They got all the demolition done.

4
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:18.130
I'm going to have to open the fucking window cause it's already too hot in here.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.420
As fucking thing needs to be replaced too.
Anybody want to buy a tree fort?

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.970
And I think that's what I bought.
I bought a tree fort with fucking Waldo Wall.

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.110
Look at the views.
If you see though the ILS,
all these fucking bullshit.

8
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:35.920
Everybody told me,
you know what?
If you ever go to buy a house,

9
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.590
this is what I suggest you do.
Walk in there wearing a helmet.
All right?

10
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
With some safety goggles on.
Put those fuckers,

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.420
put the whole ensemble on and then have one your biggest friends just grabbed

12
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:53.950
you like a battering ram and slam you into the wall of the house and have a look

13
00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:56.680
around when you come,
when you come to have a look around,

14
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.710
you'll be surprised what you find in there.
All right.

15
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.190
If there's nothing in there other than the fucking horse.
Shit you just broke.

16
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.140
By all means make an offer on the house.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.830
All right.
He's fucking cock sucking fucking insurance adjusters.

18
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.310
Oh,
well we'll cover over the fluke.
Do you know these dickheads?

19
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.860
I had like fucking wood in the walls.

20
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:21.560
Like those slats that they never have these constant,

21
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:25.370
they're gonna put plywood and then they're going to put dry wall over the top of

22
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.610
that and I'm just going to be like,
well that's the same thing isn't it?

23
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.640
<v 1>Mr. Brewer was,
sorry you didn't have the premium coverage.</v>

24
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.440
If you hand your premium coverage in,

25
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:38.020
we would if we would have paid for when your answer.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.960
<v 0>No,
you wouldn't know.</v>

27
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.360
You would have found some other fucking reason not to pay me.

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.250
That's why you're in the big building,
isn't it?
Huh?
Why do you have a pinky ring?

29
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.450
How did you get that?

30
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.520
Is there some old woman in a wet house coat trying to figure out how to eat or

31
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.660
fucking Alto B?
Is that how you got that fucking ring?
You know it's funny.
It's,

32
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.790
the insurance adjuster hasn't even come over here yet.

33
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.520
And I've already been screaming at the windshield of my car because I know what

34
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.290
these fucking cops are going to do.
Yeah.

35
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.200
They did it to the entire city of New Orleans.
They're not going to do it to me.

36
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.010
You know,
I'm my own little city here.
I don't have any fucking,
you know,

37
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.850
there's no,
uh,

38
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.230
Sean Penn fucking rowing a boat up to my house coming to rescue me.
Is there,

39
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.540
you know,
I don't think Derris I'm on my own.
You know what?
That's fine.

40
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.590
I don't need any planning.

41
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
I've already resigned myself to the fact that I am going to fucking not only

42
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:33.360
restore this Goddamn fucking cock sucking fucking room.

43
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.900
Sorry guys.
Uh,
I'm in a mood here.

44
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.880
I am going to fucking,
I'm gonna make,
I'm gonna make it even better.
Okay?

45
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.720
That's what I'm doing.
I don't give a shit if I have to do standup gigs.

46
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.970
A and a,
I dunno,

47
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.350
one of those apartheid countries in front of a fucking dictator like Beyonce
did,

48
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.330
shaking her fucking perfectly round ass on New Year's Eve.

49
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.830
You think I'm above that?
I'll do.
I'll do what the fucking day.
Thanksgiving.

50
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.190
I'll give you a fucking a two for one.
You still are in flag day.

51
00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:12.191
You can have me in a Hawaiian shirt and whatever fucking compounds you're living

52
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.000
in to keep the people from

53
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.930
storming the damn thing because you made a deal with the CIA and he gave away

54
00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:22.590
the fucking oil,
didn't ya?
I'll come down there.
I'll do my act and your fucking,

55
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.520
all right,
I'm going to get some of that blood money.

56
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.810
I'm gonna get some of that blood money and I'm going to fucking restore this God

57
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:35.640
damn Rome back to the way it was supposed to be.
You know,

58
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.020
cause that's what the fuck I've been doing.

59
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:40.380
I've been sitting here for the last fucking couple of days and I've been finding

60
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:44.700
out where all the God damn stuff is that I need.
Have I cursed enough?

61
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.380
I really got to take this down a notch,
don't I?

62
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.180
Or does it make you feel better about yourself?
These words,

63
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.840
we have more than I do.
She had no,
I'm a fucking moron.
I know I'll never pass.

64
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.490
Nothing,
you know,
your Mike,
Somebody in their log.
You know,
I was good at math,

65
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.750
but I wouldn't do good in history.
Well I like,
I was good and half,

66
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.760
but I wasn't good with that woodwork and stuff shit.
Right.

67
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.210
I'm one of them mother fuckers,
minimum few mother fuckers.
I ain't going to shit.

68
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.580
I shucked from the second I pulled into the parking lot,
the shit,

69
00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:19.110
she called my name and I forget what the fuck she was talking about,
you know,

70
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:23.340
and he'd be,
she just be like,
let it and I'll be locked.
Just shit in there.

71
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600
You know,
just sitting there wondering why my deck was hard,

72
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.380
you know.
Um,

73
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.420
am I having a nervous breakdown?
Oh,
Christ.
So I was looking,

74
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.270
I forgot to look this shit up.
God dammit.

75
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.530
So I've been looking up all these old houses that they have out here in Los

76
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.891
Angeles,
by the way,

77
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:51.090
specifically the Pasadena area has these amazing houses out there.

78
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.800
Um,
and I've just been looking up how people went about restoring them when they

79
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:56.110
came.

80
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.110
And now if they were able to fucking restore an entire Goddamn,

81
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.710
um,
house,
I,
there has to be enough shit left for me to do a room.
Right.

82
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:11.711
Please tell me that just sounded like fast Eddie and fucking a reservoir dogs.

83
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:14.300
Please tell me.
Tell somebody got the diamonds.
Okay.

84
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:16.320
Can someone just please fucking tell me.
So anyways,

85
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.700
I started looking up all these houses,
right?
And this is back,
you know,

86
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.140
back in the day,

87
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.000
I'm a big fan of fucking blue blood money when there was a name attached to it,

88
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.860
you know,
back in the day,

89
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:32.600
like people knew the names of the rich that was stealing from him.

90
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.070
They knew what they looked like,
they knew where they lived.
It was unreal.

91
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.840
The Vanderbilts,
the Astors,
the Rockefellers,
the Rothschilds,

92
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.980
you know,
and then you had the people who started,
uh,
you know,
like,

93
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.940
like proctor and gamble,
that wasn't just a name.
Those were fucking people.

94
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.240
Like there's a house out in Pasadena called the gamble house,

95
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.940
and it was made by these guys,
green and green.
And they did those,
uh,

96
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.900
what do you call them?
Uh,
uh,
what do you call craftsman?

97
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.330
American craftsman houses.
So they would build a house farm and everybody,

98
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.300
we bought it.
How much money do you think Procter and gamble having you drive by?

99
00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:16.380
Well,
there's the gamble house right there.
That's gambles house.

100
00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:18.990
What is fucking proctors look like?
You know,
Johnson and Johnson,

101
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:22.380
all those goddamn families.
So anyways,
so it was looking these things up.

102
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:25.620
And this is house out in Pasadena called the blacker house.

103
00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:30.600
The Robert are blacker house.
And uh,
what,

104
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.080
uh,
come on.
You fuck it.
I can't,
you know something how dumb I am.

105
00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:35.490
I can't even click on something.

106
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.040
Hang on a second area doesn't make click on this shit.

107
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.520
The Blacker House out in Pasadena,
you can't believe what happened.

108
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.280
This house is fucking unbelievable.
Actually drove by it the other day,

109
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:50.480
like a goddamn stalker looking at it.
And um,

110
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.960
this house was made,
I guess for this guy,

111
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.930
Robert and Nelly blacker.
Right?
So typical,
you know,
rich people,

112
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:03.910
they get just unfucking believable house,
you know,

113
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.400
built at the turn of the last century.
So it's all this would,
you know,

114
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.460
they cut down like fucking 150 200 year old trees or whatever.

115
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:12.110
So the shit solid as a rock,
you know,

116
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:16.610
as opposed to that fucking bullshit they got down at home depot,
you know,

117
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.760
fucking shits grown down in El Salvador by some fucking eight year old.
You know,

118
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.480
once the tree is taller than the kid,

119
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.710
they make the kids shot down four in the morning before they make them fucking

120
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:31.630
plan another one,
start watering it.
You know,

121
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.050
you don't realize that that's how trees grow now.
Eight year olds,

122
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.760
they teach them how to sleep on their feet.

123
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.710
They sleep like standing up and they sit there like just slowly watering them

124
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.680
all night and then it causes them to grow faster.
It's a whole,
it's a whole law.

125
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.980
I saw him on 60 minutes.
You guys should check it out if you get a chance.

126
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:51.480
We got a Hulu,
you might want to look that up.
But anyways,

127
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:55.120
so they made this amazing house and all the furniture and all the shit in it and

128
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:59.230
the chandelier's and all of that are basically worth a small fortune now.

129
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.720
So what happened is of course the fucking lady outlives the guy.
Why?

130
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.730
Because when shit hits the fan,

131
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.120
women cry and guys fucking deal with it.

132
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.050
That's why bang,
there it is.
Did the bell go off in your head?

133
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.250
That's the first sexist,
more ronic thing that I'm going to sit,
well,

134
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.143
not first moronic,

135
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.270
but the first moronically sexist thing that I'm going to say in this fucking

136
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:26.350
podcast.
All right?
When the shit hits the fan,

137
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.930
the ladies,
they fucking cry.
That's what they do.

138
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.270
The guys were crying on the inside,

139
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:38.050
but we got to hold that shit together as we push an Ikea couch under the fucking

140
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.990
waterfall that's coming through your top of your house.
That's,
that's what we do.

141
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.340
They go,
oh my God,
if you knew it,
it happened with EA and they get it out.

142
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.690
We don't.
So hence 35 fucking years later,

143
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.470
we drop of a heart attack while mowing the lawn because in the middle of our

144
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:57.690
chest,
but more,
it's still fucking in there.

145
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.100
Attached to,
yeah.

146
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.690
<v 3>Oh my God.
The car is against that.</v>

147
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.250
<v 0>All that fucking shit is just one big fucking ball sitting there.</v>

148
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.840
Right on top of your heart.
And then that's it.
You fucking kill over.

149
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.060
And then she has the nerve to stand there.
Go.

150
00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:17.500
And I told him to stop eating red meat.
I told him to have his salad.

151
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.510
He didn't like it.
He said that food was for the Queens.
Um,

152
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.940
anyways,
so this fucking house,
this fucking house,

153
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.340
um,
they kept everything like all original,

154
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:36.160
right up until the forties.
So that stuff was already 40 years old.

155
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:40.140
They already weren't making furniture.
Well,
maybe the forties,
they kind of still,

156
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.290
but the style had changed.
So if you walked into that house in mid,

157
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.180
like 1945 when this woman died,
it was like stepping back in time,

158
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:52.390
like 45 years I gave ever go into an old person's house,
you see this stereo.

159
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:56.020
If they kept it in immaculate,
immaculate condition.
The car they're driving,

160
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.080
their fucking can opener.
Well maybe not now,

161
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.570
but back in the day then old can opener.
You know,

162
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.910
he made us some real fucking materials and set us on plastic hunk of Shit,
right?

163
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.150
They had all that stuff and they had all those beautiful sconces and not the

164
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:14.080
chandelier's and all that stuff on,
on,
on the,
on the walls and on the sealant,

165
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.680
everything.
Right.
So anyways,
in the wealth,

166
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.510
the Lei says,
whoever buys this house,
it's,
it's all encompassing.

167
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:24.790
You have to buy the house.
It comes with all the furniture.

168
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.550
They had a look what it looks like.
Another house behind it.

169
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.590
That was just for visitors.

170
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:34.591
Like a mother in law suite look like a fucking four bedroom colonial.

171
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.510
That was the guest house.
That's how big this fucking house was.

172
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.790
They had a greenhouse.
They had this giant property.

173
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.880
So when you went in and bought it,
after she died,

174
00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:45.790
the person had to buy everything and it wasn't allowed to sell off anything.

175
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.960
So course she dies and then the fucking greedy cuts.
What do they do?

176
00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:52.600
They sell the house and then that person immediately divides it up,

177
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.050
sells off the mother in law suite,
gets rid of the greenhouse,

178
00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:57.550
cuts up the fucking property,

179
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.670
has an infamous fucking yard sale and sells all of this unbelievable furniture.

180
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:09.150
And to this day it's in museums and private collectors own the shit gets even

181
00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:11.500
worse.
What happened to this fucking house?

182
00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:13.600
It's what makes me feel better about me cause I only lost one room.

183
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.730
It's beautiful fucking house with all the shit.

184
00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:17.260
They already lost all the furniture,
right?

185
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.430
But they still have to do the windows and the chandeliers and all that shit.

186
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:26.431
Some cut buys it in 1985 who's a fucking deals in like vintage chandeliers and

187
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:30.610
all this stuff.
He buys the house for 1 million bucks.
Guts.

188
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:35.320
The fucking thing is selling these chandeliers for like six figures to who?

189
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.220
I don't know,
but some are we selling them for like 150 200 grand.

190
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.460
He selling the sconces for like a hundred grand.
He guts.

191
00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:46.630
The fucking place replaces everything with the home depot replica piece of shit

192
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.950
was called the rape of the other fucking blacker house or whatever.

193
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:55.180
I'm reading all of this stuff.
Is this boring for you?
I don't know what.

194
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.610
So I've been reading up on all of this ship or whatever.

195
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:01.510
Somebody bought the house after and was able to restore it painstakingly.

196
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.750
I made add painstakingly.
So I figured if these guys can do that,
you know,
I can,

197
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:09.060
I can restore this one fucking run there.
Right.

198
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:12.370
Trying to pull this shit on me telling me that people don't put plaster up

199
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.730
anymore.
It's like,
yeah,
they do.
I just had my fucking rooms out there.

200
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.080
Replastered I already have a guy.

201
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.090
I write your fucking cunt with your plywood and your dry wall.

202
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.820
Is that what you're going to do then?
Why don't I just do it?

203
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.440
Why don't I just fucking do it?
Because you'd fuck it up,
Bill.
Yeah.

204
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.011
But you know what?

205
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:33.790
I could do most of it around the windows will be a little bit difficult because

206
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:38.260
it requires some fucking measurements.
Um,

207
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.900
so anyways,
that has been,
uh,
that's been my week and

208
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.370
I got a bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow,
right?

209
00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:50.610
So that's why I'm doing the podcast here Sunday afternoon.
So anyways,

210
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:51.630
I walk into the living room,

211
00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:55.560
the lovely Neal is watching one of reality shows and you know,

212
00:12:55.561 --> 00:13:00.561
it's the five just toxic women sitting in this limousine and one of these women

213
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.780
is talent.
This hap,

214
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.770
one of these women who is divorced is telling this happily married woman that

215
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:09.840
she needs to speak up to her husband more.

216
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.910
And it was basically because the husband said,
I'm old fashioned.
He goes,

217
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:17.340
I'm an old fashioned guy.
So he's out there killing it,

218
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.770
making an insane fucking living,
right?
And she's the little homemaker,
right?

219
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.780
So Kentucky,
Mick divorce thing,
right?
Contact,
divorce stain.
There you go.

220
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.520
It's sitting in the back of the limo and basically telling the girl who's

221
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:34.710
fucking,
she's got the best deal ever.

222
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.500
She married somebody who's out there making a fuck load of money and all she's

223
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:42.180
got to do is keep the house together.

224
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.740
So are you gonna do you got all fucking day?

225
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.640
Jesus Christ.
How long does it take to sweep the kitchen?

226
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.383
<v 3>Yup.</v>

227
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.100
<v 0>You can even hire a fucking cleaning company just to have the shit clean.</v>

228
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.440
And when I come home,
have dinner ready for the life of me,
for the life of me.

229
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.760
I don't know why certain people look at that as slavery,

230
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.160
you know?
Unless look,
if you have some fucking dream,
you know,

231
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.270
and you have ideas and that type of thing that you want to go out and pursue

232
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:20.530
them,
by all means.
But if you're just going to be another cog in the wheel

233
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.920
<v 4>bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,</v>

234
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.900
<v 0>taking the fucking subway to work to go make somebody else's dream come true.</v>

235
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.693
You know what I mean?

236
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.010
Why the fuck would you take that other thing you got all day to get out of the

237
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:39.970
house?
Go for a fucking walk.
You know,

238
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.520
dude,
I swear to God in another life,

239
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.680
if I'm a fucking stay at home mother,
I swear to fucking God.

240
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.490
I am going to,
I'm going to get fucking season tickets,

241
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.520
<v 3>okay</v>

242
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.520
<v 0>to everything to fucking all four sports and I'm going to knock out everything I</v>

243
00:15:01.741 --> 00:15:03.090
have to do during the day.

244
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.020
I'm going to have that fucking dinner ready the second the dude comes in and

245
00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:08.710
then when it's over,
see Ya.

246
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:13.270
I'm out fucking run it down the thing on my fucking heels and I'll go to the God

247
00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:14.104
damn game.

248
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.810
I don't know what they're complaining about.

249
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:25.070
You couldn't have more fucking free time.
You know,
even when you have kids,
it's,

250
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.680
you're still running shit.
You're still the boss.

251
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.260
<v 3>You know.
I Dunno.</v>

252
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.880
<v 0>I know I've talked about this shit.
So she ends up telling this,
this,</v>

253
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:38.510
this lady in the fucking back of this limo.
She's like,
you know,

254
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:41.630
that's all well and good if he wants to fuck and blah blah blah.

255
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.470
But you know that old fashioned stuff can also be controlling.

256
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.580
It can outsell beat control.
It can.
You know,

257
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.180
people when people are dumb is when they make one point and they have to say it

258
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.930
three times in a fucking row to make it sound like they made a bunch of

259
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:59.150
different points,
but they only made one.

260
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

261
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.520
<v 0>And now it's not working and now it's there where I can</v>

262
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.620
do that shit.
You just want to slap them on the side of the head.
It's like,

263
00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:12.200
are you stuck in there?
What's wrong with you?

264
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.630
I heard you the first time I heard you the first time.

265
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:19.680
She fucking driving me fucking nuts with this shit.
And then she ends it with,

266
00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.240
you know,
so if he wants a sandwich,

267
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.510
he should go out there and have to make it himself.
And I just ah,

268
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.100
oh that whole fucking shit I women like that are always like,

269
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.020
you're not the king.
You're not the king.

270
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:36.710
But then two seconds later if you were to say you're a queen,

271
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.400
they would 100% agree with you.
And it's that classic shit.

272
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:44.900
I think I did it in one of my standup things on stand up skittles.

273
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.730
I swear to fucking God.

274
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.060
Every God damn thing that they bitch about that they do not want to be done to

275
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:56.570
them.
They will fucking duty you in a second if you let them.
All right.

276
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

277
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.041
<v 0>This is why it,</v>

278
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:02.970
me and Nia can't watch TV together because she watches the dumb whore channel

279
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.400
and she watches it to laugh at the dumb horse,
which if I was a woman,

280
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.390
I could sit there and laugh at the dumb horse because at no point would I be

281
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.260
financially like connecting,
you know what I mean?

282
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.180
Like the biggest fear for me anyways is you're going to fucking get married.

283
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.660
The is going to flip on you and then take everything it got and there's nothing

284
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:27.930
he can fucking do about it.
Right.
So when I watched those stupid horse,

285
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.530
that's what I see.
I see a limo full of child support,

286
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.090
just fucking lazy.
Get your fucking life together.

287
00:17:36.091 --> 00:17:40.410
Losers decked out.
By the way.
They were on their way to a titty bar.

288
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.343
<v 3>Okay.</v>

289
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.190
<v 0>You know,
so right to everybody.
And if everybody in the car is fucking suspect,</v>

290
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.800
it's like,
wait,
w w what the fuck?
How old are you?

291
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.300
I don't even go to the titty bars anymore,
but Christ think ladies,

292
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.100
get your middle aged pussies back in the fucking house and make a God damn

293
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:01.860
sandwich.
Am I right?
Do you know bad?

294
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:05.550
I want to go on like Ellen Degeneres show and somehow get half of that out

295
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.960
just to see how long,
how much of it I could get out

296
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.630
before,
I don't know,

297
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:19.650
before somebody was through the morning after pill at me.

298
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.410
I'm a viola.
That shit right in my giant forehead.
Um,

299
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.230
anyways,
I was just thinking,

300
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.850
what if my hitting me in the forehead was a carnival game?
What we,

301
00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:34.260
what do you think you would win?
It would be so fucking easy.
My forehead.

302
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.790
So God damn big.
You know,
you'd win one of those.

303
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:42.150
Remember those little Koalas that the could stick on the end of your pencil back

304
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:45.450
in the 70s.
I'm sure they got a box of those leftovers somewhere.

305
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.480
That's what you'd win until they ran out.
So anyways,

306
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:51.510
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody,
it's ignorant.

307
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.770
It's sexist and uh,

308
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.450
Uh,
we got some advertising.

00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:43.470
back to the podcast,
back to the podcast.
Um,

336
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.590
did you guys watch the uh,
the UFC fight?
Um,

337
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.380
GSP versus Nick Diaz?
I believe his name was nick.

338
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.520
I go in and out of watching the UFC.
I,
I,
I love it.

339
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.730
I love the UFC.
I love boxing.
I love all that stuff.

340
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:02.020
It's just that all the pay per views,
our Saturday night am I right,

341
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.940
the Saturday night and I'm usually doing shows and uh,
and I missed them.

342
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.130
I always ended up missing him.
And um,

343
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.120
but every once in a while what happens is like I used to watch it on the versus

344
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:17.710
network all the time and uh,
I don't give a fuck.
You know what level UFC that is?

345
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:19.630
It's two people trying to beat the shit out of each other.

346
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:22.420
Then a way better fighting than I am.
Like,
I'm not going to watch that.

347
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.750
What am I going to watch five whores and the back of a limo on the way to a

348
00:21:26.751 --> 00:21:31.540
titty bar talking about how they don't want to make a fucking sandwich,
you know?

349
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.240
Well,
they get your ass on this stage,
sweetheart.
Oh,

350
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:38.050
that's the third sexist neurotic one.
Um,

351
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.960
ah,
God,
that fucking dead girl really annoyed me.
That woman was happy.

352
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:48.961
She was making sandwiches and this girl is such a fucking negative cunt.

353
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.860
It's not enough that she's fucked up around relationship.
She has stuff.

354
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:57.260
Fuck this girl's relationship and ruin.
This guy's thought he's going to,

355
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.220
he's going to come home and be like,
what the fuck happened?

356
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:03.760
Everything was going great.
And then she's going to come at him with an attitude,

357
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.600
you know,
not bringing two nickels into the fucking relationship,
you know?

358
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.690
I Dunno.
All right,
let's,
let's,
let's just let it go.
Bill.

359
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.690
Let's just fucking let it go.
I mean,
I don't know,
maybe,

360
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:21.280
maybe she's making millions on her reality show.
I can tell you right now,

361
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:22.690
they probably make less than comedians.

362
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.420
Let me ask you this,
people,
when was the last time you bought a box set?
Um,

363
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.270
of a reality show?
I don't think they exist.
That's why they like disposable.

364
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.160
That's like the bic lighter of fucking television shows.
Um,

365
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.690
it doesn't have any legs,
you know,
so they pay you once

366
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.480
pay once and they pay us shit money.
Yeah.
You know what good.

367
00:22:50.481 --> 00:22:51.730
And I'm glad they're all getting fucked.

368
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.920
Spending all their money on fucking Manny Petty's.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

369
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.360
Is this,
what,

370
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.360
am I really that upset about a reality show or is it the fact that half of my

371
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:02.950
hubs is fucking gutted right now?

372
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.880
Couldn't even say house have my hus anyways.

373
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.110
So every once in a while,
this is the thing for me.

374
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:15.700
I am a sucker for a boxing or a UFC promo.
You know,

375
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:17.770
when they get on there and they do the background,

376
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:21.640
they show both the fighters working out and they start telling their stories and

377
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:24.460
everything that they have on the line and how they need to,
I swear to God,

378
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:26.350
if I start watching one of those fucking things,

379
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.790
I'm ordering the fight to the point.
Like I avoid them.

380
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.290
I avoid them because so many times you fucking order them and then the fight

381
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:39.970
sucks.
You know,
it doesn't live up to the hype,
you know,

382
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.870
especially with boxing.
Jesus fucking Christ Jesus Christ.

383
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.770
I've spent more fucking money on all the way back to the Tyson error.

384
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.480
The Tyson ones were always worth their money even though he'd knock them out and

385
00:23:52.481 --> 00:23:53.630
fucking 90 seconds.

386
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.680
But it was still like you were watching some Babe Ruth Shit in new it.
You know,

387
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.120
they only went into the Lennox Lewis years and it just got all fucked up.

388
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.840
Even half the Oscar de la Hoya once towards the end I got fucked on those,

389
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.330
you know,
and then they always got that great white hope coming in,
you know,

390
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:14.090
and they show him,
Hey Heidi,
Heidi,
Hawaii,
Heidi,

391
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:17.450
Heidi who write and he's skipping rope and he's got an angry fucking look on his

392
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:20.270
face.
You look at him,
go at least got kicked the shit out of me.
Right?

393
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:22.870
And then the black guys all confident,
like damn ain't sweating them up.

394
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.700
And you're like,
you know what,
I'm going to order this shit and what comes out.

395
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.110
Oh did he tell you to take?
And that's it.
Just fucking over.
It's fucking over.

396
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.090
You know,
he wasn't fast enough.
You know,
it was too slow.
Yeah,
know it,

397
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.450
but they got you.
They fucking hype the shit up and the fucking dude sat there.

398
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:39.830
Not only did it beat his ass,

399
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.490
he did a little dance mocking him and then he just knocked him the fuck out.

400
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:47.230
That's what happens every God damn time.
Right.
But I still order it.

401
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.140
So the UFC thing,
like you're upstream Jeremy Law.

402
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.200
So I fucking watch,
I'm watching Dana White on there,

403
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.610
right?
And Dana white comes to the podium and I'm going,
Bill,

404
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:03.410
don't watch this fucking promo.

405
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.040
Do not watch this promo because the second you're done watching this,

406
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.150
you're going to take 50 60 bucks,
whatever it is.
And it's going out the window.

407
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.300
But there was something about the look on Dana White's face.
I'm like,

408
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:17.300
I got to watch this shit.
And he comes to the mic,
you know,

409
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.890
just a Mike and he's just like,
GSP

410
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.120
snapped today.

411
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.710
It is the most angry I've ever seen him.
He said,

412
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:35.711
Nick Diaz is the most disrespectful human being on the planet and he is going to

413
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:43.100
absolutely destroy him.
Something like that.
Okay.
And I'm thinking like,
GSP,

414
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:46.820
this guy's like the fuck.
He's like Captain America.
He never gets mad at anybody.

415
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.310
He doesn't let anybody get under his skin.
He fucking stage.

416
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.170
He's like a robot.
He just fucking goes in and does what he's got to do.

417
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:57.980
He's made them that man.
And then I see this Nick Diaz Guy and he just looked,

418
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:02.360
he just looks the part like,
fuck you bitch,
I'll fuck you up.

419
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.280
And it was just the two worlds.

420
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.020
The guy who spikes the football and the guy would just cans it to the referee

421
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.360
colliding.
I got to see this shit.

422
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.960
I want to see what a furious fucking GSP looks like and I want to see if this

423
00:26:17.601 --> 00:26:21.380
other guy can actually back up all this shit talk.

424
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:22.880
And so I ordered the fucking fight.

425
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

426
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.760
<v 0>It ends up being a great fight.</v>

427
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.440
I'm not saying then I got fucked on this fight at all.

428
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.240
It's totally worth it.
And the fight before,

429
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:36.440
it was great with that dude from Texas with the heavy hands and the fucking

430
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:40.130
Ulysses s grant beard loved it.
Okay.

431
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.040
But this is what pissed me off at the fucking end of it and made me feel stupid.

432
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.740
Was it in the end,
you know,

433
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.660
Rogan interview when the guy and then they won't.
And he was going,
you know,

434
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:54.330
you seem like you got really angry and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

435
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.820
And then he just goes,
uh,
you know,

436
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.620
and I was waiting for him to be like saying like,

437
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:01.440
this guy is a piece of shit and I'm glad I fucking beat him.

438
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.120
And I was waiting for him to finally see that side of him.
And,

439
00:27:04.121 --> 00:27:07.760
and he just goes a GSP just like I did not take anything.

440
00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:10.610
He says he has a great fighter.

441
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.610
He did a great job promoting the fight.

442
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.900
Everybody give him a round of applause.
He is,
he is the stairs that but guy,

443
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.670
it's like,
wait a minute,
I thought you snapped.

444
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.020
I thought you did take it personal.
I might have fucking stupid.

445
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.730
I felt like a fucking idiot.
I did not take,
I pause.

446
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:37.010
It's like George,
however you say his name,

447
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.150
the whole reason I fucking ordered the fight was because I thought you took it

448
00:27:41.151 --> 00:27:43.820
personally.
I'm an idiot.

449
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.460
I'm like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.

450
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.840
I fall for it every fucking talk right now.
Maybe it's because he won.
Well,

451
00:27:50.841 --> 00:27:52.850
maybe because he's so aware of his,

452
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.530
his image that he just didn't let on that the guy annoyed the shit out of him.

453
00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.700
But there's fucking sitting there.

454
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.310
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

455
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.510
<v 0>Holding each others arms up by man,
you know,
and it just,
I dunno,</v>

456
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.330
he absolutely snapped today.
Fast forward,

457
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.060
I did not take it personally.
He has a great guy come over here.
Uh,

458
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.170
we are gonna go play shuffleboard now.
Here's a great guy.

459
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:21.680
He is a good competitor.
And uh,
and then the other guys going like,
Hey,

460
00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:25.910
I think I'm done with that.
The MMA of die.
You know,
I'm sick of this.

461
00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:29.210
I don't know what to do now.
And then George,
isn't it background?
No,
no,
no.

462
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:32.900
Stick with it.
You can de Yoga come back.

463
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:34.600
He's like giving them words of encouragement.

464
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.640
I Dunno.
Am I an idiot?
But I that,
that fucking annoyed me.

465
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.180
Don't fucking tell me this guy's taking it personally.

466
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.730
And then I ordered the fight and then the fucking guy said he wasn't,

467
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.820
it's false advertising.
I'm just fucking around was a great fight.

468
00:28:54.821 --> 00:28:59.180
But you know what I mean?
Don't look,
I know that just sell on the fight,

469
00:28:59.181 --> 00:29:00.950
but don't fucking tell me that

470
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.980
everything we sat up until this point was bullshit.

471
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.380
I'm actually friends with him and his wife.

472
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:13.300
We got down to Applebee's every other day.
We do not take it personally.

473
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.720
Um,
whatever.
I was still a great fight and uh,
you know,

474
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.590
I gotta keep saying that in case I fucking run into one of those guys and they

475
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:25.110
headbutt me with their fucking cauliflower to elect their ears.

476
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:29.610
Even their ears are tough,
you know,
every time I watch a UFC event,

477
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.030
you know what it is,
it's the fucking kicks.

478
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.860
That's what kills me is amazing as it is to watch somebody who's on the bottom

479
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:41.420
getting fucking taken elbows to the head and,

480
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.080
and fucking actually looking over at the clock like,
oh,

481
00:29:45.081 --> 00:29:47.740
17 more seconds to this.
I can handle it.

482
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.200
Maybe if I bring my bloody forehead closer to his chest,
um,

483
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.490
he will only maybe grazed the back of my head and you know,

484
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.720
I have fresh skin back there that hasn't been broken wide open at this point.

485
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.410
Like the level of toughness is that is that,
that's a whole nother level.

486
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.620
But when they're just standing up and the fucking one dude just kicks the other

487
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:11.500
dude right where you'd get a Charlie horse and they just take it,

488
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:17.310
that fucking blows.
Like how do you,
how do you get that tough dude?

489
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:22.330
I'm telling right now if I was standing in line at a fucking grocery store and

490
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:26.710
some eight year old had pants on and some eight year old came up to me and just

491
00:30:26.711 --> 00:30:29.680
fucking whack me,
punched me and I maybe not punch,

492
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:32.200
I could take a punch from an eight year old.
All right,
let,
let's,

493
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:36.130
let's move it up here of fucked in an eight year old whose dad is like 609 so

494
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:40.300
the kids already five fucking four.
I'm just saying any,

495
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.700
if you ever want to just fucking knock me down.

496
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.860
You don't have to be all fancy and hit me in the judge.

497
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:45.880
Just hit me in the leg right there.

498
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:50.170
I will crumple like the fucking plaster in the ceiling of my office.

499
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.570
Um,
everything just goes back to that,
doesn't it?
Um,
what else?

500
00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:58.300
What else can we talk about here?
I'll be,
we talk hockey.

501
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.660
Did anybody watched the Bruins Pans Game Penguin's game?

502
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:05.920
They put on a fucking four checking clinic.
They uh,

503
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.731
they were amazing.

504
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:10.390
They look great in the fact that Gino isn't even back yet was uh,

505
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.130
was pretty scary.

506
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.200
I mean we have a great defense so we were able to keep it two to one,

507
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:21.190
but it felt like it was more like three,
three,
one like a back in the day three,

508
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:23.230
one,
one,
three.

509
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:25.930
One was like the tipping point because then if you went down by three goals,

510
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:27.850
it was fucking over.
There was no way you would come back.

511
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.160
Then they got rid of the red line and then,
you know,

512
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.500
within a minute it's like a Thai fucking score.
But um,
they look great.

513
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:39.610
And Crosby is without a doubt,
the best player in the fucking league.
It's insane.

514
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.780
That fucking line that they have is terrifying.
And a,

515
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:46.420
the only thing I'd say is there maybe their goal tending,
I guess it's,

516
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:49.480
they're starting to play better,
but I don't know about that goal tending.

517
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.810
I Dunno either way.
Either way.
They beat us again.
We finally beat the capital's.

518
00:31:55.811 --> 00:32:00.330
That was cool.
But we,
we're,
we're missing a Crosby level now.
Fuck.

519
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.930
Nobody's across Crosby's level.
But you know,

520
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.390
we need a fucking 50 potential 50 goal score and guy,

521
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:13.000
um,
we need,
we need a next level guy.

522
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:16.960
We got a defense.
That's all good.
We got the goal tending.
That's all good.

523
00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:18.070
But like this whole shit,

524
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:22.150
what we're going to score two fucking goals a game and try to stop these upper

525
00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:25.750
echelon teams.
It's just,
it's not working.
It's not fucking where,

526
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:28.450
you know what's great than anybody watched the capitals game course you did.

527
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.530
Did you see when that,
that dude was at Henderson and something got kicked out?

528
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.880
Whatever the fuck his name is,

529
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:39.630
he gets kicked out of the game and some Boston Bruins fan is down at him to the

530
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:43.490
point the guy stops and starts yelling back at him.

531
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.730
You gotta see I gotta Oh,
did I erase?
I think I erased it.

532
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.990
If anybody's got a copy of it.
It's a fight about,

533
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:52.580
was like five minutes left in the game.

534
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.990
And one of the capitals gets taken off the ice.

535
00:32:54.991 --> 00:32:56.870
I was at the end of the second period.
I don't fucking,

536
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.700
all you do is you got to see the,
the bouncer,

537
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.260
the security guy who's in,
in like the tunnel.

538
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.010
And he fucking comes walking out and just clear as day.

539
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:11.720
He starts pointing at the Bruins fan and he goes,
Hey,
shut your fucking mouth.

540
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.030
Shut your fucking,
and then they,
they cut it.

541
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.603
I love it.

542
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.900
I love seeing highlights of where I'm from and seeing the behavior hasn't

543
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:28.450
changed.
It makes me feel smart.
Um,

544
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.210
all right,
let's get to some,
um,
emails for the week.

545
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:34.550
Now a lot of you guys always ask me,
and I always forget to say,
you know,

546
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:36.920
if you want to email the podcast,
you want to ask me questions?

547
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:40.040
You want to trash me?
You want to do whatever the hell you want to do.
Uh,

548
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.060
it's bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com bill at the capital m,

549
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:50.820

Um,

550
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.693
all right.

551
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.630
Army wife relocation a,
their bill.

552
00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.560
I hope your house is feeling better.
Thank you.
Yeah,
it's actually,

553
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.890
it's been gutted.
It's been gutted at this point.

554
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.450
That's where we're at.
Um,
hope you house is feeling better.

555
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.320
I am an army wife currently living in but fucking Berg cans,

556
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:17.240
ass.
We are stationed at Fort Reilly until July this year.

557
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:21.740
When my sweetheart heads over,
heads on over to Afghanistan.

558
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:27.230
My conundrum is where should I move when he leaves because I sure as hell ain't

559
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:30.860
stay in here by myself at any moment or heard of fat,

560
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:35.861
dirty pajam bottom wearing Walmart shoppers with black bottom feet.

561
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.560
Jay's is,
can you paint a picture?
Um,

562
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.120
said could lynch me for being Brown and under 300 pounds.

563
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.460
I got to get Outta here and thankfully I am fortunate to have two choices of

564
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:57.050
where to go in there in lies.
The reason that I need your assistance.
Um,

565
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.990
I could move back to Seattle where I live two years ago.

566
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.500
It's all true about Seattle by the way.
Beautiful,
clean white,

567
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:07.850
depressing reigny better than Kansas or I could go to Fort Lauderdale,

568
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:11.330
Florida where I have never lived,
but I just visited last week.

569
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:15.230
It's a little scary because I haven't driven like a complete retard with crystal

570
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:17.060
meth throwing through my veins.

571
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.410
So I don't know if I can handle myself on the road.
But aside from that,

572
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.770
it's got just as much going on going from me.

573
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:28.730
There is Seattle and it's not fucking Kansas.

574
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.940
Uh,
I think that with all your travels,

575
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:34.460
you must have some insight that you could really,

576
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:39.930
you could relay loudly to me through your podcast.
Um,
if I,

577
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.550
well personally
I would pick Seattle over Fort Lauderdale,

578
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:48.300
Florida,
any day of the fucking week when people are smarter.

579
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.310
Um,

580
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

581
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.450
<v 0>You don't have the hurricanes</v>

582
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.160
like Florida is like a destination state for dark bags.

583
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.743
You know what I mean?

584
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

585
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.910
<v 0>It's,
it's one of those,
like La is a destination city for people like me.</v>

586
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.240
You know,
I'm going to be a movie star,
whatever dumb shit we want to do,
right?

587
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.250
So we come out here,
you know,

588
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.840
and then bitch about how flaky everybody is and when the reality is,
it's us.

589
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.110
You know,
we're the ones coming out here and we don't,

590
00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:23.920
we're not personally invested.
Nobody's invested in this fucking city.

591
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.180
Um,
cause you always think I'm gonna make my money,

592
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.480
then I'm going to get the fuck outta here.

593
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.670
That's in everybody's trying to make the money.

594
00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:32.410
So it always looking over everybody's shoulder,

595
00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.810
trying to see the next person coming in the fucking room and a while they say

596
00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:40.030
everybody out here is flaky.
But anyways,

597
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.480
getting back to what you were talking about,
I would go to,
let me,
Seattle,

598
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:45.880
Seattle is fucking beautiful.
I know it rains.
I know it's fucking depressing.

599
00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:49.240
But um,
Fort Lauderdale,

600
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.970
I don't know man.
I mean

601
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.630
the fact that it's like,
it don't just let people go down there for spring break.

602
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.900
Do you want that for like one month of your year?
You know,

603
00:37:02.901 --> 00:37:06.890
waking up in the morning here and show show yard tense.

604
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.610
Do you want to do,
you don't want to do that.
You know,
you got fucking hurricanes.

605
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.500
There's alligators.
They got my Skeeto size in my fucking head.

606
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.900
Um,
I dunno.
I mean,
you know,

607
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:26.370
you don't understand.
All I do is I fly in and I do a fucking gig down here,

608
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:30.550
like the Strip mall area.
And like,
I dunno,

609
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.310
I like the Tampa Bay lightning and I like the devil race.

610
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.800
I Dunno.
Like Florida is,
is,
is,

611
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.190
is kind of like Sunny Kansas in a way.

612
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.780
You kind of still got the gun culture.
You kind of still got the Walmart people.

613
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.480
Um,
I'm not saying they're all like dead,
you know what I mean?
I mean,

614
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:59.330
tiger woods lives there,
right?
Jack has a place down there,

615
00:37:59.331 --> 00:38:01.060
some zillionaires down and he got,

616
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.990
you got the fucking all the movie stars living down there in Miami,

617
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:09.760
but Fort Lauderdale.
Um,

618
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.390
I dunno,
that's safe to say cause I don't fucking play there and I play Seattle.

619
00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:16.630
So I think I made a smart business move there.
Firstly,
I would move to Seattle.

620
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.430
Yeah.
Fuck damn moved to Seattle.

621
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.940
Go down of the fish mark and get yourself a fucking clam sandwich.

622
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:28.700
Whatever the fuck you do.
I don't know.
I,
you know,

623
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.660
I dunno.
I don't fucking know.

624
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.170
You got like on the other opposite ends of the spectrum.
Listen,

625
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:35.650
will you unbelievably depressed.

626
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.270
If it's cloudy fucking nine months out of the year,
then I wouldn't move there.

627
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:42.730
But I'm just letting you know,
I saw a t shirt,

628
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:45.790
one of the few really truly funny tee shirts when I was in Florida.

629
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.620
It said Florida,
a sunny place for shady people.
You know,
it's Kinda like,

630
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:55.150
you know,
Florida is the Sunny Alaska,
I guess is what I should call it,

631
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.590
where there's a lot of people in Alaska who have some unfinished business down

632
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:02.560
here in the lower 48 if you know what I mean.
Wink,
wink,

633
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.150
a little slap of the nose there.
All right.
There's a lot of people,

634
00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:09.400
la running from things,
you know.

635
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

636
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.600
<v 0>If the skaters don't get them,
then the gators wheel.
What fucking song was that?</v>

637
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:17.740
That just popped in my head.

638
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.210
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

639
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.870
<v 0>Hang down your head.
Tom Dooley.
Was that the one?</v>

640
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.110
Hang down your head and Kai [inaudible] hang on.
I wasn't really,
oh boy.

641
00:39:28.111 --> 00:39:30.910
You're bound to died.
That's funny.

642
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:34.330
Back then you could have like a hit song just talking about somebody who killed

643
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:38.950
a woman and I got hung.
I met her on the metal tin.

644
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.390
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

645
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.560
<v 0>blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Bloom.
Met her around the mouth pin,</v>

646
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.660
stabbed her with Myra.
Man.

647
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:48.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

648
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.100
<v 0>I hang down your head,
Tom Dooley.
That's a song about a hang down your head.</v>

649
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.200
You know,
like,
I'm supposed to feel bad for Tom Dooley.

650
00:39:55.201 --> 00:39:57.030
It's like you fucking killed.
You killed your girlfriend.

651
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.630
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

652
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.530
<v 0>Go Fuck Yourself Tom.
Um,
alright.
Addicted to vagina.</v>

653
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.330
The next one.
Everybody.
How's it going?
The,
it'd be like,
boy,

654
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.750
I'm 22 year old college student.
You're not addicted to vagina.

655
00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:14.510
You're a 22 year old college student.
You're doing what you should be doing.

656
00:40:14.511 --> 00:40:16.520
You don't have an addiction.
All right?

657
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

658
00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:21.160
<v 0>Uh,
what are you,
you're sowing your oats,
whatever the fuck they say.
Um,</v>

659
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.780
I've been seeing this girl for a while.
Nothing serious,

660
00:40:23.781 --> 00:40:26.450
but we've been hooking up on and off for about a year.
All right,

661
00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:30.440
so you've got a side piece.
Nothing wrong with that.
Um,

662
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.790
she's incredible looking.
What the hell?
I,

663
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.960
she has the natural body of a playboy model.

664
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.720
She's the kind of girl who doesn't need makeup.

665
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.660
You're going to keep saying the same thing over and over again.

666
00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:45.600
I'm jealous you son of a bitch.
Um,
she has long,

667
00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:50.440
blonde hair and she's the most amazing fuck that can possibly exist.
Uh,

668
00:40:50.441 --> 00:40:53.250
this is the curse of a guy.
However,
I want to fuck somebody else.
Right?

669
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.020
She's ferocious in bed.

670
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.210
What did she growled at your balls?

671
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.970
Easy Lady Ac.
Um,

672
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.990
and for some reason she thinks we're in the same league.
He goes,
but I hate her.

673
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.310
I hate everything about her.

674
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.140
Every contrived opinion that falls out of her soft,
perfect lips.

675
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.380
Every shitty band she tries to get me to listen to every unfunny air quote joke.

676
00:41:23.491 --> 00:41:28.450
She insist on repeating over and over and over every going to know where stories

677
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:33.150
she spends five hours telling me I hate her.
Oh my God.

678
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.360
Uh,
but I just keep agreeing to,
to see her.

679
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.040
I've manned up and stopped replying to her text messages a few times now and

680
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:44.390
blocked her on Facebook.

681
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.140
But before long she'll send me a text about some nonsense.

682
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.580
The blood will start rushing to my cock and all of a sudden I'm standing next to

683
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:56.660
her again.
It's like a compulsion.
I feel like a heroin addict.

684
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.770
I get laid,

685
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.910
but fucking other girls just feels like drinking non alcoholic beer at this

686
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:02.744
point.

687
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.410
Can I just stop and say a lot of you guys are really good writers like that.

688
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.500
Kansas one was really written really well.
This was great.
Like I would,

689
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:12.950
it's just be,
should be in reader's digest.
They would fuck him,
you know,

690
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:16.220
loosen the belt a little.
Um,
anyways,

691
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.610
what do I do man up and suppress my instincts,

692
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:23.800
throw her out the bedroom window or quit cold Turkey.
Um,

693
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.260
I never missed a podcast.
We'll love to go see you do a Gig in Ireland.

694
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:28.790
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

695
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:31.130
<v 3>okay.</v>

696
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.680
<v 0>What do you do?
Uh,
uh,</v>

697
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.100
you know what I was,
I've never been able to solve that problem,

698
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:40.443
<v 3>you know,</v>

699
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.950
<v 0>because unless you just jerked off,</v>

700
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.800
you know she's going to text you and it's just gonna it's going to be a layup.

701
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.450
And she's like,
guys can't say no to lay up pussy.
We just can't,

702
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.110
you know,
unless way like head over heels in love.

703
00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:58.880
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

704
00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.780
<v 0>And like,</v>

705
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:00.560
<v 3>yeah,</v>

706
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.740
<v 0>I guess,
yeah,
when you meet the right one then he could say no,
but you know what?</v>

707
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:04.790
It still pisses you off.

708
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.033
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

709
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.140
<v 0>Fucking annoys you.
You know why?</v>

710
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.940
Cause like when you're with the person who's supposed to be with and then

711
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.570
somebody throws you a little something and it could fucking happen and you don't

712
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.860
fucking do it.
You come home and you want to get credit for it.

713
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.150
And women go,
why should you get credit for something that you should be doing?

714
00:43:28.151 --> 00:43:32.860
And it's like,
you know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's why.

715
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.500
Because you're not me.
You're not a guy.

716
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.860
And we are literally were designed

717
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.880
to fucking be weak.

718
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.130
So we will fuck you so we could get out of the cave so he could fucking
progress.

719
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.490
So we would procreate.
We or I,
we are wired,

720
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.350
<v 3>wired
to fuck.</v>

721
00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.140
<v 0>This is such a moronic fucker.
Podcasts.
I love it.
Um,</v>

722
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:08.020
all right,
so what should you do?
All right,
well ultimately in life,

723
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.180
what do you want to be married to the woman or your dreams or some girl who's

724
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.920
ferocious in bed at all?
And,

725
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.320
but you fucking can't stand everything that comes out of her mouth.

726
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:21.010
You got to get rid of this girl.
All right.
It's not going to get any better.

727
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.090
You did it a zillion times.
All right?
You got to go cold Turkey.

728
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.490
You got to cut her off.
All right.

729
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.610
Cause what's going to happen is if you stay with her and then he ended up

730
00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:31.950
fucking feelings for her.

731
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.010
She might fuck you over and you'd have loved it to begin with.

732
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:36.540
Or you get married to her and then,

733
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.690
then the fucking looks go away and then you just whip this fucking idiot who

734
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:40.471
can't tell a joke,

735
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:44.650
can't tell stories and listens to shitty music and eventually a,

736
00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.960
you're going to pull a Phil Spector I,
that's what I'm going,

737
00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:48.450
you know your hair's going to be all over the place.

738
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.910
You can stick a gun in her mouth.
There's going to be horrible.

739
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.620
You don't want to do that.
All right.
I would.
Um,

740
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.260
<v 3>okay.</v>

741
00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.350
<v 0>What is hard though is you're saying she's so good at bed that it makes all the</v>

742
00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:04.220
other girls seem like non alcoholic beer.
Well,
you know,
that's one of the,

743
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.870
that's one of the dangers of going out and living life is a,

744
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.450
<v 3>okay,</v>

745
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.820
<v 0>people will never leave their hometown.
They just fucking stay there.</v>

746
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:17.940
They don't know what the fuck they're missing.
So they can actually,
in a way,

747
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.613
you know,

748
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.180
live a happier existence just by not fucking knowing the fact is now,

749
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.260
you know,
you know a level

750
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.570
<v 3>yeah.</v>

751
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.750
<v 0>Of A,
of banging that you didn't know before.</v>

752
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:34.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

753
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.160
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

754
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.380
uh,
you're in trouble.

755
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.213
<v 3>No Sir.</v>

756
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.820
<v 0>I can tell you this,
you know,
just standing outside of it,
listening to it,</v>

757
00:45:48.821 --> 00:45:50.920
you got to get rid of her.
You can't stand or just get rid of it.

758
00:45:50.921 --> 00:45:55.510
You just fucking her.
Eventually those tits are going to fucking sag.
Um,

759
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.110
but that was that mouse still going to work.
Okay.
And when she's not blowing you,

760
00:45:59.111 --> 00:46:03.160
she's going to be telling you awful stories so you know what you need to do.
Um,

761
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:08.080
so there you go.
I would just man up and get rid of it.
And it's,
it's like,

762
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:11.470
I don't know,
the longer you get away from it,
you know,

763
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:17.350
here's a great thing.
You know what
I dunno.
Mixed time.

764
00:46:17.351 --> 00:46:21.520
You fucking rub one out.
Think of her immediately afterwards.
All right.

765
00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:25.240
And that's going to be your true fucking feeling about her.
All right.

766
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.660
Facebook messages a day.
Billy,

767
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.420
I need your help dealing with the girlfriend issue.

768
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.110
I have been seeing my lady since December.

769
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.550
I'm 30 and she is 27.
That's a good fucking age difference.
I like it.

770
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.160
She lived in the city and I lived in the country.

771
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.260
We started as a long distance relationship,

772
00:46:47.261 --> 00:46:50.680
but it got serious quickly and now she has moved back home.

773
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.030
Um,
she's,
what is this fucking green acres?

774
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:56.783
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

775
00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:58.933
<v 0>Um,</v>

776
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.020
she is busy buying her own house but has stayed with me for the last two weeks.

777
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.180
We've talked about me moving in with her.

778
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.610
We tell each other I love you and we're making plans for the future,
et Cetera,

779
00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:11.444
et cetera.

780
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.810
So today I log onto my computer in her Facebook page is still logged in.

781
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:21.610
Oh,
this is a whole new world man.
The Facebook thing,

782
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.220
uh,
me being a curious creep,
I started snooping in the message section.

783
00:47:27.221 --> 00:47:32.050
I find a conversations she's had with former boyfriend on February 1st she tells

784
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:36.070
the guy,
I still miss your face done.
It's over.

785
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.223
Walk away,

786
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.900
walk away like Deniro and he just fucking get up and walk out.

787
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.940
It's over.
I don't need,
I don't even need to read the rest of this sir.

788
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.710
It is fucking over.

789
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:52.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

790
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.800
<v 0>But I'll keep reading it just cause I have to fill up an hour here.</v>

791
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.990
But I know you know the people listen and know.
Um,

792
00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.800
anyways he goes,
I don't see any response from the guy.
Then on February,

793
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:10.190
February 11th,
she trolls out another message.

794
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:13.820
I love how now you're stalking her Facebook page as well.
You should,

795
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.860
you had probable cause you never did know you were,

796
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.700
you were a creep and then you find,
you know what,

797
00:48:19.701 --> 00:48:23.090
this one stand up in court court cause you didn't have a war,
but you know what?

798
00:48:23.091 --> 00:48:27.980
You got instinct and you can't teach that.
Uh,
anyways,

799
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.350
she trolls out another message that say,
hope all is well and again,

800
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:38.090
no response.
Yeah,
dude,
she's settling for you.
I hate to tell you that,

801
00:48:38.091 --> 00:48:42.290
but she's settling for you.
What she's trying to do is,

802
00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:46.860
is if this mother fucker goes,
you know,
I miss your face too.
She's out.

803
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.300
All right?
But if he doesn't,
he doesn't get back to her.

804
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.540
She's going to settle for you.

805
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:56.740
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.630
<v 0>Okay.
And I'm not saying you're a bad person,</v>

807
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:01.240
I'm just saying the feeling isn't there.
She's settling few,

808
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.760
which means the entire time you're fucking marriage,

809
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.800
every time you're not looking at her,

810
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.320
she's just going to be staring at the back of your head,

811
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.010
looking at your dumb shoulders.
Something just going like,

812
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.170
how the fuck did I end up with?
How did I fuck that other one up?
You know,

813
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.760
you don't want to be that.
You got to get somebody as crazy about you.
Anyways,

814
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:23.770
here we go.
There was some previous,

815
00:49:23.771 --> 00:49:28.450
somewhat explicit messages they sent back and forth before we got together and

816
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:32.710
messages about how they should text instead of Facebook.
All that being said,

817
00:49:32.711 --> 00:49:37.030
she is good.
Tell.
All that being said,
however,
everybody,
uh,

818
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.950
she is good to me.
I'm good to her and we have fun,
a fun,
loving relationship.

819
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.640
I had solid trust and now I'm very confused.

820
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.400
How should I approach her with this?

821
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.350
I know if I keep it to myself,
it's going to fester and really pissed me off.

822
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.650
Would you head for the hills immediately or give the relationship a chance?

823
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:58.750
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
This is what I would do.

824
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.820
I would be a hundred percent honest with them.
Say,
listen,

825
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:08.290
I gotta be honest with you.
Uh,
what the fuck is today?
The 18th,

826
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:09.490
about a month and a half ago,

827
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.880
I want to use the computer and your Facebook page was open and even though I

828
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:16.870
shouldn't have looked,
I did look.

829
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.440
And then she's going to start crying and she's going to start fucking,

830
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:23.500
she's going to turn a fucking cap around backwards and getting your face and

831
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:26.890
start screaming and yelling.
But blahblahblahblahblah fuck all of that.

832
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.130
Fuck all of that.

833
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.400
She's going to come at you like that cause she knows what's coming.

834
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:32.853
<v 3>All right.</v>

835
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:39.600
<v 0>And don't get mad.
Don't take the fucking bay.
This is the time,</v>

836
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:42.900
sir.
You have to hang onto your fucking emotion.

837
00:50:42.901 --> 00:50:46.770
She's going to cry or she's going to yell or she's going to do both cause she

838
00:50:46.771 --> 00:50:48.780
knows what the f how could you do?

839
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:53.460
Well you didn't trust me anyways in the bed,
the bed,
the bed,
you know,

840
00:50:53.461 --> 00:50:56.160
and you don't have the line that they have where they just,
you know,

841
00:50:56.161 --> 00:50:59.760
female intuition,
they,
they get to hide behind that.
You know,
like,

842
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.010
like guys don't have any fucking instincts.

843
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.100
Like we weren't blessed with any of that.
You know,

844
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:10.130
fucking chasing down saber tooth tigers were sharpened sticks like we weren't,

845
00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:12.870
we weren't blessed with that.
He sorta instinct,
give me a fucking break.

846
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.270
All right,
so anyway,

847
00:51:16.271 --> 00:51:19.680
she's going to cry or she's going to yell or she's going to do fucking both.

848
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.070
And you just stand there and you let her do it.

849
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.653
<v 3>All right?</v>

850
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:30.720
<v 0>And when she's done yelling and crying or whatever the fuck it is,
just say,
yeah.</v>

851
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.470
And I saw a message that you wrote to an old boyfriend saying,

852
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.910
I still miss your face.
You know,

853
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.450
and then you tried to contact them again on the 11th.

854
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:47.280
And it's been bugging me and I did want to bring this up to you because I didn't

855
00:51:47.281 --> 00:51:50.760
want to look like a creep and I didn't want to hurt your feelings that I don't

856
00:51:50.761 --> 00:51:52.440
trust you.
But um,

857
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.090
you obviously still have feelings for this person

858
00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:01.050
then I guess you're settling for me.
Like if this guy doesn't get back to you,

859
00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:03.930
then you're going to move forward with and settle for me.

860
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:08.310
And that's not what I want.
I want someone who's crazy about me.

861
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.650
It doesn't have other issues.
You,

862
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.660
you seem to have unresolved stuff with this guy and um,
you know,

863
00:52:15.661 --> 00:52:19.920
I'm not getting any younger so
you know,

864
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.430
and then she,
yeah,
back it up with me,
but bed,
the bed,
the bed,

865
00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:25.590
all this shit and just keep going.
Listen,

866
00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:30.090
this is a face that you miss,
sweetheart.
Ed,
it's not mine.

867
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:37.170
You know,
sir,

868
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.740
take your heart and stick it on the fucking nightstand and go into your brain.

869
00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.730
All right.
Get some self esteem here.

870
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.470
This is fucking bullshit.

871
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.513
<v 3>All right.</v>

872
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:54.170
<v 0>All that being said.
She's good to me.
She's not good to you.</v>

873
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.550
Not 100%

874
00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.073
<v 3>all right.</v>

875
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:05.310
<v 0>I'm telling you.
Get out of it.
Get out of it.
Fuck that.</v>

876
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:10.650
All right.
Did I make myself clear?
All right.
Next one,
Ufo.

877
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.420
Dude,
my question is in here somewhere.
Oh,
for fuck's sakes,

878
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.390
I got to read all of this.
Brace yourselves.
Everybody did.
I did.

879
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.081
I tell you guys,

880
00:53:22.081 --> 00:53:27.081
I fucking got on the God damn scale and I'm 185 I was all the way down to 170

881
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:30.450
lbs.
I've I fucking,
I was too skinny then.

882
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:33.810
I should have been like [inaudible] 72 that's my fighting weight.
I've put on,

883
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:36.990
I put on 13 fucking pounds.
I take it you don't,

884
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:41.130
you know what's the dumbest thing you can do is when you don't want to get on

885
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:43.590
the scale,
you know,
like I should get on the scale.

886
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:45.510
Good now don't cause I don't want to know that.

887
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:50.190
Do you just signing yourself off to another fucking 10 fucking pounds had a

888
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.950
waffle,
which in Wisconsin,
what the fuck was I thinking?

889
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:57.690
I was on that crack again.
I was hitting the pipe.
I was doing the sugar,
salt,

890
00:53:57.691 --> 00:54:02.670
fucking arm wrestle,
you know,
Chanel,
I gotta I gotta go.

891
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:04.440
I gotta go run the fucking stairs now.

892
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.980
I did that to myself because I hit a fucking waffle,

893
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:12.480
which in grand rapids fucking with,
uh,
Michigan

894
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.640
wasn't just a waffle,
which I had McDonald's twice.
You know,

895
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.920
why did I have Mcdonald's?
I Dunno.
I Dunno why I did.

896
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.890
I went drives like,
you know what,

897
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.780
I haven't had one of those in a while and I fucking,
you know,
hit the pipe again.

898
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.280
Had that,
I started drinking Miller high life and a fucking cat.

899
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:39.720
They had the talls right down the street and it became like this ritual.

900
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:44.240
I watch a hockey game.
I throw back a tall [inaudible],
hey,
hey man,

901
00:54:44.241 --> 00:54:45.480
be that up to,
next thing you know,

902
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:49.200
I'm having one a period and then I'm looking down at my stomach and I'm going

903
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:53.970
like that.
Really?
Come on.
This isn't,
Hey,
I'm all right.

904
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.920
I had a banana for breakfast,
right?
I'm fun,
asshole fucking asshole.

905
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.780
Hey piece of cake yesterday,
it had green frosting.
The fuck is wrong with me.

906
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.760
What am I doing?
You know
what,
what,
what am I going to bottom out?

907
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.720
So I bought him out.
So now I'm back.
I'm down to about a buck 82.

908
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.590
I've dropped like a couple,
two or three pounds and uh,

909
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:21.620
you know,
uh,
just fucking moron.
You don't,
I'm like,

910
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.180
I'm like Bill Clinton before the heart attack,
up and down,

911
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:27.180
up and down with the fucking wait.
All right,
you are folks,
dude,

912
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:28.620
my question is in here somewhere.

913
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.730
I am nowhere near a conspiracy freak or anything like that,
but I do admit,

914
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.190
I get a hard on for any documentary on that secret military base in Nevada that

915
00:55:37.191 --> 00:55:41.190
is called area 51 the government is suppose,
well,
I mean,

916
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:46.440
believe in aliens like
I have,
like,
I don't know that,

917
00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:49.170
that's really not that crazy.

918
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:57.090
You know what you,
you think like how big the fucking universities,

919
00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:02.580
that's just life on one planet.
No life anywhere else.

920
00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:06.660
Despite the fact that they see evidence of water on Mars at some point,

921
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.050
you know,
I'm telling you guys would not that special

922
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.970
if you're God and you made the whole university the,
I'm just going to sit back,

923
00:56:15.971 --> 00:56:20.740
watch in one fucking planet.
Maybe that's why the earth is so fucked up.

924
00:56:20.741 --> 00:56:23.410
I don't think he's been watching us for the last couple thousand was the last

925
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:27.290
time he reached out.
Reach out,
reach out and freak out.

926
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.960
Right?

927
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.080
When's the last time he fucking did that was the last time he fucking was in a

928
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:34.030
burning Bush going,
hey,
hey,
you're there.

929
00:56:34.031 --> 00:56:37.900
You're there with the long fucking curvy stick next to the sheep.
Come over here.

930
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.590
Come over to the burning Bush.
You know,
when's the last time we did that?

931
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.600
I think he's been watching another earth.
I'm flipping through the channels,

932
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:50.560
you know?
Can you imagine how clear his fucking,

933
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:53.350
how big do you think God's Flatscreen TV is?

934
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:58.450
How clear is that picture?
I bet even if you make it to heaven,

935
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.720
you know,
you don't even get to see it.

936
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.280
Like he comes out of his office and he try to peek in real quick and like the

937
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:10.870
human eye you get just,
it's just too much of a fucking glare.
Right.
Um,

938
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:16.620
so anyways,
yeah.
If you believe in aliens,
I mean,
I mean,
I don't know that,
that,

939
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:20.240
that we can reach one another,
you know,

940
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:24.790
that whole flying saucer fucking oh shit.
Okay.
I mean,

941
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.420
how long can you go with,
with artificial breathe,
you know,

942
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:32.320
some sort of atmosphere in there.
I was like on Star Trek,

943
00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:35.200
I mean they just had this limitless supply of fucking oxygen.

944
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:36.653
<v 5>Oh,</v>

945
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:45.480
<v 0>just fucking flying through space.
Now look at them.</v>

946
00:57:45.481 --> 00:57:47.670
They landed on a lot of planets set at oxygen.

947
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:49.840
They would just land on these planets and they just had oxygen.

948
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:52.330
And I think what they did was they opened the day,

949
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.310
landed the star ship enterprise and they just opened the windows and they got

950
00:57:56.311 --> 00:57:59.280
some more oxygen and then they flew away.
Right.
Isn't that how it works?

951
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.230
Anyways?
Uh,

952
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.830
the government supposedly is housing and researching crashed Ufos and uses

953
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:11.220
deadly force to keep regular people out.

954
00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.930
Do you have any opinion on the subject?
I think I just said,
I mean,
I don't,

955
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:20.700
fuck do I think they actually have the bodies of aliens?
Um,

956
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:27.120
did you realize like the level of secrecy you would have to have if you actually

957
00:58:27.121 --> 00:58:29.910
had that shit?
That would be like one of the things before they went in the room.

958
00:58:29.911 --> 00:58:30.744
It's like,
okay,

959
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:35.550
we're going to let you in this room and you got to understand when you go in

960
00:58:35.551 --> 00:58:35.971
this room,

961
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:39.570
the doors closing and you're never getting out because you're going to see some

962
00:58:39.571 --> 00:58:43.380
fucking shit in here that I don't give a fuck.
You're not.

963
00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:47.770
If you have one shot a Nyquil,
you're,
you're going to be blabbering about it.

964
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.410
Did you can't do it.
So I,
I don't,
I don't know.

965
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:57.480
I don't fucking know.
Um,
anyways,
he goes,
what is your bullshit meter say?

966
00:58:57.481 --> 00:59:01.080
I think there's way too much of a veil of secrecy around the place to think

967
00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:04.710
otherwise.
I used to know someone who was a career air force pilot.

968
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.880
Whenever the subject of that base or those mysterious for flights,

969
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.840
Smith's series lights over Phoenix scene in 1997 kicking up,

970
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:17.910
he completely removed himself from the conversation.
Uh,
those mysterious lights,

971
00:59:17.911 --> 00:59:19.740
I don't even know what you're talking about for all,
you know,

972
00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:23.690
that just testing some psycho fucking weaponry.

973
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.880
You know,
early morning the new Yankee stadium came out in like,

974
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.050
oh eight or o nine and they will like,
we have 2013 technology.

975
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:34.460
All right?

976
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:39.460
If those fucking morons that run that place can have shit that we're not going

977
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:43.250
to have,
you know,
they can be four or five years ahead of us.

978
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.960
Can you imagine what the government is?

979
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:46.360
<v 3>Okay?</v>

980
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:51.160
<v 0>I mean,
they got to have shit from like,
I dunno,
2014 I have no fucking idea.</v>

981
00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.250
I don't know.
Anyways,
he says,
quite frankly,

982
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.910
the evenings lapse would end right after the topic was brought up.

983
00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:02.360
I believe in life outside of our universe to think that we human and Oliver's

984
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.560
inhabit.
And so the only life anywhere is just plain ignorant.

985
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:08.110
I 100% agree with that.
Uh,

986
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:12.520
I'm sure you've heard stories about President Nixon secretly showing you FO's in

987
01:00:12.521 --> 01:00:15.970
aliens to his favorite comedian Jackie Gleason.
Uhh,

988
01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:20.320
that's a complete crock of shit.
Uh,
what would you like?
He's going to do that.

989
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.870
All right.
Now I'm know I'm not supposed to show you the

990
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.710
Arrow way we call it was a bad Nixon impression right there.
Um,

991
01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.410
what would happen if you were shown some stuff like that?

992
01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.340
I imagine I would immediately be microchipped or shot in the back of the fucking

993
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.950
head.
Would you tell about it?

994
01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:41.560
I would want to know about that.

995
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.990
That if I actually found out about that,

996
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:51.200
it would blow my fucking mind.
I,

997
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:53.840
you know what it is?
Look,
maybe the,

998
01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:56.360
maybe your Air Force Guy Buddy that has seen some,

999
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:59.390
because I would say that like all converse.
No,
but you know what?

1000
01:00:59.391 --> 01:01:01.130
He laughs right up until that moment.

1001
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.380
If he wasn't laughing at all throughout all your conversation,
then I would,

1002
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:09.710
I would believe it more because I know if I knew some shit like that.

1003
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1004
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:15.290
<v 0>And then I would sit there and listening to people talking about God and Holy</v>

1005
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:18.780
Shit that we believe down here that didn't include aliens.
I would,

1006
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:23.050
I would feel like a fucking alien cause that would be like,
ah,
yeah,

1007
01:01:23.051 --> 01:01:24.070
we're just a speck of dust.

1008
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.940
They are people and there's all this other stuff out there.
And uh,

1009
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:34.840
yeah,
I mean it would drive me nuts after awhile.
Um,
yeah,
no,

1010
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:39.430
I'm not cut out for that fucking,
uh,
the kind of secrets I can keep our like,
uh,

1011
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.613
<v 3>you know,</v>

1012
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.730
<v 0>you know,
it stays in the locker room kind of shit.</v>

1013
01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.653
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1014
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.530
<v 0>You live your life or you want to fucking live your life,
you know,</v>

1015
01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.770
and until like if you're a look,

1016
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:58.130
if you porn shit until the water supply,
you know,

1017
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.360
if you're doing stuff like that,

1018
01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:03.530
if you fucking vandalizing the neighborhood I live in,
then go fuck yourself.

1019
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:07.970
All right.
But you know,
the other bullshit,
I looked the other way,
but if the,

1020
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:12.220
if I knew there was fucking aliens,
yeah,
no,

1021
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.530
look,
I'm too fucking stupid.
There's no way they would tell it to me.

1022
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.160
If I was in the air force,
how far to the air force would think I would get?

1023
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:21.660
You think I'd get anywhere beyond the guy with the two sticks guide in the

1024
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:26.560
fucking plane.
And you know,
I don't know.
Anyway,

1025
01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:30.750
she says Black Hawks First Bruins for the 2013 Stanley Cup hawks and five,

1026
01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.460
maybe six.
Uh,
I don't see us making the Stanley Cup finals.

1027
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.660
I hate to say that unless we make a trade.
I know we're looking for Alfredson,

1028
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.030
but I don't know who we're going to give up for him.
But,
uh,

1029
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:48.050
I saw a gap between us and the,

1030
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.850
uh,
the Pittsburgh Penguins.

1031
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:56.310
I'd be interested to see how those are some of the other teams.

1032
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:58.170
I'm going to start watching the penguins.

1033
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.560
I'm waiting to see when they play the Canadians,

1034
01:03:00.561 --> 01:03:02.910
cause I want to see if the Canadians are as good as a record because if fucking

1035
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:07.470
killing it right now,
they really are.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

1036
01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:12.240
that almost made me stop Rudy for GSP when the crowd started going Ole,
Ole,
Ole,

1037
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:12.811
Ole,

1038
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:15.900
and the only thing that saved me was he had the Quebec Nordiques fucking tattoo

1039
01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:18.840
on the back of his cab.
So I'm like,
all right,
this guy fucking,

1040
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.690
he likes the avalanche.
All right.

1041
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Balinski many times you said we're all doing because of overpopulation,

1042
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.500
but it's actually the opposite.

1043
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:33.120
We are doomed because people are not having enough children.
Oh,

1044
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.260
<v 6>Gj</v>

1045
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.910
<v 0>okay.
From a,
Oh,
Jesus.</v>

1046
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.710
Did you join a cult,
sir?
All right.
You know what?
I'll,
I'll go along with this.

1047
01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:48.980
The following article discusses what I'm talking about.
We'll,

1048
01:03:48.981 --> 01:03:52.790
I'll put this link up on the podcast page for everybody to read.
Essentially,

1049
01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.980
America's fertility rate is declining,

1050
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:59.240
meaning the population will get older and older as it also shrinks,

1051
01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:03.920
meaning more healthcare costs and fewer reasons for businesses to innovate and

1052
01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:06.170
provide better products.
Also,

1053
01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:10.100
global population growth is slowing to a halt and we'll begin to shrink within

1054
01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:14.720
60 years.
Uh,
I don't know where you're getting your stats from serve,

1055
01:04:14.721 --> 01:04:16.640
but uh,
okay.

1056
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:18.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1057
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:22.800
<v 0>Low fertility societies don't innovate because their incentives for</v>

1058
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:27.210
consumption's tilt overwhelmingly toward healthcare.

1059
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.900
They don't invest aggressively because the average age skewing higher and

1060
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:34.590
capital shifts to preserving their epidemic.
But don't put that,
but apathy,
Sarah,

1061
01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:37.470
you would addressing,
are you ever going to address what the environment?

1062
01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:39.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1063
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.360
<v 0>Are you going to address what we've done to the environment or are you one of</v>

1064
01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:46.950
those people who believes that 7 billion people on this planet.
Okay.

1065
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:49.200
And that horse shit out there in the Pacific Ocean,

1066
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:55.010
that's fucking two and a half times the size of Texas and two miles deep that's

1067
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.420
swirling pile of trash out there.

1068
01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:03.970
We put a fucking hole in the ozone layer,
okay?
Less people

1069
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:09.190
as far as for the survival of humanity.
Okay?

1070
01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:13.160
Fuck all selling widgets and all of that.
Horseshit and whole.

1071
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.810
Everybody's going to be on the iron lung if we don't have any babies.

1072
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.530
Um,
a bunch of people need to die.

1073
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:25.510
They need the die off.
There's way too many fucking people.

1074
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:29.650
There's only so much fresh water.
There's only so much natural resources.

1075
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.650
There's only so much fish you can pull out of the ocean.

1076
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.520
There's only so much fucking shit you can throw in the ocean before.

1077
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:40.110
There's that tipping point,
tipping point.
Um,

1078
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.580
what you're sending me,
sir,
is not facts.
What you're sending me as an angle.

1079
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:50.860
This is this guys and I will read this angle,
okay?

1080
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:57.190
But what I love is that someone has written that,
that you know,
um,

1081
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.360
overpopulation,

1082
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:01.860
you're like many times you said that we're all doing because of overpopulation,

1083
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:05.650
but it's actually the opposite.
What?
Cause this guy says so.

1084
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:09.430
So the other smart people that read the road,
those other studies,

1085
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:13.600
they're immediately all full of shit because this other guy said this,

1086
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:18.040
you know,
did you read the shit that I read?
Cause I'll read your thing.

1087
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.740
But um,
I think the problem is,

1088
01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:25.320
is that human beings will never stop believing that we're,

1089
01:06:25.321 --> 01:06:30.321
we're fucking important and that we're made in God's image and all that other

1090
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:33.130
fucking ego maniac shit.

1091
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:34.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1092
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.160
<v 0>That eventually causes you to have fucking eight kids and go out and buy two</v>

1093
01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:42.210
flat screen fucking TVS.
The solution,
sir,

1094
01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:44.670
is not more people.
Okay.

1095
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1096
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:51.270
<v 0>I mean,
think about it.
What,
what,
where are we doomed?</v>

1097
01:06:51.271 --> 01:06:55.230
Back in the day,
a thousand years ago,
what was the world population then?

1098
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.730
Where are we doomed?
We somehow survived.

1099
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.770
How will we not going to survive,
sir?
Because of these healthcare costs.

1100
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:08.190
We have a national debt that we're never going to fucking pay.

1101
01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.900
We're still all going to work every day.

1102
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.570
People still have apples in their mouths when they want them.

1103
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:15.510
I don't understand what the fuck you saying.

1104
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.320
The greatest thing that could happen for the possible,

1105
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:24.470
I believe for the survival of humanity is if there was way less of us,

1106
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.990
way,
fucking less way,
way,
way,
fucking less.

1107
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.061
All right,

1108
01:07:30.061 --> 01:07:34.620
and if you somehow were able to weed out sociopath's along the fucking way and

1109
01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:38.040
selfish cons,
I think if you just weeded out sociopath's and selfish cons,

1110
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.660
you'd have the right number on this planet

1111
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.020
and I think it would be under seven figures.

1112
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.740
Whatever,
sir,
I'm just fucking with you.
I'll,
I'll read your,
your,

1113
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.450
I read your shit.
You know,

1114
01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.420
but don't come at me like you fucking know what you're talking about any more

1115
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:58.580
than I do cause you read some stupid article.
All right.
Um,

1116
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.070
I love how it's all based around business.

1117
01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:05.250
Low fertility societies don't innovate because their incentives for

1118
01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:07.800
consumption's tilt overwhelmingly towards health care.

1119
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.670
Uh,
I don't,
I don't,
I just in philosophy,

1120
01:08:14.671 --> 01:08:18.860
I just believe in it whatsoever.
All right?
But I am a moron,

1121
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.270
but I think I'm smarter than you because I could admit that.
All right,

1122
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:26.210
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.
Uh,

They kicked me a little bit of money for whatever you buy.

project.
