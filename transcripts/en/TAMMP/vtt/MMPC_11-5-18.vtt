1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.110
Okay.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.000
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.300
Is Bill Burns time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,
November 5th,

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.300
2018 what's going on?
How are you?
Oh,
that's phenomenal.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.340
Isn't that wonderful?
Hey everybody,
I don't know if you've heard,

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.330
I don't know if you've been on a TV or near a TV.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.540
I don't know if few stream your thoughts at this point through some sort of

8
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:29.970
algorithm on a world wide network.
Um,

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.340
I don't know if you've heard this is for Americans only by the way,

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.640
people from the United States of America,
everybody else,
you know,

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.440
if you're in Australia,

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.370
just go stick a beat on something and fucking eat it during this time.
All right.

13
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:48.260
Cause this has nothing to do with you and that giant fucking

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.750
<v 1>Can have a what?
Foster's lager,</v>

16
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.420
whatever the fuck it is that in any you constrict down there,

17
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.990
that's why you stick it in a little fucking powder keg.

18
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.370
Like he just trying to get rid of it,
sending it our way.
Right.
Um,

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.490
that beer,
that's the Busch light of Australia anyways.
I've never had one.

20
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.090
I just judge it by the size of the can am like offsets that fucking good way.

21
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.570
You've given away by the bucketful anyways

22
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.790
for the people that this podcast truly represents.

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.140
And that would be the greatest people on this planet,

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
the people of the United States of America.
Um,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.600
particularly the white people.
I'm fucking with you.

26
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.510
I'm going off Trump on here.
Sorry,
I'm reading a Trump speech.
Um,

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.750
it's a first draft of a Trump speech.
Um,
evidently tomorrow,

28
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.530
and I didn't know this,
I don't know if you're aware of this,

29
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:54.531
but I was not aware that tomorrow is evidently a very important day in politics,

30
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.410
quite Moslem way,
the most important

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.350
political day in history.
And you know something I had no idea,

32
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:09.351
but thank God all of these celebrities have taken time out of their day to let

33
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.040
me know how important it is.
You know what I mean?

34
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Just when you think of celebrity cannot give more of themselves on screen after

35
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.170
they'd been driven over in a golf cart and add their fucking hair foof to buy

36
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:29.640
some fucking poor bastard in a trailer,
right.
Food to Poof,

37
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.650
whatever the fuck it is.
Thank God you know something.

38
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:36.651
And I've been so inspired by all of these celebrities letting me know what is

39
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.530
going on in my country.
You know what I mean?
Why would I listen to,
to,

40
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.410
to people who I don't know are in that business for a living.

41
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:50.670
Why would I listen to them when I can listen to somebody who's on a sitcom?

42
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

43
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.890
<v 1>And you know what?
I've been so inspired.
I actually think that going to,
uh,</v>

44
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.450
I'm going to you.
Oh,
look who just calling in here.
Little facetime here.

45
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.170
My kiddo.
Hey Buddy.
Hi.

46
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.700
Hi.
Hey Amy.
I'm doing the podcast.

47
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.720
I'm lily recording right now.
You guys are on the podcast.

48
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.840
<v 2>Say Hi Dada.</v>

49
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.510
<v 1>Hi Sweetheart.
Hey.
Do you know tomorrow's a very important election day?</v>

50
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.120
<v 2>I did.
I'd be getting text messages round the clock about it.</v>

51
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.710
<v 1>I had no idea.
And then somebody,</v>

52
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.780
uh,
well,
the third lead in a x man movie,

53
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.900
let me know that I need to get out there and vote.

54
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.060
<v 2>I got an email from an actor as well.</v>

55
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.540
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know why they're doing that.</v>

56
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.740
I have a bad feeling that it's going to drive it the other way.
I was just in,

57
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.850
I was just in a a car service coming over from the airport and the guy goes,

58
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.270
I'm voting all red tomorrow.
All red.

59
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.000
All right.
I gotta get back to the podcast.
I'll see you guys later.
Bye Buddy.

60
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.930
Bye Sweetheart.
All right,
I'll see you in a minute.
Okay.

61
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.610
Um,
yeah.
Anyway,
so I think I'm going to do,

62
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.640
I am going to loan my podcast celebrity to try and inspire some of you to get

63
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.840
out there tomorrow.
Get out there and vote.

64
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.610
And when I say vote,

65
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.900
I don't mean go out and decide who you think is the right candidate.

66
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.280
I want you to go out there and vote.
Who for who?

67
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.820
I want you to vote for.
Okay.

68
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.880
I'm loaning my podcast celebrity and I feel like more so than that,

69
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.560
I'm actually going to be honest with you

70
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.120
as a person in your public ears rather than just being like trying to be like

71
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:57.840
non,
you know,

72
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.600
committal here and just say get out there and vote.
I want you to vote.
Who,

73
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.820
who I want you to vote for.
Okay?
I don't know who to vote for him.
Maybe.

74
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.700
Maybe somebody that hosted game show could tell me.

75
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.790
I watch CNN and Fox News all the time.
I'm informed.

76
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.570
I read the Sunday New York Times.
Shut up.

77
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.510
Jesus.
Do these fucking people understand that there's,

78
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:33.020
there's engineers and doctors,

79
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.280
you know I'm too stupid to name another smart job.
Veterinarian.

80
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.040
The guy who knows how to hook up your fucking cable.
I mean,

81
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.010
these are smart people.
They know it's an important fucking election.

82
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.030
They know who they're voting for.
All right?

83
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.780
I got a bad feeling that they're going to get this wrong.

84
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:54.350
The same way they got the election wrong.
You know,

85
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.660
I actually think that have celebrities wanted this blue wave.

86
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.950
They should shut up

87
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
because do you know people who are on the red side are also watching this shit?

88
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680
It's like you're broadcasting to the Japanese during World War Two when you're

89
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.660
going to attack,
why would you do that?
You gotta get on your own frequency,

90
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.223
<v 0>right?</v>

91
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.430
<v 1>Oh,
who should I vote for?</v>

92
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.210
Maybe two near row could tell me,

93
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.540
hey,
I like that guy's movies.
Maybe I like his political choices.

94
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.253
<v 0>MMM.</v>

95
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.390
<v 1>Do you remember back in the day when you just,
you know,</v>

96
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.320
you didn't bring up politics and you didn't bring up religion and you sat there

97
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.980
and you hate your fucking cheese sandwich,
you know,

98
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:53.460
and you just said that was it.
Every fucking,

99
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.500
you know,
you got to get out there and vote.
And by vote,

100
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:01.370
I mean vote who I'm going to vote for.
Oh my God,

101
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.990
what is wrong with this country?

102
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.870
How come everybody doesn't see it the way I see it?

103
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.210
Anyways,
having said that,
I usually vote,

104
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.180
but I'm going to be here in New York and I didn't file for the absentee thing,

105
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.773
<v 0>you know?</v>

106
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.300
<v 1>So whoever's not liking this should be happy that I just cancelled out my vote,</v>

107
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.263
<v 0>you know,</v>

108
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.600
<v 1>and one of the most important elections of all time.</v>

109
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.460
And you know why it's important because the same five corporations that have the

110
00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:36.270
money on all the horses in the race this time decided to just put it on one side

111
00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:37.320
of the ball evidently.

112
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.640
So we will move towards a more prosperous future for the middle class

113
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.990
because someone's finally going to have to regulate the banks again.

114
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.510
Is that what we're voting for?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Hey,
you know what,

115
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.680
I'm going to loan,

116
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.440
I'm going to loan my podcast celebrity right now and I'm going to solve the

117
00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:09.450
problems of the Middle East right now.
First thing I would do,

118
00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:11.850
I would go over there.
I would tell everybody to grow up.

119
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.453
<v 0>Okay.</v>

120
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.540
<v 1>As far as I can tell you all worship the same thing.
Um,
no,</v>

121
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.960
this is what I would do.
I would,
I would,
uh,

122
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.800
I would break up with Iraq as the first thing I would do.

123
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.210
I would just sit down and just say,
listen,
I wreck,
I'm not happy.

124
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.460
This isn't working out.
I know,
I know.

125
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.450
I came in like gang busters.

126
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.860
I moved in within a week with this just whole relationship,

127
00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:48.720
just moved way too quickly.
All right.
And I just,

128
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.900
you know,
it's not the I,
I love you,

129
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.720
but I don't love you in a way that makes me want to stay.

130
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.430
And I would just get the fuck out.

131
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.070
We can keep this Starbucks and all these fucking things,
right?
All right,

132
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.040
switch over to solar power.
I would do all of this on the same day.
By the way,

133
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.150
in my world,
you can actually do this.
Switch over to solar power.

134
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.990
Take that lunatic over a Tesla.
You know

135
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.960
d,
uh,
he looks like the guy,
Ian Mcshane,

136
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.630
if he had a nervous breakdown or so,
I don't know what the fuck that fucking guy,

137
00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:36.830
right?
I would just all electric all the fucking time,

138
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.653
right?

139
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.660
I'd have a big campaign where I bring back the electric slide and everybody

140
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:47.270
fucking enough mouth breathers would do it and they would get behind it and then

141
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.500
we're not no more money to the Middle East.
All right,
for oil.

142
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.780
Then they'd all go bankrupt and the second we leave,

143
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:56.720
they go back to kicking the shit out of each other.
You know what I mean?

144
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.500
The same way,
when Russia left Eastern Europe,

145
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.190
everybody was happy for about three days and they all started killing each other

146
00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:07.040
again.
They were like,
oh yeah,
where,
where are we?
That's right.

147
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.880
God said we're better.
Right.
And they just went right back to that shit.

148
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.010
So you leave.
Yeah,

149
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.070
you got to look fucking solar power and all that fucking shit going on.

150
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.770
I don't know if he knows about the Middle East.

151
00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:20.230
Middle East always reminded me of,

152
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.240
there was used to be this store in the South Shore Plaza that I used to go to

153
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:26.900
before they did the remodel.

154
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.050
You know when it was all brown and seventies looking,
I swear to God,

155
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:36.830
I think the floor was made out of vinyl.
It was some sort of rubber.

156
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.280
Anyway,

157
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.860
they used to have these little kiosks in the middle of all these big stores,

158
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.890
almost like a like little moons to these giant fucking planets of stores.

159
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.520
And one of them was called Wickson sticks and all they sold was candles.

160
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.020
And even as a little kid I was like,
how are they stay in

161
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.730
open?
Like that's all they sell.
You know,

162
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.300
if people ever stopped fucking or raw doing Voodoo,

163
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:10.690
like these people are going to be in trouble.
So I look at like the Middle East,

164
00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:15.691
like they're like a giant Wickson and sticks like where at Wix is sticks just,

165
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.020
just sold candles.
They're just sell an oil.
That's their main thing.

166
00:11:20.021 --> 00:11:22.600
If you stop buying their oil,
they don't have any money.

167
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.670
They don't have any money.
They can't,
can't finance a fucking military.

168
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.350
Right.
Meanwhile they can't have endangered species as pets.

169
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:37.000
So that's a two for right there.
They slowly go out of fucking business.

170
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.530
We're over here with their fucking a,
I dunno,

171
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.890
fucking electric cars and shit.
Not saying it's cleaner for the environment,

172
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:46.360
but it gets you out of that shit.

173
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.270
If elected tomorrow ladies and gentlemen,
I will,

174
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.420
I will present a three day plan to get us out of the Middle East and off of oil.

175
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.450
That would be implemented immediately.

176
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

177
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.810
<v 1>Despite the crushing effects on the economy.</v>

178
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.420
I'm sorry.
And I'm just,
I've just,

179
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.220
I don't need somebody who is in fucking third rock from the sun.

180
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

181
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.330
<v 1>You know,
talking to me about this,
but you know,
at the end of the day,</v>

182
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:30.140
I am not voting.
I would have voted,
but I'm just on the road.
So what,

183
00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:34.540
what am I supposed to do?
Well,
Bill,
you could apply for an absentee ballot.

184
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.880
<v 0>Um,
well I would,</v>

185
00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:41.050
but the people that I vote for never win

186
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.290
<v 1>cause they hate the Democrats.
They,
the Republican Party.</v>

187
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.940
I vote for those lunatics.
There's people that are like,
I don't know man.

188
00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:53.580
If we voted for this guy and he got in,
I don't know,

189
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.450
either things would get better or everything would be on fire.

190
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.080
Like those are the people that I vote for.
So maybe I shouldn't vote.

191
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.280
Maybe I'm one of those people.

192
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.343
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

193
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.000
<v 1>We'll be right back with podcasts.
Celebrities who don't vote.</v>

194
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.803
<v 0>MMM.</v>

195
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.910
<v 1>As a podcast celebrity.
I just like saying that,
that makes me feel important.
Um,</v>

196
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.610
speaking of important,

197
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.870
I have a couple of important announcements to make.
Um,

198
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.870
<v 0>okay.</v>

199
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.810
<v 1>I'm going to be at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday,</v>

200
00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:27.920
the day after the election.

201
00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:31.130
I think I'm still going to be like telling people what they should vote for.

202
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.550
That's how full of myself I am.
The day after the election,

203
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.500
you know what you should've done.
You know,

204
00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.640
like somebody calls up a sport shelf the day after the team fucking losers.

205
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.090
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Um,
important announcement.</v>

206
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:46.980
<v 1>My patrion page,</v>

207
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:51.690
www.patrion.com/birth five bucks a month.

208
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.170
Every month you get two episodes of uninformed but me and old Joey roses.

209
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.380
Um,
I got a,
uh,
let's see,

210
00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:05.070
live from the live Monday morning podcast that I filmed,

211
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.820
I did in front of a live studio on it.
Fuck it.

212
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:13.010
We'll do it live in Phoenix or you can download that from the pastry on app to

213
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:14.640
stream,
um,

214
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.480
that in new uninformed episodes or download directly to your phone.

215
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.330
I have behind the scenes and a,

216
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.580
the forum behind the scenes backstage I should say.
And uh,

217
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.580
you have some helicopter video and I'm just going to keep adding to that every

218
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.090
month.
It's at www.patrion.com/bar.

219
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.953
<v 0>Uh,</v>

220
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.740
<v 1>that's it.
What else do I have?
I think that was it.</v>

221
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.780
<v 0>Um,
other than that,
I went up and</v>

222
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.780
<v 1>I visited my family back east and I went to the Patriots Green Bay packers game,</v>

223
00:14:47.781 --> 00:14:50.930
obviously was very excited.
What the outcome of that game.
I was,

224
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.830
because Aaron Rodgers is such a fucking beast.
And uh,
yeah,

225
00:14:56.831 --> 00:14:59.830
I was nervous about our defense against them and uh,
you know,

226
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.320
played a little Ben don't break in the red zone.
Uh,

227
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.520
he kind of had all day to pass for most of the game,
but when it counted,

228
00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:11.200
we got in his fucking grill and made it happen.
Um,

229
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.140
and I had great seats,
you know,
I have to tell Jimmy Kimmel that I sit up,

230
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.640
up top with the fucking real people actually got into one of those boxes.

231
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.750
No sitting right in the front fucking row.

232
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.713
<v 0>MMM.</v>

233
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.820
<v 1>They had the window open and shit.
It was great.
So I was like cold.</v>

234
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.880
But then when I walked into the back near the food,
I was all warm.

235
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:35.930
Like it was in somebody's living room.
I got treated like an absolute king.

236
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:38.910
So I want to thank the Patriots.
Um,

237
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.610
when we got the whole trip,
I got to see the,
uh,
the trophies.

238
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.440
I got to talk to Andre Tippett.
I mean,
it was,
it was,
it was incredible.

239
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.790
It was fucking incredible.

240
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.760
And then I watched arguably two of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.

241
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.540
One of them is the greatest quarterback of all time.
And then the other one,

242
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:58.030
I don't know,
you know,
what are we going to put him?

243
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.320
But he's the only halfway done,
you know,

244
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.120
he's just fucking kicking the shit out of everybody.
He's on track.
Right.

245
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.710
He's on track to be what top five every has got to be.
You know,

246
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:15.140
I bet if he,
if he wasn't doing what he was doing and Green Bay,
you know,

247
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.050
if he was doing it in a different city like New York,

248
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.700
he probably already be there.
You gotta to work twice as hard,

249
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.520
twice as hard and green bay.
I feel like,

250
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.310
like can you imagine me in the greatest quarterback of all time?

251
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:30.020
And you're in Buffalo,
New York.

252
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

253
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.440
<v 1>Green Bay,
Wisconsin.
Like how long would it take people to notice?
Um,</v>

254
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.770
we're taking collars?
No,
it was an amazing game.
And um,

255
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.020
set.
That's maybe the third time I've seen Aaron Rodgers play live.

256
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.580
He just always leaves one of those guys where he starts to run and then he could

257
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:53.600
throw the fucking ball.
You Think,
oh,
he's going to run for like eight Yah we did.

258
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.920
He just got 30 yards.
Like how good he is at that is,

259
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:03.310
it's like drives you up the fucking wall when you're watching your team cause

260
00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:06.870
you like tag them.
Okay.
They got him getting at how he slipped away.

261
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.600
Now Dick Chap called before he gets it,

262
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.200
throws it down the goddamn field.

263
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:14.920
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

264
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.470
<v 1>I bet people were like,
well bitch,
and it's some of our quarterbacks,
it's like,</v>

265
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:21.610
dude,
dead a damn.
They'd been running around back there for like six seconds.

266
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.290
Like something should have happened by now.

267
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.510
They shouldn't still have to be covering a receiver.

268
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.263
<v 0>MMM.</v>

269
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.540
<v 1>But anyways,
uh,
I kind of called it before the game,
I kind of feel,</v>

270
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:35.400
and Josh Gordon was going to have a breakout game,
which I feel like he did.

271
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.890
I couldn't tell and I wasn't watching any sort of broadcast.

272
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.280
So let's say you've jammed his fingers or something on two plays in a row.

273
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:43.080
He was looking at his hands.
I hope he's all right.

274
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.470
And then that Patterson dude just took over before the half.

275
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.820
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

276
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.990
<v 1>just unstoppable.</v>

277
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.030
Just handing the ball off to this hybrid running back wide receiver.
I mean,

278
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.800
how perfect is that for Bella checks on offense.
Um,
so here we go.

279
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:02.450
We're six and two,
but fucking Kansas City one again.
So there,

280
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.660
what this seven and one,
I don't fucking know.
I got a kid now.
I have no idea.

281
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:09.960
So as a right now we would play.

282
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.840
<v 1>Kansas City at home provided we got to the AFC championship game and uh,</v>

284
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:19.270
I tell you that would be,
that'd be a tall order trying to beat those guys.

285
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:22.090
Two tabs one year.
Um,

286
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.660
once again,
people freaking out about,
uh,
my homes.
He threw a ball like 90 yards.

287
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.430
Oh,
you mean like Doug Williams did 30 years ago?
Sorry.
Um,

288
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.100
I've never seen anything like this.

289
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.400
Alright.
Lsu versus Alabama.
Oh,
Jesus.
Oh,
that one hurt.

290
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.680
Oh,
did that one hurt?
I was like,
Alabama hasn't fucking played anybody.

291
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.290
Let's look at their fucking schedule.
Right.
Cause this is what I was doing.

292
00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:51.370
I was like,
you know something.

293
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.480
Even though our fucking best defensive players going to be on the bench for the

294
00:18:56.481 --> 00:18:58.580
first fucking half,
I feel like we're going to hang with them.

295
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.930
Then the other kid comes in.
Maybe he can,
uh,
you know.

296
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:04.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

297
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.630
<v 1>Tip the scale and Ellis shoes.
Favor.
That did not happen.</v>

298
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.950
Can I spell Alabama,

299
00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:14.951
Alabama football schedule 2018 let's listen to these powerhouses that Alabama

300
00:19:18.621 --> 00:19:23.210
has played a Mississippi state.
That's not bad.
Auburn.

301
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.070
Oh,
this is what they have left.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hang on a sec.
Hang on a second.

302
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.630
Auburn.
They play harbor and everyday of every fucking Thanksgiving bill.

303
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.820
All right.
They played Louisville.

304
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:36.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

305
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.160
<v 1>One 51 to 14.
Then they played Mississippi.</v>

306
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:41.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

307
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.850
<v 1>Then they played Louisiana Lafayette.</v>

308
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

309
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.820
<v 1>Then they played Missouri or whatever.
I think I'm fucking up these.</v>

310
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:55.230
None of these teams are ranked.
They played Arkansas state.

311
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.590
They played Texas a and m not Alabama's fault.

312
00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:04.050
The Texas a and M is not good right now.
Then they played Arkansas,

313
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.130
not their fault.
They played Tennessee.

314
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:09.210
They played Missouri.

315
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:13.500
This is Lsu is the first fucking ranked team they played all year.

316
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.190
So I'm thinking like,
well they're finally fucking playing somebody.

317
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:18.540
Let's see what happens.

318
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.100
And they went in there and they just fucking kicked him right in the Dick.

319
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.820
I mean it just,
it offense couldn't do shit.

320
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

321
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.670
<v 1>The defense just dominated him.
It's,</v>

322
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:35.050
it's like they just stuck a rag in their mouth and fucking wrap some duct tape

323
00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:35.890
right around them.

324
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.220
I always fit and just repeatedly kicked him in the nuts slowly for four straight

325
00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:45.910
quarters,
uh,
29 to nothing.

326
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.200
So all those haters out there,
you know.
Yeah,
they don't play shit,

327
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:51.520
but it's not their fault.

328
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.340
It's not their fault that everybody kind of sucks at their plan.

329
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.630
But then when they do play a number three team,
they fucking destroyed them.

330
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.790
So,
uh,
they got Mississippi state and then the biggest challenge of the year,

331
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:04.840
they play sit at all

332
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.150
and then they got a Auburn.

333
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.490
And then for some reason there's a game on the 1st of December.

334
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:18.120
I would've thought that that was the last one.
They're playing Georgia.
So they,

335
00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:21.980
they got some teams coming up,
not really.
Um,

336
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.320
but does just say there'll be nice and rested for when they played for yet

337
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:30.010
another championship,
but you know,
something as much as people bitch about that,

338
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.290
you know,
they're easy scheduled,

339
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:35.620
then they get into the championship game and more times than not,
they win,

340
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.713
<v 0>you know,</v>

341
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.370
<v 1>as opposed to Ohio state.
I remember a few years ago,
they fucking,</v>

342
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.650
they Penn state beat them straight up and then also won the big 10

343
00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:52.210
championships.
And for some reason Penn state didn't get in,
but Ohio state did.

344
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:55.150
And then I'll state went down there.
I got that fucking shorts.
She yanked down.

345
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.480
Um,
I'm in way over my head right now.

346
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:00.850
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

347
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.060
but I could just tell you as a podcast celebrity,

348
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.160
your vote on who should be,

349
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.940
who should make the Ncaa College football playoff is extremely important.

350
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.530
It's extremely important that this Saturday coming up is one of the most

351
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.100
important Saturdays in college football history.

352
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:25.940
And who would know better than his celebrity podcast?
Oh,

353
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:29.620
that sounds better,
doesn't it?
I'm gonna have to put that on my fucking,

354
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.193
<v 0>mmm.</v>

355
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.920
<v 1>I guess say put it on my Wikipedia page,</v>

356
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.570
comedian,
actor,
celebrity,
podcaster.

357
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.430
Uh,
please don't put that on there.
Well,
I've already said to do it.
So now it's,

358
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:54.580
and that was done.
Um,
anyways,
um,
so I'm hanging here in New York,

359
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.910
going to do my little tuneup show tonight,

360
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.710
bounce around some clubs here in New York.
Uh,
looking forward to that.
And then,

361
00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:05.370
uh,
I got my big shoe on,
um,

362
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.300
on Wednesday,
so I'm just sitting here and then I got,

363
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.740
I got three shows in Chicago,
um,

364
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.500
at the Chicago theater on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.

365
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.740
And then all freckles is fucking done for the year I've done for the year.

366
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.780
So I mean,
uh,
not,
I mean I got some local shows that I'm doing,

367
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.100
but um,

368
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.100
and I will not be doing shit again until I go out to eastern Europe,

369
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.270
which I already made fun of on this podcast.
When are we announcing those dates?

370
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.790
I don't know.
I think I just pictured the hedge.

371
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.450
I just picked the headshot they were going to use or something to that nature.

372
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:52.120
So any day now.
And um,
oh,

373
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.260
you know what?
Fuck this.
I'm just going to tell you this.

374

375
00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:57.620
but I'm not going to tell you the dates.

376
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.420
All I'm going to do is tell you that it fucking,

377
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.990

Well,

Well,

382
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.350
Oh,

383

385
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:44.850
Eastern Europe.
Okay.

386
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.030
Ah,

387
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

388
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.840
<v 1>All right.
I'm just going to,</v>

389

390
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.810
Warsaw,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.070
I didn't know whether it is Lithuania,
Estonia,

392
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.440
Bulgaria.

393
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

Germany,
Budapest,
Hungary.</v>

395
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.860
I might've read those kind of backwards.
Um,

396
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.970
that's going to be from January 3rd until a Sunday.

397
00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:23.290
January 13th,
10 days.
And I'm bringing Paul Versey with me.

398
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.500
And he's going to go over there with his fucking blue Yankee hat and his fucking

399
00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:32.090
joy dude,
eastern Europe,
Jordan's sexes

400
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.110
over over.
We uh,
I'm actually,

401
00:25:38.111 --> 00:25:42.730
it came in town early cause we had a surprise birthday party for Paul.
And um,

402
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.000
when I tell you like,
you know,

403
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:47.820
when you go to those things and like the person's kind of figured it out and

404
00:25:47.821 --> 00:25:51.450
then he tried to act like the surprise and you know that the not like Versie

405
00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:53.340
legit had no fucking clue.

406
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.040
He was coming down the stairs and I could tell the way he was talking,

407
00:25:56.041 --> 00:25:59.430
it was at this restaurant,
the way he was talking to this guy,
I was like,

408
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.390
oh my God,
this guy has like no clue.
And then I got like nervous for a second.

409
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:05.910
Like is he going to have like a fucking heart attack?

410
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:09.770
What if he just breaks down and starts crying?
Like I always there,
you guys,

411
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.880
you know,
just gets really fucking awkward.
I got,
I got like,
really,

412
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.970
I don't like doing that to people.
You know what I mean?
You know,

413
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:19.140
let them know what's going on.

414
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.350
<v 0>Okay.</v>

415
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.800
<v 1>He just came,
walked around the corner,
we all just go surprise.</v>

416
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.260
And he did like a fucking double take,

417
00:26:26.261 --> 00:26:30.070
put his hand up to his face and then just walked out of the room for a second.

418
00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:34.920
But it was funny.
Everybody laughed and then he came back
and uh,

419
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.760
oh my God,
we had a great time.

420
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

421
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.540
<v 1>It's like this whiskey tasting thing.
It was just amazing.</v>

422
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.050
It was fucking amazing.

423
00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:49.051
This guy was given us all this whole fucking history lesson on whiskey to a

424
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:52.960
bunch of comedians.

425
00:26:52.961 --> 00:26:56.770
So it's like we're in class with this subject we always wanted to take,

426
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.180
but at the end of the day,
we're all class clowns,

427
00:26:59.181 --> 00:27:02.470
so everybody's trying to outdo each other.
And this Guy Ethan,

428
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.450
who did the tour just handled it like a champ.
You know,

429
00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:11.770
we gave him shit a little bit.
He gave a shit back.
Um,

430
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.180
it was,
uh,
it was just such a fucking great time.
Then he had,
if somebody,

431
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.110
they can roll in cigars.
It was really a,
it was amazing.

432
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.990
And then I went up to the Patriots game.
Yeah,
you know this,

433
00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:27.991
this is what it's like people to be a celebrity pie rms stuff with that joke.

434
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.510
All right.
Anyways,
so I'm back here in New York and uh,

435
00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:35.340
I was watching today on ESPN.
Um,

436
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.620
they said the Lakers hit a new low and the Lebron era,

437
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.860
it's like the just fucking started.
It's like a month into it.

438
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.020
Magic Johnson said that are on a two year plan.

439
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.100
The first year is going to be rough and then they're going to clear all this cap

440
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:51.380
space and they're going to buy a bunch of people and make a run at fucking a,

441
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.320
<v 0>yeah.</v>

442
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.440
<v 1>Oh,
the golden state.
I mean,
the guy said that you said,</v>

443
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.990
that's what I'm going to do.
I don't understand.

444
00:27:58.810 --> 00:27:59.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

445
00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:04.170
<v 1>Why Espn is trying to make me act like this is like this big failure and Luke</v>

446
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.400
Walton needs to be fired.
They said it's a two year plan.
We're barely fucking,

447
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:14.220
not even two months into this.
Jesus Christ,

448
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.970
he fucking ESPN.
I swear to God,
they're worst than CNN and Fox.

449
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.280
So I don't watch any of those channels.
I just said,
just tell,

450
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.440
tell me who won the game.

451
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.770
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

452
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.710
<v 1>get me all fucking anxious.
Um,</v>

453
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.000
we had a meeting with Luke Walton and they said it wasn't,
you know,

454
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.560
it didn't concern his job,
but could it Ben,
his kidneys,

455
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.650
sorry.
Anyways,
um,

456
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.620
I actually have been going to the gym out here in New York and,
uh,

457
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.240
you know,
I had a little bit of set,
a little bit of a setback with my shoulder.

458
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.390
Now back.
Um,

459
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.970
the person I was working with was telling me what I could do,
like 120 pounds,

460
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.750
like 10 times on the lat pull down with the weight that I'm at.

461
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.650
I could attempt to do a pull up.
My shoulder would be,
but you know,

462
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:08.200
one to three,
which means I would just do one.
And uh,
you know,

463
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.800
I took a few days off.
I tried to come back where I left off.

464
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.500
I was up to 110 pounds and I felt a little tweak.

465
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.410
I fucking stopped immediately shut the whole thing down.

466
00:29:17.411 --> 00:29:21.880
Ice My shoulder and I was fine,
but I had to go back down to about 75 pounds.

467
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:27.040
Just these fucking rotator cuffs to such,
they're so delicate.

468
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.620
You know what I mean?
It's like a,

469
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.810
you don't like,
uh,
what?
Like someone who's just a needy self centered asshole,

470
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:38.010
like their group of friends.

471
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.810
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

472
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.180
<v 1>It's just like a,
I don't what their deal is.
They're like a,</v>

473
00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.660
it's like this entourage of people.
Like that's Kinda like what,
uh,

474
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.890
you rotator cuff is like that person,
you know,

475
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.740
if your shoulder muscles were a bunch of different people built,

476
00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:54.920
what are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm just trying to fill fucking time.

477
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.730
Let me read some advertising here.
How about that?
Huh?
Did I,

478
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.300
did I copy and paste the advertising?
I don't think I did.

479
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.540
I don't think I did.

480
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.183
<v 0>Here we go.</v>

481
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.250
<v 1>My age is probably going to give me shit for reading those fucking names of</v>

482
00:30:11.251 --> 00:30:13.370
those cities.
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?
I've been,

483
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.650
I've been pre hyping it for awhile

484
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.523
by the way,

485
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:24.040
that my eastern European tour is going to be one of the most important standup

486
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.960
tours
in the history of eastern European standup tourists by bald,

487
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:33.520
redheaded males who grew up in Massachusetts,
south of Boston.
All right.

488
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.250
Oh my bookie.
Everybody a show watch footballs far more.

489
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.340
Would you like to have a little bit of [inaudible] she audit,

490
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.470
but it's more entertaining when you have some action on the games.

496
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:04.850

you can create a big parlay,

497
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.480
pick three teams to win and it'd be hit all three.

498
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:12.160
You could turn $100 into 600 bucks.
I never do the parlays.

499
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.190
That's like fucking doing a murder with somebody else.
You know,

552
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.470
Feminist cheerleaders.

553
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.410
Somebody was saying that they have a problem with the cheerleaders.

554
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.250
Should we let our girls be cheerleaders?

555
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.050
Is it time to rethink the rules for NFL cheerleaders?

556
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.640
Um,
okay.
Let's see what day,
what it was.

557
00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:20.190
See what the fucking problem is.
What is the problem now?

558
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.583
<v 0>Okay.</v>

559
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.990
<v 1>Okay.
40 years ago,
this month,</v>

560
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.610
a visitor at the Dallas cowboys cheerleading tryouts described a scene that was

561
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:36.611
quote as tense as an open casting call for a Broadway production with 150 woman,

562
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.260
the most envied,
celebrated,
and sought after in the country.

563
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.980
Shivering in an overly air conditioned room.
Aw.

564
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:49.040
That's like being backstage at Letterman.
It was fucking freezing.

565
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.090
Uh,
the women's spoke of starvation diets that had lasted for weeks.

566
00:34:55.091 --> 00:34:58.340
This sounds like when you've got a movie career from here coming up.
Uh,

567
00:34:58.341 --> 00:34:59.174
the visitor,

568
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:03.400
a New York Times reporter noted that the cheerleaders were paid next to nothing,

569
00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:04.780
$15 a game.

570
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:09.160
They had stringent practice schedules as much as five hours a night,

571
00:35:09.161 --> 00:35:12.520
five nights a week.
The only thing I agree with is how little they pay.

572
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:16.600
They should pay more and they could not appear where alcohol was served at 10

573
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:19.660
parties of any sword or wear jewelry with the uniforms.

574
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.600
A cowboy cheerleader above all else is beautiful.

575
00:35:22.601 --> 00:35:27.460
The article said at a time when the squad was perhaps the most iconic such case,

576
00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:29.080
so what is the fucking problem?

577
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.270
For decades later,
the world may have changed,

578
00:35:34.271 --> 00:35:38.320
but the rules of professional cheerleading appear to be essentially the no.

579
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

580
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.250
<v 1>These people,
they don't even know what the fuck they're talking about.</v>

581
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:42.720
First of all,
cheerleaders,

582
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.370
they used to lead cheers before there was diamond v.
Dot.

583
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:49.350
The big fucking whatever you call them,

584
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:53.550
the big fucking flat screens and all the music go,

585
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.740
go short it and all that shit.
You know,

586
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.070
everybody clap your hands before all of that shit.

587
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.710
They would lead people in chairs,

588
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:06.000
but then when it became obsolete,
so now what they really are,

589
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:10.650
is it just sort of dance teams and then when there's a stoppage of play,

590
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.870
they come out,
oh,
Bobo Bobo.
Break it down right there.

591
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:20.070
You just do something.
I just do some shit.
And this is just,

592
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:23.950
once again,
I swear to God,
this is just,
this is just fucking,

593
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.160
I'm telling you,
like the women who are going to complain about this,

594
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.050
no one's going to ask you to be a cheerleader.

595
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:35.230
This is like me being concerned with the models at copper tone being like,

596
00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:38.210
are they being,
you know,

597
00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:42.470
tanning is not the most healthiest thing.
And in the end it's really,

598
00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:47.471
I'm just jealous because I don't have any pigment and look according to the

599
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:49.760
Internet,
like a mongoloid.

600
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

601
00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.690
<v 1>Is it time to rethink those?</v>

602
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.830
I don't think I've ever seen with all of the true,

603
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.380
huge fucking gigantic

604
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.420
fucking problems out there.

605
00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:10.421
I don't think I've ever seen a time where just like the most frivolous shit

606
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.820
gets,
gets bumped all the way up to the top.

607
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.630
It's like all those fucking assholes that somehow board the plane before group

608
00:37:17.631 --> 00:37:18.440
one.

609
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.610
Will you just look at how the fuck did that person get on to people today got
on,

610
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.520
not veterans.
No kids not limping.

611
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.220
Somehow got on before.
Everybody else is just like,
what the fuck did they do?

612
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.870
And my buddy just sent me something.

613
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.920
This is going to be the new scam in aviation.

614
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.260
Is everybody just paying money and extra shit just to be able to get on that

615
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:46.160
fucking point.
First,
my buddies,
uh,
Dean del Ray sent me this thing.

616
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:48.050
It's like five grand a year.

617
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

618
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.900
<v 1>Five fucking grand a year.
You go to the,</v>

619
00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:54.140
you go to your own private terminal at lax and then,

620
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.020
then they take you right to the plane and you get on first.

621
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.460
So you know what?
I decided,
I was like,
you know what?
I'm just going to pack less.

622
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:05.530
<v 0>Okay,</v>

623
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.680
<v 1>well I'm going to be old Billy backpack and my backpack will fit right</v>

624
00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:12.250
underneath my fucking chair.
And then you guys in.
Anybody else wants to fucking,

625
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.253
yeah.

626
00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:14.523
<v 0>You know,</v>

627
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.030
<v 1>sit there like,
like a,
like a bunch of fucking hyenas.</v>

628
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

629
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.730
<v 1>Trying to get the spoils of a lions kill.
I am.
I'm not fucking doing it.</v>

630
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440
All right.
I'm going to fucking hang back.

631
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:27.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

632
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.660
<v 1>And be like,
all right,
all you fucking,
I,
I quit.
Okay.
I did it the right way.</v>

633
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.950
I started in the back of the,
I worked my way up.

634
00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.940
I was promised a gold watch and the gold watch was that I was going to get on

635
00:38:40.941 --> 00:38:42.530
first.
It just doesn't fucking exist anymore.

636
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:44.503
<v 0>MMM.</v>

637
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.940
<v 1>Anyways,
what is a,
what the fuck was I talking about?</v>

638
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

639
00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.870
<v 1>Oh yes.
So there's all these lashelle like,
so,
you know,
it's funny,
I just,</v>

640
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.530
I just did what these feminists to doing,

641
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.783
<v 0>right.</v>

642
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:03.490
<v 1>Rather than dealing with overpopulation,
climate change,
fucking uh,</v>

643
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.250
uh,
deregulated banks.

644
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:10.990
We're going to tackle cheerleading.
Why?

645
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:14.050
Because it affects me then.
I love that.

646
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.540
I went on that fucking rant about people getting on the plane first.

647
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:19.270
Cause I just showed him just this fucking bad to say are,
you know,

648
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.720
so God bless them.
Let them bitch above a fucking job.

649
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:23.830
They're never going to be offered.

650
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

651
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.710
<v 1>How fucking full of yourself are you.</v>

652
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.070
Should I let my daughter cheerlead what she good.
Looking enough.

653
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.220
Should I let my son be the head of,
of the math team?
Well,

654
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:44.220
did your son get your fucking,
I'm actually making fun of myself here.

655
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.200
You're,
you're fucking it up.

656
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.960
Should I let my kid read out loud on the radio?

657
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.940
A No bill for the love of God know.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

658
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.400
policy genius.
Everybody.
That was just a little break.

659
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.580
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

660
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.940
<v 1>That's what feminists are concerned about.
Now.
Cheerleading.</v>

661
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.503
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

662
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.910
<v 1>Hey,
there's a swirl.</v>

663
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:09.230
A trash two times the size of Texas to biles deep out in the Pacific Ocean.

664
00:40:09.231 --> 00:40:13.620
I don't give a fuck.
Pull a pom poms.

665
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:15.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

666
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.650
<v 1>Um,
I don't give a shit.
Let's talk about cheerleading.
All right.</v>

667
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:24.040
Policy genius.
Life Insurance isn't the most enjoyable thing to think about.

668
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.070
Most people don't like thinking about dying.
I can tell you right now,

669
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:30.130
I've got a life insurance policy and now all of a sudden I,
I,
you know,

670
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.120
I know it's like a weight off my chest.
It's like I can fucking leave now.

671
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.800
And,
and nobody's going to have a problem.
And I'm not talking about dying,

672
00:40:40.801 --> 00:40:44.550
I'm talking about going out,
getting a pack of smokes and never coming back.
Uh,

673
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:48.420
but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling.
As I just said,

674
00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.430
I literally feel like I could abandoned my family.

675
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.560
Like that's how relieved I am that I have life insurance.

676
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.350
It's nice to know that if anything were to happen to you,

677
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.180
<v 0>I immediately pictured a piano.</v>

678
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.500
Did anybody ever bring a piano up with a fucking rope?
Did that really happen?

679
00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.370
<v 1>And why would somebody walk underneath?
Um,
anything can happen to you.</v>

680
00:41:10.371 --> 00:41:14.540
Your family won't have to start a go fund me to stay afloat.
Well,

681
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:17.120
here's my question.
What happens if something happens to my family?

682
00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:19.190
What about the guy here?
Huh?

683
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.690
When do I get to fucking put my feet up?

684
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

685
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.150
<v 1>Uh,
motivate your audience.</v>

686
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:29.330
Talk about your experience with the product slash service.

688
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.950
<v 0>okay.</v>

689
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:39.070
<v 1>Um,
well,
I already told you how much I like life insurance.</v>

690
00:41:39.071 --> 00:41:43.000
I just did it before you guys advertised here.
So I didn't use policy genius,

691
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:46.690
but you know,
had there,
had I known that there was a policy genius out there,

692
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.160
I would have used it and what it saved myself a fucking small fortune.

693
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.193
<v 0>Right?</v>

694
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:57.090
<v 1>My loved ones would be in Kavia rather than tuna fish.</v>

695
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

I mean by Lavan Jerry's that whole time I was just thinking about those,

711
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.580
the fucking cheerleader thing,
you know,

712
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.530
I had to starve myself and everything.
Hey,
you mean make sacrifices?
Well,

713
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:11.620
get a fucking nutritionist.
You don't have to starve.

714
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:16.130
You just have to eat foods that fuel your body.
Yeah.
If you could sit a star.

715
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.600
I like how like you know,

716
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:19.623
<v 0>Oh,</v>

717
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.920
<v 1>have you ever seen real starving people?
What?</v>

718
00:43:21.921 --> 00:43:24.950
The distended bellies and you can count their fucking rib cage.

719
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.120
Lionel Hampton could come over and play a fucking song on that goddamn torso,

720
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.140
that starving.

721
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.233
<v 0>All right.</v>

722
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.740
<v 1>These poor women starved themselves.</v>

723
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.370
The air conditioning is turned on too low.

724
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.560
Just imagine

725
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:47.530
living in some fucking war torn country and listening to that fucking argument.

726
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.470
I think one of the biggest problems facing women today is the question of

727
00:43:53.471 --> 00:43:56.560
cheerleading.
All right.
He likes everybody Hallux.

728
00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.920
You ever wake up in the morning?
We'll do.
Yeah.
With regrets of what you've done.

729
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.060
Jesus Christ.

730
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.420
Telltale heart is your roommate buried underneath your floorboards and your best

731
00:44:10.661 --> 00:44:11.351
friend,
dad.

732
00:44:11.351 --> 00:44:15.760
The cop is coming over a reef laying the terrible decisions you've made the

733
00:44:15.761 --> 00:44:20.470
previous night over and over and over.
Jesus Christ.
Yes.
The kicking,

734
00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:23.830
sweating,
yelling or whatever she did to piss off everyone in the bedroom.
Well,

735
00:44:23.831 --> 00:44:27.790
guess what,
Bud?
Deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.

736
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.600
<v 0>MMM.</v>

737
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.190
<v 1>Wait a second.</v>

738
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.300
You telling me if I have a nice mattress,

739
00:44:37.301 --> 00:44:39.880
I won't regret decisions I made as a younger man.

740
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.450
This might be the greatest sales pitch I've ever heard in my life.

741
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:45.760
What else can it do?

742
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.280
Are you sick of your dick staring down at your ball bag when you wake up in the

743
00:44:51.281 --> 00:44:53.980
morning?
Wouldn't it be great if it was fucking pointing at the ceiling?

744
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:59.320
Is it to say there's a fucking raccoon up there?
Be careful.
Um,

745
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.350
anyways,
what the hell am I here?

746
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.990
Sang to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.
But bill,

747
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.940

Teachers were the talks in the bottoms.

Now let's get onto the questions for this week.

783
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.620
Question Number One,
am I too fat to be a cheerleader?

784
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.493
<v 0>MMM.</v>

785
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.720
<v 1>If I continue to take it in the face,</v>

786
00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:45.300
well that extra protein make me beautiful enough.

787
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:50.190
These are the hard hitting questions in cheerleading.
All right,

788
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.780
Paul Versey special.
Hey Bill,

789
00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:55.710
I just watched the Paul bursaries forsee special and just wanted to thank you

790
00:47:55.711 --> 00:47:57.270
for promoting it.
Look at that.

791
00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.410
It was hilarious and I can't wait for the next all things comedy special on

792
00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:04.740

Keep up the great podcast.
You Maniac.
Oh yeah.

793
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.980
Paul Versey special did very,
very,
very well.

794
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.310
So I want to thank everybody for watching that.
Um,

795
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.870
[inaudible] I'm sure they got it streaming on their website.

796
00:48:15.871 --> 00:48:16.860
You know how those guys are.

797
00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:21.120
Everybody knows what they're doing over comedy central.
And,
um,

798
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.230
Paul's just the first week we're going to,

799
00:48:23.231 --> 00:48:28.060
we've got three more specialists come in and we're picking all comics that other

800
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:32.410
comics like.

um,
I'm very proud of the group that we have common.

801
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:36.340
I'm not allowed to say who they are when I can.
I will.
All right.
That's it.

802
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:41.800
All right.
Advice for olive oil,
olive oil,

803
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.140
uh,
number one.
Uh,

804
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:45.100
<v 0>okay.</v>

805
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.130
<v 1>Benito.
Billy.
I'm another 22 year old lady</v>

806
00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:54.000
and longterm lover of the podcast and truly all of your work to be honest,

807
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:58.380
as an Amazonian myself,
just shy of six feet.

808
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.460
All this is for that woman who wrote in olive oil.
Um,

809
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:08.210
I wanted to reach out and offer some advice to my girl olive oil from last week.

810
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:13.020
I co sign everything you said about loving yourself and some guy will love you

811
00:49:13.021 --> 00:49:17.700
just the way you are.
But I just wanted to put my 2 cents of advice in as well.

812
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:22.620
Joe Jesus,
get on with it there which is lift some weights.
Girl.

813
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.640
Thankfully my prayers were answered around the time I reached adulthood and the

814
00:49:26.641 --> 00:49:31.380
form of a nice little waist to hip ratio and suggests praise God.

815
00:49:31.381 --> 00:49:34.680
But I was never satisfied with my rear end and tell it.

816
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:39.710
I met my husband who is jacked and he introduced me to pumping iron and iron and

817
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.020
Schwartzenegger blesses hard,
taught me how to sculpt an ass out of muscle.

818
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.500
I suggest she watches that movie,

819
00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:53.910
starts with the basic no supplements except create team weight gainer and

820
00:49:53.911 --> 00:49:54.744
coffee.

821
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.670
Don't waste money on any of the bullshit GNC concoctions and find some heavy

822
00:49:59.671 --> 00:50:03.990
stuff to lift in the following ways.
Squad bench deadlift.

823
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.341
Uh,

824
00:50:05.341 --> 00:50:09.750
now she will get so much self confidence out of becoming stronger than she has

825
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:12.540
ever been.
You know,
I would just say get a personal trainer too.

826
00:50:12.541 --> 00:50:15.670
So you doing all of this right?
You don't fuck up your back.
Um,

827
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.010
and with the endorphins from exercise plus the changes in her body adding mass,

828
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:24.820
I really think she will love it.
Number two,
the tall skinny girl.
Ah,

829
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.760
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this doing here?

830
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:31.380
I don't want to update now it's looking.
No,
sorry.
Number two,

831
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:36.590
the tall skinny girl who wrote in a should move to New York and be worshipped.

832
00:50:36.721 --> 00:50:38.340
I feel for her though,

833
00:50:38.341 --> 00:50:41.680
because people used to tell me stuff like that to my face all the time.

834
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:45.020
They would just tell him he a call your stretch,
you know?
Well,

835
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:47.370
and then let's type the type of shit,
you know,
eight foot core,

836
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.980
whatever they say to tall women.
I don't know.
I don't remember.

837
00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:51.330
It's been a long time since you've been in school.

838
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.840
A 100% of those people who said that to me 10 years ago are now pretty Chubby at

839
00:50:57.301 --> 00:51:00.750
30.
While I look like the same slash better than I did at 20.

840
00:51:00.751 --> 00:51:05.670
My boyfriend says I'm a 10 and he's a catcher and a half.
Uh,
I just looked up,

841
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:12.800
Gigi had his numbers,
five,
10 and a half tall,

842
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.940
130 pounds,
almost the exact same as this girls.

843
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.750
She should also look into squats,
leg lifts and protein.

844
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:21.190
Thanks to go fuck yourself.

845
00:51:21.191 --> 00:51:25.480
So I think what she did was she embraced her body and made it the best she
could.

846
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:29.560
She could be.
I think that's all great advice.
Olive oil.
I hope you listening.

847
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.550
All right.
But,
uh,
only thing I would add to that,

848
00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.420
just make sure you get a personal trainer,

849
00:51:34.421 --> 00:51:38.710
get a nutritionist and all that stuff and they have the answers rather than

850
00:51:38.711 --> 00:51:41.740
fucking looking at the dope next to you being like,
what,
what are those?

851
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:42.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

852
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.330
<v 1>Knows spray [inaudible] try.
I'll fucking,
I'll just,</v>

853
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.140
I'll just do that.
Um,

854
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:51.710
<v 0>okay.</v>

855
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:56.240
<v 1>Alexa at my hospital.
Oh Geez.
A dear bill.</v>

856
00:51:56.241 --> 00:52:01.070
I work in a medical center that is very up to date with technology in Beverly

857
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:04.910
Hills that I will not name my work involves me visiting patients at their

858
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.840
bedsides.
I walked into one of my patients from defined Alexa,

859
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.870
mounted on the wall with an example question typed up on a piece of paper.

860
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:18.590
Alexa,
call my nurse.
My reaction was,

861
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.410
she has a big fucking Emoji.
Looks like a smiley face.

862
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:25.510
Are you freaking out?
Is that a freaking out smiley face?
I Dunno.

863
00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.740
And I asked the RN that's registered nurse.
Uh,

864
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.190
we have Alexa now.
As soon as I said Alexa,

865
00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:37.540
it lit up with that creepy blue ring waiting for me to give it a command.

866
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.030
I have no idea why patients need that.

867
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:43.630
And then room because patients have remotes that call the nurse station.
Yeah.

868
00:52:43.631 --> 00:52:46.720
Cause it's spine on you that also controls the TVS.

869
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:49.450
I mainly thought of you and chuckled,
love your work.

870
00:52:49.451 --> 00:52:54.451
And I agree a lot with you lady m d c that this smart ladies go with old

871
00:52:55.831 --> 00:53:00.520
freckles and you should go with those freckles.
A celebrity podcasts,

872
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.790
podcasts are this Tuesday in the voting booth.

873
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:04.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

874
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:09.490

875
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.020
yes.
I saw the McRib advertise recently.
Must be voting season again.

876
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.140
Hilarious.
Um,
yeah,
that's all creepy.
You know,

877
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.780
flew in and out of Boston from Newark Airport and they had this magazine,

878
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:26.210
this is trivia to Burt Reynolds.
So it was like,
you know,
I,
you know,
it was great.

879
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.050
His movies,
his stunts,
the women he loved.
I was like,
oh,

880
00:53:30.051 --> 00:53:31.880
I gotta read this fucking Burt Reynolds.

881
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.650
They're not going to make another guy like this.

882
00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:34.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

883
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:38.810
<v 1>And,
um,
I go,</v>

884
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:42.980
I pick up the magazine,
I'm looking around this,
nobody there.

885
00:53:42.981 --> 00:53:44.540
So I walk over to the restaurant,
I go,

886
00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.240
<v 0>yeah,</v>

887
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.760
<v 1>where do I pay for this?
And The lady just goes,
oh,</v>

888
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:49.530
at the self checkout right over there,
sweetheart.

889
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.520
And she points over to when it had to been 5 million fucking things.

890
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:59.890
So I just said,
oh,
okay.
It's right over there.
Okay,
well thank you sweetheart.

891
00:53:59.891 --> 00:54:02.170
And I just walked over to the rack and I fucking put it back in.

892
00:54:02.171 --> 00:54:03.004
I'm not doing it.

893
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

894
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.220
<v 1>Not fucking doing it.
That's another thing too.</v>

895
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:07.700
I've fucking refuse to be my own cashier

896
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:11.870
drawn a line in the sand.
I will.

897
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.930
I will fucking eat a Goddamn thanksgiving meal before I go to the fucking

898
00:54:14.931 --> 00:54:19.530
airport.
I'll bring my reader's digest.
I'm going to be that old guy.

899
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.310
I don't like new things.

900
00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:22.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

901
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.130
<v 1>And you know what?
No one's going to care,
Bill.
Nobody's going to care.</v>

902
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:29.210
So just learn how to check yourself out in the mirror.

903
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.550
No silly at a store.
All right.

904
00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.930
My wife cheated on me by downloading Tinder and sending nudes.

905
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.240
Hey,
Billy balls.

906
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.850
But listening to your podcast for a few years now and your advocacy,

907
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.180
this is somebody who never would have cheated in the past.

908
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.370
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

909
00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.380
<v 1>they just were around a computer too long.
I'm telling you,</v>

910
00:54:47.381 --> 00:54:49.450
it's like just having a heroin sitting on your table.

911
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.760
Eventually you're going to do some dumb anyways,
but,

912
00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:56.080
but lets your podcast for a few years now and your advice always makes me laugh

913
00:54:56.081 --> 00:54:58.870
and hard times.
Here's something that just happened to me this past week.

914
00:54:58.871 --> 00:55:03.760
I was hoping you could help me out with,
I got married Memorial Day irony,

915
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.430
um,
of this year.

916
00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:10.540
My wife has been acting really distanced lately and on Sunday I asked her if she

917
00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:12.820
was seeing anyone.
She told me no,

918
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.840
I've known this girl for four years now and I knew she was lying.

919
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:22.050
Wow.
Do great instincts.
If you guys just got married in May,

920
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:24.750
this is five months later,
it's gone.
This has gotten this bad.

921
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:26.103
<v 0>Okay.</v>

922
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.490
<v 1>When I asked to look at her phone,</v>

923
00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:32.870
she quickly deleted something and refuse to let me see your phone physically

924
00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:35.630
attacking and scratching to keep me from seeing it.

925
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:40.040
She then admitted to downloading Tinder about two weeks ago and has been take

926
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:44.900
talking to a guy and send him some pictures,
claiming to never have met him.

927
00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:45.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

928
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:46.580
<v 1>And I believe her.</v>

929
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.690
I've been struggling these last few days with a lot of emotions.

930
00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:55.340
It's only five months into the marriage.
Is it best to look at getting a divorce?

931
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

932
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.460
<v 1>It would take a lot of time to forget about what she did.</v>

933
00:55:58.461 --> 00:56:01.450
Especially since I will never really know what transpired.

934
00:56:01.451 --> 00:56:05.650
Saw you and AC and loved it.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
dude,

935
00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:06.670
you're five months in.

936
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

937
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.680
<v 1>Well if you were like 10 years in,
you go going through a rocky period.</v>

938
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:12.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

939
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.473
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

940
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

941
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.660
<v 1>You gave a couple of kids.
It's something you work out maybe,</v>

942
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.933
<v 0>but</v>

943
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.020
<v 1>yeah.
This just seems like if this has happened in this early on,
I don't,</v>

944
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.090
she wanted to marry.

945
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.110
That's what I would add or doesn't want to be married or I don't know what or

946
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.810
sabotage in the whole thing and at that point it's like,
well hey,

947
00:56:30.811 --> 00:56:34.380
here's Kudos to you cause you did it.
Yeah,
I would get the fuck out of that.

948
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:40.010
Yeah.
I mean as a kid,
did you dream?
Does that,
was that your dream woman?

949
00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.660
Five months in Senator [inaudible] fucking who Howard is some fun.

950
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.610
I don't think it is.
Um,
yeah,
I would,
I would get the fuck out of that.

951
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:55.250
You know,
not to mention she also like physically attach it to.
So I mean,
I dunno.

952
00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:59.090
That's good.
There's a lot of that sounds like the beginning of one of those uh,

953
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.230
lady appear to be a happily married couples.

954
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.680
Occasionally he would showed up with odd scratches and bruises,

955
00:57:06.681 --> 00:57:09.560
but he quickly explained it away saying he was working on his car.

956
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.830
Then one day he didn't show up for Thanksgiving.

957
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:18.010
His wife had recently been digging a well in the back yard.
All right.

958
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.920
Hate fat people.
Oh Jesus.
Dear Billy bitty balls.

959
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.100
Billy Betty balls.
Oh,
Billy Betty balls.
What's a matter?
Um,

960
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.110
I'm a 20 year old sophomore in college and I have a dilemma.

961
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.130
Like the subject says fat people really just disgusts me.

962
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:42.680
Oh,
the subject.
Kate flappy bar.
Uh,
there are too many examples to name,

963
00:57:42.681 --> 00:57:44.570
but one that really gets me is this lady,

964
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:49.220
my math class who sits next to me and we'll ramp randomly start smacking her

965
00:57:49.221 --> 00:57:51.740
lips and making this,

966
00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.380
he spelled it m.
E.
H.
E.
M ma'am.
Noise.

967
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:01.910
She's doing that and maybe she's thinking about food.
I don't know.

968
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.290
There was also this guy in my hall who shits literally three times a day.

969
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:08.111
Well,

970
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:13.111
he must be rapping his pizza and Kale or something because I see him go to Rome

971
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.970
with pounds of food at a time.

972
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.930
My dislike isn't anything malicious and I just can't help it.

973
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:24.931
But I just stuck between a rock and it's squishy place and surrounded on all

974
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:29.950
sides by the fatties.
I know this does not seem like a big,
that big of a deal,

975
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.700
but I have a bit of a temper and I'm afraid I'm going to say something to one of

976
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:38.701
the fatties and get title nine right out of my school.

977
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.690
Do you have any tips to become a bit more tolerant?
Uh,

978
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.190
love the podcast.
Congrats on your role in front runner.

979
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:53.440
You should grow that mustache and keep it and go fuck yourself.
Um,

980
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.420
I did grow that mustache.
I grew that mustache when I had a,

981
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:02.710
when I played the cop way back on Chappelle show.
Um,

982
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:08.710
let's see here.
Uh,
I would just make a joke out of it.

983
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.650
I,
well,
do you know the guy who was always disappeared?

984
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.813
<v 0>Okay.</v>

985
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.850
<v 1>I would give him a sumo wrestler name.
Now you can't do that.
That's me.
I Dunno.</v>

986
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.060
Yeah,
I know.
It's like a,
yeah,

987
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:29.020
you supposed to be tolerant,

988
00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:33.290
but they just continue to eat and they make weird noises and they smell and you

989
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:36.140
supposed to just sit next to him and be like,
well I feel bad from,

990
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:37.420
they have a fucking problem.

991
00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:39.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

992
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:44.040
<v 1>You know,
it's hard to feel bad for someone that you know is gluttonous I guess.</v>

993
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.040
But that's just the way I'm wired.
Like a,

994
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.473
<v 0>you know,</v>

995
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.020
<v 1>all of these fucking addicts and all these goddamn people.
Like I dunno,</v>

996
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.850
once you live with the fucking attic,
you just,
you just,
uh,
yeah.

997
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:00.770
You just have,
you don't have a lot of patients from,

998
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:05.030
I don't really know what you're asking me,
so I understand what you're saying.
Um,

999
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:09.170
I would just find somebody else in shape and I would just together just make fun

1000
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:13.190
of them without them being able to hear it.
And you know,

1001
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.770
in most of the time they're chewing anyway,
so it drowns out there.

1002
01:00:15.771 --> 01:00:20.750
Hearing so I think you'll be all right.
I would just make jokes like that.

1003
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:25.400
Other than that what he's supposed to do,
you know,

1004
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:28.363
uh,

1005
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.823
<v 0>I dunno.</v>

1006
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.570
<v 1>Sing songs when they go by.</v>

1007
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.863
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1008
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:42.350
<v 1>That'd be funny if he just snapped by Jesus Christ again.</v>

1009
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.420
How fat are you trying to fucking get?
You can't do any of that.

1010
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.990
And the thing is is you're not really helping him.

1011
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:49.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1012
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.900
<v 1>You shouldn't fat shame people,
but like,
it's also like,
you know what I mean?</v>

1013
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.870
Like,
you know,
there's a little bit of arsenic and an apple,

1014
01:00:55.871 --> 01:00:57.970
but it's still good for you.
Like it.
Yeah.

1015
01:00:57.971 --> 01:01:00.790
If you could have like the same level of arsenic that's in an apple,

1016
01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:03.940
if you could have that level of shame shaming and fat people,

1017
01:01:03.941 --> 01:01:05.200
I think it would help them out a little bit.

1018
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.250
Why don't you tie one of them to your bumper and drag them to the gym?

1019
01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.330
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't have the answers here.
Um,

1020
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.490
recipe from vegetable Lasagna.

1021
01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:18.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1022
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.780
<v 1>I have no fucking idea why I'm getting this.</v>

1023
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:22.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1024
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.220
<v 1>Speaking of which,
um,
I have not been eating well.</v>

1025
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:28.180
I consider myself a fat fuck right now and I,
I fetch,
I'm,

1026
01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:32.740
I'm a self contained unit.
I will,
I will fat shame myself.
Um,

1027
01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:36.160
oh,
you guys can do it too.
You know,
I always enjoy that.
All right,

1028
01:01:36.161 --> 01:01:40.060
recipe for vegetables.
Anya.
Dear Bill,
I was recently listening to an old podcast.

1029
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.180
Will you and Neil,
we're talking about a thanksgiving.
Oh God,
yes.

1030
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.770
Well you made a shitty vegetarian lasagna with carrots in it.
It was horrible.

1031
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.340
Oh my God.
One of the worst thanksgivings ever,
uh,

1032
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:57.370
made me think of a great Broccoli lasagna recipe that my roommate and I would

1033
01:01:58.071 --> 01:01:58.904
cook.

1034
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:00.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1035
01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.360
<v 1>And I would cook.
Uh,</v>

1036
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:08.810
he's half Italian from Sicily.
Well,
those guys don't consider themselves Italian.

1037
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.680
They consider themselves Sicilian and the recipe is from his Italian

1038
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:16.060
grandmothers.
See,
you know,
it's going to be some good shit.
Uh,

1039
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.540
this isn't healthy at all.

1040
01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:21.980
It's rich and creamy and absolutely delicious as a Lasagna should be.
Also,

1041
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.450
it's super easy.
I can't remember the exact measurements for each thing,

1042
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.920
but we're going to try anyways.
Oh,
your protection.

1043
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:33.770
The recipe while you gave me was the fucking ingredients.
What is this?

1044
01:02:33.771 --> 01:02:37.100
A cooking show,
700 grams of Broccoli,
Florence

1045
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.140
flour,
butter and milk for the bechamel sauce.

1046
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:48.120
Look up a basic lasagna recipe for Beck.
I'm B,
c h,
a m,

1047
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:52.560
e l and amount of Lasagna sheets.

1048
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.170
A few cloves of garlic,
chopped olive oil,

1049
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.140
fresh Mozzarella Parmesan,

1050
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:03.220
or a tablespoon of Pesto depending on how much back on mail you make.

1051
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.260
Well,
let's see.
It's pretty simple.
Like all great Italian dishes.

1052
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:09.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1053
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:13.940
<v 1>All right.
I'm not going to read all of this shit.
Cut Up the Broccoli.
All right.</v>

1054
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:16.900
I Dunno if somebody can figure that fucking shit out of it.
Uh,

1055
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:22.460
anyways,
if I done an hour,
I think I have.
Um,

1056
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.980
all right,
that's the podcast.

1057
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.810
I don't know who's playing Monday night football tonight,

1058
01:03:26.811 --> 01:03:29.570
but I gotta do some spots tonight and tomorrow to make sure I'm ready for

1059
01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:32.980
Tuesday and into this weekend.
And,
um,

1060
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:36.980
I'm actually going to do something that all old men like to do.

1061
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:41.450
I'm going to take a fucking nap.
I can't wait.
And you guys,

1062
01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.110
you have no idea how difficult it is to be me.
You know,

1063
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:48.860
dealing with Harding problems like cheerleading.

1064
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:53.810
Should we let women cheerlead I love how their cheerleading five feet away from

1065
01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:57.710
guys who are literally doing irreparable brain damage to themselves,

1066
01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.740
most of whom you know,
when they get to a certain point,

1067
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.950
either go crazy or killed themselves,
but,
but let's,

1068
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.300
let's not focus on that.
Anyways,

1069
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.980
that's the podcast.
Everybody,

1070
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.730
I'll check in on you on Thursday and uh,

1071
01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:19.620
I dunno what I guess now I'm down to watch and uh,

1072
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.450
going to start watching the Celtics and the Bruins.

1073
01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:26.230
Now when I get fucking home to my,
my,
uh,

1074
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:30.360
what is center ice package and one of the,
they call the basketball one,

1075
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:35.160
the NBA hardcourt package.
I don't know what the fuck it is.
His package to a,

1076
01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:38.910
is that micro aggressive?
My uh,

1077
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:42.970
Santa Rice Vagina?
Is that what you supposed to say?
I have no idea.
All right.

1078
01:04:42.971 --> 01:04:45.580
Go fuck yourselves please.
Everybody.
Just,

1079
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:49.990
just for me and my celebrity podcasting ego.

1080
01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:55.000
Could you kiss,
get out there and vote cause tomorrow is really,
really important.

1081
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.730
All right,
go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you Thursday.
