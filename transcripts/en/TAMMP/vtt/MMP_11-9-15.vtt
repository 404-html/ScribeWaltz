Easing into thanksgiving.
Uh,

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.620
I apologize for the broadcast being so late in the piece popping on the

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.300
microphone to turn that down there.
Um,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
I just been travelling like a maniac,

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.570
I did Philly and then I did Bethlehem,

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.580
Pennsylvania and then I went to Daytona,
Florida and,
oh,

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.960
what a time I had.
What a fucking time for old freckles.

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.850
It's good to be freckles these days.

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.660
His fucking year is winding down.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.840
I always wonder what my neighbors think when I fucking come back to New York.

15
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.040
Like,
wait,
what?
Where does that loud Kanban and a fucking coma?

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.710
Haven't heard his stupid podcast forever.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.290
We fucking roach infested God apartment back here came walking in like this.

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.650
Just fucking,
you know,

19
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:08.910
I have the guy come in and spray it,
but I dunno,
they still get in here,

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.330
you know that just fucking dead everywhere.

21
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.650
But this so fucking old from being dead,
right?
Yeah.

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.180
I pick them up and like the antenna stays on the floor.

23
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.680
It's fucking gross.
So anyways,

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.650
um,
what was I talking about?
I don't even remember.

25
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.790
Whatever.
Yeah,
just been,
I've been all over the place.
So,
um,

26
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
I want to thank everybody that came out to my shows this weekend in
Philadelphia,

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.000
in Bethlehem and in Daytona.

28
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:47.001
I had a fucking awesome time in each show was special in its own little way.

29
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
Um,
the first fucking night was the,
uh,
was the Philly show,

30
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.870
right?
So I go to Philly and contrary to one fucking youtube video,

31
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
everybody thinks I hate Philly.
I don't,
I was actually,

32
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.590
this is some shit I've never really been told you guys.

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.720
I was actually a flyers fan growing up because when I first started watching

34
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:10.554
hockey,

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.090
I loved the fact that you could fight and that's what the flyers did.

36
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:18.570
So I loved him.
You know,
I was too,

37
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.080
too young to remember them beating us in the Stanley Cup final in the 70s.

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.100
So I didn't have any bad will against the guys.

39
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:28.050
I just knew that they'd beat the fuck out of people.

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.890
And who doesn't want to watch that?
You know,
I eased my way into violence,

41
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.220
you know,
started off by getting my ass kicked by my older brother.

42
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.600
Then I started watching Raslan and then I moved on to hockey.
Right.

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.460
Years later I'm watching the UFC.
It just keeps progressively get more fun.

44
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.180
I watch those knock out videos.
I watch people getting slapped,

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.350
you know,
um,

46
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.320
there has to be a fucking word for the level of excited the person holding the

47
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:03.381
cell phone a camera has when they start screaming worldstar it literally sounds

48
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.830
like they're on fire.

49
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.410
They're so fucking excited that they filmed the knock out and that they're going

50
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:14.020
to get it on the fucking website.
Like they're almost like paying themselves.

51
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.370
I do an impression of it,

52
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.700
but I have a show I have to do in about eight days and it would shred my fucking

53
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.870
voice.
I'll try to,
uh,
I was going to lie to you in sales,

54
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.510
going to try and find the clip.
I have no idea where the clip,
where the clip is.

55
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.720
But um,
so anyways,

56
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:32.230
so I went and got into Philly on Thursday night.
Had the big shoe,

57
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
really big shoe there on Friday.
So I was like,
all right,

58
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.870
let me go out and get a cheese steak.
And it was really late and I,

59
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:44.060
I didn't have a car and I just said fuck it.
I said to the guys downstairs where,

60
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.410
uh,
where's the closest place to get a good one?
And they kind of made a face.

61
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.020
I go down to the corner.
So I went to this place Cavanaugh's so sports bra,

62
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.140
one of the coolest thing I saw,
they had the night,
the,

63
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.770
the fucking Philly's 1980,
um,

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.950
world series banner in there,
which was cool.
And I went in,

65
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.340
I got it with the Tater tots and I gotta tell you it was pretty fucking tasty.

66
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.220
Pretty God damn tasty.
Straight across the board.

67
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.500
I give the fucking cheese steak at,
at a,
at Cabin Oz,

68
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.540
the fucking thumbs up.
Right?

69
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.550
So then the next day,
right,
we got the show.
So I'm walking around,

70
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:26.500
I'm doing what I always do with when I go to Philly,
right.
Fucking check it out.

71
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.550
The downtown area.

72
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:30.550
And I always end up over at Mitchell and ness just to see what the fuck they

73
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:35.500
have and uh,
about my God son something.

74
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.870
And,
uh,
what else did I do?
I just walked around.
I fucking,
you know,

75
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.660
I enjoy the Goddamn city.
I don't do the touristy shit.
You know,

76
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.260
I meant to check out the Joe Frazier fucking
statue,

77
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.450
but I didn't have time.
Um,
so anyways,

78
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.260
so we got to go do the fucking show,
right?
It's at the wells Fargo arena.

79
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.530
Speaking of the flyers and the fucking 76 isn't all that shit.

80
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.370
So me Versie and Joe Matter Reese or on the show matter,

81
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.190
he says from Philly.
So we're driving over there,
I'm using the fucking,

82
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.110
you know,
I finally changed in the phone.
I changed it to a guy's voice.

83
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:15.880
So at least it's a guy telling me what to do.

84
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120
It's supposed to that fucking broad nagging me the whole way,
right.

85
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.680
Causing my balls to pull up into me.
Right?
So I fucking,
um,

86
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.590
we're driving over there and of course we,

87
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.800
somehow we get lost trying to find a fucking arena.

88
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.330
And I literally see it says parking for event,
but the fucking computer can't,

89
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.080
didn't tell me to turn or my thumb grazed against something and just shut the

90
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.880
fucking thing off.
So I went right by it.

91
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.420
And when you miss the Wells Fargo Center headed south,

92
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.730
you end up in the fucking swamp.

93
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.110
So it ended up being like a half hour mistake cause it was like 15 minutes to

94
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.420
get all the way over the fucking thing.
And then we did not get in there.

95
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:56.860
We went into the wrong fucking gate.
So we pull in the charging us for parking.

96
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.230
I'm going now where the guys doing the show?
I'm bill bird.
That's Joe matter.

97
00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:05.860
He says Paul Versey.
So ladies like,
hang on a second.
She's like,
yeah,

98
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:07.520
he said he's Paul Berg.

99
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.790
So we're laughing our asses off gone.

100
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:17.791
I swear to God we're there and when they go out to tell us a joke and I was

101
00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:20.830
like,
I don't want any fucking jokes.
Well the three committees,

102
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:22.930
we can't find a fucking arena.
Is that funny enough?

103
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.790
And they guy go down there to [inaudible] and we just keep running into security

104
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.910
guards.
We just keep going.
Yeah,
we're the guys from the show.

105
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.820
And they would just go,
oh,
all right,
go down that way.

106
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:35.470
So then we just started laughing.
Go and do it.

107
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
I'm going to pull up two arena and be like,
yeah,
I'm Willie Nelson.
Yeah,
man,
I uh,

108
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.160
I'm a little late.
Where do I go?

109
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.800
I obviously I couldn't get away with Willie Nelson.
He's too famous.

110
00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:49.240
But I'm telling you,
this is how it works.
Okay?

111
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.470
You need somebody black and somebody white in your car and I guarantee you,

112
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:56.860
you could sneak into any fucking arena when there's a concert.
All right,

113
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.590
this is all you gotta do.
All right.

114
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.290
Have a black and a white person in there just in case you get into the wrong

115
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.100
line.

116
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.240
Then what you do is you try to peek ahead to see what color the person is in the

117
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:11.710
parking booth.
If they're white,
you have the black guy talk,

118
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.960
right?
The black guy says,
I'm fucking,
uh,

119
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.520
oh wait,
wait,
wait.
You got to start with the artists for us.
All right,
so say you.

120
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.290
What are,
what did the kids listening to these days?
Huh?
Asap.
Rocky,
right?

121
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.670
Say he's got a fucking show.
What'd you got to do is you gotta be black friend.

122
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.280
Oh,
you got to get a black friend or just hire a black guy.

123
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.390
You have him say you pull up to the wrong fucking gate.

124
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:38.710
The regular person gave you,

125
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:43.711
make sure you get in line with the fucking white person right in the booth and

126
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:48.010
you,
all you get black guys got to say is,
yeah,
I'm him and I'm late,
man.

127
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:51.550
What do I go?
Where do I go?
And I'm telling you,

128
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:55.330
that guy will fucking wave you went,
we should want to have to pay for pocket.

129
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:57.730
I don't know if it fucking works.
And then if it's a fucking country,

130
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:01.650
show your black friends,
not Cohen.
So it gives a shit.
You know what?

131
00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:06.520
I need white people anyways.
Whatever.
I'm convinced.
Ah,
fuck me.
Hang on a second.

132
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.340
Hang on.
Hang on.
All right,
I'm back.
Yeah.

133
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.170
So your black friends not going to want to go to the country showing him.

134
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.930
All I'm saying is if you just,
if you fucking pull up,

135
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.970
oh wait a minute.
They probably know it all day.
This is me being an EGOMANIAC.

136
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.760
This is what this is.
They didn't know why I am so then,

137
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:25.370
then I can know who know who fucking Travis traders.

138
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.810
What an arrogant freckled cons.
I apologize.
I apologize.

139
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.250
Not only for this thing being late,

140
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.930
but having my ego go off the fucking rails that soon and this podcast,

141
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.700
right.
It's fucking unbelievable.

142
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.890
It usually takes me at least 15 minutes in before the ego starts coming out.

143
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.700
Oh it reared its fucking redhead early.
Deaden it.
Um,

144
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.051
so anyways,

145
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:53.830
we will fucking driving around that parking lot for like 20 minutes and I'm

146
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:58.710
talking to the guy in the fucking arena and he's going,
you know,
where are you?

147
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.470
I'm like,
I will.
I'm in the fucking parking lot.
It's,
it's,
we're an e.
And he goes,

148
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.460
all right,
did you go into the tunnel?
And I'm like,
no,

149
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:11.940
I went over a bridge or bring it around and fuck fucking take.

150
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:16.320
It took us like for fucking ever.
And then we got in there and um,

151
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.510
we got to go into the,

152
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.110
obviously going to the venue before the crowd got in there,
got to see the,

153
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.130
you know,
they got the boards,
you know,
with a fucking,
you know,

154
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.300
for the flies play in all that shit.
I saw that 76 83 championship banner,

155
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.220
the team that I would put up against the 96 bulls and I say it goes seven games,

156
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.350
you know,
um,
oh me and versus you got into it that night.

157
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.310
Holy Shit.
Arguing sports.
Good Lord.
He's like,
dude,

158
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.330
they're fucking 72 and 10.
You know,

159
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.940
he's one of those 1990s babies.

160
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.000
Like nothing happened in sports prior to 1990.
Nobody do.

161
00:09:56.001 --> 00:10:00.240
They had Pippin and a Jordan like that fucking shit.
It's like,
all right,

162
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:04.860
well they had doctor Jake in Moses Malone,
you know,

163
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:09.410
and Mo cheeks.
Fucking Andrew,
Tony and I have a Roni.
Right?

164
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.410
And that fucking skinny white dude coming off the Goddamn bench.

165
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.450
Who's like the defensive player of the year,
Dude,

166
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:19.380
Moses Malone underneath against Luc Longley,
Luc Longley.

167
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:24.240
It's gonna fucking fall.
He's,
we'd filed trouble every fucking game.
All right.

168
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.290
I'm not saying that the six is definitely would have fucking one,

169
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.410
but to just say that it's a foregone conclusion that the fucking 96 bowls of the

170
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:35.670
greatest fucking team ever,
they add,

171
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.110
there was no Celtics Lakers thing going on with the fucking,

172
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:43.740
it was a very uneven time.
You know,
and people will,
if you go,
Jordan was so good.

173
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.560
I'll give you a little bit of that.
All right.

174
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.980
But to when the fucking Celtics,

175
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:55.080
Lakers and sixers were all good in the fucking eighties and then the pistons

176
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:56.190
came along.
I mean to,

177
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.270
you had to fucking commit mass murder just to get to the finals.

178
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.970
People throwing clothes line.

179
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.780
Kurt Rambis has glasses flying across the fucking court.
It was a man's fuck.

180
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:10.740
And Gabe,
I'm being that old guy.
No,
I know it wasn't the nineties too,

181
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:15.480
but I'm just saying there wasn't any Kareem's there wasn't,

182
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.710
there wasn't like,
you know,

183
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.580
the Celtics and Lakers were fucking littered with Hall of famers on both sides,

184
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.150
you know,
I dunno.
What am I fucking Bill Simmons?

185
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:30.270
I don't know shit about fucking hoop.
I'm just saying,

186
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.110
I just hate how everybody,
Oh,
you,
you do this.
And He'd do that.
And,

187
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.550
and Moses and doctor Jay would just stand around watching them going,
Cima holy,

188
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.810
holy mackerel,
golly,
Chia,
these guys.
Good.
Um,

189
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.210
we get into that argument all the time and he also gets to the argument that
may,

190
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:50.670
where there's the greatest fucking middleweight of all time.
I'm like,

191
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.280
Paula Marvin Hagler.

192
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.000
The problem is Marvin Hagler,
sugar ray Leonard,
Tommy Hitman,

193
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.360
Hearns and Roberta Duran all fought at the same fucking time.

194
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:05.110
So they took losses in know,
and me,

195
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.510
I'm not saying that he would lose to all of those guys,

196
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.590
but he lose to at least one of them,
wouldn't he?
Oh,

197
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:14.800
I sound like an old man in a barbershop.
Um,

198
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.510
well I'll tell you it back in 1972 fucking voices,

199
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.340
junk dude,
junk doing all these fucking shows.
And uh,
I gotta be honest with you,

200
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.520
man.
I am,
I'm fucking,
I'm done with cigars man.

201
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.400
I smoked my last one in Philly and I didn't even want to smoke it.

202
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:33.880
I just did it cause,
uh,
we with a bunch of people and they,
you know,

203
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.260
they wanted to head over there,

204
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.790
but I didn't even tell you about the show so far as he goes up to open it

205
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.030
fucking crushes and uh,
which made me feel really good,
you know,
obviously,

206
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:50.650
cause the last time I did a really big show out there,
um,
you know,

207
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.980
things were a little more aggressive so to speak.
And I had a lot of people,

208
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.040
interviewers asking me about it cause I wasn't even thinking about it because

209
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:00.070
I've been back to Philly like six fucking times and I never had a problem,

210
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.670
but they just kept,
well this was a big show.
So you think that this one,
Huh?

211
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.710
Do you think they're going to treat you like an ea soul as they say in Philly?

212
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.330
He sold.
Um,
and then Joe matter,
Reese went up,
by the way,

213
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.330
who I hadn't seen,
you know,
he's a guy I started out with.
Uh,

214
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.350
when I first came to New York,

215
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.000
he moved to New York right around the time that I did,

216
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.750
came up from Philly and I came down from Boston.
And uh,
you know,

217
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.070
he's even funny that I remembered.
He absolutely fucking destroyed,
did dead on.

218
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.240
Uh,
what was it Harry callous saying his name right.
Um,

219
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.450
sounded exactly like him.

220
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.730
Now Philly people know him as the voice of the Phillies.

221
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:41.260
I knew him from NFL films taken over for the Voice of God and um,

222
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.900
he absolutely murdered in a,
I highly recommend you check that guy out.
Um,

223
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.800
if you get a chance and you can follow him on Twitter at the Joe matter.

224
00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:54.460
Reese m a t a.
R.
E.
S.
E the Joe Matter Reese,

225
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.270
I believe he's got a special or something like that coming out.
Um,

226
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.020
he was fucking hilarious.
And then when we would drive in a way,

227
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.570
he was doing a dead on Tony Soprano,

228
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.610
fucking dead on it.
Hell is unreal.

229
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.343
So,
uh,

230
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.970
we had a great time and then we ended up going out and a smoke some cigars.

231
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.030
I was a good boy.
I had one glass of Bourbon,
that was it.

232
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:23.980
I smoked a cigar and me and [inaudible] boy at each other's throats,

233
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.080
fucking arguing sports.
And um,
and then when we left,

234
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:33.690
we got cheese steak number two.
I'm a two to,

235
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.310
um,
uh,
where did we go?

236
00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:40.180
We went to something like Mike's Princess steaks or something like that.

237
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.870
I can't even remember.
I don't remember the name of it,
but,
um,

238
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.380
that one I thought the bread was good.
I thought everything was good,

239
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:51.770
but the steak,
I thought the steak wasn't as high quality.
Um,

240
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.620
as what I had at Cavanaugh's and I'm not even talking about,

241
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.890
was it Pat's and Geno's I got,
I've been to those fucking things.

242
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.880
I'm trying to go to the satellite ones.
Um,

243
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.620
I didn't even get to the ones that roast beef one was closed by seven,

244
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:08.390
so I never made it to that one.
But,
um,
I still at a good time,

245
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:12.830
but Jesus Christ,
what a fucking shit show.
If you want to see a shit show,

246
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:16.400
get a fucking cheese steak at two in the morning and Philadelphia on a Friday

247
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:20.750
night.
Good Lord.
People just sway in,

248
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:25.010
in the fucking breeze,
right?
And then the people I walked in with,

249
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:28.950
they were fucking hammered too.
I wasn't,
I'm fucking sober,
right?

250
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:33.020
Go walking in matter receipt goes like,
like way too loud,

251
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:38.021
like drunk voice because you go to the APP every fucking loser and filly out

252
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.240
here to get a cheese steak.
And I was like,
Joe,
Joe,
shut the fuck up.

253
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.970
Shut the fuck up.
You know?

254
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.710
And then first he goes,

255
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.140
he goes,
Jesus Christ,
he goes into the hair,

256
00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:56.360
cut on that fucking animal over there.
Way Too loud.

257
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.950
Way Too fucking loud.
I'm going to Paul Paul,
shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck.

258
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:04.490
So I was that guy.
I was basically not even designated driver,

259
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:08.450
like a designated Walker.
And everybody in there,
I swear to God,

260
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.800
was swaying.
They were so drunk.
Like 90% of the people in there was swaying.

261
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.240
I felt like I was on a fucking ship and I would some salty dog who had his sea

262
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:21.650
legs and everybody else was just sort of fucking floating around.
So anyways,

263
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:24.050
we get the cheese steaks.
I fuck up the order.

264
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.720
The guys all in patient with me and I was going to be,
oh,

265
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.980
you're doing that Philly thing?

266
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.500
Well you get all fucking impatient because I don't know how to go get it.

267
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:34.790
Give me two.
Wait,
give me a Wiz.
Wait,
no,
with nat.
You know,

268
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.530
so I'm,
so I got that little experience and then a,
as we were eating,

269
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.160
we were finishing up right at the,
the exact right time.

270
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.200
Like the,
uh,
the white dude with a,

271
00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:51.500
all black friends came walking in and he was trying to,
you know,

272
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.310
I don't know what he was trying to do.
He was unbelievably loud.

273
00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.140
He was being fucking rude and he was going to get all of his friends into a
fight

274
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.200
when we fucking left.
I was like,
let's get the fuck out of here.

275
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.880
And,
um,
I dunno,
I had a great time.
And he said,

276
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.060
I actually also had a really good breakfast place,
little piece,

277
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:16.880
I think it was called greasy spoon.
I fucking loved it.

278
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.320
And The lady behind the counter was a who works the day shift is a fucking riot.

279
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.460
I was sitting there and she got me my drink order and she goes,
you're ready?

280
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:29.030
And I was like,
yeah.
She goes,
what do you got?
And I just laughed.
I go,

281
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:33.560
I let me get two eggs.
Fucking what do you got?
What do you got?

282
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.870
I don't know.
Hunger pains.
Um,
so anyways,

283
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:43.400
so we had a great time there.
And,
uh,
as I said,

284
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.730
I can't recommend a going out to see Joe man Reese enough man.

285
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.270
Like he fucking blew me away versus he of course was great always.
But,
uh,

286
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.940
I always like throwing out new names on the podcast.
People.

287
00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:56.780
You could check out the Joe Matter Risa on Twitter.
Um,

288
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:57.730
<v 1>okay.</v>

289
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.310
<v 0>I hang on a punch in the scene.
You</v>

290
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.040
never can talk and do my password at the same fucking time.

291
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:08.180
If I went into my settings and figured out how to make the screensaver not come

292
00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:12.590
up every two fucking seconds.
Um,
all right,
let's do a couple of reads here.

293
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.430
Let's do a couple of reads and believe me,
that's all I have.

294
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.330
You know as much as you guys enjoy the Improv during the fucking

295
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.030
<v 1>okay,</v>

296
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.570
<v 0>the advertising here,
it's,
it's a costume.
Oh,
freckles.</v>

297
00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:31.300
Some money here.
Who gives a fuck?
I started doing this for fun,
right?

298
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.470
And I'm always going out.
Fuck Trunk Club everybody.
Jesus.

299
00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:38.800
It's a trunk full of clothes.
Shopping is awful.

300
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.960
And so are most of the people that you date,
you know,
until you find the one.

301
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.020
So chances are not only your shopping and not having a good time,

302
00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:49.990
you're with someone you don't even want to be with.
So it's doubly bad.

303
00:18:49.991 --> 00:18:53.050
Would it be nice if a whole trunk full of clothes showed up and you could,

304
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.900
you know,
open it up,
take the clothes out,

305
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.530
crawling and close the fucking lid so you can't hear that fucking person.

306
00:18:59.531 --> 00:19:01.720
You don't want to be with shopping is awful.

307
00:19:01.721 --> 00:19:06.460
Who has the patients who has the patience for crowded stores or the time to try

308
00:19:06.461 --> 00:19:09.220
on 10 pairs of pants that don't even fit?
Well,

309
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.120
<v 1>okay,</v>

310
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.940
<v 0>I'll never understand that sentence.
10 pairs of fucking pig.
Well,</v>

311
00:19:13.941 --> 00:19:15.970
well maybe if you knew your fucking size.

312
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

313
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.450
<v 0>You know what were you bullied for a month?
Um,
but here's the problem.</v>

314
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:24.000
You still want to look great.
That's what it is.

315
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:26.610
You're blaming can you don't have the strength to lift up the fucking pants.

316
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.110
Are you making fun of people with eating disorders?
Yes.

317
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.490
Um,
but here's the problem.
You still want to look great and what Trunk Club,

319
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.370
Trunk Club takes the hit unless you worked there and you've got to keep going

320
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:42.630
there the whole time going,
you know what?

321
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.000
I might come here but I don't shop here.

322

I'm above this and with trunk club you never have to set foot in a mall again.

323
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.400
Trunk Club takes the hassle man out of shopping by shipping you a trunk of

324
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:57.630

Bouloud to do my ids.
Me undies.

351
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.610
Your balls are dry.
Don't say they ate.
You got dead cotton.

352
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.130
Cotton all on your under carriage.
Oh,

353
00:21:49.131 --> 00:21:52.850
what did I say?
Carriage.
Carriage.
Parish.

354
00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.760
Marriage is marriage.
Yeah.

355
00:21:56.761 --> 00:22:01.080
I only carrot carriage.
Your balls won't stay ghetto.
Help your marriage.
Jesus.

356
00:22:01.081 --> 00:22:04.830
That took awhile.
Oh,
when you get somebody on these up against your balls,

357
00:22:04.831 --> 00:22:07.500
you'll have a weird smile on your face.
Oh yeah.

358
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.920
People think that you got some sort of problem already in her ear and balance.

359
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.220
All right,
me on does everybody,
we all know how sexy confidence can be.

360
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.930
Um,
and that confidence comes from being well to a certain point,

361
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.490
you know what I mean?
What's his face down there on the Carolina Panthers?

362
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.500
That fucking great quarterback there.
Cam Newton.
Yeah.
Guy Hams it up too much.

363
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.780
He hands it up.
Um,
I'm getting,
I'm already,
even though I love what I have to do,

364
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.270
you got to have the fucking sound down and after he throws for a touchdown or

365
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:43.230
raw,
especially if he runs for one,
you got to look away from the TV.

366
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.030
You know what I mean?
I just said that's stupid.
Ah,

367
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.600
all the fucking time.
And Taryn is fucking shirt open.

368
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.200
You know what's funny about that end zone celebration is as he gets older,

369
00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:58.260
you know he's going to have to fucking adjust that,
you know,

370
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.670
cause inevitably did dead gay beats the shit out of you and you just put coming

371
00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:06.050
old fucking man.
Right.
So he's going to,
rather than I am,

372
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.990
I'm predicting Cam Newton in his 17th season when he's breaking all the fucking

373
00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:12.690
records.
When he runs for a fucking touchdown,

374
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:15.900
rather than ripping open his Jersey doing the superman thing,
uh,

375
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:20.100
he's got a mind like putting on a sport coat.
That's what I would do.
Oh,

376
00:23:20.101 --> 00:23:21.140
what'd you bill?
What'd your,

377
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.920
they had never played a profession even fucking division 19.
Huh?

378
00:23:24.921 --> 00:23:28.950
You're freckled can't look in all sickly.
Where do you get off?

379
00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:32.790
Make it fun to that fucking superhero.
Well,
I dunno.
Well,

380
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.320
I'm an old grumpy man.
I really did enjoy that game though.
Let's get my,

381
00:23:37.321 --> 00:23:41.310
why am I still doing the undies thing?
I am right.
Um,

382
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.560
furniture is sexy.
That's right.

383
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.390
But how great can you feel when your wrinkling up and riding up you fucking

384
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:50.360
balls?
They're maybe getting into the folds.

385
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.400
He had clam me undies gets it.

386
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:56.180
And that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear for a

387
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:59.270
daily dose of confidence.
Uh,

388
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.130
Mandy's is made of modal model Moodle of fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

389
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.070
That's twice as soft as whatever underwear you're wearing right now.

390
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.430
Me and he says tons of colors and styles and the only place to get matching

391
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:13.940
pairs for men and women,
they even release a new design every month.

392
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.670
I wear whatever free pair that they give me and boy,

393
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:20.090
Oh boy do I love a free pair of comfortable underwear right up against my balls.

394
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.140
Plus we all know that paying for shipping sucks.
So me,
Andy says,

395
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.090
remove that from the creek equation.
Yeah,

396
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:28.730
rolled it into the price of the underwear.
We're not born yesterday.

397
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.730
All orders in the U S and Canada shipped for free.

398
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.980
Me undies even has a great money back guarantee.

399
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:35.570
If you don't love your first pair,

400
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.270
you get to keep it for free even though you don't love it.

401
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.280
You got to keep it forever.
You literally have nothing to lose.
Uh,

402
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.220
to sweeten the deal,
me,

403
00:24:44.221 --> 00:24:47.510
Andy's is offering you 20% off your first order at [inaudible] dot com slash

405
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:51.944

407
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.250
And so that we,
uh,
they know that we sent you,

408
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.370
you know what that just reminded me of?

409
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:04.760
I don't know why everybody freaking out about that fucking missile that the navy

410
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:09.440
shut off.
You know,
this is the beginning of world war three.
Wow.

411
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.340
Great,
great.
And then you know what?
We're all going to be dead.

412
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.270
So what are you fucking worried about?
You know what I mean?

413
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.570
I would be much more worried if somebody released one Cobra into the fucking Los

414
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.220
Angeles area and I knew that it was somewhere in the hills where I hiked.

415
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.090
If there was one cobra there,
I would be way more fucking nervous.

416
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.560
Like if they said right now we have a special news flash,

417
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.670
China has just shot a bunch of nuclear weapons,

418
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.690
they will be here in six minutes.
So get your affairs in order.

419
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.280
I would go over to the fridge and I'd get out of pine ice cream and I'd sit

420
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:53.450
there,
you know,
you know,
like a little kid sits in a big charity,

421
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.310
kicks his legs up and down like a scissor.
That's what I would do.
Oh boy.

422
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:02.810
Oh boy.
I'm going to get vaporized of getting what everybody wants.

423
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.100
A painless death.
That's what you're looking at when you see the nuclear weapons,

424
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.510
which you're looking at is a painless death.
I'm all about them.

425
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.620
I love the warhead.
This,
I'm a big bore,
had fed,
you know,

426
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.090
I liked that were puffing each other's chests up.
You know what I mean?
China's,

427
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.540
you know,
where like why I oughta,
you know,

428
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:28.040
in China is like why we oughta and then Korea is like,
Hey,

429
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:32.990
what about us?
We still count,
right?
I don't give a fuck.
I really don't.

430
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.730
Um,
you know,
I'm a grizzled veteran.
This shit,

431
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.090
I grew up in the tail end of the Cold War.
I remember that Shit,
right?

432
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.290
Everybody says that gun to do it and then they never do okay until they do.

433
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.300
And when they deal,
you're not going to know it because it's going to be over.

434
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.530
At least I won't know it.

435
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.170
That's one of the great things about being in a targeted city.

436
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.590
You're going to have no idea that world war three even app it,

437
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.780
you just going to wake up,
you know,
wherever the fuck you go.
Oh,

438
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:06.030
maybe you just become part of the radiation.

439
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.140
You know that the next people are going to climb out of,

440
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.620
I told you guys that might,
that's my theory,
right?

441
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.100
That water is the nuclear waste from the last people that fucked up this planet.

442
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.080
You know?
And we're actually,
these fucking mutants were actually ugly as shit.

443
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:25.270
We just don't know any better because we're attracted to what we see because we

444
00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:28.560
were all fucking arrogant.
Right?
We've got the ego.
You look at me,

445
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.910
my ego came out and fucking for six minutes,
you don't know who I am.

446
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:35.370
Or then I could say I'm Elvis and everyone would believe it.
Now Bill,

447
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:38.790
they wouldn't you fucking dope.
Um,

448
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.030
yeah,
so I don't,
I don't know what the big deal is.

449
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:46.200
And it was also funny to watch to read that and uh,

450
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.850
listen to say that they were saying everybody in California was freaking out and

451
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.490
then I call my wife and she doesn't even bring it up.

452
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.430
Probably didn't even know what happened.

453
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.970
Cause at this point nobody really watches the news anymore.

454
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.460
Remember the news used to come up but to do,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to,

455
00:28:03.461 --> 00:28:07.050
to fuck everybody watched the fucking news.
You had you guy,
who do you like?

456
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:08.270
And it was all men,
right?

457
00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:12.000
Cause men tell you what's going on in the world despite what these ladies stink.

458
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.180
You know what I mean?
That's why I stopped watching the news.

459
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.820
Second I saw a woman news anchor.
I was like this.

460
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:20.460
Brian does know what she's talking about.
She does.

461
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:23.730
She only got half the information because whoever it was telling it to her was

462
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:27.120
probably thinking about fucking her.
And he left out half the information.

463
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.883
Okay.

464
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.210
That's the problem with female news anchors and I've been saying it for years

465
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.240
and you can hide behind your sexist.

466
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.340
He's a sexist comment.
All right.

467
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.940
There's not an ounce of comedy in this right now.

468
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.520
I'm just trying to get bloggers and easy week.
Uh,
I am dead serious,

469
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.820
you know,
I don't even know Dick.
Just Connie Chung still do it.

470
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:54.301
You know it's funny.

471
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:57.480
It was Connie Chung did the real news and then her husband was doing that.

472
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.130
When was that fucking show?
Was it hard copy?
He had that sound.

473
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:03.420
That sound like a fucking Matthew.

474
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.560
What's that thing behind the door that doorstop up open?

475
00:29:05.561 --> 00:29:08.550
The thing he played with before there was the internet and you just sit there

476
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:09.384
for hours,
go home.

477
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.690
That's a hard noise to imitate.
You just sit there fucking with dad.
Right.

478
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.020
He was on his show that that was the sound effect as they went into every story.

479
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.760
And Connie right was actually talking about real shit that was,
well at least,

480
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:30.600
you know the edited real shit,
our version of the real shit that was going on.

481
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.680
You know,
I would love to him and sit in there and they both talked about,

482
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.770
you know,
the news stories that they were excited about.
You know,

483
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:44.770
she was reporting about the Berlin Wall coming down and he was talking about to

484
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:49.030
some paper boy who fucked the postman's wife.
You know what I mean?

485
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.550
I Dunno.
I just,
I guess I just find relationships interesting.
All right.

486
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.220
Legal Zoom,
everybody we have,
we're still doing advertising by the way.

487
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:58.540
Legal Zoom,
everyone,
you know,

488
00:29:58.541 --> 00:30:03.190
you shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive hourly rates

489
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.540
when you need legal help.
Yeah.
What are you in the drunk tank?
You're at home,

490
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:11.920
you should have your fucking choice.
But the legal system is so complicated.

491
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.870
What are the choices do you have when you need help with your business or want

492
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:20.730
to protect your family?
Start with legal zoom.

493
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.770
they make it easy for more than a decade.

494
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:28.771
They provided a way for regular people like you and me to confidently navigate

495
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:31.300
the legal system.
I'm not regular like you guys.

496
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.770
I could say I'm Willie Nelson and they would believe it.
Um,
legal zooms,

497
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.980
not a law firm.
And that's how they provide such great value.

498
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.380
They don't rely on charging you by the hour.

499
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.960
Instead you'll get transparent pricing.

500
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:47.230
And customer reviews so you know exactly what you're getting up front.

501
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.210
If he need help with your incorporations Llcs,
trademarks,
last,
wills,

502
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:55.150
living trusts,
and more legal sense,
the smart choice.

503
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.910
They've got the right people on hand to answer your questions,

504
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:01.720
not the wrong people.
They got the right people,
and if you need legal advice,

505
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.560
their network of independent attorneys can provide the most straight forward

506
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:08.620
guidance you need in most states.
All right.

507
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.500
Don't let legal hurdles become an excuse.
Stop quitting in life.

All right,
stamps.com man,

512
00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:36.331
I thought I only had two stamps.com getting your mailing and shipping can seem

513
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:39.580
like a no win situation.

514
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.030
Going to the post office takes up valuable time leasing a postage meter.

515
00:31:44.031 --> 00:31:47.860
It's expensive.
They've got multiyear commitments and hidden fees.

516
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.760
You don't need that shit.
Luckily I know a better way

517
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.430
why should really say is luckily I can sort of read out loud because stamps.com

518
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.270
knows a better way.

519
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.250
Buy and print official US postage for any letter or package right from your own

520
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:06.220
desk using your own computer and printer.

521
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.460
Even the special postage discounts,
she can't find it.

522
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:13.300
The Post Office that is a fragment of it's a fragment.

523
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:16.720
If I read that even gets special postage discounts,
she can't find it.

524
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:17.554
The post office,

525
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:22.270
he can save at least 50% compared to a postage meter and you'll avoid the avoid

526
00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:27.190
those time consuming trips to the post office.
Uh,
I use,

527
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:33.060
um,
I use stamps.com anytime I send my fucking posters out.
Ah,

528
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:37.360
shit,
I just realized I'm gonna be late for something Ghana worst.
Uh,

529
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.890
anytime I send my posters out,

530
00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:42.450
I that stuff in on if I could figure out how to use this,
I bet you guys can,

531
00:32:42.451 --> 00:32:46.790
unless you're unbelievably stupid.
At which point,
um,

532
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.070
I wouldn't even make funny.
How about that?
Don't wait.

533
00:32:50.071 --> 00:32:53.010
Go to stamps.com before you do anything else,
you click on that microphone.

534
00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:57.300
At the top of the homepage and you type in Burr,
that's stamps.com enter burr.

535
00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.920
All right,
so the next night I went up and I did a,

536
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.920
I did this.
The sands casino is proud to percent.
Oh,
wonderful.
New Show.

537
00:33:07.921 --> 00:33:11.970
I'm mad at his music and not man is Frank Sinatra.

538
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.470
Oh,
you people get in my room.
Come fly with me.

539
00:33:16.471 --> 00:33:21.270
You big fat fucking whore.
Um,
you guys ever hear that album?
Oh,

540
00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:25.750
what an album that is just with the count Basie orchestra.
Um,

541
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.920
there's a casino,
there's a town,

542
00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:33.660
I know where the hipsters go called bedrock,
but doodoo twist twist.

543
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.300
There's a Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.

544
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.730
There was a casino in there that pulls in like $1 million a day.
They make a,

545
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.150
they make bank.
I walked in there,
I got there early.

546
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.720
I talked to this fucking Zombie.
I,

547
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.530
she must've hated her job.
I don't know what it was,
but she,

548
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.010
the way she was talking,
it was like that.
Just that sing songs every way.

549
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.280
That'd be like,
yeah,
where's the gym?
She'd be like,
okay.

550
00:33:59.281 --> 00:34:02.400
The Jimmy's right down the end of the hall.
And you did Debbie,
Debbie,
Debbie,

551
00:34:02.401 --> 00:34:03.234
Debbie.

552
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.020
What Times Checkout Bababa we were [inaudible] just going like up and bike.

553
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:15.620
Like she was a robot and someone just randomly like programmed the same

554
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.750
inflection arc.

555
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.260
She started down low and then she went up high and then she ended up here and

556
00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:25.390
then she came back down.
Um,

557
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.910
and I went in there,
right?
I got a Budweiser,

558
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.950
I sat down and this place was fucking mobbed.

559
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

560
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.530
<v 0>Mobbed.
I noticed you so many dirty jackets in my life.</v>

561
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:46.500
Mobs with white people,
Asians,
black people,

562
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.300
any kind of people you could think of.

563
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

564
00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:53.530
<v 0>Was in their place was fucking mobbed.</v>

565
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.860
And I'm sitting in one Saturday afternoon and I was sitting there going,

566
00:34:56.861 --> 00:35:00.850
is there like a fucking championship fight?
Just let out.

567
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.570
This is fucking unbelievable.
And I talked to one of the owners and he said,

568
00:35:04.571 --> 00:35:07.900
no dude,
this fucking place does a business.

569
00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:12.220
Like it's one of the top casinos in the country.
And uh,

570
00:35:12.221 --> 00:35:13.450
I'll tell you what else it is.

571
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.860
It's one of the top venues I ever performed that I had the best fucking time.

572
00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:21.550
I don't know what it is.
Just certain rooms you walk into,
they just,

573
00:35:21.551 --> 00:35:24.850
they got that magic right.
You just,

574
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.920
you stand to the side of the stage and just feel it.

575
00:35:26.921 --> 00:35:30.160
Like this is going to be fucking great.
And,
um,

576
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:36.630
I think I did like it.
I might have done an hour and a half on that one.
Oh,

577
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:40.660
such a fucking time.
Such a great time.
Um,

578
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.980
you know,
I still,

579
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.440
funny I talked about trying to get into the wells Fargo Center and,

580
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.860
and talk about the show.
So actually got to do a show,
um,

581
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.490
at that arena and um,

582
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.830
Paul and Joe did great and I walked out and a crowd was nice.

583
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.880
It was so funny,
man.
Philly's like males choking with Versie like Philly's,

584
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:04.860
like the only city that you'd go to,
what you have,
you need a game plan.
Like,

585
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:09.800
okay,
if this happens,
I'm going to do this or be ready to do this,
blah,

586
00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:12.950
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
whatever.
But the crowd couldn't have been,
uh,

587
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.520
any better and everybody who worked there was fucking coolest shit.
And,
uh,

588
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:22.490
I was actually bonding with the f one of the flyers fan.
Um,

589
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.260
security guys because their team's not doing that well either.

590
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.740
Fucking Bruins drop like three out of four,
but we won the last one.

591
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.200
That's all right.
And,
uh,

592
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.010
we fucked up and then we blew the Canadians game.
Courageous,

593
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.020
uncharacteristically taking a dump penalty.
But,
um,
but I just,

594
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:42.480
you know,
I had no idea what to expect this year,

595
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:45.690
so I thought we were gonna just going to get fucking smoked because we had all

596
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:48.570
these new guys and,
uh,
the plane good.
You know,

597
00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:52.140
I don't mind if we lose a game because we fucked up,
cause that can be fixed.

598
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.950
It's just when you're just losing because you just simply can't even compete.

599
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:57.360
And I have not seen that this year,

600
00:36:57.361 --> 00:37:02.361
so I'm still a very optimistic that we're gonna make the playoffs and now we're

601
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:05.310
going to have a good showing.
I think it's going to even be better next year.

602
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.440
So anyways,
so I fly down to Daytona,
right.
And,
um,

603
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.540
oh,
Yannis Pappas open for me on that last one.
You know,

604
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.380
he went out and fucking crushed it.
Um,

605
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.360
actually he really fucking crushed it and went over a little bit,
so,

606
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.700
and he felt it was all apologetic.
So I fucking,

607
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:30.300
I broke his balls for like a good 10 minutes saying I was never going to use

608
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:33.480
them again.
Went over by like fucking three minutes.
I was like,
no,
no,
no,

609
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:37.050
you did great.
Uh,
but you're one and done.
It's over.
You're dead to me.

610
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.180
So anyways,
I went down to Daytona.
I'd never been to Daytona,

611
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:46.290
didn't even realize that.
And A,
I've always wanted to go to the Daytona 500.

612
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:47.124
Why wouldn't you?

613
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:52.320
Why wouldn't you want to see people as fucking brilliant as they are in pit row

614
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.380
and then stand in the being in the stands of some of the dumbest people in the

615
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:59.660
nation.
Just that whole mic DLT,
that juxtaposition.
Huh?

616
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.290
Be fucking phenomenal.

617
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Fucking people trying to shave off milliseconds thousandth of a second.

618
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:13.470
Whatever they're trying to do by adjusting some God knows what.
Meanwhile,

619
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:16.710
me and a bunch of morons are just standing up there.
Hope it's somebody crashes.

620
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.990
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
so I was like,
man,

621
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:25.890
I hope I have time to fucking check out the speedway,
but I don't have a,

622
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:30.000
I don't have a car.
So I'm walking off the plane and you know,
in the,

623
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.420
in the airports they have those floor to ceiling windows.

624
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.350
As I walk off the jet way and coming to the place where you fucking wait,

625
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.510
I looked across the,
uh,
the,

626
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.770
to the other gate that was directly across and out the window and there was the

627
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.040
fucking speedway.
The speedway is right next to the airport.

628
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.180
It was fucking cool as shit.
And when I was over at my hotel,
I heard,
um,

629
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.360
I heard a this car fucking driving around the track,
you know,
testing,

630
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:01.360
God knows what hour it was really fucking cool.
So hopefully I'll get back there.

631
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:03.970
And I performed at an aeronautical schools,

632
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.230
so everybody in the crowd was either a pilot was in maintenance,

633
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.010
homeland security or uh,

634
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.960
they were actually learning how to design airplane parts,
our aircraft parts,

635
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:19.390
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
Um,

636
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.850
and I had a great time talking to them,
especially afterwards.

637
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.250
And the dean of students was actually a veteran.
I forget what he said.
He flew,

638
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.680
uh,
see something or the gunship and asked him if he,
if when he flies now,

639
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:38.320
is it a lot more enjoyable cause nobody's shooting at him.
He goes,

640
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:42.440
I don't do it anymore.
And I go,
wow.
Oh well why not?

641
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.800
Why not you just sick of it?
He goes,
Nah man.
He goes,
I got shit.
You know,
he goes,

642
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:50.510
when he gets shot down,
he goes,
I got a metal in my knee and my shoulder.
He goes,

643
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.810
cause yeah,
cause you go down once in one of those,
you don't want to do it again.

644
00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:00.400
So I just sat there with my jaw on the ground listening to his stories,

645
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:03.430
but I could not have had a better time.
Um,

646
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.130
I could not have had a better time at that,
uh,
at that school.

647
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.560
And uh,
Vanessa fraction opened up.
She fucking destroyed.
Um,

648
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.590
it's just a great time.
It's just a great fucking run.

649
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:20.270
I just did not get any God damn sleep.
So,
um,
on,

650
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.550
let me read the questions here and let me get on with my fucking life here.
Um,

651
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.730
all right.
Other language.
Um,

652
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.060
see,
hey bill,
I'm 23 and my wife will never be

653
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.310
complete.
He will complete,

654
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.610
complete without advice from 50.

655
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.430
What?
Hey Bill.
I'm 23 and my okay.

656
00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:53.720
Other language.
I'm from Czechoslovakia,
right?
I'm gonna do my best to read this.

657
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.340
MMM.
Oh,
maybe I guess I'll just going to read it how you wrote it.
Hey Bill.

658
00:40:59.341 --> 00:41:04.341
I'm 23 and my life will never be complete without advice from 50 yo out of

659
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:10.150
shape.
Baldhead I moved to England just because of standup.

660
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.160
Sorry for writing like a total dick.
But this is my second language.

661
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.930
I used to be good comedian back home,
Czech Republic,

662
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.220
but I wanted more,

663
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.820
ever since I moved to England I realized I'm not so funny in English.

664
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.340
I want to give it three more years,

665
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.190
at least four when I'm able to do open mikes.

666
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.490
Do you think that non native speaker can break in hard work in?

667
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:38.770
Um,
yeah.

668
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.590
Yakov schmear enough made an absolute fortune.

669
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.090
Um,
I do.
I think you definitely can't.

670
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.030
It's not going to hurt you look to it.

671
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.430
If you can figure out being from the Czech Republic,

672
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:56.990
if you can figure out how to be funny in English and make those cons in England

673
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:58.610
left,
you know,

674
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.480
if you can make those fucking people love when you go back to your party Europe,

675
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.780
you're going to be the king.
And I'll tell you something right now,
dude,

676
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:08.150
there's nothing wrong with being the king of the Czech Republic.

677
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:11.030
Is it all those fucking smoking hot chicks over there?

678
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.920
You'll fucking destroy dude.
If everybody in your country loves you,
you'll,

679
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:20.720
you'll be a fucking zillionaire.
It's over.
And who are you competing against?

680
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.220
Who's the Czech Republic?
Richard Pryor or George Carlin.

681
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.970
What's the competition to you getting in at the ground floor?

682
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.440
You could be the Lenny Bruce over there,
right?
I think it's a great fucking move.

683
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:34.790
And I think you're going to do well,

684
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.550
just hang in there because no matter where you're at,

685
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:41.210
you're going to be struggling,
right?
And while you're at it,
you're in England,

686
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:44.210
you got this cool fucking accent,
right?

687
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.770
Maybe you can take out your old fucking checks to there and stick it between

688
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:51.770
some chicks,
beef curtains or whatever the fuck they say over there.
All right.

689
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:55.370
Eastern Europe.
Hello,
small tits.

690
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:58.970
Billy boy you are teasing with coming to eastern Europe sometime ago.

691
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:01.490
Would you consider coming to Poland?
Absolutely,
I would.

692
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.260
I was told the south southern part of Poland's great and up north along the

693
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:09.830
water.
I would be thrilled to see you live in my country.

694
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:14.240
I'm a huge fan as is everyone who listens to you obviously.
Um,

695
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.750
less of my ego says sincerely go fuck yourself.
Also,

696
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:20.900
I remember you watching you and breaking bad and I wasn't aware of you being

697
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:24.970
such an awesome person and thinking of you and every time you parked on the

698
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.300
screen I was like,
who was dead fan?
Go look and do to fuck you.

699
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:34.160
Um,
anyway,
I,
I,
you know,
I can't even,
is that a compliment or an,

700
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:37.050
I don't even know.
I would definitely come to Poland.
Um,

701
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:40.720
and I definitely want to do eastern Europe and I was talking to,
uh,

702
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.770
my agent the other day about how we got to do Europe.

703
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.990
I do whatever you got a year.
So I didn't do it this year.

704
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.840
I'm going to do it next year.
Um,

705
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.330
I do whatever every other year when I get my act together.
You know what I mean?

706
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.230
People going over there in a second fucking language,
you know,

707
00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:56.100
in some of those places,

708
00:43:56.101 --> 00:44:00.750
people listening to me speaking English and they don't speak English as a first

709
00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:03.840
language.
I got to make sure that like,
you know,

710
00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:08.580
I can't be just riffing and fucking around.
I can do that in this country.

711
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.430
I can put together an act,
but I'm not flying all the way over there to do that.

712
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.720
So I got to make sure that during my off year between specials,
this is the,

713
00:44:15.721 --> 00:44:18.330
this is how it works.
I put the shit together,

714
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.490
I'll take us through the whole thing.

715
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.790
I do my special and then immediately I start doing comedy clubs.

716
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.600
Any place I can get up at and I get it in an hour,
four to shit that I can say.

717
00:44:27.601 --> 00:44:31.020
By the time my special comes up and then I honed that thing to the point,

718
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.030
it's an acceptable level and then I,

719
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:37.680
I start torn with it on the road and then I just start dropping jokes is better.

720
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:40.560
Jokes come in and then when I get it really ready to go,

721
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.310
then I do the European shit and then I come back and I take the special and then

722
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:49.110
that's it.
Then I started all over again and it never ends.
All right.

723
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.100
Here's something about Cleo.
All right,
dear Billy Bruford,

724
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:57.900
I have a theory on cleos behavior and an explanation explanation for her peeing

725
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:58.621
in the house.
All right.

726
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:01.800
For those of you who didn't listen last time or for those of you in the future

727
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:05.370
who just grabbed this one out of a whole slew of them,
how are you?

728
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.960
Was there a nuclear holocaust?
Well,
great.
You survived it.

729
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.210
Are you in your bunker now?
Any more cans of beans?
Can you eat?
You can't.

730
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.750
What's it like living in a world without ESPN that at booboo all,

731
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.901
you know what,

732
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:24.420
if you're actually in a bunker right now in the future and you're listening to

733
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:28.140
me,
I should probably be a little more positive,
right?
I should predicate Jess.

734
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:33.141
What makes that little lowland Danky can survive a meltdown from a nuclear

735
00:45:34.141 --> 00:45:34.974
plant.

736
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:40.080
Everyone knows he's got sores all over his fucking face cause he went,

737
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.800
uh,
he didn't stay a dark brown.

738
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.140
That's why you'll be in that.
What do they usually Barry,
that's those,

739
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:52.741
those things.

740
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:56.250
What they stick all the drugs in that sit on the wharfs and they stick them on

741
00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:59.670
the back of trucks.
Freight,
freight fucking thinks,
I dunno,

742
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.920
whatever they dealt with during the second season of the wire.
Anyway,
so,

743
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:08.970
um,
the fuck was,
I talk all the fucking dog.

744
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.750
So my dog,
um,
has been having bladder issues every once in a while.

745
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:16.650
She just like peas,
the no fucking reason.
And um,

746
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.290
our doctor was saying that it's because,
you know,

747
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.280
she was spayed and that's one of the things that happens sometimes once they get

748
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:23.880
older.

749
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.850
So this guy has a theory as to why she's been peeing a little bit in the house.

750
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.920
She says,
he says,
I'm,
are he or she?
What do we got here?
I don't know.
All right.

751
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:37.120
I'm a lifelong dog lover.
Um,

752
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.960
I fucked my first dog when I was four.
Sorry.
It was an easy job.

753
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.170
I'm a lifelong dog lover and,
and own to have my own.

754
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:47.910
Remember last week you commented on how when you got back from tours,

755
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:51.780
she slept all night and then was sleeping in your office while he did the

756
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:56.190
podcast like she was on morphine.
Totally knocked out.
It's because she loves you.

757
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.450
You are the one person who takes her on hikes and gives her baths,
et cetera.

758
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.810
She's probably anxious when you're away and when you come home.

759
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:06.420
She's so relieved and relaxed that she just passes out.

760
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:11.220
Now that I know I'm asking about the peeing here,
sir.
All right.

761
00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:13.650
Don't be at [inaudible] apples with oranges.

762
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.880
Now you're about to leave for tour and she's peeing in the house.

763
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.330
Dogs are very intuitive and can picked up on the littlest thing.

764
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.120
She's picked up on signs that you'll be leaving again.

765
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:25.950
And as a result is feeling anxious,

766
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.000
which is causing her to pee inside beside the house.

767
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:34.540
She made,
she's peed inside,
like go inside of her.

768
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.870
Just a thought,
but it could be what's going on.

769
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:40.710
I think that's a great fucking theory.
Good luck and see.

770
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.990
See you next weekend in New York.
All right.
You know what?
Thank you.

771
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.450
Is fucking phenomenal advice.

772
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.830
Way better than anything I've ever said on this podcast.
All come on,
Bill.
Don't,

773
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:54.190
don't beat up on yourself.
Well,
I know.
All right.

774
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.570
Eight 89 year old tries to stand up for the very first time.

775
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.810
Um,
a bill.

776
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:04.420
Did you see the article and the video of the old guy trying stand up for the

777
00:48:04.421 --> 00:48:06.340
first time at the first,

778
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.570
at first the video came out and he was praised and it came out that he lifted

779
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:15.571
the jokes and some people turned on him saying it wasn't that big of a deal if

780
00:48:15.791 --> 00:48:17.810
he memorized them.
I feel both ways.

781
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.010
Seems like he could have put together a couple of one liners with all of the old

782
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:24.140
people downtime.
He has other,
pardon me?

783
00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:27.130
He says he just wanted to stand in those shoes and see what it feels like.

784
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:31.240
Like if you started flying a helicopter at 89 but had the instructor takeoff.

785
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:36.550
So he just did the cruising around in the air.
Thoughts?
Um,
yeah man.

786
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:37.360
Well first of all,

787
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.590
he probably came from the Henny Youngman error when most of those guys,
you know,

788
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:44.350
not saying Henny Youngman stole,

789
00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:48.160
but like back then like people just did street jokes.
Two guys walk into a bar,

790
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.810
but a,
I actually think it's Kinda cool that an 89 [inaudible] 89 years old,

791
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:57.160
so he got to feel like what it was like to do stand up.

792
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.500
He got to feel like what it was like to be famous.

793
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.600
He got to feel what it felt like.

794
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:05.950
He got so famous that there was the backlash he got called a thief.

795
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.460
He got the whole fucking thing.
Look at him.

796
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:13.540
His second set's going to be called his big comeback like Travolta and fucking a

797
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.030
pulp fiction.
I think it's wonderful.
I'm,
I'm,

798
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.450
I'm glad that he did it and I don't have any problem with them going.

799
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:23.620
That's a fucking adorable to see an old guy go update 89 telling old jokes.

800
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.660
Jamar,
I,
you're not a fucking,
you got to know you have no blood in your heart.

801
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:32.050
If he didn't think that,
that was adorable.
All right.
Corporations,

802
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.910
a bill.

803
00:49:33.911 --> 00:49:38.911
I was doing some fall cleanup in my yard because the maple trees surrounding my

804
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:43.120
house likes to leave a nice message during this time where I,
where I live,

805
00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:46.630
the city requires that you put leaves and grass clippings and giant paper bags

806
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.450
that you can purchase it.
Various stores.
When the bags are filled up,

807
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:52.060
we set them out on the curb and they picked up during the week.

808
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.720
They usually costs around $3 for a bundle of about five bags.

809
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.670
One thing I noticed on these bags,

810
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.080
which every store you buy them from their logo and or slogans or printed all

811
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:06.550
over the bags like it,
like had a home improvement store.
Um,

812
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.350
when they are sitting at the curb,

813
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:12.280
the store logo is there for everyone to see who drives a walks by to see.

814
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:17.160
And that's brilliant.
I realize that because of this,
uh,

815
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.670
I am advertising for that store for free or actually paying them to advertise

816
00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:23.870
for them.
Uh,

817
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:27.070
this is almost the same as if you bought a car from a dealership,

818
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.740
put in an emblem or a license plate.
The cover the car with the dealership law.

819
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.470
My God,
this is killing my brain just didn't get enough sleep.

820
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.400
If I could find bags that were blank,
I would get those.
But I have not.

821
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.270
I thought to tell you about this because of your bit about automated cash

822
00:50:43.271 --> 00:50:48.271
registers at the checkout stores and was wondering what your take was on

823
00:50:48.341 --> 00:50:52.510
something like this.
Love your comedy.
Thanks.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,
you know,

824
00:50:52.511 --> 00:50:56.680
I'm not going to promise something like that.
Who gives a fuck?
You know,

825
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.590
you went in,
you needed bags,
they had bags,
she gave them to them,

826
00:50:59.591 --> 00:51:03.250
they put the names on them.
I don't give a shit,
you know,

827
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:09.220
it's no skin off my fucking back.
My thing is working for free.
Um,

828
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:12.340
I guess technically you could be a jerk and be like,

829
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:16.360
you owe me money for advertising out in front of my house.
You know,

830
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.960
start renting out the space at the end of your driveway.

831
00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:22.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

832
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.170
<v 0>I mean,
that might be a thing in the future.
You know,</v>

833
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.320
a way to make money from home,
like rent out your mailbox,

834
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.260
let people put their logo on it.
Um,
it'd be hilarious.

835
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:35.120
And you have to start whoring out your kids.
Listen,

836
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.250
you call up like Nestle and just say,
listen,
my oldest daughter,

837
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.790
I'm not trying to be weird,
but she's really hot and everybody wants to fuck her.

838
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:47.060
So they're always driving by the house.
So I was thinking,

839
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:51.200
what if you guys put like your little fucking hot cocoa sign on the side of my

840
00:51:51.201 --> 00:51:55.460
mailbox?
You know,
so all those guys,
you know,
they'll think that all,
man,

841
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:59.180
if I buy this hot cocoa that they could fuck my daughter and they're not going

842
00:51:59.181 --> 00:51:59.980
to do this.

843
00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:02.030
There's no way they're going to do it because she's already banging on one of

844
00:52:02.031 --> 00:52:05.090
our teachers.
You see what I'm saying?
Nestle.
And they'd be like,
all right man.

845
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:08.990
We'll fuck it.
Do it.
All right.
No relationship.
Hey Bill,
I need your insight.

846
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.710
I just started hanging out with this girl who's,
who's 17 years younger than me.

847
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.110
Yes,
we have had sex,

848
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:19.190
but we have not had blood sex.

849
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.620
<v 1>What the fuck?</v>

850
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.400
<v 0>I'm 45 and she's 28.</v>

851
00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:31.610
Every time I tried to calm her down for that kind of action or left leg starts

852
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:35.210
spasming out and she freezes up.
Should I dumper,

853
00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.630
uh,
or,
or move on?

854
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.910
Oh Shit.
Okay.

855
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.970
Just mark the entire thing that I do at the end of my podcast and God damn.

856
00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:55.590
And I loved it.
I loved every second of it.
Um,
all right,

857
00:52:55.591 --> 00:52:58.890
well that's the podcast for this week.
Um,

858
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:00.930
I don't know what to tell you.

859
00:53:00.931 --> 00:53:05.580
I'm in New York to do my final show of the year gear,

860
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.430
my final road gig of the year.
All right.

861
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.930
And I have already mentally,
I'm already drinking eggnog.

862
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.130
That's how excited I am about being home for the fucking holidays.
Um,

863
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.480
I'm going to be performing at Madison Square Garden,

864
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.610
believe it or not this Saturday,
November 14th.
And um,

865
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:30.240
for those of you who saw,

866
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:34.470
I put out a teaser for F is for family that's coming out on December 18th

867
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:39.440
everybody.
And we put out a little teaser there and,
uh,

868
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:44.480
the rumor mill is that the trailer's going to be coming out soon and where you

869
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:48.160
can actually right now it's just sort of a little thing just to get out.

870
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:52.180
You know,
they do it again.
We're,
we're fucking getting you salivating for it.
Um,

871
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.680
but I'm really excited about that and check this shit out.

872
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.530
I rented a drum kit,
um,

873
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:03.330
to be set up at Madison Square Garden during the day.

874
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:04.171
So during the day,

875
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:08.280
me and some of my friends are going to go in and jam in an empty Madison Square

876
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.780
Garden and uh,
it's gonna be fucking,

877
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.650
it's going to be fucking ridiculous.
It's going to be fucking ridiculous.

878
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:19.650
And we're all like fucking old white guys.

879
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:24.240
So we're just geeking out sending a set list,
you know,

880
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.640
would you do war pigs?
Just all this whole light guy music,

881
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.530
although that stands the test of time,
black sabbath us.

882
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.030
I challenge any fucking kid today.

883
00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:38.490
I don't give a fuck how many mouse heads people have.

884
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.940
If you put it on black sabbath,
there's no fucking way you can appreciate that,

885
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:45.840
the level of quality and that music.
So we're going to be doing that.
And uh,
yes,

886
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:48.450
I will definitely take some video.
Um,

887
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.000
you know what's really cool is there was a buddy of mine forever.

888
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:55.260
I've been trying to jam with them and uh,
it just never worked out.

889
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.600
So I finally called them.
I say,
Hey man,
I'm in New York.

890
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.710
You want to get together Saturday?
And he goes,
yeah,
come on out to my place.

891
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.700
I moved out to jersey,
I got to rehearsal space and I said,
Nah man,

892
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:08.010
I got a better space.
And you know,

893
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:09.900
he's proud of his space and I know it's the shit.

894
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:13.410
So he writes back and he's like,
what the fuck?
And then I hit him with it.
Hey,

895
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:18.060
let's go fucking play it at Madison Square Garden.
He fucking freaked.

896
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.050
Fucking freaked.
Um,
it's gonna be awesome.

897
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:24.570
And for those of you who are already cringing,

898
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.550
thinking that I'm easing my way too,

899
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:31.551
at some point playing drums before or after one of my shows during a live

900
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:35.730
performance,
I would never do that to you.
Okay?
Just know I would never do that.

901
00:55:35.731 --> 00:55:40.440
No that I know that I stink.
All right.
I know that I stake,

902
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.610
I know that this is just a hobby.
I know that I will never make a living.
Okay,

903
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:47.790
so fucking relax.
All right.

904
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:52.530
I'm just a middle aged white dude.
Fucking being a geek.

905
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:56.070
I'm allowed to do that.
All right.
Okay,

906
00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.110
well that's the podcast for this week.
It's a little bit short,
but a,

907
00:56:00.111 --> 00:56:04.380
I'm a little short on time this week.
I'll make it up to you on Thursday.
Um,

908
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:08.790
that's it.
Don't take any shit.
Go fuck yourselves,
and I'll check it on Thursday.
