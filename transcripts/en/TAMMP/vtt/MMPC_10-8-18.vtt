00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:07.680
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for a Monday.
Um,
October eight,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.140
2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.490
How's it going?
I am a,
I am good.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.520
How are you?
Oh my God,
that is great.
Get barely hear myself.

6
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.990
I'm out here on the road.
I don't have all my podcasting equipment.
Oh,
Bill,

7
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.870
you really get you going to come in with the excuses on Monday morning.
Maybe.

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.810
I am,
um,

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.820
I'm still here in Boston after a horrible Flint tour of,
uh,

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.000
the New England states,
Springfield,
Boston and then um,

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.490
Bridgeport,
Connecticut.
I want to thank everybody that came out.
Um,

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.820
<v 0>okay.</v>

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.920
<v 1>You know,
an incredible weekend.</v>

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.950
Most people I've ever performed to over a three day period in my career and uh,

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.370
could not have gone any better.
Thank you so very much.
Um,

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.080
<v 0>okay.</v>

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.170
<v 1>I was in a,
I did the Boston Garden to TD bank,</v>

18
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.170
North Garden on,
um,

19
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.780
Friday night in the round.

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.070
Got Together with some buddies of mine I used to jam with back in the day and we

21
00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:18.640
played in the empty arena and just had the best time ever,
right.
So anyways,

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.410
you know,
I walk in,
it's fucking places huge.
It's like Jesus Christ.
So you know,

23
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:26.710
you make a little bit of noise in there so it's not as nerve racking and then

24
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:27.970
you calm down a little bit,

25
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:32.140
you get comfortable and then all of a sudden the people start coming and it

26
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:36.520
fills up and then you get nervous again.
Right.
So I had Tony v the Great Tony v,

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.430
the Guy who taught me
basically how to write by not writing.

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.640
First Guy I met her,
it didn't write shit down.
And I was like,

29
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.860
well what if you forget a joke?
And he was just like,
well,

30
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.390
it means it's time to stop doing it.

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.230
I just thought it was such a fucking bad ass cavalier attitude is like,

32
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.480
I want to be like that guy.
So anyways,

33
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.690
I worked with Tim and Paul Versey so they both go up and they're just acting

34
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.930
like they're just doing a regular spot.
And if the fucking murdering,

35
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.810
both of them murdering,
you know,
first he was stuck in traffic,

36
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:13.170
you have to get a double park or something before he went in there.

37
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:16.680
So I don't think he had time to be nervous.
He just ran out and did it.

38
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.670
So anyways,
I'm in the um,

39
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.900
they put you for the Green Room when you did it.

40
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.620
We were in the referees like little fucking,
uh,

41
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.500
pretty called locker room.

42
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.490
I was thinking just all the people that must've been screaming on the other side

43
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:37.020
of the door,
cause you're not allowed to go in there.
Um,
if you're a coach,

44
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.390
a player or anything like that.
So anyways,

45
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.920
I'm sitting in there doing what you do in that moment thinking,

46
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.600
how the fuck did I get here?
Why me?
Is this the end?

47
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.480
Is everybody going to show up and be like,
you know,

48
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.130
we don't think he's funny anymore,
right?

49
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.820
So I'm going through all of this shit trying to talk myself off the ledge so I

50
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:00.490
can just go out there and act like this big deal.
It's not a big deal.

51
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.040
So I can perform the best

52
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.390
and right before I go out there,
my cell phone rings

53
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010
and I see it's,
it's my wife and I'm like,
ah,
look at this perfect timing.

54
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.220
This is why I love her.
This is why she's the best.
She's,
you know,

55
00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:21.510
she's going to say,
hey,
don't be nervous.
Go out there.
You earned it.

56
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.360
I love you,
blah,
blah,
blah.
All that shit.
Right.

57
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.140
Well I pick up my phone and my wife,

58
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.540
she's crying hysterically.

59
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.080
<v 1>And um,
my first thought was something happened to our kids.
Like,
oh my God,</v>

61
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.010
did she fall down?
Did you drop her?
There's somebody coming to the house.

62
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.430
I put the fuck happened.
Like I picked up the phone.

63
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.620
I was like,
what?
What,
what's the matter?
What's the matter?
I'm like,
what?

64
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.160
What's amount?
And she's like,
no.
I'm like,
well what is it?
She's like,

65
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.360
I just saw a star is born.
And it was,

66
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.180
I was like,
are you fucking kidding?
I was like,
honey,
I got to show.

67
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:11.750
I got to go do all right.

68
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.090
I thought the fucking shit that went through my head.

69
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.160
All Stephen King level stuff or what could have been happened to her

70
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.060
in the house and,
and my daughter and all of that type of stuff.

71
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:27.130
So it was so fucking ridiculous.

72
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.390
It just made me laugh and I went out there and I just told the story and then I

73
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.530
was kind of fine for the rest of the,
the show.
But um,
yeah.

74
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.430
<v 1>It was a,
I dunno,</v>

76
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.100
these past two weekends it felt like I dreamed the shows,

77
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.370
it didn't feel like they really happened.
So I don't know how to Alec,

78
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.550
I got to that to be able to be the guy that did it.

79
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:54.500
But I just want to thank everybody for coming out.
And um,
uh,

80
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.540
I,
the Boston Garden one really freaked me out cause I,

81
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.660
I literally started my standup career.

82
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:05.990
I told my first shit and Dick Jokes literally at Nick's comedy stop.

83
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.310
I mean,
I could have walked over there.

84
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.560
I mean would have taken me about 25 minutes,

85
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:15.280
but still I could still walk van stage that I'm in.

86
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.800
Um,
so anyways,
I went out there and I had a great time.

87
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.050
The only thing I had to deal with it was,
it was in the round,
those,

88
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:26.200
the stools in the middle and they had to keep walking around either side of it.

89
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.480
And I've learned what you want,

90
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.240
what you want to do is just take the stool out of the middle and just lay it

91
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.640
down on its side,
you know?
Then if you want to sit down,

92
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.880
just pick it up and sit down,
I guess if you were going to do that.

93
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.440
But I just feel like if it's in the round,

94
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:43.441
you have to kind of be moving so people aren't staring at your backside the

95
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.690
whole time.
Um,
anyways.

96
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.780
And then I got on the other side of that one and that one was nerve wracking

97
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:53.560
just because I had all kinds of family and friends and coworkers and people I

98
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.210
went to school with.
All of those people coming down and it's just like,
oh boy,

99
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.380
what if I have a old sticker room tonight?
But if I have a bad one,

100
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.630
then they gotta be like,
no,
it was good.
It was good.
It was good.

101
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.450
God did you,
ah,
you lost a little way.
You look good.
You're going to the gym.

102
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.880
People try and change the subject.
I like that shirt.

103
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.503
<v 0>Okay,</v>

104
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.180
<v 1>your shirt look great things you don't want to hear after a sentence.</v>

105
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.320
Um,
so anyways,

106
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:28.620
so now I'm on the other side of it and the red sox played game one and of course

107
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.570
it was a nail biter and I was just thinking,
man,

108
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.190
if we don't win the Chris sale game,
we're fucked and we want it.
So thank God.

109
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:39.450
So then game two comes around the next night and I am in Bridgeport,

110
00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:42.720
Connecticut and I missed the whole game because I was traveling.

111
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:46.200
And then I was also uh,
doing my show.

112
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.080
And once again,

113
00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:52.430
unfortunately price could not get us a victory in the post season.

114
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.863
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.560
<v 1>And then of course,
now it's like all the wheels are coming off in boss.</v>

116
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.380
Everybody's just like,
oh my God,

117
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.800
how could we have played two games with the New York Yankees and we won won and

118
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:08.240
they won one.

119
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.270
Whoever saw that coming after I hundred and eight regular season wins season.

120
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.850
She's fucking people.
It's just like what happened?

121
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:24.680
Like they were like already writing in the globe going was the hundred and eight

122
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:25.461
when season.

123
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:30.461
Just a mirage because we lost one fucking game to a $200 million team that won a

124
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:36.260
hundred games that we played 19 times this year.
We went 10 and nine

125
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.580
we one one day,
one,
one we want to,
they won one,
we won one day,

126
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:46.930
one,
three.
We swept them and then they went to and one to one,

127
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.520
one against us.
And then yeah,
I had um,
I had 100 bucks on each game,

128
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.040
but in 50 with version 50 with my agent,
you know,

129
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.160
the overall season thing and the most I got up,

130
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.630
they were up by like one 51 point.
Then I was up one 50 and then in the end,

131
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.900
19 games they owed me 50 bucks each.
We want one more fucking game.

132
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:08.680
So everybody's sitting there freaking the fuck out.

133
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.690
<v 1>And they're going to try to build this thing up like,
oh my God,</v>

135
00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:13.560
this is the greatest team,

136
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.770
one of the greatest teams ever to have won 100 need fucking games.

137
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:20.340
It doesn't mean shit.
The Oreos are not going to be there in October.

138
00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:22.380
I keep saying,
how many times do I have to be right?

139
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.540
How many times do you guys have to shake your head and discuss and reach for the

140
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.810
Stop Button?
Because once again,
old Bald Billy,
oh,

141
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:35.520
freckles himself is once again crowing about something that he said was going to

142
00:08:35.521 --> 00:08:39.660
happen.
I would say as far back as July,
you know,

143
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.050
definitely after we swept them in August I was like,
what?
What exactly?

144
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:48.850
Like an ESPN all like,
God,
it's fucking over.
It's over.
It isn't over.
Um,

145
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.660
<v 0>okay,</v>

146
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.550
<v 1>so for all you people out there who get confused with regular season wins,
okay,</v>

147
00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.090
just take everybody off the board at the end of the season who isn't going to go

148
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:05.330
into the playoffs and then look how they did against the playoff teams census.

149
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.460
It's as simple as that.
I think we were about,
you know,

150
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.740
pretty even with,
uh,
the Indians.

151
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.300
I didn't look up the Indians or the Astros,

152
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.060
but I think we're even with the Indians and we probably had a losing record

153
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.360
against the Astros and we went 10 and nine against the Yankees.
So

154
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.070
those are the teams we're going to be playing.

155
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.780
That's how they've matched up against us.

156
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:28.670
Why is it surprising that we're one on one?

157
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.393
<v 0>MMM.</v>

158
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.630
<v 1>If we lose this playoff series yet,</v>

159
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.100
it won't be near nearly as a surprising fucking thing.
You know,

160
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:40.590
considering the last two times we played the Yankees,

161
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.260
we've lost both regular season series.

162
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.053
<v 0>Right.</v>

163
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.040
<v 1>So I'd say we're due to win this one.
So we need all fucking,
uh,</v>

164
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.420
whatever his fucking name is per Cielo to have one of his good games tonight.

165
00:09:56.421 --> 00:10:01.190
Then we'll be up two games to one before we get the shit kicked out of us by the

166
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:05.630
Astros.
That's my prediction.

167
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.340
That's what I feel is,
is,
is going to happen if we get by the Yankees.

168
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.950
And if we don't get by the Yankees,
uh,

169
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.290
despite what shyness see and all these guys will say,

170
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:19.850
it wasn't a major fucking collapsed despite what Johnny Damon said.

171
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.850
I guess my one of my buddies goes,
dude,

172
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:27.770
you can believe Johnny Damon is fucking rooting for the Yankees.
It's like,

173
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:31.940
yeah,
absolutely,
I can.
Absolutely.
He wasn't a red sock.

174
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:35.390
He was an a.
And then he became a free agent.
And once you,

175
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:38.030
once you get a fucking free age and you can't fall in love with them,

176
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.540
it's like calling in love with a stripper.
All right,

177
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.550
he's going to go with the money.
He didn't give a fuck.
Pay me.

178
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.230
He grew his shit up.

179
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.280
You know when he's at the red sox and then he goes to the Yankees.
Yeah,

180
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.930
you can sign with us,
but you got to get a haircut.
And he was like,
okay.

181
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.230
And he went down there like look like a good little school boy.

182
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.180
They got them already for a scouting pictures.

183
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:59.330
So now he sees root for the Yankees who gets a shift.

184
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.150
He helped fucking and the cars here at boss Boston.
I'm good with the guy.

185
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.580
We had a great time.
We had a great fucking time while he was on the team.
Um,

186
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.580
so anyways,
uh,
I'm going to watch that game tonight.

187
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.330
I believe game three is tonight and I'm not going to think that,
you know,

188
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.140
I'm hoping that we fucking win this thing,
but like,

189
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:26.270
just the way that they're already building this thing up,

190
00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:28.730
like this is going to be,
oh my God.

191
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.510
Like if the Red Sox win it all this year,
right.

192
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.480
Is this one of the greatest teams of all time now?

193
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.500
I wouldn't say that even if they had 108 wins,

194
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.270
you know,
compared to some of those other,
other fuck I mean the Oh,

195
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:45.890
force red sox to beat the fucking,

196
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:47.790
<v 0>yeah,</v>

197
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.890
<v 1>2018,
uh,</v>

198
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.080
who's in waters was the old 14 one of the greatest teams of all time behind?

199
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.140
I don't think so.
Well,
Bell,
who do you think is one of the greatest,
you know,

200
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.640
the fucking Oakland A's and your early seventies,
those teams,

201
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.220
the big red machine.
I think those will better teams.
I have no fucking idea.

202
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.170
I'm just saying everybody fucking relax.

203
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.770
Put your fucking eyebrows down.
Um,
anyways,

204
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:16.380
plowing ahead here.
Uh,

205
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.780
so I'm still here in Boston and uh,

206
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.680
anytime I come back I'm like,
Oh man,
I miss living here.

207
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.350
But this time more so than any other time.

208
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.060
I don't know why.
I just,
uh,

209
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.890
I took like the day after
the Boston Garden cake,

210
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.901
I was,
you know,

211
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:42.901
still staying in Boston and I walked over to the north end as I always do and I

212
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:48.460
went down Hanover Street and then I kinda,
you know,

213
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:49.720
I was walk about halfway down,

214
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:54.520
get bed to look like the corner store and then I fucking break off to the left

215
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.820
and I tried to find shit that isn't,
you know,
Hanover Street.

216
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.170
It's like the Times Square,
the north end.
Right.
And uh,

217
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.920
ended up finding this great place to get a sandwich and uh,

218
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.400
me and my tour manager just fucking hung out in this park,

219
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:12.190
eat and the sandwiches.
I'm like a perfect day,

220
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.790
perfect sunny New England day in the North End.

221
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.270
It was a great Italian Deli where they had all of this just,

222
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.080
you know,
Italians,
it's just like they take food to the entirely next level.

223
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.260
Um,
and I was in there just like wanting to order everything cause I live on the

224
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:34.990
west coast.
He kick a good Italian,
he can't kick good pizza,

225
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.390
can't get any of that shit.
But I was just like,
all right,

226
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:41.110
I guess stay on my diet and not get too crazy.
Marty bred here,

227
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.670
so I just got a tuna,
small tuna,
a

228
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.630
sub,
I guess you'd call it out here.
And uh,

229
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.020
just the way they season it was fucking perfect.

230
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.980
They'd celery onions in there and something else mixed in with the tune and just

231
00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:58.060
a hint of Manet's.

232
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.760
And even the size of the way they chopped up the onions and salaries.

233
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:04.120
It was perfect.
It all just added to it.

234
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.570
It all just kept taking the tuna to the next level.

235
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.170
And I was sitting in the park,
I was saying to my manager,

236
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:14.950
I was so fucking sandwich is unbelievable.
And even lives on the east coast.

237
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:18.430
He's like,
yeah,
it is.
This is a good sandwich.
And we sat there going,

238
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.810
is there anything better than just sitting outside?
Good bucket sandwich.

239
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.620
And that's the end of the sandwich story.
And it was,

240
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:31.330
it was tremendous walking.
Tremendous.
That's one of my favorite parts,

241
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:35.080
uh,
you know,
of Boston.

242
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.350
And then I always walk in and I walked over to the,
uh,

243
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:43.080
to the garden to buy some Bruins stuff for my daughter.
And I walked by,

244
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.380
you know,
that bridge you go over to get to Charlestown,

245
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.600
which I never even knew that.
That's what that was.

246
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.920
I'd always heard a Charlestown,

247
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.480
but I didn't know where the fuck it was until that movie,
the town came up.

248
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.363
You know,

249
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.580
I learned more Goddamn shit about Boston by watching movies about it when I

250
00:15:02.741 --> 00:15:04.180
lived here.
I just,
I didn't know,
you know.

251
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.040
<v 1>I knew how to get to like the sports venues,</v>

253
00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:13.240
but I didn't know East Boston.
I still don't even know where that is.

254
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.270
I would know how to get that.
I know what Chelsea is.
I don't know what.

255
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.000
And now I know what shouts down is.

256
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.793
<v 2>MMM.</v>

257
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.930
<v 1>Back Bay.
I don't know.
I don't even know where the fuck that is,</v>

258
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.860
where that starts to wear that ends.
I know where Newberry street is.

259
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.630
Um,
sorry,
my stomach's growling.
Yeah.
Um,

260
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
I dunno.
So tonight is my sort of,
uh,

261
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.330
the next couple of days and my hang back here just cause you know,

262
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:45.680
I got a bunch of fucking nieces and nephews and all of that shit and I'm on the

263
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.360
other side.
I got one more arena gig.

264
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:52.361
Everybody one more left before fucking freckles turns back into a pumpkin and

265
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:58.961
that's November 7th Madison Square Garden and it's going to be me.

266
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.090
Verdesian Joe Barton.
Nick.
Um,
and I'll tell you,

267
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:08.990
I wish I was taping a special right now cause I feel like my hour is ready to
go.

268
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:12.650
But um,
doodles,
different things.
That's,

269
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:15.960
I don't think I'm going to tape until next year,
but um,

270
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.963
<v 2>yeah,</v>

271
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.600
<v 1>I been having more guide.
Damn fine.
And I swear to God,</v>

272
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.630
I really believe that the more things get crazy on social media with these

273
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:30.200
lunatics that have gone so far left that I'm questioning whether I'm even left

274
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.180
anymore.
The more they do that,

275
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.700
I feel like the more you can get away with them on stage,

276
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.360
people are just laughing even more.
Um,

277
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.613
anyways,

278
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.080
you see that Cavenaugh guy got on the fucking supreme court.

279
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.760
I don't know what that means.
I know a lot of people are upset about it.

280
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.830
You know,

281
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.440
I don't understand those women getting fucking arrested and then they're

282
00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:58.320
sticking their fists in the air.
They're doing the black power thing.

283
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.010
That was black power,
right.
If I can take in that,

284
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.550
it's hilarious.
White women,
the United States of America fight the power.

285
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.780
Um,
the kid,
they can't come up with their own fucking thing.

286
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.410
They should steal this Sammy Hagar thing that he used to do.
We took the two,

287
00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:23.550
I love these things together,
and then he would sort of put his index,

288
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:26.910
strangle it again,
his stumps together,
and then,
you know,

289
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:30.990
stick his tongue through the middle and wiggle it acting like he was going down

290
00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:35.880
on a woman.
I mean,
that's what you could do in the 80s and a mainstream concept.

291
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.040
It's women should have something like that.

292
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.380
Just don't stick the tongue through it.
Then I think it's respectful to women.

293
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.250
I think that that's where that part goes off the rails.
I'm not sure if I'm not,

294
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.160
you know,
I don't know much about the hand gestures there,
but I,

295
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.800
I know enough about him to be like,
oh,
that was the black power one.

296
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.150
That's the one from the Olympics.

297
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.103
<v 0>MMM.</v>

298
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:06.740
<v 1>You can't tell me at this point to get arrested at a protest to stick your</v>

299
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:11.100
fucking hand up in the air.
You don't feel like you're doing the Charleston.

300
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.350
That doesn't feel a little dated.

301
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.500
<v 1>Yeah.
This guy,
it'd be something new that you're doing.
Like,</v>

303
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.460
like this,
like doing a joke,
hey,
take my wife please.

304
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.770
That's like the fucking protest version of that.

305
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.920
You know what I mean?
Like first she had the low five,

306
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.010
then you had the high five,
then they were bumping forearms,

307
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.220
then they'd come in and kind of do like that.
Uh,
you know,

308
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.490
it's like you deliberately miss and then your forearms and elbows kind of lock.

309
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.250
And then there's all these elaborate fucking hand shakes.

310
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:51.450
Like it always goes to the next level,
but for some reason with protesting.

311
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.410
<v 1>They just,
you know,
it's a timeless classic.
The fist in the air.</v>

313
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.263
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

314
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.980
<v 1>Um,
I'm,
I'm saying that needs to be switched up.
I Dunno what I would go with.</v>

315
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.850
You guys want to check in on some feminists tweets,

316
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:09.560
one of my favorites fucker things to do.

317
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.680
Let's see what they're demanding today.
Maybe they're in a good mood today.

318
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.320
Can you imagine that you,
if you just went to feminism and they were like,

319
00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:21.560
you know what,
I'm kind of happy with America.
All right.

320
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.490
Um,
so probably get,

321
00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:30.640
this is just be people trashing feminism.
I don't want to see that.
I want to say,

322
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.940
oh no,
she's one of those feminists.
Yeah.

323
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.330
Assuming they just trashed feminists.

324
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.573
<v 0>Okay.</v>

325
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.150
<v 1>This is a guy wearing this shirt of course,
cause he's woke.</v>

326
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:49.570
Feminism is the radical notion that women are people,

327
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.600
uh,
to some people it is.

328
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.050
What I love about feminism is this really no clear cut definition.

329
00:19:56.051 --> 00:20:00.970
It's just what it means to the person.
It's kind of like what,
what is art?
Uh,

330
00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:02.890
why men's rights activists,

331
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:08.350
the shooter according to his Facebook is a feminism.
A feminist.
Sorry.

332
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.130
It's just gonna be trashing.
Ah,
Christ.

333
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.920
All right.
All right.
You know what?
Let me look this one up.

334
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.280
You got to get the ones where they make it about themselves.

335
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.930
That's my favorite cab.
And uh,
right.
How do you spell it?

336
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.680
Kevin are confirmed.
Okay,
here we go.
Ah,

337
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.540
right.
Just an FYI.

338
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.320
Fyi,
everyone supreme court justices can be impeached.

339
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.870
It rarely happens,
but it's absolutely possible.
Just keep in mind until,

340
00:20:44.871 --> 00:20:48.860
oh,
I don't know.
Let's say mid November.
All right.

341
00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:50.090
There's something about the election.

342
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.580
When do I get my own handmaiden?
That's how this works,

343
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:00.490
right?
All right.
Once again,
that's a little dramatic.
Don't you think?

344
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.130
<v 2>Uh,</v>

345
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.660
<v 1>yeah,
it's probably,</v>

346
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.630
oh,
I love this.
Here's a good one.
I met three black people,

347
00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:17.490
a gay man as Hispanic man and more women than men yesterday.
That's support.

348
00:21:17.491 --> 00:21:21.420
Cavenaugh identity.
Politics is sexist and racist.

349
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:27.070
Don't be part of it.
Identity politics is gross.
Don't be part of it.
Um,

350
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.830
I,
that's always like convenient,
right?

351
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:29.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

352
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.890
<v 1>You know,
I think Obama stinks and I'm a democrat.</v>

353
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.520
Liberals help Cavenaugh win by showing how ridiculous they truly are.

354
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.760
Hell yeah.
To Cavenaugh.
Come on,
man.

355
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:48.810
I liked the other ones.

356
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.793
<v 2>Oh,</v>

357
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.960
<v 1>some old guy holding up a sign and there's some woman dancing around him.</v>

358
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.023
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

359
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.240
<v 1>All right.
This is just going off the rails.
I got it.
I got it.</v>

360
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.950
I want this to be a fucking a legitimate segment.

361
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.773
<v 0>Okay.</v>

362
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.170
<v 1>The power structure wasn't willing to risk not having a majority of straight,</v>

363
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.650
<v 0>yeah.</v>

364
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.890
<v 1>CIS gender conservative white men directing our laws,</v>

365
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:25.860
practices and policies into the foreseeable future.

366
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.690
They would rather have a sexual assaulter than literally anyone else.

367
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.120
<v 2>Um,
yeah.</v>

368
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.950
<v 1>Everybody sees it the way that bucket,
the way they fucking see it,
man.
You know,</v>

369
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.830
it's kind of weird way.
It's what those things you don't,

370
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.780
the burden of proof is way less.

371
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.893
<v 2>MMM.</v>

372
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.610
<v 1>Cause if that was a trial that would have been like,
yeah,
dude,</v>

373
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:55.130
you can't be in there again.
I think it was him.
I don't really remember.
I yeah,

374
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.560
yeah.
They'd be like,
all right.
Yeah,
we don't have time for this.

375
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:02.800
He got to come back with fucking evidence.
Um,
having said that,

376
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:03.880
I still believe the woman though,

377
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.150
just cause she kept telling the fucking story over and over and over again.

378
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.000
I don't know who the fuck knows,
but some of the shit,
that cabin I was getting,

379
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:14.260
like who doesn't have a bunch of fucking friends was stupid nicknames from high

380
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:15.094
school.

381
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:22.210
How's it like fucking Headley squash plank goes a Frenchie

382
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.810
with the fuck.
Um,
you're in high school anyways.

383
00:23:29.811 --> 00:23:33.410
Plowing ahead,
keep missing all the God damn racing.

384
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:38.050
I got the fucking app one app and it just keeps showing me.
Um,

385
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.850
I got the [inaudible] TV and I was watching what,
watching this race from 1989,

386
00:23:43.851 --> 00:23:47.630
the Japanese f one with that said,
I dude,
you know,

387
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:51.920
he's arguably the best of all time.
And I'm like,

388
00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.840
who the fuck was he up against?

389
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.660
<v 1>Uh,
I forgot his fucking name,
but it was phenomenal.</v>

391
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.550
I watched it almost right to the end was Santa was coming back driving like a

392
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:07.430
lunatic and uh,

393
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.210
they actually had the onboard cameras,
if you can watch it,

394
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:15.620
like the cars back then sounds so much more ferocious and dangerous.

395
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.530
And then also when you just look at the lack of safety,

396
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:21.830
it's just like they fucking head is just,
you know,

397
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:25.850
like get that halo and shit around you.
Um,
it definitely seems,

398
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.493
you know,

399
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.050
<v 0>okay.</v>

400
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.790
<v 1>Like the death rate must have been way higher.</v>

401
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:35.020
Obviously it was bill and the guy you're talking about ended up dying.
But um,

402
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.490
well why don't you read some advertising here now that you've meandered and bond

403
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:41.350
with your fucking

404
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.180
<v 0>okay.</v>

405
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.410
<v 1>Twitter,
feminism.
Fucking reading the tweets there cause you didn't look him up.</v>

406
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.170
Why didn't you fucking
come on,

407
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:54.090
there's gotta be a good one.

408
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.800
He's just not a likable looking guy.
This Cavenaugh I think that's when,

409
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.580
that's what really hurts shit.
He gotta be likable.
You know,
like Bill Clinton,

410
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:08.290
Bill Clinton is likable.
The shit that,

411
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.320
that guy has gotten busted for doing and women's still like it was fucking,

412
00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:14.080
it's unbelievable.
Um,

413
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:17.711
well,
you know what this is,

414
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:20.410
this is just a bunch of pro cabin on people crone on here.

415
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.310
That's all it is.
Well,
you must vote.

416
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.290
Here's to the end of everything.

417
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:32.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

418
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.900
<v 1>All right.
P America,
Kevin are confirmed.
I mean that's a little dramatic.</v>

419
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.560
We didn't just hire this guy to become a fucking fear or did we see the end of

420
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:48.000
everything?
Um,
all right,
let me read the advertising here.
Everybody.

421
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:49.320
I know this is like brutally

422
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.440
not professional here.
Okay.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Oh my bookie.

423
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:58.810
Everybody share watching.
Football's fun.

424
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.070
But it's more entertaining when you have some action on the games.
Guys,

425
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.850

<v 0>Yeah.</v>

503

<v 1>You know,
life insurance is really important,</v>

504

but one third of the people don't have it.

505

That's because it's really hard to buy.
You have to work out what you need,

then do research to find the best quote and hope you don't get swindled along

the way.
It's not a good way to shop for anything.

508
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.060

decision.

518

529
00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:29.040
it's everything that I missed.

He beat the Burger King Guy there.
Conor Mcgregor,

you know,
something,

538
00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:04.400
it'd be great if they didn't fucking have that stupid fight in the end.

539
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.590
That was really dumb.

540
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

541

nine,
eight,
nine,

569
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.440
ten three days.
Okay.

570
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.160
Three days at the unbelievable Chicago theater.
And um,

571
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.450
and that's it.
And then the rest of the year I'm fucking off.

572
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.190
It's already filling up with bullshit.

573
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.550
It has always some sort of fucking bullshit,
you know.
All right folks,
let's,

574
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.410
let's read some of the questions here for this week.
Um,
oh yeah.
You know,

575
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.230
he stays sober October.
Um,
which I jumped into late

576
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.800
because I drank the first day.

577
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.760
Then I didn't drink any other days except last night.
I had a few,
you know,

578
00:35:20.761 --> 00:35:25.430
I'm in Boston.
What am I supposed to do?
Um,
so I've drank too.

579
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.970
To what,
uh,
what's today?
What's today?
The eighth.
All right.

580
00:35:29.971 --> 00:35:34.770
So I'm six and two.
I'm back on the wagon.
Here we go.
And I was saying,
well,

581
00:35:34.771 --> 00:35:36.180
you know,
it'd be great if the,
uh,
you know,

582
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:38.160
sober October makes you not want to drink,

583
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.630
be great if they could come up with a rhyme for November.

584
00:35:40.631 --> 00:35:44.560
So somebody came up with no bender November.
It doesn't really rhyme,

585
00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:47.140
but it's close enough.
He said,
y'all Billy TD,

586
00:35:47.141 --> 00:35:50.920
Gad and crushed on the parquet floors Friday.
Thank you.

587
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.480
He said no booze in November of his called no bender November in case you can't

588
00:35:55.481 --> 00:35:59.680
think of a way to rhyme.
You dumb genius.
Uh,

589
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.200
well it doesn't really where I'm okay.

590
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.710
And there's a word for that when there's two things that they sound like they

591
00:36:05.711 --> 00:36:09.850
Ryan,
that they don't,
it's called hyperbole.
I forget what it's called.

592
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.070
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

593
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.780
<v 1>it's called a run on sentence.
Fuck me over that shit though.</v>

594
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.970
Stupid terms in an English class.

595
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.453
<v 0>Okay.</v>

596
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.080
<v 1>Two words that rhyme but don't</v>

597
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.540
terminology.
What'd he call it?
Two words.
That rhyme?
No,
no,
no,
no,
I didn't.

598
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:36.340
I didn't ask it right.
God dammit.

599
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.590
Two words that sound like they rhyme,
but they don't.

600
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.270
Come on.
Give it to me.
What is it called when words sound like they Ryan,

601
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:54.600
but don't.
All right.
Half a rhyme.

602
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.110
I thought they had a bigger term for that soliloquy.

603
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.430
I don't know.
Anyway,
anyways,
let's get back to this fucking bullshit.
All right.

604
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:10.370
Uh,
toilet paper versus a fancy toilet.
Hey freckles.

605
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.760
This seat is better for the environment because thousands and thousands of

606
00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.830
liters of water and kilowatts of power going to the production of toilet paper.

607
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.700
Thanks.
You dumb.
Fuck.
Okay.

608
00:37:22.701 --> 00:37:26.480
Well what about having to then have an electric toilet seat?

609
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.400
<v 0>Okay,</v>

610
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.140
<v 1>and what about all the extra water you're going to be using hosing off your ass</v>

611
00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:36.420
hole?
You know,
I mean they both,

612
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.880
it's like driving a Tesla.
Okay,
so it doesn't use any guests.

613
00:37:40.881 --> 00:37:43.830
But what happens to you throughout that giant battery underneath the car?

614
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.540
Although I'm totally for those cars and electric power,

615
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.220
you don't cause even if it pollutes the environment just as much,

616
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.640
at least we'll be out of the Middle East.
They don't,

617
00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.020
that's how you solve that problem.

618
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.370
We just convert to solar power and we all drive quiet electric cars.

619
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:08.690
You know there are fucking one trick pony over there in the Middle East.

620
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

621
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.180
<v 1>They don't produce any cars than anybody wants.
You know,</v>

622
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.930
cuisine.
They got cuisine and they got oil.
They're cuisine's delicious.

623
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.270
Our cars loved their oil,
but you don't,

624
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:25.740
if you put that on the point amount of business,

625
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:26.950
they go and they don't have no money.

626
00:38:26.951 --> 00:38:28.980
The money to fund any sort of terrorist groups.

627
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.520
And then we leave them the fuck alone and then they go back to just being mad at

628
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:35.100
each other.
Done.

629
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.560
Oh see you declare victory.
Go home.
All right.

630
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:43.310
Make a smoothie.
Broccoli sprouts in your smoothie.

631
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.590
Dear Billy Bison.

632
00:38:45.591 --> 00:38:50.480
But I'm really into fitness and eating healthy and all that.
All right?

633
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:52.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

634
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.733
<v 1>To that point,</v>

635
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.520
you may want to consider researching the benefits of Broccoli sprouts.

636
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.850
They contain a lot,
lots of anticancer properties,

637
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:05.290
and the research is new with loss of tests.
To back it up,

638
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.100
I want you to live forever.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,

639
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:12.130
so what am I supposed to look this up?
Broccoli sprouts.

640
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.180
Now is this just straight up broccoli was to see Broccoli sprouts.

641
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.550
Broccoli

642
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.310
sprouts.

643
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.613
<v 0>Cancer.</v>

644
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.750
<v 1>All right,
let's see what they say here.</v>

645
00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.060
Because I found of Broccoli sprouts may not only help prevent cancer,

646
00:39:32.061 --> 00:39:35.780
but also treated well.
Jesus Christ says about it,
it may,

647
00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.053
<v 0>mmm</v>

648
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.930
<v 1>suffer.
Laughing is found in vegetables such as Kale,
cauliflower,
and cabbage,</v>

649
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.820
and in particular high concentrations in young Broccoli sprouts.

650
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.710
<v 0>Yeah,
Jesus Christ.</v>

651
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.580
<v 1>So I gotta be,
I gotta eat those things.</v>

652
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.330
<v 0>You're going to freeze them.</v>

653
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.920
<v 1>All right,
well,
you know,
I looked it up.
It says they do that.
So now I believe it.</v>

654
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.130
Are you eating enough Broccoli sprouts?

655
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.700
<v 0>Oh,
fuck dose.</v>

656
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.530
<v 1>All right,
here we go.
I,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll definitely do it,
you know.
All right.</v>

657
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:22.550
Art Deco bars.
Hey,
they're freckles.
You mentioned looking into an art deco bar.

658
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.200
Check this one out.
It comes inside an $80 million airplane.

659
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.620
Pretty sweet.
Drop a few of those Netflix coins there.

660
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.023
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

661
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.800
<v 1>Let me see this fucking thing.</v>

662
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:40.110
And Art Deco Bar in a plane that's not an a plain white

663
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.780
private business.
Aircraft manager

664
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.580
<v 0>and</v>

665
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:54.580
<v 1>Embraer executive jets have created a new luxury jet dub the Manhattan,</v>

666
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.720
which takes passengers back to the 1920s with his art deco designs.

667
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:05.090
Isn't it enough that you're fly in private?
Yeah,
I'd love a private jet.

668
00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:08.210
But what is the theme?
Uh,
created by the companies,

669
00:41:08.211 --> 00:41:10.220
vice president of interior design,

670
00:41:10.221 --> 00:41:14.990
jade fever and former Disney imagineer.

671
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.190
Image Linear Eddie Soto,

672
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.560
the jet will t sounds shady.
Eddie Soda.
J Bieber.

673
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.140
He'll try to fuck your girlfriend.
80 Sodo.
You Shady.

674
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.670
The Jeb will make you feel as though you're stepping back in time and it's with

675
00:41:31.671 --> 00:41:34.020
its rich mahogany wood panels,

676
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.870
brass and gold trimmings and vibrant jewel tones.

677
00:41:36.871 --> 00:41:39.420
It's just sounds like it's going to take a lot of fuel to get this thing off the

678
00:41:39.421 --> 00:41:40.254
ground.

679
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.320
Beaver was inspired by the art deco interior designs of the SS Normandy French

680
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:51.100
Ocean liner.
I those the say of the SS fucking German psychopaths there.

681
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

682
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.230
<v 1>I use the Nazis,
Nazi Germany to inspire this.</v>

683
00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:58.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

684
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:59.530
<v 1>This bill,</v>

685
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:03.010
somebody explained to me how the fuck you can never fly private and make any

686
00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:06.970
money.
I will never understand that.
You know,

687
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.890
it costs an absolute fortune and he can't even write it off.
You can like,

688
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.460
if you spend like 20 grand on a fucking private plane ticket,

689
00:42:15.461 --> 00:42:17.620
like the government's only,
well,
it's like,

690
00:42:17.621 --> 00:42:20.350
well you could have flown first class for 1500 bucks.
Two grand.

691
00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.310
You're the dumb ass that spend another 18 grand that's on you.

692
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

693
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.770
<v 1>That's the way my accountant explained it to me.
All right.
Shit.
Talk and people</v>

694
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.240
dear Billy Justice.
What's the deal with,
uh,
okay,
so what's the deal with shit?

695
00:42:36.241 --> 00:42:38.730
Talkers getting mad when other people talk?
Shit.

696
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.410
All of my beef comes from hypocrites these days.
I keep hearing people,

697
00:42:43.411 --> 00:42:47.520
Comedians as well get mad at people who,
who make fun of them.

698
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.630
Uh,
the same people will make a living doing the same.
I need some examples here.

699
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.440
Uh,
this,
yeah,
I mean,
I don't agree with that.

700
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.780
If you go around and making fun of people and then you shouldn't get mad at

701
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:02.030
people making fun of you.
Right?

702
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.360
Meaning like hecklers.
I don't mind hecklers,

703
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.310
you know I didn't mind these fucking people that write mean shit to me on

704
00:43:11.311 --> 00:43:16.080
Twitter.
It's annoying,
but I mean I just accept it.
I try to,

705
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.610
I try to rise above it.
The same people who make a living doing the same thing,

706
00:43:20.611 --> 00:43:24.960
the same people who never think for a minute about what they're saying.

707
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.600
Flip the fuck out when someone trashes them.

708
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:33.000
It's something I yell at to no one in my car on the way home from work on a

709
00:43:33.001 --> 00:43:35.880
daily basis and this is his quote.
You mother fucker.

710
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:39.900
How can you expect to be treated like this when you yourself are doing the same

711
00:43:39.901 --> 00:43:42.600
thing?
It's the golden rule right out the window.

712
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.250
It's a law of nature right out the window.
Bill,
I'm losing my mind anyways.

713
00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:50.700
I was wondering how you deal with these people.
Do you yell at everyone you know,

714
00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:52.380
do you lose your friends and colleagues?

715
00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.120
I'm sure you had a celebrity friend complain about something.

716
00:43:57.121 --> 00:44:00.980
They have done themselves a million times.
What would you say to that?
Um,

717
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.160
well listen,
if you're going to talk about hypocritical behavior,

718
00:44:05.161 --> 00:44:07.980
I'm the fucking King of that.
Um,

719
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.150
and I've been guilty of that trashing people on stage than getting upset if

720
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:17.230
someone was addicted.
Me.
Um,
everybody's,
everybody's like that.

721
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.650
Everybody's got flaws.
So I don't,
I don't know really know what you're asking me,

722
00:44:20.651 --> 00:44:23.990
but like I do find it funny with,

723
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.000
<v 0>okay,</v>

724
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.440
<v 1>some of these people who are like,
uh,
in entertainment who are,</v>

725
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.930
uh,
you know,
pro women

726
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.760
advancement and all that,
which,
why wouldn't you be?
But then the way they go,

727
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.440
they go about it is they're the,
they say all this sexy shit about guys,

728
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.550
these,
you know,
big sweeping generalizations and all that.
And it's like,

729
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:50.430
you literally sound like what's you're fighting right now?
And they're like,
oh,

730
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:54.230
shut up.
You're a white guy.
Okay.
It's like,
yeah,

731
00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:57.470
you have a white guy who would know more about that then.
Then a white guy,

732
00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.870
you sound like a white guy.

733
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.100
Maybe that's the way you try to convey it to them cause then you kind of

734
00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:07.020
shitting on yourself.
You sound like a white man.

735
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.180
That is not a compliment.
You know what I mean?

736
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.890
Why do I think this audio is going to be played at a Klan meeting?
Okay.

737
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.340
It's just where the wide man is right now.
He thinks the sound lock himself,

738
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.290
it is not a compliment.

739
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.500
It all went off the rails with a first freeing the slaves second Yo MTV raps and

740
00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:34.020
then Obama.
Um,

741
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.870
yeah I would just say that.

742
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

743
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.660
<v 1>Like some of this shit like I thought a lot of the ways that people were just</v>

744
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:45.600
talking about Kevin,
I was like,
it's just downing Lee.

745
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:49.420
Like you don't hear that you're doing okay what you're doing,

746
00:45:49.421 --> 00:45:51.280
you're against racism and all of that shit.

747
00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:54.040
Like he can't say you're being racist against the white guy cause your thoughts

748
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:57.130
don't effect.
But it's basically like if you were in power,

749
00:45:57.131 --> 00:45:59.710
that guy would be fucked.
Like a white guy.

750
00:45:59.711 --> 00:46:02.560
He just never heard the word no.

751
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.810
Every door just flew open.

752
00:46:04.811 --> 00:46:08.950
You know that that cartoon version of being a white dude?
Um,

753
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.960
<v 2>yeah.</v>

754
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.360
<v 1>I don't know.
I just thought so much of it was about,</v>

755
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.870
they just built this whole story behind this guy.

756
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:21.730
I guess that's identity politics.
Like,
oh,
he went to Yale.
He's a white guy.

757
00:46:21.731 --> 00:46:24.490
He was,
you know,
he played sports.
Okay.

758
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.630
He's a date rape is all the doors flew open.
His Dad was a judge.

759
00:46:28.631 --> 00:46:32.180
He never went to jail,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,

760
00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.100
whatever the fuck they're talking about.
It's just going to let go.

761
00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:40.360
How bout a little air?
That dance.
Yay.
All right.

762
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.140
Boyfriend being shady.
I didn't even answer this guy's question.
What do I say?

763
00:46:44.141 --> 00:46:47.640
Those people,
you know,
if I'm in a zone,
I don't say anything.
Okay.

764
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.110
Yup,
Yup.
I'm in a bad place.
I'll let it ruin my morning and I'm like,

765
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.390
you and I like,

766
00:46:56.391 --> 00:47:00.060
I remember when Harvey Weinstein first got busted and then Fox News,

767
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:02.550
what's going on?
This is what Hollywood is like.
I'm above boom.

768
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.970
And I just remember yelling and your network bill O'Reilly.

769
00:47:06.971 --> 00:47:10.300
What about all these other than your fucking one of your main guys over there?

770
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.720
Um,
I mean,
I dunno

771
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:19.120
me TV is where it's at.
I'm telling you.
All right.
Boyfriend being shady.

772
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.600
Hey Billy.
No bonds.
No.
Uh,

773
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.090
man and I have been together for six years,

774
00:47:25.091 --> 00:47:29.810
but this past year he's become really close to this lady from work.

775
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:34.730
That's not good.
They spent a lot of time together,
go into bars,

776
00:47:34.731 --> 00:47:36.350
parties and work.

777
00:47:36.351 --> 00:47:40.280
Obviously I don't go out with them because I don't like to drink and have

778
00:47:40.281 --> 00:47:45.140
anxiety.
Uh,
he'll make me feel like I'm crazy for getting upset.

779
00:47:45.141 --> 00:47:48.650
But if the situation was switched and I was going out drinking and dancing with

780
00:47:48.651 --> 00:47:52.370
another man,
he'd be pissed too.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

781
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.940
He's going out drinking and dancing with another woman.

782
00:47:55.941 --> 00:48:00.200
I think you're well on your right to be like,
ah yes.
So then,

783
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.100
I mean the next logical step is you're going to finger blaster here.
I,

784
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.780
what's going on here anyway?
So what's your opinion on this?

785
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:10.160
Do I need to chill out?
And if so,
how?
Lol.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
No,

786
00:48:10.161 --> 00:48:14.840
you need to validate what you think.
And this is bullshit
in victim.

787
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.050
You're out drinking and dancing with another woman.
I mean,
I don't think that,

788
00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:20.300
you know,
um,

789
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.190
the only thing that could say that is if you don't go out,

790
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.650
if you don't hang out and you have anxiety,

791
00:48:27.651 --> 00:48:30.670
I don't know what the anxiety is above,
but like,
you know,

792
00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.380
if this guy likes to go out and he don't like to go out at all,

793
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.270
maybe you guys aren't right for each other,

794
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.170
or maybe you guys find some shit that you both like,

795
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:43.190
you know?
Yeah.
I mean,
that's a,

796
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.070
that's not a good situation.
So I would,
I would tell the person what,

797
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.400
what you thinking?
I don't think she'd be in a wrong,

798
00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:57.140
and I think that is shady behavior.
All right?
But that's just me.
The fuck.

799
00:48:57.141 --> 00:49:01.760
Do I know
what the fuck do I know?
All right.
What do we got here?

800
00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.520
This is the last question.
I've got 12 minutes left.
I swear to God,

801
00:49:04.521 --> 00:49:07.970
if I don't have my microphone and my fucking headphones,
it's literally,

802
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.300
it's like Kryptonite.
All right.
First breakup.

803
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.833
<v 2>Uh,</v>

804
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.480
<v 1>hey,
you freckled fuck,
oh,</v>

805
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.650
he's fucking relationship goes down the tubes and then they come at me all

806
00:49:20.651 --> 00:49:24.790
hostile.
I'll make this quick.
I just wanted to tell someone and honestly,

807
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.620
honestly before I talked to my parents,
I know you're dyslexic like me,

808
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:33.880
so I'll use basic words.
Well,
I appreciate that.
I'm a senior in high school.

809
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.650
I'm on the varsity wrestling and run and run distance track.

810
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:44.250
My free time has only consisted of homework and Netflix parenthesis after is for

811
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.740
is my favorite show.
Nice.
Did you guys see how we announced that?

812
00:49:47.741 --> 00:49:51.550
The Great Vince Vaughn will be on the,
uh,

813
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.990
we'll be on season three,
right?
No.
Season two.

814
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.700
Season three.
Yeah.
Season three.
I'm getting fucking fuse myself.
Anyways.

815
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.560
He said,

816
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.520
<v 2>uh</v>

817
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.810
<v 1>Oh is,
I'm a senior in high school,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Well,</v>

818
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.760
that was like 10 months ago.

819
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.180
I had never dated a girl ever,

820
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.600
but I had a crush on this girl for like a full year.

821
00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:22.920
She runs cross country is way smarter than I will ever be.
All right,
great.

822
00:50:22.921 --> 00:50:26.550
Put her up on a pedestal.
See how that works.
She's a year younger than me,

823
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:30.620
but we eventually started talking because when the boys' and girls' varsity

824
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:34.220
teams would hang out,
we both would be there.
Eventually.

825
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:36.410
She became all that I thought about.

826
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:39.050
I literally could not focus on school running,
et Cetera.

827
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.980
We talked almost every night over texts to,
and we're together.

828
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:44.690
Every time I went out with the team,

829
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:50.030
we went to homecoming my first time together a few weeks ago and I had my first

830
00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:53.840
kiss there.
Jesus Christ.
This sounds like a fucking perfect story.

831
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.010
After that night,
we really didn't talk over text that much.

832
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.510
We don't have any classes together and practice is not a good time to hang out

833
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.100
late.
Anyway,
about a week ago,

834
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:08.930
she texted me and said she didn't see a future of us being more than friends.

835
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.420
I told her what I felt.
I just said,

836
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.610
that's fair and all I want is for her to be happy,
which is true.

837
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:20.480
But I thought I would be able to brush that shit off like it was top thing.

838
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.040
But I'm writing this email for no reason.
So that obviously didn't happen.

839
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.120
Uh,
should I have fought harder to keep us together?
Just move on.

840
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.630
I'd never been in a relationship and I don't know what to do anymore.

841
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.920
Would appreciate your advice as always.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,

842
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:41.240
he sound like a funny kid,
man.
I think you get yourself,
you know,

843
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:46.400
I think you'll be fine.
Just keep using humor.
Cry It out.
Ia.
Yeah,

844
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.300
you'd fucking,

845
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.920
you fell hard for this person and then they sent you packing and then you'll

846
00:51:50.921 --> 00:51:55.130
like,
what?
Is there something wrong with me?
And it's like,
no,
there isn't.

847
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.210
You just not right.

848
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.100
It's not like she broke up with you for a specific thing.
You know,

849
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:05.300
you're torturing animals and I just don't like that about you.
She just said,

850
00:52:05.301 --> 00:52:08.180
well,
we're not right.
She didn't feel the spark the way you did.

851
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.620
That's what happens then she did you a favor.
So,
uh,

852
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:15.530
the best thing is you didn't yell at her and you're still kind of friendly with

853
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:18.740
her.
So what I would do is I would just fucking,
yeah,

854
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.270
but the don't brush it off.
Um,

855
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.160
if you have to like brush something off,
that means you,

856
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:28.700
you're trying to trick yourself that you don't give a shit.

857
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:33.140
You do give a shit and just sort of exist and giving a shit about it.

858
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.590
Talk it out with people.
Um,

859
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.760
but I would leave her alone,
but be friendly.
What they're,
say,
hey,

860
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:45.590
what's up and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And um,
you know,

861
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.260
and young,
he's still in high school.

862
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:50.840
Do you gotta you gotta you gotta a Zillion at bats.

863
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:54.290
That was your first fucking it bet.
You know,
what are you going to do?

864
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:56.900
So I wouldn't,
I wouldn't take it that hard.
Um,

865
00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.890
but it's normal that if you like somebody and they break up with you feed of

866
00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:02.570
feel bad.
All right.

867
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.790
If you could have just brushed it off like it was no big deal,

868
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:06.320
then that would mean that you didn't like,

869
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:11.470
or that you were like a sociopath and then what that would lead you to torturing

870
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:14.240
animals and eventually work your way up to,
uh,

871
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:18.860
the ultimate prey being a human being walking out of a seven,
11.
Unsuspectingly.

872
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:23.300
Uh,
so that's,
it.
Is that going to be the park has to be 53 minutes.

873
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:26.590
I'm contractually obligated to another six and a half minutes here.

874
00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.773
<v 2>Right.</v>

875
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.580
<v 1>So anyways,
I've been pretty good on my diet.</v>

876
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

877
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.430
<v 1>Um,
breakfast I've been better than anything else,</v>

878
00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.930
but just coming back here up and trying to avoid all the old haunts that I go
to,

879
00:53:40.931 --> 00:53:44.410
but it's been,
uh,
it's been difficult.

880
00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.960
I've been trying to do the smoothies in the morning.

881
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.690
<v 2>Um,
but you know,</v>

882
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.130
<v 1>I was staying with some relatives and they've just been,
you know,
it's just like,</v>

883
00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.870
oh,
so and so's in town,
let's make pancakes.
Right.

884
00:53:59.871 --> 00:54:02.660
And what are you going to say?
No,
actually no.

885
00:54:02.661 --> 00:54:06.320
Could I get some Greek yogurt with some berries and some Chia seeds,

886
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.660
whatever the fuck you call those things.
I mean,

887
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.450
that's acceptable on the west coast.
You do that out here.

888
00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:15.820
Everybody starts looking at you like,
hey dude,
you know,

889
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:20.570
don't forget where you came from.
Now
you're an east coast guy.
Okay,

890
00:54:20.571 --> 00:54:23.570
you die of a heart attack in your 50s or 60s.
They're,
you know,

891
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.040
that's how it works to get over here,

892
00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:28.610
sit down and eat this shit that's going to make you want to take a nap.

893
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

894
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.110
<v 1>That's basically it.
Right?
Um,
well I'm hoping,
uh,</v>

895
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.270
I'm open.
I can jump right back.

896
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.610
I'm going to jump right back on the Diet when I get out there.

897
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.640
I'm doing the best I can.
I can,
if I can get a fucking fell it today,

898
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.390
then I would,
I would be a,
I'd be fine.

899
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.400
I just have to get on the other side of this to be honest with you.

900
00:54:49.401 --> 00:54:54.401
I get to the other side of the fucking Chicago Theater Gig and once I do that,

901
00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:56.650
then I feel a,

902
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.420
<v 0>okay,</v>

903
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.340
<v 1>I can just cruise for the rest of the year.</v>

904
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.040
I'm going to do my eastern European tour and then some,

905
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.130
another little run.

906
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.640
I think next year how we're going to do is every six weeks I'm going to go

907
00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:12.100
overseas and knock something out,

908
00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.680
hopefully get some Australia dates and that type of shit.

909
00:55:14.681 --> 00:55:18.760
That is the game plan and somewhere in there to shoot a special,

910
00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.840
uh,
I don't know where or when yet,

911
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.353
<v 2>but um,</v>

912
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.990
<v 1>I don't know.
It's feeling like it's feeling like it's fucking ready.</v>

913
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:30.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

914
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.313
<v 1>You know,</v>

915
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.450
and I've been thrown in all these extra lines and people been really laughing at

916
00:55:34.451 --> 00:55:38.070
it in all of it just goes in the complete opposite direction

917
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.983
<v 2>of</v>

918
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.960
<v 1>all of this shit that's kind of been going on out there.</v>

919
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.040
<v 2>Um,
which might,
I dunno</v>

920
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.600
<v 1>means it's either going to be a really good special or I'm just going to get</v>

921
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:56.330
fucking trashed.
Well,

922
00:55:56.331 --> 00:55:58.790
like this just sounds like a whining,

923
00:55:58.791 --> 00:56:02.480
white male pining for the way things used to be,

924
00:56:02.481 --> 00:56:05.810
but where the paper bag and then when they do that fucking shit,
it's just like,

925
00:56:05.811 --> 00:56:07.150
no,
I'm a contrarion.
Okay.

926
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:08.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

927
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.160
<v 1>That's all it is.
Um,
so Abbott,
dentally a star is born.</v>

928
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

929
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.880
<v 1>Which stars?
Uh,
Dave Chappelle.
Andrew dice clay,</v>

930
00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:19.220
and I think there's one other comedian in there too.
I didn't see it.

931
00:56:19.221 --> 00:56:22.880
My wife saw never Duntley loved it to the point that she was crying.

932
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:24.310
A loved one died.

933
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.213
<v 2>MMM.</v>

934
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:31.440
<v 1>She's like,
you got to come out,
we have to see that movie.
And I was like,</v>

935
00:56:31.441 --> 00:56:35.460
is it like a dirty dancing type of movie?
Cause I just don't see myself.

936
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:38.263
<v 2>Uh,</v>

937
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:43.490
<v 1>maybe it was a good thing that you saw it by yourself and I guess she's like,</v>

938
00:56:43.491 --> 00:56:47.060
Bradley Cooper presented,
he's fucking unbelievable.
He wrote all the music,

939
00:56:47.061 --> 00:56:50.630
he's so talented.
And I was like,
Oh,
I love Bradley Cooper.
Right.
And she's like,

940
00:56:50.631 --> 00:56:54.560
Lady Gaga is in it.
And I was like,
oh.
She's like,
what's the matter?

941
00:56:54.561 --> 00:56:58.640
I you don't remember the long time ago when I went to the Lady Gaga concert with

942
00:56:58.641 --> 00:56:59.474
you?

943
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:04.110
It was the day the Patriots got crushed by the Ravens in the playoffs.

944
00:57:04.111 --> 00:57:07.050
So I had already had like six beers.
You don't remember that?

945
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.860
And evidently I said,
Jesus fucking Christ in the middle of the concert.

946
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:14.063
<v 2>MMM.</v>

947
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.090
<v 1>I've done only said it once.
She said he said it like four times.</v>

948
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.980
We got in this big fucking fight.

949
00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.080
<v 2>MMM.</v>

950
00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.190
<v 1>Not really.
She was just mad at me saying that I ruined the experience for us.</v>

951
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.950
So like ever since then whenever she goes to one of these big shows,

952
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:31.410
like she doesn't,
she doesn't ask me to go anymore,

953
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.600
which is funny.
But now that I said it out loud is a little sad.

954
00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:42.360
I think I should be able to sit through,
no,

955
00:57:42.361 --> 00:57:45.390
I liked lady Gaga when she was singing,
but it just kept,

956
00:57:45.391 --> 00:57:47.580
it just was like this fucking,
uh,

957
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:50.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

958
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.680
<v 1>I Dunno what it was.
It was like this self help program.</v>

959
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:54.180
I felt more than a concert.

960
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.973
<v 2>Okay.</v>

961
00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.800
<v 1>And they just kept fucking talking about how they didn't give a file.</v>

962
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:04.100
Give a fuck.
You give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.
It's just like,
well,

963
00:58:04.101 --> 00:58:05.930
get on with not giving a fuck.

964
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:07.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:11.420
<v 1>Who stands around talking about how they don't give a fuck Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

966
00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:15.920
I mean,
that's basically what it was long.
It was probably only like 20% of it.

967
00:58:15.921 --> 00:58:20.220
The other 80% was that my team lost and the fucking playoffs.
Um,

968
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.960
so it's probably a good thing.

969
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:27.230
<v 2>I don't know.
Yeah,</v>

970
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.100
<v 1>I'll be honest with you.
I don't,
I don't know.</v>

971
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

972
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.910
<v 1>I don't know if I can sit through a movie that has people singing in it.</v>

973
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

974
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.080
<v 1>And that has nothing to do with the people that are singing.</v>

975
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.930
And it has to do with me.
I just don't know what it is.
I,
I,

976
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.970
I can watch the dumbest shit ever.

977
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:49.170
Like somebody is a hundred people with machine guns shooting at the guy and

978
00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:50.700
somehow the guy doesn't die.

979
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:52.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

980
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:54.730
<v 1>Like that to me,
for some reason,</v>

981
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:59.590
it's less ridiculous than watching two people sitting across from each other

982
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:02.050
talking and all of a sudden one of them start singing

983
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.230
and nobody's like looking like to open a restaurant.
Could,

984
00:59:08.231 --> 00:59:10.930
can you stop fucking singing?
Just,
just say what you have to say.

985
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.383
<v 2>Okay.</v>

986
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:18.030
<v 1>You weird me out here like no,
nope.
That moment never happens in a musical.</v>

987
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.700
You know,
it's funny as I have,
I don't even know what that movie's about.

988
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:25.410
I go see it.
Um,
cause I may,
uh,

989
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.510
I dunno.
I,
I watched the same fucking movie over and over again.
It's just,

990
00:59:32.511 --> 00:59:34.970
it has a different title.
So,
you know,
I'm going abroad,
my run,
you know,
fuck it.

991
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:38.060
I'm going to go see that movie.
I got to see it cause decent Chappelle or in it.

992
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.500
Um,
but yeah.
Oh God.

993
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:45.580
If I go there,
my wife is crying,

994
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.820
then I have to like comfort her and all that shit.
Jesus Christ.
It's just like,

995
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.560
Hey,
are we having a good time?
Look at you.

996
00:59:52.561 --> 00:59:54.950
You're fucking cry and an hour walking in public.

997
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:57.290
And everybody's looking at me like I just said something mean to you.

998
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:59.990
And I gotta be like,
no,
no,
no.
She just saw star is born.

999
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.600
It was really good.
That's why she has an expression on her face.

1000
01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:09.570
Like something really bad just happened.
Uh,

1001
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.460
was that dirty dancing?
Weird.
Our word word,

1002
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.250
you know,
I don't know.

1003
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:24.560
There's people who watch top gun and they liked the airplanes and then there's

1004
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:29.561
other people that watch it and they liked the kiss between Tom Cruise and Kelly

1005
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.110
Mcginnis.
Me,
I just like the volleyball game.

1006
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:43.010
I know.
I'm fucking with you.
I'm all right.
Thanks to listen to the podcast.

1007
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:47.450
Thank you to everybody who came out to Springfield,
Boston and uh,

1008
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.650
Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

1009
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.680
My mind is blown that I was able to play in those venues.

1010
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:57.410
It was,
it didn't even make sense.
I felt like a fucking cartoon character.

1011
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:02.570
I never,
never,
never even thought I could ever do,

1012
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.970
would ever do something like that.
So thank you so much.
And everybody,
Saginaw,

1013
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:10.940
Michigan,
you know,
it's fucking amazing.
Most sagging initial Michigan.

1014
01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:16.060
My great grandfather and grandmother had a house in Saginaw,

1015
01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:16.761
Michigan.

1016
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:20.420
And I'm going to drive and take a picture of it for some of my relatives because

1017
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:21.950
they want to see if it's still the same thing,

1018
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:24.740
but they live there like a fucking hundred years ago.
See,
you never know.

1019
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.690
It's probably has solar panels on it.
Some growing,

1020
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.490
knocked it down and made a mcmansion,
a fucking hot tub and shit in there.

1021
01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:33.590
Who knows.
Uh,
but I'm really looking forward to,

1022
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:36.540
cause I've never performed at Saginaw,
Michigan.
So,
uh,

1023
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.270
we're all bringing our a game.
Me Versie Barnick,
Saginaw,
Michigan.

1024
01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.440
The next day we go into the big house.
So you there at the tailgate.
All right.

1025
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:50.360
Look for two bald guys in one fucking giant Cam Neely looking guy and will be

1026
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:54.260
hammered.
We'll see there.
All right.
Check in on you on Thursday.
