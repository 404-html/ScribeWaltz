00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.781
Hey,

2
00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:04.590
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:07.770
January 21st,

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.720
2019 what's going on?

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.650
How's it going everybody?

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.330
How was your weekend of playoff football?

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.760
I'll tell you right now,
if you didn't have a fucking view,

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.760
didn't have a fucking dog in that fight,

9
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:31.230
you just sat back and enjoyed both of those fucking crazy games.
Um,

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.330
sort of I guess.
Um,

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.090
yeah,
I don't even know where to begin.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.810
All I can just say his overall,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.970
both of those games is exactly what the NFL wants,
which is heart attack,

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.890
fucking football games.

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.670
And I know there was a lot of shit given to the refs,

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.320
but I think so much of it is them just applying 20 years of rule changes that

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.640
all essentially benefit the offense.

18
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.563
<v 1>MMM.</v>

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.370
<v 0>It drives me fucking nuts.
I know.
I always sound like an old man,
but I hate it.</v>

20
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.350
I fucking,
I can't stand it.
I know my team won,

21
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:22.670
but I fight those fucking games sucked yesterday.

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.440
Okay.
I just,
I can't fight him.
I don't know.
I don't even know where to begin.

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.210
I mean,
if that's what the fuck you want to watch,

24
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.220
just two teams just going up and down the field.

25
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.690
Can you believe in it's 56th 52 oh my God.

26
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:40.691
Now they scored 59 56 if you want to fucking watch that for a God damn three

27
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.690
hours.
You know what I mean?
You'll,

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.830
you'll like some fucking fat kid who wants to go right to dessert,
you know,

29
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.310
no one wants to eat their vegetables.
No one wants to see any fucking difference.

30
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.283
<v 1>MMM.</v>

31
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.400
<v 0>I don't even know where to begin.</v>

32
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:02.401
I actually somehow sat through the Patriots game just sitting there,

33
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.390
you know,
I got my daughter now,

34
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.120
so it's like I'm not going to be this guy flipping out and everything like that.

35
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:09.190
And I was able to remain calm.

36
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.033
<v 1>MMM.</v>

37
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.400
<v 0>Until 39 seconds left in the game.</v>

38
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.780
And after that I just lost my shit where I was just like,

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.210
this is so fucking,
I was already watching like the chiefs now,
you know what?

40
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.100
The first time I lost my shit was when it was,

41
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.440
there was nine 54 to go in the game.

42
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
We had fourth any yard or a half of the yard.

43
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.460
And we had essentially for the NFL,
a chip shot field goal,

44
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:44.040
which would've put us up by six.
Okay.

45
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.260
And I'm thinking,
and,

46
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:51.261
and we go for it and we don't get it and we're fucking kills me was no one gave

47
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.500
Bella check any shit because that's just the way the game's played now.

48
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.360
It's like you'd be up by six,

49
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.110
even if the chiefs go down the field score a touchdown,

50
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.430
they're only going to be up by one and now you can go down the field,

51
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.691
kick a field goal,

52
00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:10.670
go up by two or score a touchdown and put it away for the fucking life of me.

53
00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:14.450
I don't understand the way the game is played now.

54
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.980
And I guess,
cause I'm sitting there,
well,

55
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.510
I'm just a stand up fucking comedian.
He's bill Bellacheck.

56
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.290
Obviously he knows what's what you're supposed to do here.

57
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.560
I think there's just so many rules that are in favor of the offense that you

58
00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:34.980
just know the other teams essentially going to score.
We can't,
that,

59
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.480
that taking a three points is like,
uh,

60
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.120
like not,
um,
I dunno.
It's like not kicking an extra point.
Who gives a fuck?

61
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.860
I have no idea.
I don't fucking get it.
Um,
I haven't said that.

62
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:53.360
I know there's a bunch of people upset about the officiating and you know,

63
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.320
I mean,
I,
I,
I'm,
I'm with you on it.

64
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.840
I don't think all of them were bad calls.

65
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:03.110
I just think there's just a bunch of bad rules that totally tipped it in the

66
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:07.850
favor of the offense.
If you just look in the last year,

67
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.170
Tom Brady threw 500 yards in a Superbowl in lost

68
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.220
Patrick.
My homes is a rookie quarterback and he threw 50 fucking touchdowns.

69
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.390
I'm not saying the guy isn't great.
He's fucking unbelievable.
I love him.
Okay.

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.890
But 50 touchdowns by a rookie,
this something wrong with the eleague.

71
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.083
<v 1>MMM.</v>

72
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.160
<v 0>Last week we tackled Philip Rivers while he had the ball and we got caught for,</v>

73
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.080
we got called for roughing the passer this week.
I watched the chiefs,

74
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.400
the guy's hand,

75
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.690
I think it caused air that that disrupted Tom Brady's eyelash,

76
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.840
not even eyelashes,
his eyelash.

77
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.140
And they got called for roughing the fucking passer.
Then Patrick,

78
00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:58.610
my homes actually got hit,
which was also a fucking love tap,

79
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.810
a love tap and he's wearing a helmet and I saw him look at the ref and while I

80
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:04.730
was watching the game I was like,
all right rock,

81
00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:06.530
you're going to get that call in two to three years.

82
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:10.010
You don't have the seniority yet to get that call.
But Tom Brady gets that call.

83
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.400
But that's always get the calls.
All right,

84
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:16.430
but that's fucking shit.
Whereas a,

85
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.930
an offensive lineman is pushing you down and you're only thing is you can dive

86
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:24.110
at the quarterbacks of legs and you actually sack them and then they call you

87
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:26.690
for roughing the passer.
I mean,
I don't know what to fucking do with that.

88
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.403
<v 1>MMM.</v>

89
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.590
<v 0>I Dunno.
But you know,
if chiefs fans are going to whine about the ref,</v>

90
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.580
the officiating,

91
00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:38.180
you know or whine about that non call on your fucking pick play too.
I mean,

92
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:42.140
let's be fair about it.
Um,
I also,
as a patriots fan,

93
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:47.141
I was surprised that they reversed the call on Adelman touching it because on

94
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:50.480
the replay it looks like he doesn't touch it.

95
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.950
But you can't say that it didn't touch his forearm hair.
Um,

96
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.330
I guess they went with the ball,
didn't change sort of direction,

97
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.280
<v 2>wobble stopper or anything like that.
I was surprised they switched that.
But um,</v>

98
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.730
all you fucking wine paiche Patriot haters out there who say the referees love

99
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.200
us guy.
You're really forgetting deflate gate.

100
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.980
<v 0>Roger Goodell fucking hates us.
The league does not like us.
Okay.</v>

101
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.010
They allowed the owner of another team to conduct his own private investigation.

102
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.430
This wasn't the league.

103
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.790
It was the owner who poo paid a guy to dig up dirt and the dirty found he also

104
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.950
found with the colts,
they completely ignored all of that.

105
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.640
Suspended our quarterback,
the golden boy.
Ooh.
Don't touch him.

106
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760
Suspended him initially more than they suspended a guy on the ravens who fucking

107
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.210
knocked his wife out on video in a fucking elevator.

108
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.250
So I don't know what world you're living in.

109
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.630
I think it just sick of fucking lose into us and I will go with that.

110
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:55.370
The officiating was terrible.
I'll go with the,
at the fucking rules are terrible,

111
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:59.090
but I don't,
I stopped short of that.
The refs love the Patriots.

112
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.903
<v 1>MMM.</v>

113
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.210
<v 0>Yeah.
Roger Goodell fucking hates us.</v>

114
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.000
<v 0>And he did everything he could fucking do to suspend our quarterback,</v>

116
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.260
which he ended up doing.

117
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.890
He actually lost it in a court of law and then like the little fucking cunt that

118
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:19.080
he is,
he went back and completely switched his argument.

119
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.800
Not that the Patriots are cheating,
was that that they were a corporation.

120
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.960
Tom Brady's and employee doesn't,

121
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.920
a corporation had the right to suspend an employee and the court was like,
yeah,

122
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.980
fine.
He's our employee.
He suspended.
All right.
So if that's loving us,

123
00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:32.970
I don't know what to tell you.

124
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.523
<v 1>MMM.</v>

125
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.240
<v 2>Having said that,
my heart goes out to fucking chiefs fans.
I was actually,</v>

126
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.173
<v 1>you know,</v>

127
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.730
<v 2>at one point being like,
all right,
if the chiefs,
when this,</v>

128
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.500
then I can just fucking relax during a fucking super bowl.

129
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.160
I can watch old NFL,
classic old NFL team.

130
00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:57.150
The rams verse,
a classic old AFL team,
um,

131
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.670
in the chiefs and,

132
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.870
and I could just fucking enjoy a god damn Superbowl for once without having to

133
00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:05.940
fucking sit there,
you know,

134
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.400
having a fucking heart attack while the whole world's watching,

135
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:11.700
wanting your fucking team to lose and then have to listen to comments for you.

136
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.410
<v 0>You're like nick foals kick Tom Brady's ass when he threw for almost half as</v>

137
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:18.560
many fucking yards.
It's like no,
he beat the Patriots defense.

138
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.033
<v 3>Okay.</v>

139
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.500
<v 0>The only guy,
I wouldn't say he beat Tom Brady was fucking uh,
Eli Manning.</v>

140
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:27.810
Cause Eli manning is the only guy in a game.

141
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:31.830
I think Tom Brady could questionably say he fucked up when he threw to Welker.

142
00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:33.990
He through the back shoulder welcome.
Probably should've caught it.

143
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:36.270
Who the fuck knows?
I'll give you that one.
But other than that,

144
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:39.750
every fucking Superbowl Tom has drove the team down the fucking field for the

145
00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:43.920
winning touchdown.
It's our defense that fucks it up.
Like yesterday.

146
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.070
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

147
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.360
<v 0>39 fucking seconds left.
And what these fucking rule changes.</v>

148
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.560
<v 0>Or up by three points,
you kick it away.</v>

150
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.210
You're them on the 20 day driving all the way fucked up dude,
too.

151
00:08:58.211 --> 00:09:01.690
Fucking offensive plays in there on our 20 yard line.

152
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.930
<v 0>If there was 49 seconds left,</v>

154
00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:07.180
they would have had a chance to throw it into the fucking end zone.

155
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.680
Like that was when I was up off the couch when it went into overtime.

156
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:14.350
At that point,
I didn't even give a fuck who won the game.
I was just like,

157
00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:18.640
fuck this.
This isn't even fucking football anymore.
It's a fucking joke.

158
00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.040
It's just,
it's just Madden Instagram.

159
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.860
Every fucking game out is,

160
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.290
they changed the rules to the point where it's going to turn into the,
the,

161
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.250
the 40 or the Miami Dolphins,
San Diego charges,
which was,
uh,

162
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.310
a game of the decade happens like every three weeks now.

163
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.580
Now I know I sound like a fucking curmudgeon here,
but like,
I dunno,
I miss,

164
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.560
I miss great defenses with nicknames and Shit.

165
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.740
I guess the last one maybe was Seattle with legion of boom,

166
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.560
<v 2>but I don't even think that took off.</v>

167
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.110
I think that that was just in Seattle where everybody used to say doomsday,

168
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.440
purple people eaters,
steel curtain,
the sack exchange,
all of that shit.

169
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.270
Um,
I dunno.
Let me ask you this guys.

170
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:04.340
W W W who's the fucking Ronnie Lott in the League right now?

171
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.120
Who's the Jack Lambert?
Where's the fucking Ray Lewis?
They just,

172
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:11.990
they don't fucking exist.
They're not allowed to play the fucking game.

173
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.770
If you can tackle a quarterback with the fucking ball and that's roughing the

174
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:19.130
passer,
man,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Um,
and furthermore,

175
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.950
people will keep saying that Tom Brady's the greatest of all time.

176
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.470
It's still Joe Montana to me,
Joe Montana,

177
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:27.800
one four in one decade with two different coaches heal his bill.

178
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:31.070
Bellacheck quit and you are allowed to beat the fuck out of the quarterback.

179
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.200
So if Joe Montana plays today,

180
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.280
Bill Walsh sticks around like they'll Bella check does and he doesn't take that

181
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:41.870
hit against the giants and he plays into his forties.
I think you can get five.

182
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.770
All right.
I know in this first 10 minutes you wouldn't know that my team won.

183
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:48.520
But like,
you know,
I don't know,
I just

184
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.771
<v 0>don't listen to me.</v>

185
00:10:50.771 --> 00:10:54.910
I'm just an old fucking man who's watched the game change and I'm acting like,

186
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:58.300
who was that guy that played for

187
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.440
the eagles?
He was the last guy to start both ways.

188
00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:04.570
And there was an NFL film clip of him,

189
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:06.280
cause he used to always shit on the new games,

190
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.610
the new players because they didn't start both ways.
And you'd be like,
oh,

191
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:12.940
I wouldn't watch a football game every day of your baby.

192
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.900
Anyways,
so that's my take.
I don't think the referees love the Patriots.

193
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:22.280
I just think that it's

194
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.760
<v 3>okay.</v>

195
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.760
<v 0>It's just all about the offenses.
Now having said that,</v>

196
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:29.730
talking about the saints and the fucking Rams,

197
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.120
the saints absolutely got royally fucked over s times too

198
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.670
by the referees because it wasn't like that play was away from the ball.

199
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.330
It was where the ball was going and there was two major,

200
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.600
major fucking penalties on that play that have literally changed game to the

201
00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:59.091
point you have a rookie quarterback throwing for 50 fucking touchdowns that was

202
00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.950
pass interference and helmet to helmet contact.

203
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.400
The whole fucking stadium was looking where the ball went.
Yeah.

204
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.523
<v 3>You know</v>

205
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.430
<v 0>that Kansas City pick play that no Kansas City fan is going to fucking bring up</v>

206
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.810
when they whine about the officiating.
I,

207
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.800
I can see them missing that play.
You know,

208
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:21.960
you're watching the fucking ball,
this,
you know,

209
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.230
four or five players all fucking moving at the same time.
But that was,

210
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:26.370
I don't know,
I don't get that.

211
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.360
And people who argue that the saints could've put the rams away,

212
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.340
you're acting as though the rams aren't the rams who it's looking like they have

213
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:40.230
the next bill Belicheck on their hands as a head coach who's only like fucking

214
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:40.981
33,

215
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:45.630
34 years old now it's going to take 60 minutes to put them away.

216
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.880
Um,
I usually like that argument that,

217
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:55.210
you know,
you've,
uh,
you know,

218
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:58.630
you got to put a team away when you have a chance to put a team away.
Um,

219
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.250
I wouldn't use that with the saints because the rams or to go to fucking team to

220
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.080
be like,
well,
we handled them and a half,

221
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:09.280
let's just fucking play our game and show up the clock and,
you know,

222
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.610
and we can just win this one going away.
Um,

223
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.620
I would have used that argument against the Patriots where we should have kicked

224
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:19.360
that fucking field though.
I just don't understand.

225
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.100
I don't understand going forward.

226
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.880
Were up by three fucking points and you're going forward,

227
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:28.810
like there's no time left on the fucking clock and you're down by four.

228
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.930
Uh,
but that's,
you know,
I guess that's how the fucking games plates.

229
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.490
So here we go.
Another Superbowl.
Um,

230
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.280
the chiefs are the team of the future though,
in the AFC,
even if I'm,

231
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.140
believe it or not,
this is a rebuilding year for the Patriots,

232
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.470
having lost all the talents of free agent that we have.

233
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:52.950
So the fact that they made it to another fucking Superbowl is ridiculous.

234
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.863
Um,

235
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

236
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.350
<v 0>But like I said,
I don't know.
I'm sure this is coming off like what the fuck?</v>

237
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:02.650
But like I don't,
I don't sit there and talk shit and rub other fucking people.

238
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.770
You know,
like I played that noses in it.

239
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.920
All I can say is like NFL football has changed the way stand up comedy has

240
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:15.910
changed in the last couple of years to the point like you don't even fucking

241
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:17.740
recognize it.
You know,

242
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:22.741
I'm sitting here watching other comedians going on radio shows and,

243
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:23.161
and,

244
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:28.161
and social media attacking other fucking comedians and literally saying what

245
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:31.930
they should or shouldn't be saying on stage is like,

246
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.310
what the fuck am I watching?
And I watch NFL football.

247
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.113
<v 3>You know,</v>

248
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.020
<v 0>you can't hit a quarterback below the knees.
You can't hit him in the head.</v>

249
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.890
He can have the ball and you,

250
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:48.400
if you tackle them too hard or in one of those areas,

251
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.470
it's roughing the fucking passer.

252
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.830
If you push them down onto the ground,

253
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.900
it's roughing the fucking passer.
Dude.
How many fucking times?
By the way,

254
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.930
we'll a quarterback throw his shit fucking ball and the defensive back goes up

255
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:08.360
to intercepted and the in the y and you know at that point the defensive back

256
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.420
has position and the wide receivers behind him on his back hands all fucking

257
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:19.160
over him.
It breaks up the fucking pass.
Not only is it not interference,

258
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200
the guys in the booth guy was a heads up play.
Um,

259
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:24.880
<v 3>okay.</v>

260
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.870
<v 0>That's why you have everybody's thrown for 5,000 yards and 50 fucking touchdowns</v>

261
00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:29.890
is all I'm fucking saying,

262
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.420
which is why you can't go back and look at Joe Montana and say that he is

263
00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:38.590
somehow inferior to Tom Brady.
I just don't buy it.
All right,

264
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.660
so here we go again.

265
00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:43.570
Now I'm going to age and other 10,000 fucking years and fuck all you guys are.

266
00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:47.740
Go You fucking spoiled Patriots Fan.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Okay.

267
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:49.300
Walk a mile in my fucking shoes.

268
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:52.630
I've been in your shoes where you never fucking get there.
That's sucks.

269
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.930
Losing an AFC championship game sucks.
I'll tell you what's worse.

270
00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.100
Losing a fucking Superbowl when the whole world's watching.

271
00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:03.310
So the next time you go to Belgium,
some asshole shows up with the fucking,

272
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.860
you ain't no giants or an eagle shirt and get you,

273
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:09.190
you get worldwide shit for that loss.
Um,

274
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.340
so anyways,

275
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.720
I'm just an old curmudgeon who would like to see more of a balanced game,

276
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:20.350
but I also think because of that CT shit,

277
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.570
they kind of have to protect everybody.

278
00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:25.960
So I do love seeing defensive players hitting with their shoulders and not

279
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:29.620
hitting guys in the head.
I do like that aspect of the fucking game.

280
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.030
Um,
and uh,
you know,
I don't know.

281
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.260
Other than that,
I don't know what the,

282
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.760
I don't even know what the fuck I watched yesterday and I have been consistent

283
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.230
with that the whole fucking year.

284
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.400
<v 0>All right.
I hated that chiefs rams game.</v>

286
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.400
Um,
and as much as you guys are gonna just sit there saying I'm some whining

287
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:55.280
patriots fan.
I,
there was literally NFL players tweeting.

288
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:58.850
What the fuck I was saying,
Teddy Bruschi,
Richard Sherman,

289
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.760
they all said the same thing I did.
And you fucking cunts.

290
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.660
Don't bring that up to you though.
Yeah.
Um,

291
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.130
all right.
Uh,
all right.
Um,

292
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.580
<v 3>okay.</v>

293
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.181
<v 0>You know what it is.</v>

294
00:17:12.181 --> 00:17:15.450
It's also because now I have a kid and I can't get out all this fucking energy.

295
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:16.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

296
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.920
<v 0>Like I just sit there stoically and then it just fucking builds up.
So I'm sorry,</v>

297
00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:24.700
I'm regurgitating all of this shit.
Um,
having said that,

298
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:28.330
congratulations to the ramps,
you know,
you're not making the calls out there.

299
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.280
My condolences to the saint fans.
That was my pick.
Um,

300
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.790
I did not like the Patriots chances against the saints.

301
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.360
I don't really like them against the Ramsey.
That'd be honest with you.
Um,

302
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.560
I definitely think the NFC stronger and Micah Donald to chief fans.

303
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.280
Um,
all I can say is that you're going to,
I,
I,

304
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.980
you're definitely the team in the future,
in the AFC.
Um,

305
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.660
<v 3>yeah.</v>

306
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.570
<v 0>Unless,
I dunno.
Brady keeps fucking drinking his fan prior,</v>

307
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:01.140
prior blood and plays until he's 45,
but even then,

308
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.560
the homes is so fucking young.
Um,

309
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.640
<v 3>okay.</v>

310
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.470
<v 0>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
Anyways.
Yes.
Uh,
this weekend,
uh,</v>

311
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.560
celebrated my daughter's second birthday.

312
00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:19.030
I made a fucking birthday cake like a champ.
Um,

313
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.320
sorry,
dude,
I'm fucked.
I'm sorry.
I'm fucking spent from both of those games.

314
00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:30.160
Just today I had those games and my daughter's birthday.

315
00:18:30.161 --> 00:18:34.990
So the whole first part of the day was stressing out.
That might,

316
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.430
no one was going to like my birthday cake running around making sure,
you know,

317
00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:43.330
the,
the bubble lady was showing up who've,
who crushed it by the way.

318
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.260
We had a guy come by,
did the music portion,

319
00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:50.410
everybody loved that and we built it perfectly.

320
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:54.640
And then there was the bubble lady and then we did the birthday cake.

321
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.960
It was perfect opener.
Middler headliner,
you know,

322
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:04.030
the whole thing worked out.
And um,
the kids freaked out.

323
00:19:04.031 --> 00:19:07.840
The bubble lady was like,
next level,
like kids love fucking bubbles.

324
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:10.020
So all you have is that little fucking won,
you know,
that you,

325
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.170
your blow the bubbles through.

326
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.130
And then this lady came down with like fucking four kiddie pools with these

327
00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:21.550
bubbles.
The size of like special effects of,
of summertime,
blockbuster.

328
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:25.510
And these kids who were like,
I is this,
is this really happening?

329
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.250
Like they didn't care about it.
They didn't even care about cake.

330
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:34.251
After that she shut down the birthday cake with the bubble display that she put

331
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:40.890
on,
you know,
other parents where they're going.
Where did you find this person?

332
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.640
They were getting her information.
She was crushing it,
you know,

333
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:47.340
it was like watching a comedian do a private gig and there's like three other

334
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:51.510
companies there and he gets,
he gets like three,
four more fucking gigs out of it.

335
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.930
Um,
I dunno,

336
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:57.580
I don't,

337
00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.800
I feel like I went to fucking hard on the officiating in the fucking game does

338
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:02.540
going on,
but I,
I just,
I dunno,

339
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.130
maybe I'm just worn out watching the fucking games.
But
um,

340
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.530
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

341
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.130
<v 3>yeah,</v>

342
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.370
<v 0>so we knocked all of that out and then I watched them.</v>

343
00:20:15.371 --> 00:20:18.790
My daughter takes her nap and I watched that first,

344
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.370
the first game and then she woke up,

345
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:24.900
we did more birthday stuff.

346
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.970
Then I watched the Patriots game on tape delay announced the next morning.

347
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.390
I'm like,
just fucking worn out here.
Um,

348
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:40.570
I can't fucking believe they're in another Superbowl.
I can't fucking believe it.

349
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.700
Unfucking real.
Does Brady have plinth fifth?
They win this.

350
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:49.110
Do you think Brady retires?
The guy should retire.
Right.

351
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

352
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.110
<v 0>Then he goes,
what does he have?
He's got,</v>

353
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:53.840
<v 3>yeah,</v>

354
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.460
<v 0>you'd have six.
He would be tied</v>

355
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.050
with the Steelers who for some reason are considered the New York Yankees of NFL

356
00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:07.490
football.
Um,
you know,

357
00:21:07.491 --> 00:21:10.790
I've never really gotten anybody to fucking explain to me why they don't count

358
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:15.410
NFL titles because the packers are the team.

359
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.660
And then at then I think it's like the giants because the giants have won four

360
00:21:20.661 --> 00:21:21.760
super bowls.

361
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.180
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

362
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.920
<v 0>And I don't know how many NFL titles they've won.
Let me check this shit out.</v>

363
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.500
I love this nerd shit here.
Um,
all right.

364
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.640
New York giants,
your New York giants.

365
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.590
All right.
What are they got here?
Alright.
Easter's written marriages,
blah,
blah,

366
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.453
blah.

367
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:42.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

368
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.180
<v 0>Don't even tell me then.
Okay.
Nfl Championships,
pre 1970,
they have four.</v>

369
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.820
So the way I see it,

370
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:50.790
<v 3>okay.</v>

371
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.710
<v 0>I,
you know,
I should make a list of these things.</v>

372
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.850
The fucking New York giants have eight titles.

373
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.760
<v 3>Okay.</v>

374
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.120
<v 0>For Nfl titles and four Superbowls.</v>

375
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.370
So they should be ahead of the Patriots
because we have

376
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.740
five Superbowls.
That's it.

377
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.230
<v 3>Okay.</v>

378
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.120
<v 0>Um,
I wouldn't count AFL titles</v>

379
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.090
the same way you're in a,
you don't count Aba Championships.

380
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:25.260
The Aba merged with the NBA and the Celtics still got to keep all their

381
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.910
championships in the Minneapolis.

382
00:22:26.911 --> 00:22:31.230
Lakers got to keep those a fucking Lakers even kept a BA championship that they

383
00:22:31.231 --> 00:22:34.290
send out counters an NBA championship.
I'll never not bring that up.

384
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

385
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.403
<v 0>All right.</v>

386
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.113
<v 3>Okay.</v>

387
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.850
<v 0>You know Stanley cups go all the way back to early.</v>

388
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:44.850
He fucking 19 hundreds and world series.

389
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.920
They give the fucking Philadelphia Phillies,
let me look them up.
They get credit.

390
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.700
They want one in fucking 1880.

391
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.260
You know they want to one in like 18 fucking 80,

392
00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:00.830
where like if you brought it up like hey,

393
00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:04.520
how come in 1880 if you brought up like,
hey,

394
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:08.510
how come there's no black people on your team?

395
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.870
First of all they'd say,
what's a black person?
And then refer to say,

396
00:23:11.871 --> 00:23:15.950
you mean Edwards?
You mean former slaves?
Like that's how long ago it was.

397
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.093
<v 3>Okay,</v>

398
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.860
<v 0>where are we?
What happened?
How many do they want?
Let's see.
That</v>

399
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.230
major title world series.
Oh wait,

400
00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:31.530
1980 they haven't won one went back down.
Wait a second.
How can only say,
okay,

401
00:23:31.531 --> 00:23:35.310
I put it on the Phillies.
Who the fuck was it?
First World

402
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.970
<v 3>Series
Baseball.</v>

403
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.700
<v 0>Oh,
I always thought when they want it in 1980 they had one in a hundred fucking</v>

404
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.310
years.
Oh,

405
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:52.880
the 1903 world series was the first modern world series.

406
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:54.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

407
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.470
<v 0>Is that the first one that they count?</v>

408
00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

409
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.180
<v 0>Oh wait a second.
Wait a second.</v>

410
00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

411
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.220
<v 0>1884 world series.</v>

412
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.840
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.750
<v 0>All right.
And baseball.</v>

414
00:24:04.751 --> 00:24:09.190
The 1884 world series was a post season championship between the Providence

415
00:24:09.191 --> 00:24:13.210
Grays of the National League and the New York Metropolitan's of the American

416
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:17.860
associations at the Polo grounds in New York City,
which is now it's in Harlem.

417
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:18.940
There's a little plaque up there.

418
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:21.850
I looked at it one time by myself because I'm weird.

419
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:27.210
While the 1884 post season championship series was the first such to be referred

420
00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:31.690
to as the World Series Major League Baseball considers 1903 world series the

421
00:24:31.691 --> 00:24:34.690
first.
I've been saying that for years.

422
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.210
Shitting on the Phillies and no one's ever corrected me.

423
00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:40.990
At least I didn't see it.
All right,
so 1903 let's see,

424
00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:44.320
the 1903 world series.
All right.

425
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.390
1903 world series

426
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.900
was the Boston Americans first,

427
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:54.920
the Pittsburgh pirates in the Boston Americans one five to three whatever.

428
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:56.540
Fuck five games to three,

429
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.260
so as best five out of nine.

430
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.043
<v 3>Okay.</v>

431
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.560
<v 0>Well,
whatever it happened to the Boston Americans
say,</v>

432
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.300
this is the shit here.
This is why.

433
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:11.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

434
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.390
<v 0>Being a sports fan is great and then also just this is what I'm going to lose.</v>

435
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:15.610
My Boston Americans

436
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:22.700
Wiki PDF,
the Boston Americans,

437
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.050
Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston,

438
00:25:28.051 --> 00:25:31.830
Massachusetts.
Wait a minute.
The Red sox compete at the major league baseball

439
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.610
weighted.
That's not our first world series title is it?
It is.
That's us.

440
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.780
Two three four,
five,
six,
seven eight nine

441
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.990
we would call the Boston Americans

442
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.870
well series,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

I didn't,

443
00:25:57.871 --> 00:26:02.430
I had no idea.
I didn't know that.
1903 now.

444
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.410
Who the fuck played in that game?

445
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

446
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.650
<v 0>If the Boston Red Sox can count a 1903</v>

447
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.063
<v 3>yeah.</v>

448
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.540
<v 0>I mean,
we didn't like their way.
There was no option to fly to a game.</v>

449
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.060
No one had ever flown before.

450
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.750
19 Oh fucking three.

451
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.010
<v 0>Ladies,

453
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.180
how about a round of applause for all our heroes from the Spanish American war?

454
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.270
Jay coming down and I let me try something.

455
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.250

456
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.460
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

457
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.480
<v 0>they didn't even have motion pictures.</v>

458
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.910
<v 3>Jesus Christ,
they're fucking Masco is probably a fucking Doto burgers.</v>

459
00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:51.410
Probably still alive back then.

460
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.900
Named the only fucking major league baseball team with an endangered species

461
00:26:56.901 --> 00:27:00.440
that was at the fucking ballpark when it won his first world series.
All right.

462
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:05.000
Now if they can count that shit,
why do I care?

463
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:08.300
Why do I care this much?
All right.
Stanley Cup

464
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.880
<v 0>j a list of Stanley Cup champions.
How far back do they go?</v>

465
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.153
Um,

466
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.130
1890 fucking three the Montreal hockey club.

467
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.410
Now you can't tell me that they played in an arena,

468
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.900
in an arena that that'd be like on the fucking pond.

469
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:36.010
1893 h a c champions,

470
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:43.640
Montreal Hockey Club,
the Montreal Victoria's to Macho.
Let's look for the first,

471
00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:48.641
like Montreal Canadians are a team that I recognize the Winnipeg Victoria,

472
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:54.830
so they moved out to Winnipeg.
Then whether they moved to Phoenix after that.

473
00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.530
Montreal hockey club.
Montreal hockey club.

474
00:27:57.531 --> 00:28:02.300
This is 1903 Ottawa.

476
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.530
nine,
10 fucking years in a row.

477
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.820
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

478
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.960
<v 0>In 1903 the Ottawa hockey club beat the rat porridge.
This'll</v>

479
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.250

480
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.050
I think I have to get a rat porridge.
Fucking hockey jersey.

481
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.890
The Kanora thistles they originally known as the Rad Porridge.
This those.

482
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:39.260
All right.
I gotta look this up.

483
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.520
You can't tell me Mitchell and ness has not put out a fucking rad porridge.

484
00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:44.354
This'll yet.

485
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.780
Jersey Rad Porridge.

486
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:53.850
This'll jersey images.

487
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.360
Oh,

488
00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.353
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

489
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:04.560
<v 0>I Dunno.
You can buy it and there's no rat on it.
It's got the fissile on it.
Ah,</v>

490
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:05.860
you fucking cunt.

491
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.770
Somebody wife came up with that fucking name.

492
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.070
Ken Norton.
Thistles.
Third string goalie.

<v 3>Okay.</v>

495
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.840
<v 0>What would you look at that</v>

496
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.910
Jesus Christ.
Look at the team photo of the fucking Rad Porridge.

497
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.470
This'll all right now I'm going to say the guy in the front row on the left was

498
00:29:37.471 --> 00:29:42.290
the one who came up with that logo if not the other in the left and the second

499
00:29:42.291 --> 00:29:45.950
row.
And those two guys might may have been dating each other.

500
00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.290
That's what I'm getting out of that photo.

501
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.800
Not to say that there's anything wrong with it.
Okay.

502
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.770
Progressive lifestyles have existed for a long time.

503
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.760
They just haven't been recognized.
Um,
anyways.

504
00:29:59.560 --> 00:29:59.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

505
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.100
<v 0>Plowing ahead here.</v>

506
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:02.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

507
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.650
<v 0>Um,
I'll tell you what,
I'll make a promise you,
this is the last time,</v>

508
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:06.670
I don't know if I could do that.

509
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.800
I would say it's the last time that I'm going to complain about fucking

510
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.800
all of these fucking sports.
Jesus Christ.
He can you guys at least get,

511
00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:18.220
get me that.
I'm making at least a little bit of a decent point.
You know,

512
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.060
how many times are you going to watch a guy drive the lane in the NBA now and

513
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:23.770
the defender literally get out of the way?

514
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:25.960
Cause he doesn't want to end up on fucking Instagram.
I mean,

515
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:29.860
that just didn't happen back in the fucking day.
All right,
let me read some,
uh,

516
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.260
let me read some,
uh,

517
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:33.840
<v 3>okay.</v>

518
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.370
<v 0>Advertising here.
All right.
Oh look who's here.
Rolled Zip.</v>

519
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.990
Uh,
you know what's not smart?
Pick one of the following.

520
00:30:45.991 --> 00:30:47.430
Feel free to make it your own.

521
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.110
A job boards that send you candidates that aren't qualified for the role you

522
00:30:52.111 --> 00:30:52.944
posted.

523
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:54.250
<v 3>Okay.</v>

524
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.360
<v 0>But you know,
it is smart.</v>

525
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.980
That's the only one that gave me going to zip recruiter.com/burner to hire the

526
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:02.890
right person.
Unlike other job sites,

527
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.953
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

528

<v 0>Finds qualified candidates for you.
Uh,</v>

529
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.920
for some reason they capitalize for fines,

530
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:16.780
candidate call it finds qualified candidates for you.
Uh,

531
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:17.561
it's powerful.

532
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:22.561
Matching technology scans thousands of resumes to identify people with the right

533
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.051

534
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:27.940
education and experience and actively invites them to apply to your job.

535
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.170
So you get quality candidates fast.
Yeah,

536
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:35.500
it's like Tinder for employees.
Uh,

537
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:39.880
that's why Ziprecruiter is rated number one by employers in the u s this rating

Simply safe.
So here's a timely stat for you.</v>

549
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.850
Almost half of us make a new year's resolution.

550
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:26.590
Every single gear we've all made them and most of us are probably broken him.

551
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.400
Um,
I kind of have,
but my whole,

552
00:32:30.401 --> 00:32:34.630
I'm not arguing with my wife has been working great.
Oh Man,

553
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:37.500
I got to have her on the fucking podcast and talk.

554
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.640
Maybe this Thursday we're going to talk about me buying a,

555
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:46.290
I was looking for a birthday candle for my daughter's cake.

556
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.223
<v 3>All right.</v>

557
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.650
<v 0>I'm just going to,
I'm going to tease the story and I went there.</v>

558
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

559
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.080
<v 0>You know,
I just wanted the number two,
I'm making a chocolate cake.</v>

560
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.930
I'm thinking something silver,
you know,
something like,
you know,

561
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:02.480
looking like that.
Right.
And I show up in all the,

562
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.950
all the numbers were all like this tie dye,
rainbow color.

563
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.323
<v 3>Okay.</v>

564
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.700
<v 0>And I had a paranoid meltdown and refuse to buy one and I bought the silver</v>

565
00:33:12.701 --> 00:33:15.460
candles anyways,
and I'll,
I'll have Nia,
c'mon,

566
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.390
and grill me as to why I did that.
Um,

567
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:25.650
<v 3>okay.</v>

568
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.010
<v 0>Oh,
it's just trying to have an agenda.
Free birthday cake for two year old.</v>

569
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.340
That's all I wanted.
All right.
Happens to,
happens to the best of us.

570
00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:33.690
Where am I have to the best of us,

571
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.770
but one resolution worth sticking to this year,

572
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.990
keeping your home and family safe.

573
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.760
That's why I recommend simply safe home security.
Simply safe is 24,

574
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:47.790
seven home security with no contracts or catches.

575
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.060
They believe the safest place on earth should be your own home.

576
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.800
So you feel protected every time you shut your door and leave for work or shut

577
00:33:55.801 --> 00:33:58.230
your eyes.
Uh,
at night.

578

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

589
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.660
<v 0>Um,
alright.
Plowing.

590
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.420
Oh,
Billy,
booze face.
Oh,

591
00:34:43.421 --> 00:34:45.790
Billy boost face also has not been drinking.

592
00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:50.020
Maybe that's why I'm being such a fucking cunt about the new NFL,

593
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.680
you know,
ruin it.
Ruining it for younger people.

594
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.460
This isn't at football.
I thought what I was watching was football.

595
00:34:57.461 --> 00:35:01.480
Your old bald con.
Um,
I'm going to get a lot of shit.
I don't give a fuck though.

596
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.413
Um,

597
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.540
<v 3>yeah,</v>

598
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.680
<v 0>some fucking assholes send me some.
Are you not entertained?
It's like,
no,
I'm not.</v>

599
00:35:07.681 --> 00:35:11.400
I like fucking,
I like all aspects of football,
not just scoring,

600
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.520
um,
fat girlfriend.

601
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.240
<v 3>Okay.</v>

602
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.390
<v 0>I actually think that they're doing it for fantasy football numbers.</v>

603
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.410
I think that that's another reason why they're doing CTE mixed with fantasy

604
00:35:23.411 --> 00:35:26.440
fucking football and all of that shit.
You know,

605
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:30.340
so people can keep up with this stupid goddamn like,
I hate that guy,

606
00:35:30.341 --> 00:35:34.030
but he's on my fantasy team.
All right.
You know what?
I'm right.

607
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.950
I'm not backing down from what the fuck I said.

608
00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:38.790
What the fuck you're watching is not God the m football.
It's,
it's,

609
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:41.920
it's the God damn fucking ice.
Capades all right there.

610
00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:44.950
I said it and all you douchebags who play fantasy fucking football.

611
00:35:44.951 --> 00:35:49.630
You can go and go fuck yourselves to there.
I took,
I took a stand.
I'm trying,

612
00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:52.090
I'm tired of trying to be fucking like diplomatic on this,

613
00:35:52.091 --> 00:35:54.580
but I understand the game change.
I understand these concussions.

614
00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.690
Go Fuck Yourself.

615
00:35:55.691 --> 00:35:59.560
A rookie should not be thrown for 50 fucking touchdowns playing NFL football.

616
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.860
All right?
You don't believe me?
Go Ass.
Fucking ray Lewis.

617
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:07.810
What he thinks about that.
Alright.
Fat Girlfriend.
Hey belt.
I'm a girl listener.

618
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.550
Writing in with advice for a guy with the fat girlfriend.
Yes.
Okay.

619
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.470
We had a,
we had a,
a a male listener.

620
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.820
All right.

621
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:19.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

622
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.040
<v 0>I don't know if he had a man bun.
I don't know if he had a flat top.</v>

623
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:25.830
I don't know how progressive he was.
I Dunno if he was an ally.

624
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.070
I don't know if he likes to new fucking rules in NFL football.

625
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.080
I don't know if he wants to see more scoring.

626
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.230
I don't know if he's an old fucking grizzled.
Can't like me.

627
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:37.640
I don't know what this guy is,
but he has a girlfriend that was a little fucking,

628
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.990
you know,
had some pounds on.
He's like,
all right,
you know,
whatever.

629
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:42.600
We'll get a relationship.
Maybe I'll get out of her out there on the treadmill.

630
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.830
But no,
she kept eating cupcakes and she's getting to the point that she's,

631
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.120
she's a fucking house,
so he still loves her and he wants to a PR.

632
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.590
How do you tell somebody okay,

633
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.360
<v 3>that there</v>

634
00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.420
<v 0>they're not attractive to you because they've eaten so much as a man,</v>

635
00:37:01.461 --> 00:37:03.590
as a woman.
I know you can fucking do that.

636
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.420
<v 3>Okay.</v>

637
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.250
<v 0>You can say that to a guy because nobody gives a fuck about a man or his goddamn</v>

638
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.970
failings despite how much these broads fucking bitch about how difficult their

639
00:37:13.971 --> 00:37:18.610
lives are.
Um,
you know,

640
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.990
and everybody's all brave.

641
00:37:19.991 --> 00:37:23.410
Now if they're a woman and they're fucking out of shape,
when reality is,

642
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.870
is you're killing yourself,
it's not good for you.

643
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.090
It's not healthy and you're not brave.

644
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.670
You're being a fucking moron who's in denial.

645
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.210
I'm not saying you should fucking hate yourself,
but to just pat,
hey,

646
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:38.710
I'm doing heroin.
Look at my abs.
Hey,
I'm eating donuts every fucking day.

647
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:43.890
I've almost closed three out of four of my fucking arteries or whatever you call

648
00:37:44.111 --> 00:37:46.390
them.
Is that what you call him?
And things that go on,
come out of your heart.

649
00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:49.150
The fucking the intake outtake hose from the radiator.

650
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.470
<v 3>Okay?</v>

651
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.020
<v 0>Yeah.
You're not brave.
You're,
you're fucking in denial.
All right?</v>

652
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:57.700
And when somebody calls tells you that you need to drop some weight there,

653
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.410
they helping you prolong your life.
All right?

654
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.130
You can't make someone care about their weight.
That's what this woman says.

655
00:38:04.131 --> 00:38:08.810
Cause I asked for a woman to come in.
She said,
I wish I had better news for him,

656
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.920
but if his girlfriend doesn't want to lose weight and it sounds like she
doesn't,

657
00:38:12.921 --> 00:38:15.110
then she won't.
If it's a deal breaker,

658
00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:19.340
he needs to break up with her and if it's not,
then he has to get over it.

659
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.090
Oh my God,
I,
I've,
I've,
you know something.

660
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.970
If you were here right now and I had your permission in writing in,

661
00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:30.560
in triple kit,
I would give you a hug.
All right?

662
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:32.300
One of those hugs we have fucking lean in.

663
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.760
So only the tops of your shoulders touch the tops them and you do like a fucking

664
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:40.960
even your side of your heads.
Don't touch a post me to hug.
I would give you,

665
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.740
okay.
That mindset right there,
that mindset right there is what makes you great.

666
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.080
That that right there is everything you need to be successful in life.

667
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.750
All right?
It fucking [inaudible] was just,

668
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.800
that was a,
that was perfect.
Let me read that again.

669
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.240
I wish I had better news for him,

670
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:07.690
but if his girlfriend doesn't want to lose weight and it sounds like she
doesn't,

671
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.620
she won't.
In other words,
you can't make somebody,

672
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.320
you know,
get their shit together.
They have to want to get their shit together.

673
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.480
Okay.
So now that we've solved that,
that,

674
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:24.190
that it's not on you to make somebody care about themselves.
All right?

675
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:28.870
Now you have to deal with the situation.
So this is what it is.
Okay.

676
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:33.400
And if you can handle it,
get over it.
If you can't break up with them.

677
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.520
But other than that,
shut the fuck up about it.
That's it.

678
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.060
And I actually think I actually feel for this guy because if he loves her,

679
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.660
he's key.
He's going to watch her take 10 15 years off her fucking life.
Um,

680
00:39:47.661 --> 00:39:50.380
and he hasn't even knocked her up yet because that's the other thing,

681
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:54.070
like with women,
you've got to give women a pass on at least 20 fucking pounds,

682
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.030
25 pounds.
You have to,
because they have kids,
you know,

683
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.020
they got kids and they've got to deal with the whole chemical fucking thing of

684
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:04.780
that.
They can have postpartum and all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

685
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.300
But as men,
you got no fucking excuse.

686
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.100
They got P90x out there,
they got that rogue fitness,

687
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:16.840
they got all of this shit out there.
There's no excuse.
As always,
fellas,

688
00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:21.250
we have no excuse.
As always,

689
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:25.250
you will be held responsible for your actions.
Um,

690
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.790
and that's amazing.
That was an amazing response because I couldn't come up.
I,

691
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:31.920
if you haven't been listening,

692
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.960
I tried to come up with a response for it and a proper angle and I could not

693
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:40.600
come up with one.
And uh,

694
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.990
even the lovely Nia came on and she listened to it and she took it personally.

695
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:50.320
Like I wrote the email to her,
but my wife is cool.

696
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:54.700
So when I called around her and she laughed,
um,
but it took this person here,

697
00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.990
this anonymous person,
look at that.
Not even leaving a name,

698
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.900
didn't want any sort of credit.
What's so fucking ever,

699
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:06.550
all right ladies response to guy with over way girlfriend.
Okay,

700
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:10.600
now this is going to be a tough one.
It's going to be a tough one to follow up.

701
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.000
Um,
ladies response to guy with overweight girlfriend.
Hey Bill.

702
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:21.220
When I was in my mid twenties,
I was dating my longterm boyfriend.

703
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.270
Uh,
I wasn't models skinny when we met,

704
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.680
but we were dining out a lot and I had put on some weight one night.

705
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:33.740
We had a really honest conversation that served as a wake up call for me.

706
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.610
He was a hundred percent honest and told me he wasn't attracted to me with the

707
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:41.930
extra weight.
Was it hard?
Harsh?
Yes.
Was it hurtful?

708
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.760
Yes.
However,

709
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:47.990
I took our conversation seriously for the first time in my life.

710
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:51.350
I actually thought about my own health and what I was putting into my,

711
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:56.030
into my body,
in my body.
Sorry.
I,
if,
if Nia ever said to me,

712
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.830
you've put on weight and I'm not attracted to you.
Like as she was saying it,

713
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.290
I would start putting on my gym clothes.

714
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:07.430
I'm not saying my bottom lip wouldn't be quivering and there wouldn't be tears

715
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:09.770
in my eyes,
but I would get my fucking fat,

716
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:14.330
pasty freckled ass to the nearest God damn elliptical.

717
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.570
Okay.
And I would deal with my feelings later.

718
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.970
I would immediately go right to the solution working out.
Um,

719
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.710
but what we live in a different time now where it's just what you sit there and

720
00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:32.920
you hold somebody's hand right to an early grave.

721
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.610
<v 3>Okay?</v>

722
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:39.050
<v 0>You know,
is the hole too deep that we dug that you're going to die in?</v>

723
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.000
Would you like some fucking Lope,

724
00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:45.230
some bubble wrap down in the bottom when you face plant from a major fucking

725
00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:50.210
heart attack?
Uh,
we started working out together and eating better together.

726
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:54.170
We both got in better shape when,
when look at dad,

727
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.490
because of his honesty,
I realized how important being healthy is.

728
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.610
Not,

729
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:04.610
not to mention it's not fair to the fucking person you're with male or female to

730
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.910
to let yourself go.

731
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.330
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

732
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:12.930
<v 0>okay.
I'm not going to be 100% horse because I know there's a bunch of emotional</v>

733
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:16.320
reasons that people start eating.
So get into therapy,

734
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.890
figure that out and get your ass to the gym and take control of your fucking

735
00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:27.210
life.
The problem with today's,
Oh my God,
I am the old man today.

736
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.280
Oh,
don't tell you what else the problem is.

737
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:33.560
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:33.700
<v 0>The,</v>

739
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.660
the fucking Photoshop has to be me sitting on my front porch.

740
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.203
Um,

741
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.290
the problem with all this fucking understanding is you're now,

742
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.200
we've gone from going,
hey tubby,

743
00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:54.201
why don't you lay off the cupcakes to like calling the person brave for eating

744
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:57.420
cupcakes.
And I think there has to be an adjustment.

745
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.070
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

746
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.500
<v 0>Somewhere in the middle of like,
even like that.
Me Too.
Shit.</v>

747
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.760
Like this whole fucking thing had to happen because no one was listening to

748
00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:07.890
these women's complaints,
right.

749
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.520
So then the fucking cork blows off the bottle and then it becomes due processes

750
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.950
out the window.
The burden of proof is now on the person accused.

751
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.840
They have to somehow clear their name,

752
00:44:21.841 --> 00:44:24.750
where the person who accuses them doesn't have to have any evidence.

753
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.330
They just need now you just need to adjust it back.

754
00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:30.840
Where now we're going to listen to women and there's going to be due process

755
00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:34.740
that the safest way to fucking do this shit,
right.
Adjusted back.

756
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.370
The same thing was fat people.
You can't just fucking guy your tablet shit.

757
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.080
They Lard Ass fucking uh,
you know,
go eat a salad.
You fucking fat cunt.

758
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.131
You can't do that.

759
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:48.150
But to go the entire other way and just say they're brave and they should be

760
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:51.450
proud of their body and start making fucking,
you know,

761
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.160
car covers into fucking sweatpants,

762
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.140
I don't think is another guy is a good way to date.

763
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.360
You're not helping them that way either.
Um,

764
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.130
<v 3>okay.</v>

765
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.440
<v 0>All right.
So this is great.</v>

766
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.470
So he had this painful fucking conversation and she turned this hurt and do a

767
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:12.930
positive and now I would think that they're in shape banging each other anyways

768
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:16.290
because of his honesty.
I realized how important it is to be healthy.

769
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:21.030
I started reading more about diet and FIS fitness,
listening to fitness podcast,

770
00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:24.000
cooking healthy meals,
and continued to work out.

771
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:28.890
Educating myself and taking the time to care for myself has an all capital

772
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:30.930
letters changed my life.

773
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:37.100
I ended up losing 50 pounds and keeping it off all because he had the courage to

774
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:42.150
tell me his truth.
Ugh.
Ah,
okay.

775
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.520
I loved everything until you use that expression.
He's living his,

776
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.960
I'm living my truth.
Um Oh.

777
00:45:49.961 --> 00:45:51.690
Because he said what the fuck was on his mind.

778
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

779
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.910
<v 0>Anyways,
any and she said,</v>

780
00:45:54.911 --> 00:45:59.380
and I wasn't too sensitive to be able to see my shortcomings and improve on
them.

781
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:02.391
You know,

782
00:46:02.391 --> 00:46:06.050
something I wish I could send this to anybody trying to get over a fucking

783
00:46:06.051 --> 00:46:09.560
problem that's been confronted.
You should have this fucking,
you know,

784
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.690
stitched into a pillow,
old fashioned needle point or something like this.

785
00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:15.890
This is what you gotta do.

786
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:17.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

787
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.290
<v 0>All right.
Because I'll,
I'll,
you know,</v>

788
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.090
the shit that I'm doing right now with my wife,

789
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.720
she fucking came at me basically straight up telling me what a difficult client

790
00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:27.780
I was to live with.

791
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.250
And anybody who listened to me bitching about NFL football after I just watched

792
00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:36.810
my team win a game to go to the Superbowl can only imagine what my wife has to

793
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:40.050
go through.
Um,
if I'm bitching about that.
Right.

794
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.180
Um,

795
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.180
so I decided that I was going to just turn it around other than being like,

796
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:51.900
oh,
she,
she'd be using it as well.
What about the stuff you do?

797
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:56.610
I knew she was right.
So,
I mean,
there's two ways.
When somebody comes at you,

798
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.710
you can be like,
fuck you.

799
00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:02.340
I'm brave and I'm just speaking my truth and eating my,

800
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.790
my dreams,
you know,

801
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.340
whatever the fuck it is you're doing.
Do you realize Americans,

802
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.110
how fucking dumb you sound to the rest of the world when you're saying you're

803
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:15.690
living your truth.
And I don't mean other first world countries,

804
00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:20.580
so go fuck yourself.
England,
Germany and all,
you can't to a laugh and right now,

805
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:24.420
I mean how dumb you sound to the rest of the fucking world that's actually

806
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:27.960
struggling that you're living your truth.
Well,
you know,

807
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.860
kids in fucking country have to sell your clothes together for an extra fucking

808
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:36.900
hour because you now feel brave for being a fat fuck.
I mean it's,
it's,

809
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.370
it's hilarious.
Um,
anyways,

810
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.440
she goes on to say I'm actually grateful to him because if he hadn't had the

811
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:48.130
courage to have had that conversation with me,
I'd probably still be eating junk.

812
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:51.820
Yeah.
He could have been a fucking diabetic,
lost a couple of toes.

813
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:57.330
I'm not exercising and continuing an unhealthy lifestyle that would cause issues

814
00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:01.780
for me as I age and some days,
yet you have kids and you're going to die sooner.

815
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:07.450
Um,
in my opinion and sometimes tough love is necessary.

816
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.760
If you have a strong relationship,

817
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:14.470
you should be able to be 100% open and honest with each other about everything,

818
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:18.580
including this love to Nia and the baby Jesus Christ.

819
00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

820
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.860
<v 0>Why don't more women right into this podcast?
Oh that's right.</v>

821
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:26.800
Cause I'm the house.
Um,

822
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.570
those are all fucking like both of those God damn emails.

823
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.160
What I love about them was they were both sides of the argument.

824
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:39.880
What the guy had to do and what the woman has to do in that thing.
You know,

825
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:41.380
and there are also interchangeable.

826
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.340
So if you're a man listening to this and you're actually in the position of the

827
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:49.060
woman where your,
your wife or girlfriend has come at you with some tough love.

828
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.780
Yeah,
don't be a fucking baby about it.
Ah,

829
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.740
now I'm on my fucking tree stump here.
You know,
I,

830
00:48:56.741 --> 00:48:59.590
I have been unlikable a lot of my fucking podcast.

831
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:03.490
I think this is probably the most unlikable.
A zip recruiter.

832
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.770
Wait,
I had done,
I already read all this shit.
Oh sorry.

833
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.020
I scrolled up too far.
All right.

834
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:15.250
10 year challenge and conspiracy stuff.

835
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

836
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:19.830
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
Uh,
oh,
this is some constraint.
You know,</v>

837
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:22.260
somebody told me a great joke about a conspiracy theorist

838
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.340
set of conspiracy theories dies and goes to heaven,

839
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:32.560
or at least he's having his interviewed to try to get into heaven and he meets

840
00:49:32.561 --> 00:49:37.300
God.
And God says,
all right,
congratulations sir,
you lived a great life.

841
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.750
You've made it into heaven and is one of your rewards.

842
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.000
I will answer,
you know,

843
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.010
whatever your top question is that you've ever had in life,
he goes off,

844
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.480
thank God.
Uh,
I want to,

845
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:54.250
I have to know who is it that killed John F.
Kennedy?

846
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.780
Who are the people that killed them?
And he said,
well,
I can answer that easily.

847
00:49:58.781 --> 00:50:03.280
He goes,
it was Leon Lee Harvey Oswald.
It was,
you know,

848
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.930
it was him and he acted alone and the conspiracy theorists goes out.
Jesus,

849
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.920
this goes higher than I thought.
I'm sure.

850
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.920
I'm sure I butchered it.
Anyways,
tenured challenge and conspiracy stuff.

851
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.460
Dare Bill Illuminati a balloon Menotti.
Oh,
Jesus.
I love that.

852
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.730
All right.
What are your thoughts on the 10 year?
Uh,

853
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.820
my thoughts are if you're an adult,
you shouldn't be doing that.

854
00:50:30.821 --> 00:50:34.240
That's just sounds like something a teenager would be doing.
Oh,

855
00:50:34.241 --> 00:50:36.610
I'm such an old grumpy cunt.

856
00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:43.520
Bad for children,
grow up,
get busy with Diane.
Uh,

857
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.400
the social media thing where people post a pic of themselves from 10 years ago

858
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:53.700
and today to show how much or little they've changed why or did an article about

859
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:59.110
the shady daily cold data collecting involved with it.
Also,

860
00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:02.830
I'm 23,
so when I started listening to you in 2011,

861
00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:06.640
I was younger and definitely intrigued by the conspiracy stuff,

862
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:11.910
but never had enough of a perspective on history and everything till now.

863
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.300
<v 3>Okay.</v>

864
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.880
<v 0>I let him,
I've read a lot more about that crazy shit.
History is fed.</v>

865
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.970
While I don't believe that the moon is actually an alien base,

866
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.540
I do believe that the official story is often bullshit.
Yeah.

867
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.980
That's called being enlightened.
But for a lot of people they'll still say,
oh,

868
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:35.450
what are you putting on your tinfoil hat?
Um,
yeah,

869
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.000
the official story is usual.

870
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:45.030
Usually 90% of the time is bullshit and all you have to do is just look at

871
00:51:46.151 --> 00:51:49.420
yourself as a human being.
Anytime you get in trouble,

872
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.530
anytime there's a controversy,
you know how much you're spending it.

873
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.720
You know,
I've always said,
you know when,
when was,

874
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.800
has a cop ever pulled up to a two car accident and one person says,

875
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:05.730
that fucking guy came out of nowhere and t boned me and then when he walked up

876
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:07.810
to the other guy,
the other guy,
the cop goes,
what happened?

877
00:52:07.811 --> 00:52:11.160
And the other guy goes,
man,
I came out of fucking nowhere and t bolt them.

878
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.090
It's always going to be like his version of it and they're both fucking in the

879
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:16.680
right anyways.
He said,

880
00:52:16.681 --> 00:52:20.940
I think the most frustrating thing is how little people care about declassified

881
00:52:20.941 --> 00:52:25.440
files.
That confirms that was once crazy talk.
Yeah.

882
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.920
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

883
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.190
<v 0>Because they view it as this weird way,
their perception,</v>

884
00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:34.510
they view it as this isn't how things have been handled historically and

885
00:52:34.511 --> 00:52:37.510
continue to be handled today.
They view it as well.

886
00:52:37.511 --> 00:52:40.600
All those people who said that shit,
we're dead or dead now.

887
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.880
That stuff happened before I was born.

888
00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:48.810
They for some reason cannot make the leap until up until the modern era.

889
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.260
Like,
uh,
my wife just sent me something where there was a family,

890
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:54.821
you know,

891
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:59.821
that was dealing in the business of Oxycontin and how they are being accused.

892
00:53:02.111 --> 00:53:06.160
There's all these emails of them suppressing information about how fucking

893
00:53:06.161 --> 00:53:10.450
addictive that stuff was in.
If that is true,
those people,
you know,

894
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.690
if they don't get the death penalty,
what they've done to people,

895
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:17.290
what they've done to families and I'm,
you know,

896
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.020
I know like three close personal friends of mine that are,

897
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.130
have dealt with it or a dealing with it and um,

898
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.780
I don't know.
And just all of this shit,
I mean,
come on,

899
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.770
I think and in boy kills me now is now cause corporations own media and all of

900
00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:38.850
this shit,
the same ones who are fucking us over who dictate our foreign policy.

901
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.610
If you criticize anything about that,
then they,

902
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:46.560
then they just go when they wipe out your fucking career.
Um,
but anyways,

903
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:49.080
as far as the 10 year challenge,
I mean,
yeah,

904
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:52.500
there are definitely data collecting data,
I would think.

905
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.350
And they're selling data and then it just gets too,

906
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:58.350
who are they selling it to and what are they going to use it for?

907
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.770
Like that 10 year challenge stuff.
If you give that to the police,

908
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.650
that could help them find a missing kid.

909
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.800
<v 3>Okay.</v>

910
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:09.340
<v 0>Um,
but then it's also for,
you know,
it's like anything,</v>

911
00:54:09.341 --> 00:54:11.200
if it falls into the wrong fucking hands,

912
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:15.940
like there's nothing wrong with an ar 15 until a fucking Luna Luna tick gets
one.

913
00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:21.010
There's nothing wrong with guns until some fucking moron gets one.

914
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.920
Um,
so then that becomes the thing that people then debate.

915
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.680
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

916
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.530
<v 0>Because there's morons out there should nobody have,
um,</v>

917
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.560
is there a way to control who gets them?
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

918
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:37.830
all of that shit.
So,
um,
I dunno.
Well,

919
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:42.390
welcome to the frustrating world of being,
at least I'm enlightened.

920
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.410
I'm not saying enlightened,

921
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:45.780
like you're 100% right on everything that you're thinking about,

922
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:49.860
but to sit there and say that the official story is often bullshit.
Yeah,

923
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:51.600
it is often bullshit,
right?

924
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:56.601
From why a team got rid of a player to a why we're fighting a war.

925
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.330
All of it is going to be spun.
Um,

926
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.830
I'll tell you what's hilarious.
When I was overseas,
I kept doing this thing,

927
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:11.700
say in like a,
in the middle of my act,
I would just be like,
you know what?

928
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.770
Now I'm going to take time out of my Yak to talk about the greatest country in

929
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:20.070
the world,
the United States of America.
Okay.

930
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.130
And everyone would start laughing and then all,
I wouldn't even do jokes.

931
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:27.270
I would just start spewing out our propaganda,
beacons of freedom,

932
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.720
defending the rights of Blahblahblah and everybody bursting out laughing like I

933
00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:37.020
was doing stand up comedy and all I was doing was just saying

934
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:43.230
what my government says to me,
what we're doing.
All right.

935
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.300
I did that in every city,
all seven countries,
and they all laughed.
Okay,
now,

936
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.190
yeah,
you're going to fucking tell me that.

937
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

938
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.580
<v 0>That by doing that as a test because I knew that they were going to laugh,</v>

939
00:55:56.581 --> 00:56:01.200
but I just wanted to see like how hard they were going to laugh.
Um,

940
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.820
how could I just sit there and be like,
well,
what,

941
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.250
what I'm being told is 100% fucking truth.

942
00:56:07.251 --> 00:56:11.610
There has to be in at least another side to this fucking story.
Right.
I Dunno.

943
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:16.470
Anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Um,
I,
I would personally,

944
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:17.304
I wouldn't do that.

945
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:22.310
I wouldn't send my DNA into the Internet to find out what percentage German,

946
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:26.700
Irish,
French,
whatever the fuck I am.
Um,

947
00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.560
I do think the,
you know,
it's fascinating

948
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.260
<v 3>okay</v>

949
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.580
<v 0>to figure that out,
but I just don't trust people that have,
you know,</v>

950
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.990
I mean one of the biggest lie,
the brand new,
the new checks in the mail,

951
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.370
they used to be the old lie.

952
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.320
The modern version of that lie is this is a secure site.

953
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:52.360
None of them are secure and you should be guarding everything that you can.

954
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:55.990
But at this point,
even with myself,
I just think,
you know,
it's too late.

955
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:58.630
Like so much shit is out there.
But just because that's too late,

956
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:02.620
it doesn't mean you can't educate your kids to not do that.
And,
um,

957
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.190
I dunno,
I,
I am amazed with,
you know,
all of blood,

958
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.860
the stalkers that are out there,
especially with women,

959
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.810
that the fact that you can go on the Internet and essentially find anybody and

960
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:21.490
figure out,
you know,
where they are.
Um,
and also that,
you know,

961
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.950
if you're not paying attention,

962
00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:28.120
like you'll send out a fucking something to one of these social media sites in a

963
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:31.510
little leaves,
we'll say your location,
where you're at in that moment.

964
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.360
Um,
I,
I don't know,
like how,

965
00:57:35.361 --> 00:57:39.490
how can that end up being a good fucking thing?
All right.

966
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:43.510
Money free time and seclusion.
Jesus Christ.

967
00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:48.010
I think you're describing my dreams,
my goals,
my life goals,

968
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:53.170
living my truth,
having money,
free time and seclusion is great.

969
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.980
Hey,
a dear Billy lifestyle.
I'm 37 years,

970
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.510
years old and just started making really good money.

971
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.660
I used to work a shit job for a government contractor.

972
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.320
I spent 12 years working nine to five and two Saturdays a month.

973
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.130
Now I work 15 to 20 hours a week and make three times as much.
Hey,

974
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:11.500
welcome to the world at dealing drugs.
Uh,

975
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:16.030
the differences with that,
with all this free time,

976
00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:18.040
I don't feel like being social anymore.

977
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:22.450
I don't have the same amount of steam to blow off in my free time is almost more

978
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:26.770
valuable because I know what to do with it.
I'm drinking less and feel great.

979
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:30.430
My friends think I'm being lame,
but fuck them.

980
00:58:30.431 --> 00:58:32.230
Do you see any problem with any of this?

981
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.580
Am I leading myself down a path to die alone?
If I do die alone,

982
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.070
it'll certainly be peaceful.
All right,
well I'm,

983
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:42.070
I'm not saying die alone,

984
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.890
but I also did you just becoming an adult?
You know what I mean?

985
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.520
You're becoming like,
uh,

986
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:52.840
<v 3>okay.</v>

987
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.260
<v 0>Yeah.
You don't need to go out and go out and listen to it.</v>

988
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.180
Go out to some fucking bar.
Well,

989
00:58:58.181 --> 00:59:02.350
you have to scream over the god damn music just sitting there getting hammered

990
00:59:02.351 --> 00:59:07.210
or wet or whatever.
Blowing money.
Um,
I think,
uh,

991
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:10.123
<v 3>okay.</v>

992
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.420
<v 0>I don't know.
How can I put this here?</v>

993
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:13.080
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

994
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:17.170
<v 0>All right.
I don't think you're being lame because you want to,</v>

995
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:21.400
uh,
because you know,
you don't go out.
That's just,

996
00:59:21.401 --> 00:59:26.230
that's just becoming an adult.
You're,
you're a fucking adult.
That's all it is.

997
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.240
All right.
And,
and by you growing up,
your freaking them out because it's like,

998
00:59:31.241 --> 00:59:34.870
wait a minute,
this is the party over and I'm still at it.
Am I that guy?

999
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.340
Um,
but I,
I would stop short of dying alone.

1000
00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:42.970
You need,

1001
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:47.440
what I would do is with your free time rather than go out to bars,

1002
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.670
go out and do some sort of activity.

1003
00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.210
Like I dunno what the softball league or some shit,
I'm old.

1004
00:59:55.211 --> 00:59:59.260
I don't know what they,
I mean I'm so old.
Go rollerblading.

1005
01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.870
Join a roller blade team.
I'm from the 90s.
I don't fucking know.

1006
01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.470
Go play walleyball I think that sports is finally going to take off,

1007
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.250
which was volleyball combined with,
um,

1008
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:17.380
I would do something positive like that short of joining a church group and I

1009
01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:18.041
would do that.

1010
01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:20.830
And then maybe you'll meet a great woman there who also doesn't need to go out

1011
01:00:20.831 --> 01:00:24.400
and fucking do Yeager's shots.
Well into your thirties.
Congratulations.

1012
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.020
You finding out what makes you happy.

1013
01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.000
<v 2>Uh,
you're working smarter,
you're working smarter.
Speaking of working smarter,
we,</v>

1014
01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:34.570
I have a big announcement that's coming out tomorrow on Tuesday.

1015
01:00:34.571 --> 01:00:38.020
I'm not allowed to say it,
but its announcement about a certain project.

1016
01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:42.790
Um,
so check in on my social media sites.
If you have the time,

1017
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:43.961
if you don't,

1018
01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:46.990
I understand and I'll just bring it up on Thursday and I'll tell you anyways.

1019
01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:50.620
All right.
Thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend.
Oh,

1020
01:00:50.621 --> 01:00:52.090
Gj age.

1021
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:53.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1022
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.090
<v 2>Hey Billy.
Big Time.
Uh,
as the title suggests,</v>

1023
01:00:57.091 --> 01:00:58.950
I'm thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend.

1024
01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:03.030
We've been going out for three ish years,

1025
01:01:03.031 --> 01:01:07.020
minus a break in the middle.
I broke up with the last summer,
but like a moron,

1026
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:12.021
I got back together with her a month later after failed prospects.

1027
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.240
Oh boy.
That is not a reason to get back together with her.

1028
01:01:15.241 --> 01:01:19.170
And you're already saying like a moron.
Yeah.
You,
yeah.
Okay.

1029
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:23.580
She's what I would call wife material responsible.
Good looking can cook,
caring.

1030
01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:27.810
You know,
my only problem is we don't have sex.
Don't get me wrong.

1031
01:01:27.811 --> 01:01:31.680
We get physical,
but it usually ends in either a,

1032
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.030
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1033
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.050
<v 0>a hi or nothing.
H I,</v>

1034
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.010
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1035
01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:43.840
<v 2>parentheses.
Same thing for her because it's all she lets me do,</v>

1036
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.470
I can't read that word that's written on my,
I need glasses here.

1037
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.530
<v 0>I don't know.
I was at some new young slang,
a high h I don't get me wrong.</v>

1038
01:01:57.531 --> 01:01:59.050
We get physical.
I can feel all that.

1039
01:01:59.051 --> 01:02:02.210
You guys laughing at me that I don't know what this means.
We get physical,

1040
01:02:02.211 --> 01:02:07.010
but I use,
but it usually ends in either a high or nothing.
She just says hello.

1041
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.310
Same thing for her because it's all she lets me do.

1042
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:15.490
She's Catholic enough for it to be annoying and falls back on it.

1043
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:19.040
When we talk about controversial shit,

1044
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:23.510
I try to have a productive conversation.
She sandbags with excuses.
Dude,

1045
01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:27.350
I don't know what you're talking about here.
Is She a virgin?
Anyways?

1046
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:30.290
I don't have a problem that she's Catholic.
It's just gets irritating.

1047
01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:33.530
When she pulls out their religious propaganda.
I'm not religious,

1048
01:02:33.531 --> 01:02:37.310
but I'm also not a Douche bag atheists.
I just don't give a shit.

1049
01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.980
I need help here,
Bill,
you need help.
Explain.

1050
01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:43.010
What is the fuck I don't get what's going on.
You're saying,
oh,

1051
01:02:43.011 --> 01:02:44.510
you don't have sex at all.

1052
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:49.970
I thought you meant by we don't have sex as we barely have sex anymore.

1053
01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.100
So you're saying we don't have sex at all.
She's,

1054
01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.000
she's cat because she's Catholic.
Uh,
I,
okay.
Um,

1055
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.330
I need help here,
Bill.
It was fun while it lasted,

1056
01:02:59.331 --> 01:03:01.970
but I feel like I'm wasting my time now.
To me,

1057
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.290
sex is a whole other side of her relationship to her.
It isn't.
That's fine.

1058
01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:09.530
We're different in this fact.
If I break up with her,

1059
01:03:09.531 --> 01:03:13.310
I'm not going back not doing that.
That shit again.
By the way,

1060
01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:18.200
we're both 21 and I haven't had sex yet.
Not By choice and neither is she.

1061
01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:21.980
Oh,
all right.
A ps.
I know it's late,

1062
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:27.010
but I fucking love your show at the Altria killed his usual.

1063
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.820
I drug my family along.
I think it would say I drug my family.

1064
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.940
I drug my family along.
Forgot where the theater was,

1065
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:41.630
even though I occasionally work security for the acts there,
Miss Dinner,

1066
01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:43.730
and almost missed the show according to them.

1067
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:47.870
A 15 minutes early is fucking perfect for me.
Uh,

1068
01:03:47.871 --> 01:03:49.610
they forgot all about it after the show.

1069
01:03:49.611 --> 01:03:53.420
If you want more details about my problem,
let me know.
All right.
See you both 21.

1070
01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.820
Um,
all right,
dude,

1071
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.550
I'm just going to go back to what that woman's advice was.
All right.

1072
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.230
You can't change people.
I would want to pressure somebody into doing something,

1073
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.020
especially sexually,
that they didn't want to fucking do.

1074
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.780
So either you accept that this is what she wants to do.
Are you fucking walk?

1075
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.510
I mean,
that's it.
Um,
you said the big thing that sticks with me,

1076
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.310
she said I broke up with their last summer,
but like a moron,

1077
01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:25.030
I got back together with her a month later after failed prospects.

1078
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.200
So it seems to me you think it was dumb to get back with her and that a month

1079
01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.730
later because you know,
you weren't banging somebody.

1080
01:04:36.731 --> 01:04:39.370
You got scared that you're going to be all alone.
Uh,

1081
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.900
I think you both want to different things.

1082
01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.840
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1083
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.800
<v 0>All right.
And,
uh,</v>

1084
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.440
this is a major thing and if that's how she wants to live her life,

1085
01:04:50.441 --> 01:04:53.470
you have to respect it.
And if you want to go out and go bang somebody,

1086
01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:54.680
you should go out and go bang them.

1087
01:04:54.681 --> 01:04:59.200
So I would say go out and do what's gonna make you happy.
Um,

1088
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:01.750
and that's it.
And when you break up with their,

1089
01:05:01.751 --> 01:05:03.250
don't fucking get back together with her.

1090
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:06.640
Unless you're going to be able to deal with the fact that she's never going to

1091
01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:11.120
bang you until you are just merrier.
But a ring on it,
man,

1092
01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.520
put a ring
and then fucker put a ring on it.

1093
01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:19.740
Don't have any shit fucker.
Then divorced her.
That's the worst comment ever.

1094
01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:23.970
Don't do that.
All right.
That's it.
That's brand new.
Hybrid.

1095
01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.340
The crabby old man on this podcast.

1096
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1097
01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:32.600
<v 0>I remember football and it was fun.
Um,</v>

1098
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:37.280
that's it.
I stand by my fire.
Would love to hear you guys fucking opinions.

1099
01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:40.370
You guys can call me a fucking old man or whatever.

1100
01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:43.280
I would love to have your opinions on is anybody else old like me?

1101
01:05:43.281 --> 01:05:45.440
And you just remembered like a,
you know,

1102
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.370
defense was fucking allowed.
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Uh,
anyways,

1103
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.033
<v 3>that's it.</v>

1104
01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.090
<v 0>That's a podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Hey,</v>

1105
01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:00.750
look for my announcement tomorrow.
Bye.
