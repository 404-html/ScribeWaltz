don't you hate when wine looks like a 10 but it winds up looking like a tasting,

33
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.360
like a six or even worse when you walk into the store to pick out your wine,

34
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.810
you could easily be fooled into a situation like this.

35

Well now there's this new wine club club,

All right.

59
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.260
Hey,

It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast that just checking in on you.

61
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.960
Just checking in on your week here.
As mentioned,
um,

62
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.620
I was going to have a special guest,
uh,

63
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.270
one of my favorite comedians of all time and I still think brutally,

64
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490
brutally fucking underrated.
Uh,
Mr Peek,
Cory,
Ellie.
Um,

65
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.130
I've known him since,
so I moved to New York.
He's got a new special,

66
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.690
let me get all this shit out of the way.

67
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.710
He's got a new special or that streaming on showtime kids.

68
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.890
God knows you guys like the streaming stuff.
Alright.
And it's called,

69
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.620
let me tell Ya.
Just came out to rave reviews.

70
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.860
One of my favorite comics and people of all time,
Mr p Corey alley,
Billy Billy.

71
00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:18.400
I don't even,
I don't even know how to take that intro.
Dude.

72
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.800
I want to hug you across the table.
I got to put that in a bind.

73
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.870
I had like a studio audience.
Fucking brutally,
brutally underrated.

74
00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:30.140
It's as if it is.
My wife is saying the words in the kitchen.

75
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.920
What did she say that,
oh dude,
I swear.
I mean come on.

76
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:37.910
Two weeks before I did the special,
before he came out,
I was on,
I was on a boat.

77
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.820
I was on a cruise.
Who's on a cruise?

78
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:45.050
Why two weeks before this special comes out?
Why?
Well,
no,
you already know.

79
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:48.410
You already,
you already taped it.
You weren't already taped.
Yeah.
Yeah.

80
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.830
You got balls,
man.
I'd be free.
I was too.

81
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:54.290
I thought you were saying two weeks before you tape the fucking thing.

82
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.350
You were on a cruise.
Like I got this.
No,
no,
no.

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.200
I'm drinking a bud light.
Can you imagine?
No,
I mean I'm no forming on a cruise.

84
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.110
I mean,
at some point I would do a joke and I literally just say,

85
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.740
and they sit at the bar and put bread on my gr and say,
man,
what are you?

86
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.730
And they don't get it.
They don't even get it right.
Anyway.
I appreciate it.
Yeah,

87
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.530
Dude.
What,
uh,
let me ask you this too.
When you go to do a special,

88
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:21.460
like when do you feel like your hours ready?
Do you ever,
I don't know man.

89
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:25.150
I don't know.
It's just crazy.
The fight.
It's the first one I did.

90
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.440
I felt a little more like it was ready.
Like it was,
it was like,
you know,

91
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:30.830
because I never did the first one just,

92
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.100
you're always ready because you've been doing it for fucking ever wait for

93
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.070
somebody to give you a shot.
And I never did a half hour of any kind.

94
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.840
So it was really,
I had the whole gamut.

95
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:39.970
Everything I ever written up until that point was what?

96
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.060
A half hour for comedy central?
No,
no,
at the time.

97
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.560
Well the time,
by the time he came point,
my manager goes,

98
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.580
I think we can get you a half hour.
I go,
I think I can,
I got an hour.
Yeah.

99
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.240
So I laid it down at a club and sent it to them and they right away gave me the

100
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.440
hour and I felt really great after that.

101
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:02.060
And then the second one was a bit more of a grind,
like really grinding it out.

102
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.660
Um,
again,
you're one of the guys,
like,
I watch how you're doing it and like,

103
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.910
you know,
and uh,
and Louie too.
And I'm like,
how,

104
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.030
what did these guys sleeping at night and elves and writing this shit and

105
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.800
putting in about a foot of their bed can't keep up.
So,
but by the end,

106
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:19.250
you know,
I,
I really felt it was there,
but I gotta tell you,
man,

107
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.070
if I had to wait like six more months to tape that special,

108
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.950
I probably would have forgotten what was funny about some of those jokes.

109
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.470
That's what thinks so.
But I always have to.

110
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.270
You get it right to the point where you're like,
dude,

111
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.250
I'm so fucking sick of doing this.
And then it's like,
okay,

112
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.060
I've got to burn this thing.
Yeah.
And then uh,
move on.
So I tried to do,

113
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.510
I'm like just about every other year or so.

114
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.370
So this year coming up is the year where maybe towards the end of the year I'm

115
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.861
going to do it.

116
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.070
I was just talking to my guy about it and you know he's going to do,

117
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.530
you're ready,
you're ready.
I'm like Nah,
I don't think I,

118
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.770
I gotta make sure there's a few things I want to push a little bit further cause

119
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.140
cause you're competing against your last one.

120
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.930
So it has to be at least that level,

121
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.860
which you never want it to be because then it's more of the same from bill burr.

122
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:05.210
Right.
Which is,
which is worse than somebody saying you suck.
You know,

123
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.240
and everybody in the Internet's such cons pumped.

124
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.650
He's going to fucking know what I mean,
you're working at a top level.

125
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:12.520
It's like if you bet in three 40 every years,
three 40 year,

126
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.470
if the year really that bad,
but I got to say the last special,

127
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.480
all you stuff is just unreal.

128
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.070
But when you did the bit where you're playing catch with the dude,

129
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.280
are you kidding me?
I mean that's like I could see a kid watching,
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:28.270
That's,
that's like on the level of the greatest of greats.
So it was like,

131
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.290
all right,
I'm sorry I'm sitting there and watching that.

132
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.630
But the difference between where you're at too though is you are the only one

133
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:38.300
that decides.
Right?
Like for me,
when I,
I knew I wanted to do it with showtime,

134
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.090
I didn't want to go back to these places where the air at once and it's done.

135
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.800
Yeah.
He can't do that now.
Right.

136
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.220
So I got to the point where I sent it to them and they go,
we're not saying no,

137
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.790
but we're not saying yes,
but they were nice enough to work with me.
Right.

138
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.540
So I tweaked some stuff cause I had some stuff that was just current events and

139
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.190
I'm not a current event guy.
So I,
I,
I worked on another six months,

140
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:01.250
sent it back in and then the guy he's at showtime said,
all right,
come to la,

141
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:05.690
we want to see it once live and we'll make our dishes and decision basically at

142
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:06.740
the end of the night.

143
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.190
So I'm like 10 minutes and people that they're just given away half hours to the

144
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.170
fact that you got to jump through all these extra hoops.

145
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.360
They fly you off course now?
No ma'am.
Not that I stayed at the safari in Burbank

146
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.660
and you know,
I got 10 minutes left to the sets.
Go agree.
You know,

147
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.660
I mean it's the Ice House two week pass too,
you know,

148
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:30.320
but you like 10 minutes left,
you're like,
nobody dropped a glass.
Come on man.

149
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.860
And it went great.
I know what great.
And finally I got it and I really,
you know,

150
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:35.630
and,
and looking back on it,
I'm like,
man,

151
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.470
I'm glad these guys made me wait six months because it's better than it was six

152
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.900
months ago.
Definitely.
And if I could decide when I can do my own specialist,

153
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.760
my next one will be coming out next Wednesday.
Oh really?
Well not really,
but you,

154
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.440
you know,
you,

155
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.530
you sometimes you think something's great and then like a year lady like I can't

156
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.040
believe.
I thought that was great.
Now it's great.
Right?
See that's,

157
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.130
that's my paranoia is like you want to do in that perfect thing where you're

158
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.810
sick of the fucking thing and you can't squeeze anything.

159
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.330
We can't bring anything up a little bit better.

160
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.670
You taped it right at the perfect time.

161
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.080
But what's fucked up dude is we would just,

162
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.300
when you came in here for the people listening here,
uh,
is,
I don't know,

163
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.860
it's just you get to a certain age and just years,

164
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.450
even though you counting with birthdays,
they,

165
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.360
everything just feels like it was five years ago and you were talking about,

166
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:20.700
we played this,
this touch football game,

167
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:24.760
all these comics in a central park and we used,

168
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.200
that was like 20 years ago.
I was like,
oh man.

169
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.070
I thought it was like early two thousands and I was thinking,

170
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.440
I was with Bobby Kelly and we were trying to figure out what we,
so,
so it was,

171
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.360
we were so sore the next day.
I was like,
yeah dude,
come on man with 30.
He goes,

172
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:38.580
dude,
don't fucking say that.
And I'm not 30 cause he was like,

173
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.500
the efficacy is like two,
three years younger than me,

174
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.480
but I was 29 Gunna to be 30.

175
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:46.470
So that means that it was sometime in 1997 it's almost 2016.
Yeah,

176
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:51.210
it was fucking 20 years ago.
And I remember fucking Bobby getting so far,

177
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:55.380
I've told this story of the old at the show,
Bobby got so fucking mad,

178
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.770
um,
during that game,
uh,
I was blocking them or something and like he just,
I,

179
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.860
I saw it as like his nostrils were flaring.
He got all competitive,
right?
Yeah,

180
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.870
yeah.
And he was,
he was going to come in,

181
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:10.170
I think I had a couple of couches and he didn't have any yet.
He's so funny.

182
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.590
So he gets all competitive so it's fucking nostrils of flared and he comes

183
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:16.860
flying at me.
Right.
And like he just took the wrong step.

184
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.430
I just sort of pushed him down to the ground and it was just sort of effortless

185
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.760
cause he kind fucked her.
I remember that he started falling first,

186
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:25.650
so I just sort of guided him to the ground.

187
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.270
It was like when Don Zimmer ran it fucking Pedro,
he just thought it guy,

188
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.040
he got so mad,
he fucking grabbed two handfuls of grass,

189
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.620
ripped them out of the ground and then just both hands fucking throw them at

190
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:42.570
them at me as hard as he could.
And I was like four feet away from,

191
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.100
so for like two feet,

192
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.270
the grass goes like 90 million miles an hour and then it was grass and they're

193
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:53.271
like a foot later just when like [inaudible] between the two of us.

194
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.710
And I was looking at him like,
what the fuck?
I remember that one of the,

195
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.731
one of those kids,
you know,

196
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.430
we didn't know everybody was some Puerto Rican kid there and he just looks at

197
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:00.540
Bobby.
He goes,
Yo,

198
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:05.210
he buggy and I just started laughing.
It was one of them.

199
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.270
That is one of the maddest I ever saw him.
But uh,
through,

200
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.420
we used to fucking play rollerblade hockey.
This is all 90 shit.

201
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.610
And I remember we used to like every six games,

202
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:17.610
me and him would almost get into a fist fight.
We never quite got to that level.

203
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:20.600
But uh,
but through that was way back in the day we used to work,
uh,

204
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.240
the men of the Boston Comedy Club.
Giana man,
when are you kidding me?
Of course.

205
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.580
I mean that was lazy.
I don't think,
I don't,

206
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.320
I always wondered if it was because we were new to doing stand up.
Yeah,
yeah.

207
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.960
That and we didn't know what we were doing that that room was so like,

208
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:36.830
just like just the death that you could die in,

209
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.910
in that fucking building or if it really was as difficult.
I mean,

210
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.900
it's fucking insane.
When I first came down like 94,

211
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.900
it's like people selling drugs right outside the front of it.
You walked in,

212
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.630
it was an absolute shit hole.
Barry Katz owned it,

213
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.600
put like fucking 3 cents into the thing.
Had that old fucked up.

214
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:53.350
I'll look at violet places.
Yeah,
of course.

215
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:57.160
Behind you on stage in like the piece of wood could come out and I just

216
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.350
remembered when you went in there,
it was like a,

217
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.950
I don't know if it was any other room,
I would have been like,
you know what?

218
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.290
Fuck this.
After I took a pound and be like,
fuck this place.

219
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.210
This place is fucked up.
But,

220
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.180
but there was something about it because of the comics that were working their

221
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:11.050
eyes,
it will work and they were insane.
Yeah.

222
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.620
You wanted to be able to have a good set in there.
You will.
Oh God.

223
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.530
When you first broke in there,
you will like nervous and then,

224
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:21.190
and then like maybe a year or so when you find yourself putting your elbow on

225
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:24.400
the mantle,
that's when you know you're comfortable there.
Dude,
I got to,

226
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.450
one of the most embarrassing things in my life on stage happened at that club.

227
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.550
It was so,
it was one of those urban knights.
Okay.

228
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.760
Do one of the 12 embarrassing things in my life happened and I fucking club now.

229
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.330
I was,
I was only about,
I don't know,
maybe a year into comedy.
Right.

230
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.400
And it just started becoming a little friendly with brewer.

231
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.850
So now I go down there one night and I would just hang out and try to get on

232
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.210
that sort of thing.
And brewer in Chappelle meetup and a,

233
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.730
they're going to go around the corner.
This is again,
years and years ago,

234
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.550
and they're going to smoke a joint and they invite me to go,
oh,

235
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:54.730
this is like 92 three,
four like 94 or five.
Okay.
Yeah.

236
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.490
So we go around the bend.
So just to put it perspective,

237
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:02.491
men in tights for no nutty professor he was making and brewers on Saturday night

238
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.090
was,
okay,
cool.
All right.

239
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:06.820
Because we go around the band and I'm like just being quiet.

240
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:08.650
So excited to be hanging here.
Right.

241
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.030
And was smoking a joint and a Chappelle's tell him the famous story about his

242
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:16.290
end from Eddie Murphy being mad at David Spade for that.

243
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.250
You remember that famous story where spates look a falling star and it's a

244
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.160
picture of Eddie Murphy catch a falling star yet just recently wrote a blog

245
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:27.340
about it.
It's like famous,
everybody knows that story's still going on.

246
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.890
I think he finally saw Eddie and Eddie said,
hey,
what's up?

247
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:33.520
So I think it's finally like fucking 20 years later,
it's finally over.
Yeah.

248
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.820
And in that point it was wild because I'm sitting there getting Chappelle's end

249
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:40.690
of it,
cause he's doing nutty professor would Eddie Murphy when that happened.

250
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.170
Right.
And then brewers on with spade on Saturday night live.

251
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:47.050
So they tell on each on this version of the phone call and stuff.
And I'm like,

252
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:51.280
wow.
So then we go back to the club and again,
packed urban night.

253
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:52.990
As we said it was a little cold.

254
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.440
So I'd gotten there early and I put my coat down though.
So this is Sunday night.

255
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:59.200
The all black show,
people don't know what urban night.
Yeah.
Yeah.

256
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:00.460
And then urban outfitter night.

257
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.470
And this is important to know because I put my coat down and they both high and

258
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:09.700
Jason,
who runs a club at the time goes,
who wants to go first?
Jim,
you debut?

259
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.720
And they go,
no,
no,
let me relax.
And they go put PD on per PT on,
you know,

260
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.270
I'm freaking high.
I'm not even good at comedy really.

261
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.990
So they put me on first diet,
right?
I'm bombing,

262
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:23.850
I'm three minutes in brewer and Chappelle,
Dian Laugh.
And uh,

263
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.560
I do about five minutes to deploy.

264
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.770
We didn't know what black people go and he's Connie [inaudible],
Connie,
brutal.

265
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.520
I get off and now all I want to do is go home.
Right?

266
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.310
I can't find my fucking coat.
I have no idea what my code is,

267
00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:39.970
my keys to my apartment or in my coat.
It's totally dark.
I'm doing that.

268
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:43.540
When you're walking around and you swear it's under somebody's seat and you're

269
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:46.850
like,
can I just,
can I just be,
I just saw you bomb.
Yeah.

270
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.450
And that he's willing to go,
what you want,
what you want.

271
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.880
And then there's a black and he goes,

272
00:14:51.881 --> 00:14:55.230
what's going on back there that's going on back there?
And somebody yells out,

273
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.430
white boy,
he can't find his coat.
Do I book him?

274
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.510
So he goes fucking lights on and they turned the lights on and they're all

275
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:05.460
looking around guns,
this joke,
all this shit.

276
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.680
And I'm walking around and trying to find him.
Finally some lady in the back,

277
00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:11.800
I remember I put it by that little bar in the bag there.
She goes,

278
00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:16.570
this gel coat and I go,
yeah.
And I go over,
I get my coat and they go,

279
00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:19.080
you keep warm,
get out of your wife or my,
my on.

280
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.060
I just took my coat and they put the lights out and I went home.

281
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.850
You know something.
I hate to lose like that any more.

282
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:31.710
They do five minutes of stand up and then they run a God damn special.
Sorry Bro.

283
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.880
It seems like that.
Yeah,

284
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.190
I was just saying that what I always loved and hated about black crowds was

285
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.800
they're going to have fun either way.
The they having fun with it.
Yeah.

286
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.940
Cause you're killing or you're going to,
they're going to laugh at you.

287
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.920
Either way you kill.
Oh yeah,

288
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.510
there'll be either you tell the joke and people laugh or you tell the joke.

289
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.590
There's a pause.

290
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.130
Somebody else says something and then there's like the big laugh dude.

291
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:57.710
I remember one time fucking eaten it in front of all black crowd and uh,

292
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.430
there's this comedy club called mix and nuts and now it's called the comedy

293
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.970
union out here in California.
So,
uh,
out here in La and I'm doing,

294
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.260
I go up to that dude and just from the,
from the get go,
I am just bombing.

295
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.850
30 seconds in,
I got dry mouth and I am just,

296
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.300
and then I'm just plowing through my act and nobody is saying anything.

297
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.980
There's not a sound in the room.

298
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.510
It's just the sound of my dry lips as I'm fucking doing these jokes.

299
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:24.440
And finally,

300
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.170
two and a half excruciating minutes of dead silence.

301
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.770
This big girl in the back just just calm his shit,

302
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.860
just looks at a friend and just goes,
I laughed yet.

303
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.740
And the whole place just goes through everybody.

304
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.670
And then they just started laughing at me and I didn't know how to address it

305
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.750
and I stayed in my act and just,
he didn't the bubble.

306
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.770
Like I was doing my show at some other comedy club where people were listening

307
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:54.930
to it and it was fucking the,

308
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.270
I'm getting embarrassed out dates for the fucking humiliation of that to stay in

309
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:01.490
your act as the worst part about it too.

310
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.780
It's like they're just trying to hide behind this bubble.

311
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:07.310
That of words that don't exist man,
you know?
No,
you have to,
you,
you,
you,

312
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.570
you have to address it.
Like it's weird like,
oh,

313
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:11.900
white crowd will almost get uncomfortable with you.

314
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.250
But either way you have to break the tension.
But I'm getting back to the,

315
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:20.390
the Boston comedy club.
Dude,
I had such horrific set say when I first started,

316
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.890
you don't,
when you first came to town,

317
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:24.960
like Steinberg and frost would fucking test you when they put you on.

318
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.860
I have to read Johnny in the round guy who murdered.

319
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:32.400
They were this comedy team and I remember they would end this set doing,
uh,

320
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.760
their version of that song.
It takes,
it takes two,

321
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.350
it takes two to make a thing go right.
Insane.

322
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.180
And it would be flicking the fucking lights on and off,
on and off a dude.

323
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.850
You literally felt like,
dude,
I have,
I don't have a joke in my act.

324
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.000
And they would just throw you.
All that stuff shows over after that,

325
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:49.240
the show is over.
Everybody go home after you.

326
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.190
Like I ever saw a new guy I ever saw it go down and fucking not only killed but

327
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:57.150
fucking level after it was Dane Cook,
Dane Cook,
I believe that the energy,

328
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.721
oh yeah,
dude,

329
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:00.690
he went up there and that's the funny thing about all the fucking shit that was

330
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.890
said about that guy.

331
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.010
Like they don't understand like the level that that guy murdered.

332
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.540
I'll never understand that.
Right dude?
He went up to and just fucking like,
he,

333
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.480
he treated them like that.
He was like,
they weren't like as guys opener.

334
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:15.690
He just took it to an entirely different level.
And,
um,

335
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.170
I remember Steinberg years later was talking about him and Jason ran the room

336
00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:23.280
back then and he said to me,
he just said,
yeah man.
He goes,

337
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:26.640
I couldn't bury the kid,
I couldn't bury him.
And,
and I remember thinking like,

338
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:29.820
yeah,
I knew you guys used to do that.
You used it when guys came down,

339
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.460
it was the exact opposite of any other club where they'd be like,
oh,

340
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:37.230
he's a new guy.
Put it up early,
put them up after the fucking,
you know,
okay,

341
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:39.870
act when you went to the Boston Comedy Club Day and meet,

342
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.510
they threw you right into the fire and they write into the deep end.

343
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.650
And I think that that's why I wanted,
I kept going back there.

344
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.670
Do I use least?
We still walk by that club and during the day,
if I saw it,

345
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:54.400
I got sick to my stomach just going like,
oh God,
that fucking like it dude.

346
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:57.480
It literally had my heart sometimes I didn't even recognize it during the day.

347
00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:59.820
I'd be halfway past and go,
Oh shit,
there it is.

348
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.600
Just because it's such a night thing,
a dark light,
yeah.
Thing.
And,

349
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.540
but the thing about it too is,
uh,
you know,

350
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.450
the idea that you had to go through there and do that.

351
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:12.030
I like sometimes it'll be on the road now and like these features go,

352
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.600
I'm deciding if I should move to la or New York and Da da Da.

353
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:18.060
And they talking about comedy and like the one question,

354
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.950
like you got to ask yourself as,
do you love it?

355
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:24.120
You got to love it so much that like we were blind to that man.

356
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.170
It was no big deal.
You walk home after getting beaten and batted there and yeah,

357
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.980
and you always kills me is quitting.
Never even like,

358
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:34.980
I never even thought about quitting.
I would just immediately be thinking about,

359
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.310
I felt was getting past,
I've tried to think of like,
uh,

360
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.070
like how I could do better the next time.

361
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.820
I just remember the worst part was just when you went to bed and just you just

362
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.210
laying in your fucking,
I had,
oh,
I had a walkthrough bedroom,

363
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:51.490
railroad apartment back then.
Remember that shit up on 97th street,
right?
Yeah.

364
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.690
And I would fucking just be laying there in the bed just like with the

365
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:58.140
humiliation of the set,

366
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:00.600
just going through my fucking head and everything and like,

367
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.850
like it would take you all the way until like maybe two in the afternoon the

368
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.890
next day to finally get your feet for me anyways,

369
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:11.700
get my feet back underneath me and then I have a spot at the strip and he'd go,

370
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:15.480
Oh yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Thank God.
I'm still funny.
I,
I'm still funny,

371
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:20.070
but like I think that there was a lot of guys that went down to the Boston

372
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:24.210
comedy club and got their heads handed to them and then they went back up to

373
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.990
those uptown clubs,
uh,

374
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.070
meaning like the standup New York and the Strip and they just stayed there.

375
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.940
And I think that that hurt him as comedians because I mean,
who's kidding,

376
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.840
who doing the Boston comedy club exclusively would also hurt you because then

377
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:38.310
you become a hell Rome comic.

378
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.050
You needed that balance of both where you go to the comic strip,
you like,
oh,

379
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:45.780
this,
this feels like let's what must be what it's like when you make it.

380
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.500
That's cardio when working out like the comic strips cardio than comedy clubs,

381
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:55.360
squats deadweights
what do they call those things?

382
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.740
Kettlebells.
Yeah.
All that nasty stuff,
man.
Exactly.
I was the biggest difference.

383
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.770
And you'd go uptown sometimes and then you'd be like,
oh,
this is,

384
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.120
this is easy peasy.
I mean,
every,
this is so easy.
But then you'll start to look,

385
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.220
sometimes when I go uptown late to the strip,

386
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.190
I'd sit in the back and I'd be like,
I think it's the same white guy,

387
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:16.370
just changing outfits.
Like,
uh Oh,
they had that.
They had that song.
Yeah.

388
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.280
Rest his soul.
You,

389
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:22.540
I'm first time it came down to the comic strip and I Ellucian whole legend in

390
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.540
the,
uh,
New York comedy scene in stand up in general.

391
00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:27.970
And I remember calling there and just being like,
hey,

392
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:30.640
Lucia just wanted to do as myself.
And he's built Burma,

393
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.340
comedian from Boston and he just nods his head and he just went,

394
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.650
I already have enough white guys.

395
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.490
And there was so many white guys that got offended by that.

396
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:42.060
Go do digital fucked up.
If you said that about a black guy,

397
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.950
little bit like lacking,
like it was the same thing.
It's just like,
dude,

398
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:46.740
I know what this guy's saying.
Yeah,

399
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.650
don't be another guy coming in here talking about the same shit.

400
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.350
I just took that immediately.
It's like if you don't have a unique voice,

401
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.660
I'm not going to get you on stage cause I already have enough of you.

402
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.940
Well that's exactly it because I would go down anywhere,

403
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.590
even at a comedy cell for example,

404
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.980
and I would have like my clever joke about something that happened in the news

405
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.181
and then I'd be like,

406
00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:08.140
well I'm wasting my time because Geraldo in a tell doing this shit way better

407
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:10.480
than I have a crime and they're way more invested in it.

408
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:12.820
So I'm just going to talk about my life,
you know?
And then,

409
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.760
and then I took one lesson where I was going to lose my accent.

410
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:20.150
I had the damn car wine cork in my mouth to try to,
you know,
I'm like,
wait,

411
00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:22.030
what the fuck am I doing?
Just be who you are.

412
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.780
It's all this shit that's separating you from every other white guy.

413
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:29.320
Sometimes you don't have a lot y'all festival.
I'm sorry man.

414
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.880
Every guy in Canada is like,
I mean,
uh,
who's the one who does this?

415
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.350
I love that he does that.
It's the only,

416
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:37.840
it's the most physical thing I've ever seen.
A comedian comic duo.

417
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.550
The WHO's the one who,
oh,
no,
uh,
oh my God.

418
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:45.720
Love them fucking murders.
Yeah.
He's so funny man.
Uh,

419
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.650
Jeremy is something anyway,
yeah,
Jay,
I,
he touches his nose.

420
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:52.120
That's like the most physical thing.

421
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.300
I was that guy when you got a guy's got to go see we do,

422
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:57.130
when that guy gets on a fucking roll,

423
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:01.570
he almost kills people when he keeps going up.
Piece of shit that is

424
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.100
do once the crowd buys in.
Like,
uh,
I,

425
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.290
I that's one of the hardest comics I've ever had to follow a hymn.

426
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:13.390
Greer Barnes.
Oh forget it.
Yeah.

427
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.550
Would I even want to go back to the city now when I play,

428
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.710
I always look ahead to see if Grissom before me cause that's the one we were

429
00:23:18.711 --> 00:23:22.840
like,
all right to the love of crowd has for Greer Barnes.

430
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.590
If he's doing eight minutes,
forget about if he's doing like a 15 minute spot.

431
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.220
Like I always felt like when I went on stage after him,

432
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.930
I literally felt the disappointment.
Like they were like,
oh,
you know,

433
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.920
another black comic,

434
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.610
another guy going to do all this cool beat box and characters and all this crazy

435
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:41.320
shit.
And I was just going to come up.
They'd be like,
Hey,

436
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.560
you know what's up with Bill Clinton?
Like no one got,
no one gave a fuck.

437
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.980
You literally felt like the,
the uh,
I,
and he's won a few guys.

438
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:52.280
I ever just felt like just,
just disappointment was it was,

439
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.520
and I always thought it was so genuine to where it's like obviously if you go on

440
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.750
after like some uh,
you know,
some soap star or some shit like that,

441
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:00.890
that's a different thing.

442
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:04.340
He was just like that guy from day one and he's another guy.
Man,

443
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:07.850
I can't figure out why that guy doesn't,
well he's got that bit too.
For example,

444
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:12.590
where we scuba dive in and he's on the water and the majority of the pit is

445
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.820
complete silence.

446
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.030
He doesn't say anything for like three minutes and he's making the noises of the

447
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:21.520
bubbles and he's acting this shit out in his fucking murderer.
No,

448
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.810
I'm old school.
I think you're a little like this too.

449
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.270
When there's no laugh tickle.
I get all bugged out.
I'm like,
it's cold.
I mean,

450
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.550
how would I come in it and like when I saw you do,
like I said the,

451
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:34.370
well we were having a catch that made me,
you know,
again,
it's brewed,

452
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:38.630
does that too.
Chapelle take your time.
Don't worry.
If there's no laughter,

453
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:40.730
they're going to come in big at the end.
But you know,
like,

454
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.130
like Chapelle sometimes we'll have these two minute bits where you're not

455
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:47.090
supposed to be laughing and then the end,
this is going to make you die laughing.

456
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.940
But I,
I'd be too worried in the two minutes.
I'm like,
oh,

457
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:52.550
it is better to have a big ending.
He was fucked up though,

458
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.570
is what I first started out.
I took a comedy class.

459
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.950
This guy Vinny favorito,
who's now in a,
he works in Vegas.

460
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.000
And uh,
I'll never forget,
he said something in that class.

461
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.320
He was talking about people like,
you know,

462
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.350
talking about silence and people being afraid of it.
And he was saying,
you know,

463
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:11.970
it's weird,
you swatch a comic up there and then fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

464
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.200
blah,
going like 90 miles an hour and it's not going well.
And he goes,

465
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:18.470
and all of a sudden they go and they tell a street joke and they'll just be
like,

466
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:20.530
all right,
two guys walk into a bar,
right?
There's a horse in one day.

467
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.850
And he goes immediately,
the crowds shuts the fuck up and they listen.

468
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.460
He goes the gun to listen.
It feels like a story.

469
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:28.910
So like usually like a street joke with somebody tells you a street joke,

470
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:33.350
you're going to sit there for 45 seconds waiting for the punchline.
Yeah,
true.

471
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.010
But you do.
If the guy tells the story the right way,
it's gonna happen.

472
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:41.900
So I remember,
um,
for whatever reason that stayed with me,

473
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:47.260
but it took me I think like 19 years to be able to apply that to be able to go

474
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:50.390
into areas where,

475
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.890
I just think New York and Boston comedy scenes are similar where it was like you

476
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:57.950
get on stage,
once you get your foot on their neck,

477
00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:01.520
you don't take it off for the rest of the set and you like just beat the shit

478
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:04.370
out of him every fucking eight seconds.
Like that was what you were trying to do.

479
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:06.290
And there was,
even when I was in Boston,

480
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:09.170
I would say like Tony Vee and Kenny Rogers and we're the only guys that I,

481
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:12.380
that I saw that had more of like a relaxed style.

482
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.680
And could still murder and then you can come up there and come back and right.

483
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.290
I should dynamics it does.
But when you say,

484
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.630
and how it took you a long time to really apply it,
like,
oh my first special,

485
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:27.830
I have a bit long story short where at the end of it I say some about,
uh,

486
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.530
being a Cobra and a basket,
you know,
when someone plays the flute.

487
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.470
So I pretend I'm a cobra and the basket,
right?

488
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.370
And the bit is the flutes playing and I get excited and eventually I pop out.

489
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.460
And uh,
the thing about is I love it and it's funny,

490
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.950
but if I'm not doing it just right,
I'm scratched down and what?

491
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:46.490
I'm scratched down,
I can tell.
But you didn't have pop up.
Oh,

492
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.100
they're not going to laugh.
I'm going to be popping up like an asshole.

493
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.640
The complete silence.
I literally pop up and go into that as I'm popping up.
I go,

494
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.990
I flew the other day on southwest like I'm already into the next fit for.

495
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.770
I'm done doing the fucking slick.
Do you remember,

496
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.890
do you remember doing the danger fields?
Dude,

497
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.940
I was a danger fields the last time.
Rodney went on stage.
I was on the show.

498
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:12.440
He was on,
it was incredible.
Man.
Are you serious?
I came in,

499
00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:16.080
it was a Saturday night.
I mean he was,
he died like about a month after that.

500
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.840
And a Tony who runs the place,

501
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.180
it was packed because it's bridge and tunnel Saturday night.

502
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.100
Mike Britt is how am seeing and he goes to the Brits,
a beast beast.

503
00:27:27.101 --> 00:27:31.230
So funny,
so funny.
And uh,
Tony Goes,
listen,
Rodney's in the crowd.

504
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:34.170
A lot of people don't know what he's sitting with his wife right up front in his

505
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:38.220
robe and he's going to come on after you Pete.
And uh,
you know,

506
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.640
he liked it.
He didn't even really,
it was very old,
you know,

507
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:44.150
so it wasn't going to be much of anything.
So,
uh,

508
00:27:44.151 --> 00:27:46.080
I'm going to do 15 minutes in front of Rodney.

509
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.910
The guys like going to die any day.

510
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.320
I try to do every joke I ever written in 15 minutes.
Like he might pop up,

511
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:54.780
shake my hand and go,
let me make it.
Few your phone calls for you.

512
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.680
The guy didn't even know he was in doors.
Billy and I'm rattling off all night.

513
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.950
Right.
So I get off,
I stand off to the side and uh,

514
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.420
my Britt introduces Rodney place goes crazy.
Okay.
Rodney gets up,

515
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.850
he's walking so slow,

516
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.750
it's like from here to the wall and it takes him like 20 minutes at 55 solid

517
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:15.990
minutes with his wife helping him.
The people even stop clapping.

518
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:19.020
So I started clapping.
So they keep the class.
I mean keep the clap.

519
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.570
He grabs them like an imperfect Rodney voice.
If you close your eyes,
it's not a,

520
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.430
he grabs the mic and about Mike Brady goes,

521
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.890
how about another round of applause for the Moon Yan?
Huh?

522
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.080
It my wrist.

523
00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:36.120
I was cracking up to it and he puts his arm around Mike Brady does about a

524
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.610
minute and a half,
some joke.
It was very funny and worked and then he,

525
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:42.200
and then he shuffled off and then he passed away in about a month.
Wow.
Yeah.

526
00:28:42.201 --> 00:28:45.210
And I didn't meet him or shake his hand or anything cause he was back in the

527
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:48.360
crowd and I had to get back down to the cellar.
Oh yeah.

528
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.150
What would they think about danger fields?
That when we came to New York,

529
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.610
that club was like,

530
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.670
it was in a bad place where it was just like they had comics that had been

531
00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:02.310
working there since the fucking place had opened.
And it just,

532
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.990
I went in there one night,
dude.

533
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.360
And that was one of those nights where I felt like quitting comedy.

534
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:08.010
I watched this come back and say this comics name,

535
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:12.750
but I saw this guy on stage and it was the most bleakest,
darkest,

536
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.420
like the negativity that was hanging in the fucking air.

537
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.950
And then what happened was Jim Norton.
Yes,

538
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:24.120
you just said his name.
Yes,
yes.
Oh my God,
Dude.

539
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.360
Like I watched three minutes that guys sent in.
If I,

540
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:29.490
if there was a gun in the room,
I would've had it in my mouth.

541
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.760
I would have shot him first just out of just humanity.

542
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.210
How fucking bleak this guy was.
So,
yeah,

543
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.980
that's the kind of guy you want to play in a movie to win your Roscoe and

544
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:40.620
independent film thought and what are you going home to?

545
00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:44.710
What are you doing when you get home,
man?
Right.
He was sitting in there and like,

546
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.280
dude,
I'm not lying.
I love danger fields.
But the reverb on that,

547
00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:52.000
Mike was fucked up for like seven years straight.
Nobody adjusted it.

548
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.510
You what was the worst is you do like a higher energy bit and there was nobody

549
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:57.700
in there that fucking Echo,
you know,

550
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.760
which sounds great on like a dean Martin album,
like fills out his voice.

551
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.780
But if you fucking doing like singing,
I mean I'm doing jokes,
it w e your balls,

552
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:08.740
but Norton was the guy that first started doing it.
Yes,

553
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.730
you guys got to go there.
You get to do a half hour,
$45.

554
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:14.170
Norton single handedly,

555
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:17.080
I think saved that place because he got us all to go there.

556
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:21.340
I remember everybody was giving him shit.
I remember Patrice rest,
his soul goes,

557
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:25.840
uh,
he goes,
wait,
coming from Norton,
he goes Dangerfield.
And he goes,
yeah.
He goes,

558
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:28.900
hey,
he goes,
he goes,
who did you go on after Ruth buzzy

559
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:36.030
and everybody's dying laughing.
And Norton defended it though.
He was going,
dude,

560
00:30:36.031 --> 00:30:36.761
you got to go up there.

561
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:40.750
So I was living on the upper east side like you and you and I started doing it

562
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.870
and then I remember Shirad came in and then there was his great thing.

563
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.200
It just all of a sudden just fucking turned around.
Yeah.

564
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:52.540
Those older guys took off and left and uh,
but what was weird was that,
you know,

565
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.840
and is cool as the decor remained the exact same.

566
00:30:55.841 --> 00:30:57.790
Like if you're into like shit from back in the day,

567
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.030
you got to go to danger fields.
It really looks like,
you think,

568
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:04.480
you feel like Johnny Carson is going to come walking in when he still had like

569
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:06.640
jet black hair or brown hair and shit.
Like when,

570
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.950
when you sit in there with those,
those little fucking,

571
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.140
it was a little lamp shades.
Yeah.

572
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.260
Everybody writes their initials on the lampshades and uh,

573
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.290
it's literally like a lounge in Vegas from 1970.

574
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:22.000
They only have male waiters and the weight is all still wet or red jackets,

575
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:26.500
career weight or it's,
yeah,
and it's,
it's just,
uh,
you know,

576
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:29.770
I mean the photos on the wall when you first come in because like Billy Joel did

577
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:32.150
a song for easy,
easy money for Rodney's movies.

578
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.300
So there's a photo of Billy Joel was there and you know,

579
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:37.360
Sinatra and all these great Elvis,
Elvis with Rodney.

580
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.730
But then the thing would happen after a while bill is I would play there and uh,

581
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.080
then I'd be back at the seller and you know,
sometimes in between spots,

582
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:46.580
everyone sits around and chats and I'm running out and no one's like,
wait,

583
00:31:46.581 --> 00:31:48.650
are you going?
I'm like,
God,
I got gotta Dangerfield.
And he's like,
oh,

584
00:31:48.651 --> 00:31:52.090
you still got an a day and you feel like it stopped.
And I,

585
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.550
because he got to the point where it's 75 bucks.

586
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:56.140
I live around the corner and I'd be like,

587
00:31:56.141 --> 00:32:00.750
how can I not bop in and just get a quick 75 title few mummy's?

588
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.260
I fucking love that place.
Sometimes.
Other times it would just literally,

589
00:32:04.261 --> 00:32:06.980
it's the only place I had a breakdown where I was like the,
Oh,

590
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.040
the only time where I was ever looking at the crowd.
Like,

591
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.900
what did you just call me if the fucking heat,
why are you even here?
Dude,
I saw.

592
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:14.830
So I've seen some of the,

593
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.690
one of the fucking most bizarre heckles I ever got and one of the best tackles I

594
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:23.410
ever saw I saw in that room.
All right.
The one that happened to me,
right,

595
00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:26.650
I'm fucking standing on stage and this,
this,
this group,
I told this one time,

596
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:28.690
I think on a special ordinance was an extra something.

597
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:31.770
It was like four white dudes in the corner,
Dude.

598
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.260
And you could feel the fuck and anger coming off these guys.

599
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:38.860
You could feel the fucking awful dads that beat him with belt buckles and shit.

600
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:40.650
I'm,
I've never felt an energy like that.

601
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.950
So I go on stage and they're so fucking angry and there were a little loud being

602
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:48.230
drunk that they're intimidating the entire crowd.

603
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.880
So I'm standing on stage bombing and I know I'm bombing because those fucking

604
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:56.480
guys,
their energy and everything in me is saying,
don't say anything.

605
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.090
Don't say anything,
just fucking get through the shit.

606
00:32:59.091 --> 00:33:03.020
And then finally I was just bombing so bad.
I had to say something.

607
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:06.080
I was just saying like,
what are you guys talking about over there?

608
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.160
They like what?
I said,
yeah wait,
what are you guys talking about over there?

609
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.020
And the guy yells out,
he goes,
anything read non stages.
A faggot.

610
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.380
That's what he said,
which I don't even know what the fuck that means.

611
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.390
Like it was just so fucking like childish and I just,
but,

612
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.090
but then it was hilarious and I'm sitting there going like,

613
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.900
I went right back into my act and I was sitting there.
Pardon me,
is law.

614
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:30.681
I'm furious.

615
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:33.140
The other part of me is laughing my ass off because I can't wait to go down the

616
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.440
cellar and luckily tell the story through.

617
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.440
That's like saying anybody who's sitting over there,
his girl germs or cooties,

618
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:42.200
like something in the second grade.
But it was still fucking hilarious.

619
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.240
And just eating my pulse and they did nothing about it off again whatsoever.

620
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.680
And I just sat there eating my balls and got offstage and I had to walk by the

621
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:53.660
fucking table.
It just,

622
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.150
I don't know that they had that one and then there was the guy.
Uh,

623
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.570
but it makes you better man.
Somehow those make you better,
man.

624
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:02.120
It makes you low my mind that in a hotel room.

625
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:03.910
But there was always that thing where we'd like when if they,

626
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.860
if you're actually in a comedy club and they're not policing it at all,

627
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.990
you're just like,
oh,

628
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.390
you give a fuck is that these people are eating and drinking and if they yell at

629
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:12.650
me or throw shit at me,

630
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:15.710
you don't give a fuck as long as they pay the check in the end.
But,
um,

631
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.860
the other time,
uh,

632
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.180
I don't know how to do this show because I don't want to say the guy's name

633
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:23.030
because I'm saying the name,
but I'd tell the danger fields,
jokers story.

634
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:26.800
But go ahead and write to this actor.
Slash comedian goes on stage.
All right.

635
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.730
All right.
People can figure out what is,
what am I going to say?

636
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:31.670
His name out of respect.
So he fuck,
and he's one of the funniest comics.
I know.

637
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.830
I'm going to say it.
Frank Santa.
Really?

638
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.840
It's one of the funniest guys ever go with a cigarette and he does a cigarette.

639
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.720
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Fucking hilarious.
One of my favorites of all time.

640
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:41.270
So He's on stage and uh,

641
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.030
it's just this fucking one of those summertime crowds,

642
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.790
whether it just fucking sit in there and when those things like why the fuck did

643
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:48.200
you people come out here.
Exactly.

644
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:51.190
So this sitting there and he goes up on stage and he's on the soprano's going to

645
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.410
place the bartender thing.
So he goes on stage and they're just not having it.

646
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.290
They're not listening,
they're not laughing.
And his shit is really,

647
00:34:57.291 --> 00:35:00.170
it's like Greer Barnes where like he'll go into a bit and it's like this 10

648
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:04.860
minute high level concept thing and then not buying it.
So finally,
you know,

649
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.960
he's like 10 years older than me,

650
00:35:05.961 --> 00:35:09.140
so he's trying to reach out to this crowd because it's a young crowd.
He goes,

651
00:35:09.141 --> 00:35:11.880
hey man.
He goes,
uh,
uh,
you,
you guys liked the soprano's.

652
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.410
How'd you guys like the Sopranos?
He goes,
I played so-and-so.
Ah,

653
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.000
I played the bartender every week.
Uh,

654
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.540
Tony Soprano beats the shit out of me and this guy in the back without missing a

655
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:22.430
beat goes,
you should have killed you.

656
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:28.490
I don't even know to this day of frank ever heard it.
I was like,
oh my God,

657
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:32.780
that's fucking hilarious.
So,
and I wanted to laugh my balls off,

658
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:34.010
but I had to go on next to,

659
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.500
so I'm literally watching the beat down that I'm going to take.
Right.

660
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.730
It was like when your mother would line you all up and you know,

661
00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:41.440
to beat you or whatever,
and you're like waiting like,
okay,
this,
this,
this.

662
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.850
Maybe she'll get tired by the time she gets to me.
Right.
She'll get a phone call,

663
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.420
something.
Yeah.
So he walked off stage.
I remember he walked by me.

664
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.650
It's still classic.
Frank.
Funny as hell.
Didn't say anything.
He just walks by me.

665
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.640
Just doesn't look at me.
Just goes,
wow.
Wow.
He said it twice.

666
00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.410
Wow.
That's all he could do at that place.
Sometimes.

667
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.920
I mean,
Carrie Carrabba's used to be on stage there at night.

668
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:08.430
We're doing prom shows.
I used to do prom shows that,
oh no,
I just,

669
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.750
I mean that's literally just go,

670
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.080
if you can just go up there and stay up there for 10 minutes,

671
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:15.840
you get your 50 bucks or whatever it was.
It was,
it was not about comedy.

672
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:16.830
It wasn't about anything.

673
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.520
Or You'd have a better chance going to port authority and just with a Mr

674
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.740
microphone,
you'd get more laughs.
She would yell from the stage.

675
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:25.560
Cause I'd be last,
she'd be second the last sheet yell from the stage,

676
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.980
call reality.
I got five,
four minutes,
five more minutes.

677
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:33.550
How fucking jealous I yeah.
Ah Man.

678
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.580
That she's bragging that she doesn't have to be in front of them in the moment.

679
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.260
It's completely then get it and the club and the club would latch on to the

680
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:44.940
weirdest characters to be there.
Like comic,
like the comic of,
you know,

681
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:49.590
how like,
you know,
certain comics,
like it tells known for the comedy cellar,

682
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.020
right?
The 12 o'clock spot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,

683
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:55.200
like I remember danger fields went through a phase with Steve Marshall was

684
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:59.010
hosting all the shows and he was that guy and he's not there to behave.
Oh yeah,

685
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.940
have,
I'm not here to behave.
That's right slogan.
So he would do,
it is so weird.

686
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:05.130
He would do his last bit every show,

687
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:10.131
he'd have a dozen roses and he would slam each rose against the piano as he had

688
00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:15.450
a comment about women like,
and then you blah blah blah.
Uh,
and then at the end,

689
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:15.900
you know,

690
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.290
the show would end and then when everyone left he'd have to go back in and pick

691
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:22.740
up his roses.
It's like the club wouldn't even do four.
And then,

692
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.930
and then like I remember in between shows sometimes,

693
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:28.290
cause there was a Korean Deli word get the roses,
you know,
they're like,
Steve,

694
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.030
you're next.
So until I was running late and he goes,

695
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:32.360
I don't even have my roses yet.
And even go get them up and they go,
well hurry.

696
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.390
Have to go get your roses.
So He'd have to run to the Korean Deli,

697
00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:36.440
get his fucking roof.

698
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:43.380
Not to mention that's half your paycheck and flowers men,
right?
Yeah Dude.

699
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.060
And we've going with that dude.
That's what,
it doesn't have any charge suit.

700
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:49.800
I remember I used to work in a dental office.

701
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.620
I worked in a dental office with my dad when I started out.

702
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.620
And we used to have like when we were really drilling into somebody's tooth,

703
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.690
it was gross man.
Shit,
we'd be flying out of the mouth.

704
00:37:57.691 --> 00:37:59.250
So you basically had this plastic,

705
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:01.760
it looked like a welder's mask but it was all plastic.
Yeah.

706
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.250
So all the spittle that would hit your face is hitting at the end.

707
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.370
I'll show it's fucking disgusting jump.
So,
um,

708
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.640
I got the idea one night that I was going to put it on cause I was so young I

709
00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:14.360
was going to put it on on stage or whatever and I was going to,

710
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.860
this is going to be my closing pit.
So for like,

711
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.670
like maybe two and a half months in my standup career,

712
00:38:20.671 --> 00:38:24.390
I had this little duffle bag and I would be bringing the stupid mask on stage.

713
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.070
And the funniest thing was,
I didn't even have a joke.
I would just put it on,

714
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.520
I would just say like,
you know,
my job during day,
you know,
you don't,

715
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.260
it's like working there.
Who job stinks so bad,
I got to wear this.

716
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.810
And I would put on and they'd sort of chuckle and they were like,
and,

717
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.700
and where does this go?

718
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:43.390
And I would just have the thing on and with the screen in front of me,

719
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:48.370
like muffling my voice,
I'd be like,
who are you guys as I'm taking it off.

720
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.140
And finally one day I figured it out.
I was,
I was talking to this comic,

721
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:58.100
got Todd Parker and a god,
we come a long way.
Holy Shit Dude.

722
00:38:58.101 --> 00:39:00.730
And I said to him,
Oh yeah,
I actually thought that that was funny.

723
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:01.930
So I talked to him,
I said,
you know,

724
00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:03.430
I'm not going to do that match thing in the morning.

725
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.780
I remember he was sitting at the cow loom,
this arms crossed looking forward,

726
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:10.610
not looking at me like I,
you know,
I'm not gonna do that mastering anymore.

727
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.070
And I was just like,
and he just goes,
oh yeah,
he's just looking at the stage.

728
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:18.820
I go,
yeah,
I just feel like I'm just saying like,
I'm so not funny.

729
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.820
I literally need to bring shit on stage to make myself funny.

730
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.520
And he just sort of looked at me goes,
yeah,
yeah,
he figured that out.

731
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.740
And I remember my heart sinking going like,
oh my God,

732
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:29.800
every comic was thinking that and I didn't even know the whole,

733
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.120
he's a prop comic and all that shit that you know,
those guys go through,

734
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:36.040
which I don't give a fuck if you use props.
It's funny,
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

735
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:38.770
no,
that's a different thing.
But I mean if you're a prop guy,
your prop guy,

736
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:40.900
if you just got roses,
I mean that's it.

737
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.970
It's like I the that you got to go all in.

738
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:48.370
I got either got a bunch of props,
that's it or absolutely nothing.

739
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.370
I Vinnie favarino would've shut down.
The mask is,
yeah,

740
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.050
he definitely would have.
I got the,

741
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:59.530
actually I've got finally got the website for Pete's special streaming on

742
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:00.101
showtime.

743
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:04.540
Go to sho.com and click on comedy and it's going to be on there.

744
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:08.110
But uh oh yeah,
tell me.
But I could sit there and literally tell,
uh,

745
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.700
we haven't gotten to the New York comedy club all my swept day.
You know,

746
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:15.760
we're going to discourage people from becoming standups cause this is just gonna

747
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.410
cause the hell gigs of the funniest ones.

748
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.650
Well this is all though before the social media was what it was,

749
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:24.940
where like now instead of like I mopped and swept for stage time at the New York

750
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:28.900
comedy club.
Now you know,
you get yourself a nice little five minutes,

751
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.510
you get it on the right website is something,

752
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:34.480
I mean you get it out there and the on the Internet and then you could start to

753
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:37.390
feature.
That's the other thing too with features.

754
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:41.350
Now it's like Eh,
I mean you probably bring your own guys,

755
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:44.620
but when I'm on the road and these features are on the road,
it's like this,

756
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.930
it's like the MCS really into comedy.

757
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:51.370
The features like had it and his last bit always as t shirts sale.

758
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.730
And he's like,
do you mind if I sell?
And if I say,
well,

759
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:57.760
I'd rather you didn't stand next to me itself.
It's not a flea market.

760
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.430
You know what I mean?
Then he won't talk to me the whole weekend.

761
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:03.450
That's what happened the last time.
They guy won't talk to me.
Uh,
and,

762
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.950
and he's like,
you know,
they don't pay me enough to feature.

763
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:10.480
And it's like nobody gave a shit about me when I get paid enough money to

764
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:15.490
feature was
exactly when I featured,
I had a day job.

765
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.790
I mean Bruce would tell me how filled tag men that Phil tag that.
Yeah,

766
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:19.500
he had a quill,

767
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.200
he traveled with a coffee machine in his car and a waffle brew who told me about

768
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:25.640
what time.
He's like,
I worked with Phil,
but it's like brew,

769
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.970
we'll lived out of his car when he started.
Uh,

770
00:41:27.971 --> 00:41:31.330
I worked front desk at a hotel forever.
I remember I worked for,

771
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:33.680
I don't want to be the guy who was all bitter on the new cause there's a bunch

772
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:35.790
of guys,
there's a lot of great guys.
Right.

773
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.520
But it's just the different thing is funny is I remember,
don't remember,

774
00:41:38.521 --> 00:41:39.950
you don't have to do a lot of that anymore.

775
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:44.900
I remember being in working in Baltimore and I was working with the a feature

776
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:49.580
act and he was upset that he didn't get a half hour special and I just remember

777
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:53.780
thinking like,
dude,
when I want,
I started just,
this was like 10 12 years ago,

778
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:55.730
so I was only like 10 years.
And I'm thinking too,

779
00:41:55.731 --> 00:42:00.731
when I started like the half hour specials they gave to like seasoned headliners

780
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:03.980
and they picked from an hour of,
you know,

781
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:05.510
I'm not saying there wasn't some week specials,

782
00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:08.330
but like you had to be a headline and you had to pick from an hour.
It's shit.

783
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:09.860
It's like you're a feature,
right?

784
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:11.690
It's like we're going to go do your whole fucking act.

785
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.553
You can do everything together.

786
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.040
It's like they're almost doing you a favor and they don't see it that way.

787
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.980
But yeah.
Thank God.
Thank God through the fight.
Did any specials?

788
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:24.020
My Shit in the fucking 90 oh yeah,
dude,
I got the VHS tapes.

789
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:26.330
I remember I found them one time and I was watching it with my wife too.

790
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.260
I sat there,
I had my hand over my mouth.
I couldn't fuck.

791
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.410
I knew I was bad dude.
I couldn't believe how fucking bad I was,

792
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.290
how fast I was going.
Dude,

793
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.380
forget about the clothes and the big fucking red Afro.

794
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:44.060
Forget about all of that shit,
dude.
I was fucking horrible.

795
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.510
And uh,
that's the one thing that amazes me is these kids,
like they,

796
00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.780
they get the from day one,
they're putting this shit up on the Internet,

797
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:55.760
but they all,
a lot of them are better than I was that quick.
I'll give him that.

798
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:59.150
Like,
you know,
some of these guys are young,
they're funnier than I was.

799
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.230
They figured out how to write jokes better than I did that young do the crown

800
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:04.430
node,
the crowd at this point,

801
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:08.390
they're making videos of each other and then they post them and they can buy

802
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:12.350
comments that they learn what plays and what doesn't.
Like,
I really think it's,

803
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:17.090
it's helped stand up because I think crowds in general are so much more educated

804
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:22.030
to uh,
to stand up comedy that it kind of pushes you to,
to,

805
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.790
you got to stay above,
you've got to keep your head above the water lines.
Yeah.

806
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:26.330
Yeah.
Or you're going to go under.

807
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:28.520
But there's obviously a bunch of great comics out there,

808
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:33.140
but like I think as much all we all,
we,
you're like,

809
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:35.510
I don't want to say stuff about the young comics,
so I'm like,
all right,

810
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.820
we're going to say good stuff about him now.
And then now you're playing what?

811
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.730
I will say whatever you want to say that,
but

812
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.860
I'm not that sweat that the New York comedy club to get stage time.
I mean shit,

813
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:48.600
the stuff we went through to get on,
uh Oh wait,

814
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.570
that wasn't what I wanted to tell you.
But here's the thing though,

815
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:54.560
this same technology that affords them to not have to have a day job is also

816
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:57.710
what's,
you know,
guys like us now decide when we're going to do a special.

817
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.670
So it's helping everybody.
But I do know what you mean.
You almost like a,

818
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.670
not even like an asshole way,
like,

819
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:07.710
well I had to do this so you should have to do this.
I think it helps you.
No,
no,

820
00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.010
that's it.
It just makes you better.
I mean,
you know,

821
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:15.011
I see guys now sometimes that become a famous early and then you can see them

822
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.750
when you're on a show with them or something.
They bite and the finger nails man.

823
00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:20.840
And they were a little worried because they don't have like,

824
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:23.870
like I'll give you an example.
One time I opened for our old friend,

825
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.240
you must know Billy Gardell,
right?
Oh yeah.
From Mike and Molly.

826
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.350
He's so funny man.
And I've done towards that and he's just such a,

827
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.420
he's really funny comedian and uh,
it's in,

828
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.180
we're playing in Niagara Falls at the falls view casino.

829
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.320
I was getting more money than I've kind of ever got to open for him.

830
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:41.910
I can't imagine when he was getting,

831
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:47.300
and it's all these high role is in the crowd and stuff and he goes up and he's

832
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:50.310
doing,
I said to my wife was,
here I go,

833
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:53.340
this is going to be so funny because like when you pay this much money to see

834
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:55.970
somebody,
you almost don't expect them to be good.
Yeah.

835
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.630
Cause they don't know anything about them.

836
00:44:57.631 --> 00:44:59.700
You're almost paying just to see the guy.
Right.

837
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.240
And for the first five minutes you could see the look in their eyes like Whoa,

838
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:04.650
wait,
wait.
He's got jokes.

839
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:08.000
I might tell he's just going to come up here and talk about,
uh,
you know,

840
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.690
and it's like being on the show and that's from years and years of doing clubs

841
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.110
and paying dues to get to that point.
Man,
I think you just,
you,
you got,
you know,

842
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.880
you could see the relaxation in them.
It's not like,
oh no worry at all.
Like,

843
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.870
yeah,
we're going to have fun.
Yeah.
He's effortless storyteller.
He's just,

844
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:26.010
one of those guys would be like,

845
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.790
know I was in Chicago two weeks ago and you're in the way.
I am.
What happened?

846
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.840
What happened?
Well,
so then when I used to work front desk,
I've got to tell you,

847
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:37.130
this is funny,
I worked front desk of,
sorry,
you've got a roll.
No,
no,
no,
no.

848
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.440
It's hilarious.
I mean there's no way to look at the clock without the guests.

849
00:45:39.441 --> 00:45:42.430
Think of that.
I just going to make sure I don't go over.
Oh,
all right.
Well yeah,

850
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.420
let me,
we got another guy coming in here like 12 or whatever.
All right.

851
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.610
I got another guy coming in and looking at the car.
So you know I'm doing well,

852
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.920
I'm doing the old salesman thing.

853
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:53.590
The Guy Coming in here at 12 so Sebastian was telling me that you flying

854
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.810
helicopters.
Yeah,
I don't want to hear it dude.
I don't want to hear it.

855
00:45:56.811 --> 00:45:59.790
If you're going to shoot it,
like only one thing I learned this to shit on.
Okay.

856
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.120
I'm just going to say it's not like the hardest thing to fly,
right?
Uh,
no,

857
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.590
this shit way harder than that.

858
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:07.110
But I mean it's more difficult than I guess fixed wing.

859
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.740
I've never taught this as a regular sets the thing,
but it's,
it's no,

860
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:14.220
it's the hardest shit is the ground school.
All the shit that comics hate,

861
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.220
have an add learning all the,
uh,
all of that shit.
Looking at charts,

862
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.500
the airspace,
whether all of that stuff.
Um,

863
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:26.790
it's the biggest accomplishment of my more so than even becoming a comedian,

864
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.620
just as far as how I'm wired,
how difficult I thought it was gonna be.

865
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.520
I just just kept going there and it was fun.
And,
um,

866
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.170
but I've learned with anything,

867
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:42.171
whenever you do something like move to la or fly in helicopters,

868
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:47.040
like there's just like a certain,
or just put your shit out on the Internet,

869
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.940
there's always that new level of tough skin.
You're going to have to get,
like,

870
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:54.930
you go to la every was like,
oh my God,
there's so plastic.
Everybody's so phony.

871
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.070
You lose your edge,

872
00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.390
the comic stink and you're going to have botox in your face and you've got to

873
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:02.250
like block all of that out.
Right.

874
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.700
And then like with aviation I've learned is just if the person you talked to

875
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:09.180
also doesn't fly,

876
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:13.020
they're just going to tell you you're going to die immediately.

877
00:47:13.021 --> 00:47:16.980
Just got to like go.
You just got to block it out.
I flew yesterday,
dude,

878
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:20.880
the first time I flew in like a little over a month and I can't even tell you

879
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:24.390
how much fucking fun it was.
I flew from Long Beach,
I went up to seven,

880
00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:27.600
10 north and I went straight up.

881
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:30.530
It goes right to pass the dean and right the left.
You see the Rose Bowl.

882
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:33.770
I'll show you a video.
I did a loop around the rose bowl.
Are you,

883
00:47:33.771 --> 00:47:38.090
are you solo at this point?
No,
I'm doing it solo.
Uh,
tomorrow.
Like I just like,

884
00:47:38.091 --> 00:47:40.310
I'm,
I'm really cautious because I was going like,
all right,

885
00:47:40.311 --> 00:47:43.280
let me do this flight once with the instructor and I go and then I'll come back

886
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.170
Thursday,
I'll do it once with you and then I'll do it.

887
00:47:45.171 --> 00:47:47.660
And by the time I was coming flying back,
I was like,
dude,

888
00:47:47.661 --> 00:47:50.090
I can do this one by myself.
And he goes,
Hey,
he goes,
you're totally ready.

889
00:47:50.091 --> 00:47:52.520
You got your head on a swivel,
you're doing the radio calls,
you've got the whole,

890
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.370
he got it down.
So,
uh,
but why copter overplaying?
Why Not Plain?

891
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:01.260
I mean copters so like,
yeah.
Yeah,
it is.

892
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.530
I drive a jeep wrangler,
jeep wrangler right there.
That's like a cop.
The,
yeah.

893
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:09.310
You didn't fucking grow up watching a magnum Pi.

894
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.970
We didn't [inaudible] I wanted to be the guy in the helicopter.

895
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.370
That was awesome.
Hey Man,
what are you kidding me?
Yeah.

896
00:48:17.371 --> 00:48:21.560
Low TC Rick and a magnum dude.
Yeah.
I love that.
You think of jeep is cool.

897
00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:24.830
That's so our generation,
like,
I don't know if kids think I fucking,
yeah,

898
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.380
I have such a great Boston storage.
Reminds me,

899
00:48:27.381 --> 00:48:29.110
you will Roberts sometimes with the accent.

900
00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:32.630
My brother lived in Boston for a little while and um,
my wife and I,

901
00:48:32.631 --> 00:48:35.330
Jackie were visiting him.
I had a my jeep wrangler.

902
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.910
It Has New York plates and even says Manhattan on it.

903
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:42.050
Cause it was a Manhattan dealership.
Had we won the world series yet?
Uh,
yeah.

904
00:48:42.051 --> 00:48:44.870
Oh yeah.
Oh,
that's,
that's not too bad.
No,
it's not too long ago.

905
00:48:44.871 --> 00:48:49.160
And I'm at a red light and a,
nobody's banging a right to turn.
Right.

906
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.220
And I'm just saying to my wife and summertime,
right at the top down,

907
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.190
I'm like typical fucking Boston.
I mean,
just bang the rate.

908
00:48:55.191 --> 00:48:57.800
What are you doing here?
Right,
right,
right next to me as a parking lot.

909
00:48:57.801 --> 00:49:00.260
So I'm like,
Hey,
screw these people.
I'm just going to my head.
I'm like,

910
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:01.460
I'm just going to cut through the parking lot.

911
00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:03.730
So I just turned the wheel and I'm going to cut through the parking lot.

912
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.860
Now what I didn't see is there was a curb right next to me,

913
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.670
so I floor it and I turned the wheel and the jeep hits the curb and like the dog

914
00:49:10.671 --> 00:49:14.540
almost flies out of the jeep.
My wife had bangs,
everything.
And I'm like,

915
00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:15.630
Holy Shit.
You know,

916
00:49:15.631 --> 00:49:19.660
and we're just trying to regroup and imperfect Boston accent right behind me.

917
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:22.760
Here's some guy yell out ea,
you go New York,

918
00:49:22.761 --> 00:49:25.400
you hear well you go,

919
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.010
oh,
I just like,
oh my God,
I'll fucking embarrass the you write out.

920
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.670
And he just keeps yelling.
I mean here,
I don't wait for the lie.

921
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.650
Oh God,
I know.
Hey,
I gotta ask you as far as,
uh,

922
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.030
as far as,
uh,
your,
you're a sports affiliation is,

923
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:49.680
I remember you're one of those weird jets,
Yankees guys.
Cause it's always jets,

924
00:49:49.681 --> 00:49:54.030
mets,
Yankees,
giants.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
that's it.
Yeah.

925
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.580
I took a year off with the Yankees hat.
I'm in mourning.

926
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.050
Fajita I just took a whole season red sox fan duel on hateable,
one of the,

927
00:50:01.051 --> 00:50:04.370
one of the few on a hateable people like Steph curry on hateable.
Yeah.

928
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.280
Can't hate him.
What's like big Papi man?
It's even like Tom Brady.

929
00:50:08.281 --> 00:50:10.290
I mean I'm a jet fan,
but it's like I've saying,

930
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:14.070
last year we were doing a show and someone was talking about a Russell Wilson

931
00:50:14.071 --> 00:50:15.180
Zeus and that I go,
listen,

932
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:19.530
Russell Wilson's great for Seattle Come Brady is great for America.

933
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.350
Yeah,
we lost,
obviously I was actually in my last podcast.
I did,

934
00:50:25.351 --> 00:50:29.660
I was watching the game live and are loving it and like hear me flipping out and

935
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:32.780
everything.
But I gotta be honest with you,
dude,
after watching that year,

936
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:37.160
we went 18 in one like dude and undefeated record in this day and age,

937
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.920
it's not like when the fucking Dolphin stadium,
you know what I mean?

938
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:42.770
When you had like white cornerbacks and shit and it was still,
you know,

939
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.890
sports was five minutes after the end of the dude drop 30 on Bob Cousy if he was

940
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:50.810
playing today.
All right,
it's a different time.

941
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.650
I'm not going to find out about them.
To me,
that's Hilarious,
dude.

942
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.910
That's fucking hilarious.

943
00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.970
But they like an undefeated record is a fucking albatross around your goddamn

944
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.870
neck.
People get people already get amped up.

945
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:05.330
If you're defending super bowl champions or if you had a nice run,

946
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:06.310
they want to fucking beat you,

947
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.260
then they just want to be the guy that knocked you off.

948
00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.520
I remember that year we went 18 and one like,
dude,

949
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:15.230
what we we fucked up was because Raymond Genie,
uh,
uh,

950
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.920
drop dime on us that we were filming fucking the signs and Shit.

951
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.530
And then everybody questioned all of our titles.

952
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:26.531
So then they went into this rape and pillage mode for about three weeks and they

953
00:51:26.961 --> 00:51:29.750
were like,
oh yeah,
this is what we could have been doing to you.
And they would,

954
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.030
that's only started doing that shit.
Like,
you know,

955
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:35.340
going for two and running up in the score and they weren't embarrassing people.

956
00:51:35.341 --> 00:51:38.820
It was the dumbest thing we could ever do by October.
Everyone was like,

957
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.560
you're not fucking embarrassing us until we played like a playoff level

958
00:51:42.561 --> 00:51:43.131
atmosphere.

959
00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:47.330
I swear to go somewhere around the cowboy game of the cult game in mid October

960
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.021
for the rest of the,

961
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:51.620
if I'm over the ravens that year with somebody sucked and we played a Monday

962
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:54.530
night football and the place was packed and people were like,

963
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:57.440
what the towel at the terrible towel thing going over they head for a fucking

964
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:00.750
like a game and no fat.
Yeah.
And they,
and they were completely out of the point.

965
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:02.760
Maybe it wasn't the ravens window completely out of the playoff picture.

966
00:52:02.761 --> 00:52:07.070
So I'm actually,
um,
I don't give a fuck about the undefeated thing.

967
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:08.750
You want the championship.
But of course.

968
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:12.350
So what I'm nervous about is like the only star we got left is Brady.

969
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:16.550
Everybody's,
everybody's out.
Yeah.
But come on,
let's be honest.
I mean,

970
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:17.990
you got my next door neighbor.

971
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:20.990
Your next door neighbor could be running cross patterns for Brady next week for

972
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:24.200
all we know.
I mean,
did I,
did anyone know Adelman?
Uh,

973
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.050
these little white guys just drive,

974
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.300
I don't even know any of these guys except for the graph.

975
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.880
I felt the same way about Magic Johnson.
Like if I ever played on the Lakers,

976
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.480
he at my age right now,
47 year old,
slow fucking white dude.

977
00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.230
If I played with magic on the showtime Lakers at the end of the game,

978
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:44.180
somehow I would have like three points.
I should have had like 12th.
Yeah.

979
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.380
Oh yeah.
Oh,
he'll set you up a,
how did it happen?
I don't know.
He was,
yeah.

980
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:48.500
And the other way everybody went to,

981
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:53.050
and then I had it and I have 3.5 other times you'd be going back down and go,

982
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.480
my bad,
my bad magic.
Yeah.
Like this.

983
00:52:56.481 --> 00:53:00.980
There's a few guys out there that I liked that.
So I got to ask as a jets fan.

984
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.330
Um,
hi.
How did you feel about the move with Rex Ryan?
Uh,

985
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.640
getting rid of him,
but did you feel like he ran the course or whatever?

986
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:10.700
Cause I think that guy's a really,
he's a really good coach.
He just,

987
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:14.120
I feel like his big thing is he hasn't had a quarterback.
Like,
yeah,

988
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:17.120
I'm Sanchez was not as good as people said he was,

989
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.580
but he's not as bad as they say.
Like I think,
you know,

990
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:23.430
I think he should be starting up a Bradford,
well,
I don't know man.
I mean he's,

991
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.560
he's got no,
it's soft.
This throws a soft.
It has,
there's no canon,
isn't it?

992
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.630
I mean,
now we've got Fitzpatrick who is too short.

993
00:53:29.631 --> 00:53:33.110
I've never seen a guy's balls get knocked down so many times.
It drives me nuts.

994
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.870
But you're right.
I mean,
but why can rex Ryan just come out and say,
yeah,

995
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:40.610
is that so bad to say?
It's like,
give me a quarterback and I'll wait.
And Man,

996
00:53:40.611 --> 00:53:43.670
I've never had even now of came into New England beat,

997
00:53:43.671 --> 00:53:47.420
you guys beat us in the playoffs in New England after we fucking killed you in

998
00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:51.500
December when it didn't fucking count.
You guys came back.
Um,
does,

999
00:53:51.501 --> 00:53:53.740
that's the thing about him.
If we meet the bills again in the playoffs,

1000
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.850
like that's in the back of my head.
I'm thinking like,
all right,

1001
00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.150
who do they got out there in Buffalo for quarterback a tie Rod Taylor.

1002
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:02.900
I looked outside there.
Yeah.
You're like,
what?
Rochester?
No,

1003
00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:06.710
I live or I said about this small town called for Donya but 45 minutes away from

1004
00:54:06.711 --> 00:54:08.660
Buffalo Dude,
I lived where I went to college.

1005
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.380
I lived down the block from my college.
Now how do you,

1006
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.890
how do you like it out there?
I,
it's a small town,
college at town.
I love it.

1007
00:54:15.891 --> 00:54:18.720
But I mean,
so I know you've got to go back.
I'll tell you real quick.
No,
no.

1008
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:22.010
I played basketball division three there.
Right,
right.

1009
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:25.340
And by my junior year I was named captain and I quit.

1010
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.170
And I remember the coach bringing me in and he's like,

1011
00:54:27.171 --> 00:54:28.400
you're making a big mistake.

1012
00:54:28.401 --> 00:54:32.420
But all the guys had played with already gone now as young kids and they didn't

1013
00:54:32.421 --> 00:54:34.790
like to drink and party on the road,
which I did.
So I was like,

1014
00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:36.200
I'm done with these guys.
Wait a minute.

1015
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.050
You were going to be captain of the team was cat and you quit cause your

1016
00:54:39.051 --> 00:54:42.110
teammates wouldn't drink and smoke with you?
Well I didn't smoke,
but yeah,

1017
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:44.960
because it's fucking awesome.
Yeah.
But they wouldn't like old school.

1018
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.500
But I'm like with division three are not on scholarship.
That dream is gone.

1019
00:54:48.501 --> 00:54:50.570
We'll go into Rochester for a weekend tournament.

1020
00:54:50.571 --> 00:54:53.240
You're not going to go out to the bar and meet Rochester,
the girls.

1021
00:54:53.241 --> 00:54:54.590
What do you it's,
so I'm a guy.

1022
00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:58.700
What are you going to play into the tarking Sunday it's done division three I'll

1023
00:54:58.701 --> 00:55:01.340
send it was six four get the memo.
Yes.

1024
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.790
So,
so my coach told me I regret it,
you know,
and I was like,
no,
I'm quitting.

1025
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.940
And I do,
I do it.

1026
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:13.160
I would literally have dreams as the years later that I was a senior dropping 40

1027
00:55:13.161 --> 00:55:14.340
points.
It was dumb.
I should,

1028
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.690
I was in such a rush to party and I didn't realize the parties never over.

1029
00:55:17.691 --> 00:55:22.250
Especially when you graduated,
you moved to the city.
So cut to 22 what?

1030
00:55:22.251 --> 00:55:25.910
Two years later by chain of events.
My wife's from this area.

1031
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.930
I have a daughter now.
She doesn't want to be in the city.
We moved back to,

1032
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:31.370
and it's the nicest town around.

1033
00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:34.940
So we moved back and then living in a big old Victorian home right around the

1034
00:55:34.941 --> 00:55:36.200
corner from my college.

1035
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.440
It's Christmas morning and I'm shoveling my driveway at 7:00 AM and a car pulls

1036
00:55:41.511 --> 00:55:44.330
up at the end of the driveway and I hear a voice go pee,
Cory,
Ellie.

1037
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.140
And the window comes down and it's my coach.
I'm like coach.
And he goes,

1038
00:55:48.141 --> 00:55:50.990
I heard you move to town.
We're going to get coffee soon.

1039
00:55:50.991 --> 00:55:55.460
And then he looks out and he goes,
merry Christmas.
I ran into Jackie and I go,

1040
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.960
<v 1>Jackie,
it was to coach.
We're going to get coffee.</v>

1041
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.150
Oh

1042
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.370
<v 0>cause he,
he never really forgave me for that.
No,</v>

1043
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:09.480
he never forgave me is now there's just the school's a d or whatever,
you know,

1044
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.800
and he's like,
oh,
we want you to come do a show for the,
for the kids and uh,

1045
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.550
will you talk to the team?
I go,

1046
00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:17.730
I'll talk to the team about not quitting because they,
everyone quits.

1047
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.250
They wanted to get a scholarship.
They didn't get a scholarship.

1048
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.500
So then they go screw this and they quit and I'm going to tell them,

1049
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.850
but was just funny man.
You know.
But I'm on the road a lot,
so it's not like,
no,

1050
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:31.600
that's what,
no,
no,
no.
Believe me,
dude.
If I was in a,
uh,

1051
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:36.430
if I was in a,
you know,
if I wasn't in this business,
I wouldn't live out here,

1052
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.730
but I actually do love it out here.
I do too.
I like those here for a year.

1053
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.430
My wife and I liked that I was getting into Boogie board and then Manhattan

1054
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:46.780
beach,
you embrace it exactly what it is.
You know,

1055
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:50.710
we're so east coast that,
you know,
eventually you're going back.
Like,

1056
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:54.190
I don't know,
maybe I will.
Maybe I won't.
But it's just like so new winco like,

1057
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.460
well,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
It depends what this drought to,

1058
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.920
we might all have to go back,
but they,
uh,

1059
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:06.600
the first time I lived in La in the late nineties,
I was like,
uh,

1060
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.890
I hated it because I wanted to be in New York.

1061
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.720
And then the next time when I came back out in like 2007 or eight when I came

1062
00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:15.850
out here,
I was like,
you know what?
I'm going to embrace it this time.

1063
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.360
I'm going to fucking high.
He can,
I'm going to again,
go out to the beach.

1064
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.060
I'm not going to the beach and to fucking pasty put like,
you know,

1065
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:25.180
I got into the helicopter thing out here.
I played pickup hockey.
I've had,

1066
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.540
I actually took the time to build the fucking life out here.
Sure.

1067
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.750
Because the first time I was,
you know,
sitting in one bedroom apartments,

1068
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:33.460
sparsely furnished,
I just was not,

1069
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.350
I was not committed to the fuck that was back when they had all the pilot season

1070
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:38.861
and all that.

1071
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:41.830
That was a big fucking jerk off every year you'd come out here and try to get on

1072
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:46.180
something.
But um,
but anyways,
to wrap it up here,
dude,
just no Christmas out here.

1073
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:49.150
That's the only thing that pissed me off.
I mean I saw one treat,

1074
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:52.960
I balled me the year I lived here,
unlike as is everybody Jewish,

1075
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:57.550
there's like no nothing.
I mean we got the Carol's going back east man.
No Man.

1076
00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.250
Well look,
you can now you can skate,
you can go skating.

1077
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.470
I don't know how they do this.
Especially with the fucking drought.

1078
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.090
Like right outside the staples center.

1079
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:06.730
You can somehow go skating and out in Santa Monica they have something like

1080
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:08.470
every year.
But uh,
if you know where to go,

1081
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:11.430
there's a place in Pasadena like this dude,

1082
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:14.590
it's like the sickest fucking houses you've ever seen where they actually have

1083
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.350
like,
oh,
they really get into it too.

1084
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:20.410
It looks like Vanderbilt Rockafella type money and they have these all these

1085
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:23.110
giant fucking trees that look like giant,

1086
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.920
giant Christmas trees and uh,
I,

1087
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:29.800
they're all fucking rich so they just pay somebody to come in with like a crane

1088
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.790
and they light up all of these so called Christmas tree row or something to,

1089
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.070
it's fucking insane.

1090
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:39.430
It's like Illuminati money and they allow you to go down this street once a
year.

1091
00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.840
Yeah.
And then you got to fucking beat it.
But the four we get out of here,

1096
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:57.991
it's streaming right now on show.com s h o.com.

1097
00:58:58.391 --> 00:59:00.210
Just click on comedy is a,

1098
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:04.960
he does an awesome podcast with Sebastian who was one of the best comics out

1099
00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:05.794
there.
Uh,

1100
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.680
who actually he must told you he lived right down the hall from me when I lived

1101
00:59:08.681 --> 00:59:12.460
in that Shitty fucking one bedroom apartment they have no man through before.

1102
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:16.090
I have a fucking,
before he ever did comedy,
I ran into him.

1103
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:20.290
He's just a Chicago guy and he goes,
hey.
He's like,
you know,

1104
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:22.820
you know Sebastian when he doesn't know.
Yeah.
He comes out and he goes,
hey,

1105
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:27.260
your ra,
your comedian,
right?
Yeah.
And I go,
yeah,
you know,
I go on,
I'm all excited.

1106
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:31.310
So we record
and he just kind of nods me into shutting up.

1107
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:34.460
Like he sort of nodded and then I just sort of got quiet again.
He goes,
yeah,

1108
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:38.330
yeah,
I seen that senior.
Uh,
yeah.
I've been thinking,
I'm thinking about doing it,

1109
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:40.500
you know,
how do you,
uh,
how do you go about that?

1110
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:43.580
And so I gave him some advice and I kind of got to know him a little bit and

1111
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:47.660
then I moved away like right after that.
And like four or five years later,

1112
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.680
I'm coming out here,

1113
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.800
same type of jerk off thing coming out here for a half hour special.

1114
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:56.390
I got to pay my own way out here.
I show up,
I go on first at the comedy store,

1115
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.840
there's five people in the fucking crowd.
I eat my balls.

1116
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.690
I'm addressing how there's only five people there and nobody's laughing.

1117
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:03.501
And then the guy was set up,

1118
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:06.650
the fucking showcase gave me shit because it was nobody there.

1119
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:11.900
He goes by two inch waist is so many times because we know there's nobody here.

1120
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:16.700
We'll listen it to the material.
I always wanted to go back in time and be like,

1121
01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:20.840
Hey,
fuck head,
don't have a fucking showcase with no people in the fucking crowd.

1122
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.340
How about that?
How about I just paid all this fucking money and I,
oh,

1123
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.130
I'm still mad about that.
Oh,
I hear you man.
So anyways,
yeah,

1124
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:32.870
so I went out there like fucking 2000 like three or four and this was like the

1125
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.490
late nineties when I saw him.
And I see this guy on stage and I'm like,

1126
01:00:37.491 --> 01:00:40.700
I recognize them,
but I can't figure out where to go.
What's this guy's name?

1127
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:42.530
And he goes,
Sebastian,
it's like,
who do I know?

1128
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:46.530
One Sebastian my whole fucking life.
And I'm looking,
going to go that said,

1129
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:50.750
fucking guy.
He's doing standup.
And that guy,

1130
01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:55.240
he did the hardest thing ever.
He started ground zero in Los Angeles.
Yeah,

1131
01:00:55.241 --> 01:00:56.480
that's like unheard of.

1132
01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:00.230
It's practically impossible and became a monster fucking comic who has an

1133
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:04.220
unbelievable work ethic and writes it in like an,
I don't know.
So anyways,

1134
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:08.000
Pete does a show with them on riot cast is called the Pete and Sebastian show on
