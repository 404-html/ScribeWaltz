Where were you?
Good bye.

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.490

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.180
So you either getting your money today,
you're getting it tomorrow,
right?

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.110
We all know you're going to be broke by Tuesday,
right?
Wednesday walking around.

11
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.880
You know what your brown bag,

12
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.520
you got to bring a fucking lunch cause you got no money for fucking

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.940
to go out to the roach coach.
Hey,

14
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:53.360
you packed a lunch aid on front.
Eat healthy.
You're broke,
aren't you?
Yeah.

15
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.790
Um,
I can't believe the fucking money I used to blow when I was a kid.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.790
I used to make 260 bucks a week,
right?
My only expense.

17
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.810
I had a car payment,
130 $838 and 62 cents I still remember it.

18
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320
And uh,
that was it.

19
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.460
And gas that was making 260 bucks.
And I was,
that was my take home,

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.270
260 bucks a week.
Right.
So what's that?

21
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:24.110
860 times four is two 40 hours a week over grand a month.

22
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:28.280
Then I'd be fucking broke every Wednesday.
Fucking idiot.

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.920
I swear to God.
If I was a miser,
I might as well have been a miser.

24
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.190
This what the fuck I should have done.

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.030
<v 1>Tell him he was going out in the clubs and crushing it.</v>

27
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.270
Coming out with my fucking orange Afro.
Hey ladies.

28
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.950
I mean it was a shit show.
It was Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.

29
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.840
It was like Atlanta trying to win a champion job.
Come on bill.

30
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.870
Come on.
The new Cleveland Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.760
all of a sudden Cleveland wins a fucking basketball championship and the entire

32
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.560
countries and kill the cubs won.

33
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.590
How nervous were you down there in La and Atlanta?
You know what I mean?
Atlanta,

34
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.220
I can't even say it this morning.
Atlanta,
Atlanta.

35
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:17.780
How fucking nervous were you?
Cleveland wins.
You're like,
Oh shit,

36
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.070
all we got left the cubs,
you know,

37
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.890
maybe if the Indians were,
and then they went to champions.

38
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.750
Cleveland winds two championships in a year.

39
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.440
The cubs is still the fucking sad sacks and like 108 years or whatever.

40
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.320
And then they went three in a row.

41
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.630
The cubs winning alien tires,
sporting world just stops,

42
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
turns around and stares at Atlanta Quiver and over in the corner.

43
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:50.150
Like,
hey guys,
you know,
for the record,
the Braves one at 95

44
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.870
it's got to count for something.
Right?
Oh,

45
00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:00.550
those poor bastards.
You know,
I just connected in a,

46
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.270
I connected in with the fuck was I in,

47
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.271
I'm in Atlanta and I saw this woman walking by and she had on a falcons hat and

48
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.940
I was like,
you know what,
good for,

49
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.120
there's a real fan still wearing the Atlanta shit.
Right?
And it was a red hat.

50
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.750
But then I also noticed that she was wearing red sneakers,

51
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.890
you know what I mean?
And she,
then,
she was also African American.
And I was just,

52
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.630
and I just assumed she didn't give a fuck.

53
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.040
I learned that from Patrice O'neil the first time I saw him with like an

54
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.340
islanders had on,
right.
I was like,
aw,
fuck man,
you liked the islanders.

55
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.710
He was like,
what?
I go,
you liked the islanders.

56
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.370
And he took off his hat and looked at it goes,
Nah,
man,
don't give a shit.
I go,

57
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.660
he goes,
I just liked the colors.
He had these pair of fucking,

58
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.670
I only is covered colored shoes,
sneakers on.
He told me,
say,
Bill,

59
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.070
black people don't give a fuck about,
I mean,
I might say Jamaica,
you know,

60
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.300
here we go.
The white guy.

61
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.930
I got to fucking make sure I fucking say this correctly.
He was saying,

62
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.450
generally speaking,
we were the shit because of colors.
It's not neat,
you know?

63
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.060
And he joked,
he just fuck it.
Yeah.
He trashed me all the fucking time.

64
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.760
So anyway,
so I looked at her and I did that.

65
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.580
Patrice conversation just popped into my fucking head and I was just like,

66
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.300
as she probably just thought we just needed a hat to go with those fucking shoes

67
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.120
as opposed to white people were the same fucking hat forever.

68
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:20.590
It's all frayed and shit.

69
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.770
Walking around with your cargo pants and your flip flops.

70
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
I don't think I'll ever get over fucking northern Florida.
I know,

71
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:30.130
I've heard a zillion jokes about it,
but Jesus fucking Christ,

72
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.690
Jesus fucking Christ,
there are some characters out there.

73
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.990
<v 1>And what's amazing is it's absolutely gorgeous.</v>

75
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.010
And then there's people with like beautiful homes in money,
but they're there.

76
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.410
I swear to God,
is it me?
There's no middle class.

77
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.760
It's like when you go to a third world country,
it's just like this,

78
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.230
just fucking people living in this crazy poverty and then they'll just be,

79
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:57.960
there's a mansion.
I Dunno.

80
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.330
Anyway,
well,
you know,

81
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:04.830
probably didn't help that I fucking went to the Daytona 500 bunch of Yahoos like

82
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:09.780
me.
And by the way,
I fit right in.
I fucking fit right in the,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

83
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.940
I dunno,
I should be more white collar.
But,
uh,

84
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.440
due to some financial reasons,
I had a very fucking,
yeah,
I'm,

85
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:22.020
I'm pretty much a put it this way.
I,
it was,

86
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.270
it wasn't until he hung around with a bunch of a poetry stories here.

87
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.320
I wasn't telling hung up with Patrice that I realized that macaroni and cheese

88
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:29.340
wasn't a main dish.

89
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.370
We,
you Sam,
all of that shit,

90
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.560
macaroni and cheese with toast was a meal and I fucking loved it.

91
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.710
Get half a tray just scooping that shit out was a craft.

92
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.780
I've told you to talk to you guys about this chicken Alec King on toast.

93
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.390
Chipped beef on toast.
I fucking hated that shit.

94
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:56.130
Chicken out of the king was also gross.
Um,
those are the,
yeah.

95
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:59.680
You know,
in mother's fucking work and she comes home,
she's got 90 kids,

96
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.850
opens up a couple of cans,
throws it in the pot and make some toast.

97
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.790
Fucking animals.

98
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.680
Um,
anyways.
Okay.

99
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.000
Chef Boyardee
you know,
when I think back to this is important that we,

100
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.570
we didn't know anything about fucking nutrition back then.
TV.

101
00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:24.520
We weren't never really big on the TV dinners.

102
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.320
And I remember I used to ask my mother to get him.

103
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:28.000
I just think that there was something,

104
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:32.280
I don't what the fuck was called Hungry Jack's or some shit.
Something.

105
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.580
I had jack in it.
It sounded manly.
You know the commercials is all,
you know,

106
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:41.020
big chunks in Turkey with gravy,
mashed potatoes and I was sitting there going,

107
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.060
Alice looks,
that looks fucking delicious.

108
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.270
<v 1>I Dunno.
We just never,
we never,
we weren't,
we never,
we didn't,</v>

110
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.310
we didn't cross that line with the fast food.
You know,

111
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.090
I'm a mistake.
And so those were my favorites.

112
00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:58.200
I'd be sitting and I would be sitting not paying attention in the last three

113
00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:01.560
periods of school when I was in a middle school,
junior high,

114
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:02.400
whatever the fuck you call it,

115
00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:05.850
just thinking about the stake of note I was going to make when I got home.

116
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.360
That's all I gave a fellow.
That was a game changer.
You know,

117
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.050
kid from the seventies eighties you know,
he came home,
your parents weren't home,

118
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:14.880
right.
Latch key kid,
you come home.

119
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.770
The game changer was when you went from making something just room temperature

120
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:22.980
or cold to actually getting the,
you know,

121
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.750
the next level.
It's like moving up and like a,
you know,

122
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.420
army ranks is Scientology,
whatever.

123
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:34.380
We get to a new level of security clearance.
Okay.

124
00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:39.030
You can use the fucking frying pan and all of a sudden you had a fucking hot

125
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:43.710
meal.
I used to cook those fuckers up,

126
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.930
put them on white bread and then you had to eat it real quick because the
grease,

127
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.020
there was so much fucking Greece from whatever cut of meat.
Was it squirrel?

128
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.280
I didn't know what the fuck it was.

129
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.410
It was such a shit cut up meat that the grease would just be coming through the

130
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.670
bread.
It was,
it was fucking gross push.
You put ketchup on it and shit.

131
00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:06.770
Sorry if I'm grossing.
Yeah,
let me get off the subject.
Uh Oh,

132
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.820
I gotta.
I got dress all the fucking who and whom police.
Oh my God.

133
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.850
That's like a whole cult within itself.

134
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.310
The level of fucking arrogance that people came and the joy that they had that
I,

135
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.120
that I'm not good at who and home you would think that you could actually make

136
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:28.680
money off of that.
Like they had a hot stock tip,
but some shit,

137
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.970
hey,
this fucking company is going to go public.
He didn't hear from me.

138
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.730
This is one thing that I learned.
I think I finally figured out,

139
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:38.070
because people told me this trick before,

140
00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:43.071
it's like if you could substitute he or she use who you know him or her use

141
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.120
home,
so I'm like,

142
00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:50.121
to whom do I have the pleasure of speaking to and I'm like to him,

143
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.340
I have the pleasure.

144
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.630
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.100
<v 1>of speaking with.
I wouldn't say that.
That's what,
that doesn't work too.</v>

146
00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.830
She do.
I have the pleasure of speaking.
Yeah,

147
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.940
like I don't fucking get it,
but then it's like,
no,
who are you speaking to?

148
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.140
You would say to him,
to her.
Then I was like,
oh,
that's what they mean.

149
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.800
I thought the,
I thought you just meant take out who are home and plug in.

150
00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:15.634
He or she

151
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.060
who did this shit,
he did this shit.
I get it.
I think I just got it.

152
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.860
I think I finally cracked the fucking code.

153
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.410
But here's the deal with who and what's the deal.

154
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.500
Here's the deal with that shit.

155
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.420
Nobody says whom out loud unless you teaching an English class.

156
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.000
No one says that.

157
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.040
Right?
It's always who,
who the fuck do I?
You know?

158
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.420
<v 1>It's not.
To whom am I speaking was like,
who the fuck am I talking to?
Oh,</v>

160
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:54.670
the fuck are you
to home?

161
00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.490
Am I fucking speaking with?

162
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

163
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.360
<v 1>You speaking to fucking him.
That's why you said fuck it home.
Oh,
right.</v>

164
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.190
Thanks Jerry.
Nobody says it out loud,
but it's one of those things if you,

165
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:11.720
if you don't write it correctly,

166
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.333
<v 0>yeah.</v>

167
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.340
<v 1>People flipped the fuck out and they judge you like you're a fucking moron.</v>

168
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.320
But I've never heard anybody,
you know,
that's,

169
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.410
that's another one that's,
that's another like security level.
You go past.

170
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.120
If you start out loud using the not not writing.

171
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.770
Okay.

172
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.770
Speaking and you use the word whom like you've alienated probably 80% of the

173
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.480
population of my country.

174
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.740
And I don't think that there's a bigger example of the gap between wealth and

175
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:52.270
regular people then using whom in public.
I always picture that.
I

176
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.041
know,

177
00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:57.010
you know something even that cause there's people that fucking rob and steal

178
00:10:57.011 --> 00:11:01.720
their way into the upper 1% and then they just a fucking dope like me still.

179
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.070
But if you're born,
if you're born into that shit,

180
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:08.140
if you get some trust fund hanging over your head,

181
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:11.050
if you're one of those kids and you have to learn how to fence,

182
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.700
take a fencing fucking class in college to show that you're a gentlemen,

183
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.983
you know,

184
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.240
do you walk around to you date rape drug in your pocket?

185
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.020
Does your dad knows a judge and can get you off and you wear loafers with no

186
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.230
socks,
right?
There's a bunch of stereotypes.
Um,

187
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.160
I was speaking to that me and he had gotten this fucking monster debate last

188
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.250
night.
She take this show,
she goes,

189
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.040
she goes,
Hey,
I take this show.
It's about rappers in Paris.

190
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.650
You know,
you ought to check this out.
So I was like,
all right,

191
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:51.120
I'm going to watch this shit.
Right.
So immediately this show when these guys,

192
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:55.410
and they're rapping and French,
I don't know what say it.
So you know,

193
00:11:55.411 --> 00:11:58.800
I'm trying to read the words.
I'm a dope.
It's going by too fast.

194
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.290
But it sounds a lot like,
you know,

195
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:05.400
it's the same sort of point of view as a lot of rappers over here,

196
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.030
which I am in a the minority group.
I'm getting treated like shit.

197
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.590
I'm living in the shittiest part of the fucking city.
A lot of that stuff.
Right.

198
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.620
But it's flying by because I can't read fast enough.

199
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.780
So they got this fucking nerdy white kid goes to interview this dude,
um,

200
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.830
who's Muslim and he's living in some part in Paris.
Right.

201
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.750
And he's talking about all of this stuff that's happening to them now.
Right.

202
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.550
And uh,
no,
the first thing you talked about,

203
00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.760
he said that he was talking about how um,

204
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.900
he said thank God that he found,
you know,
rap and he did that,
cause you know,

205
00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:44.420
he could've gone the other way.
He said,
I could've become a bomb.

206
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.580
That's what he said.
So the white dude goes like,
oh,
you mean like,
you know,

207
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.950
you would have blown some people up or something like that.

208
00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:54.770
And then the dude's basically like,
I knew you were going to take it that way.

209
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.090
That's not how I meant it.
That's really offensive.
And I,
you know,

210
00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:00.320
and he's speaking through an interpreter,

211
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.630
tell him if he's going to come down here and talk to people,

212
00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.730
he needs to check the way he's talking to people,
blah,
blah.

213
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.480
And I'm just sitting there going like,
you totally set him up for that.

214
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.870
That was like fucking a trap.
But what do you think?
He's going to think?

215
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.020
So Nia goes,
well,
he's not doing that.

216
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

217
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.320
<v 1>So you know,
he gets judged because of those actions of the few of the few.</v>

218
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.860
And it's just like,
I understand that.
I totally understand that.

219
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.760
But at some point you have to address the fucking elephant in the room,

220
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:33.260
don't you?
You know?

221
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:34.580
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

222
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.271
<v 1>Like when people,</v>

223
00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:39.260
like when I travel outside of this country and people treat me like shit because

224
00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:42.620
I'm an American,
I don't act like that just fell out of the sky.

225
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.000
I know where that's coming from.

226
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.720
The appear realistic way that we've colonized the entire fucking world.

227
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.100
The amount of time we've,

228
00:13:49.101 --> 00:13:52.430
we've sided with dictators because they've given us fucking oil.

229
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.830
Is there a Preston their own PD?

230
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.330
The amount of times we've been on the wrong fucking side of shit.

231
00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.470
It's like Anna walk around like,
well,
I didn't do it.
It's like,
you know,

232
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.420
as much as it's still wrong to judge me,

233
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.620
I understand that when I walk out of the House,
I'm no longer me anymore.

234
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.280
It's teams.
It's like red sox and Yankees.
Okay.
And you're,

235
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.710
and you're fucking the hat,

236
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:17.480
the team hat you're wearing is you skin.
Okay.

237
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.330
And people are going to judge you for that.
You know,

238
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.700
back when I had here and I came walking down the street looking like fucking

239
00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:27.440
Richie Cunningham,
you know,

240
00:14:27.441 --> 00:14:31.340
I knew that people were looking at me like that.
You know,

241
00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:35.810
like fuck it dude,
dude dude didn't do and I can take this kid's lunch money.

242
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.260
Look at his fucking hair
doesn't make it right.

243
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.580
Absolutely does not make it right but like to sit there and act like you don't

244
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:47.490
know where shit is coming from.
That's what drives me nuts.

245
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.970
And it's like I completely understand that on my side to have empathy for that

246
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:53.841
guy.

247
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:57.920
But what was pissing me off was there was no empathy coming from the other side

248
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.510
being like,
listen,
I understand.
You know,

249
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.060
cause there was no understanding of that,

250
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.360
that wrapper that this guy is totally on the outside looking in.

251
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.370
So he's going to come from this fear based fucking thing that he,
you know,

252
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:17.330
from the shift that he sees in the media and the media is basically you get

253
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.790
judged all groups of people,

254
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.820
you get judged by the Jerry Springer fucking group of your people.

255
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.510
That's basically it.
So with white people were either living in a trailer,

256
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.040
fucking our sister,

257
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.450
or were these lizard people shape shifters that live under a fucking mountain.

258
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.130
Illuminati is essentially it,
right?
There's a law,

259
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.170
there's a zillion of them were wearing a fucking hate group.

260
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.760
We're in the fucking Klan.
We,
yeah,

261
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:46.610
we got a four wheeler with shooting a gun or whatever.
Right?

262
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.310
And you got all those fucking stereotypes,
um,

263
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.430
which obviously is not a fair fucking thing.

264
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.210
And I also understand that despite those stereotypes,

265
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:59.390
the Matrix is made for white people.
So I,
despite those,

266
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:04.280
it really doesn't affect my life and I get all of that type of shit.
But I mean,

267
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.340
I don't know,
I just needed that guy in the moment to just be like,
you know what?

268
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.020
I understand why you said that.
You know,

269
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:12.560
rather than just immediately go into lecture mode because then when you're

270
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:16.190
sitting at home,
I don't know if you're like me,
I just plugged myself in.
Well,

271
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:19.850
who would I be in that scenario?
I'd be that guy getting a lecture.

272
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:21.320
So I just started saying all this shit.

273
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:25.130
I would've said back to him and it drove my fucking wife up the wall.
She's like,

274
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:29.810
why can't you just watch things?
It's like,
you know,
what do you mean,

275
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:30.441
why can't I,

276
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:35.441
the TV's interacted to me the same shit I do when I watch wheel of fortune and I

277
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:40.640
make fun of every contestant and you sitting there laughing your ass off and I

278
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:43.490
turned it into this like a comedy show.

279
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.660
You then get mad at me when I do the same fucking thing when I'm watching this

280
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:52.040
other shit.
And so we just made a truce.
It's like,
don't,

281
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.370
I don't want to watch any,

282
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.680
any shit with you that has to do with this stuff

283
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.560
because we're going to end up in a fucking argument because I'm going to act

284
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:04.820
like I'm watching wheel of fortune.

285
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.130
Um,
anyways,
why is this thing bing bang in Bowman and all that type of shit.

286
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.240
You know,
having said all that,

287
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.850
I completely understood where that guy was coming from.
It's like,
yeah,

288
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:20.630
I didn't do any of that shit.
You know,
I'm trying to get the fuck outta here.

289
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.670
I've lived in this country my whole life and I never felt like it was mine.

290
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.950
Okay.
Which is,
you know,
and this is the arrogant thing that I'm going to do,

291
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:33.390
not even living over there.
I'm going to chastise white people like,

292
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.020
cause we do it here.
You can't do that to people.

293
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:40.400
You can't have people living in the country their whole fucking lives and the

294
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.760
hour American,
they are French and all that.
You cannot treat them like,
yeah,

295
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:47.330
but you know,
you know,
you're not real American American.
It's like,

296
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:51.980
well fucking neither were you then you're European or whatever the fuck you're

297
00:17:51.981 --> 00:17:56.180
from.
Um,
so I don't,
I'm not,
I'm not a fucking,

298
00:17:56.181 --> 00:17:59.330
I like to think I'm not a fucking bad guy.
I get all of that type of shit.

299
00:17:59.331 --> 00:18:02.420
But Jesus Christ at some point,
you know,

300
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.310
like I,

301
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:10.310
I used to joke right after nine 11 and they started racially profiling Arabs and

302
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:14.120
all that,
which was completely fucked up.
And I understood it,

303
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:16.610
but I never heard it.
Like I just always looked at it like,
all right,

304
00:18:16.611 --> 00:18:20.570
if 20 redheads knocked down some skyscrapers,
you know,

305
00:18:20.571 --> 00:18:23.150
I'd expect to be getting some looks the next day at the airport.

306
00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:25.450
Does it make it right?
But I wouldn't be sitting there going up.

307
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.710
I completely understand where this is coming from and I don't like it because

308
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.060
I'm an innocent guy,

309
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.470
but I would have the empathy to at least address where the fear is coming from.

310
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.680
And it's,
I think that if you just fucking do that,

311
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.210
the other side can just relax and maybe listen to your point.

312
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

313
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.070
<v 1>You know,</v>

314
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.220
because that's what happened to me when I watched that and I watched that kid

315
00:18:49.221 --> 00:18:52.490
all of a sudden get a lecture after that guy said I'd turned my s I could've

316
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.360
become a bomb.

317
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.560
And I just felt he set the fucking kid up and then I immediately went into

318
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:01.820
defense mode defending that kid and I knew and I didn't even at that point sit

319
00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:04.880
and listen to what this guy had to say.
So then I didn't learn anything.

320
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

321
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.050
<v 1>I would equate that to like,
you know,
when people make,
try to make a point,</v>

322
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:14.100
like when people are trying to teach me who and whom.
So much of it started with,

323
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.400
hey fuck head,
maybe you should try Bubbleq um,

324
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.220
how do I get past?
Hey fuck it.

325
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.040
I don't know.
I like to think that there was a decent point made in there.

326
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.730
I'm sure I'll get a bunch of shit for that.
But um,
either way,

327
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:33.780
it was an interesting debate,
you know,
hey,

328
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:37.960
I bought those fucking Boston Celtics upbeat,
the Cleveland Cavaliers,

329
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.770
what God's name is a cavalier.

330
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:43.770
There's probably some fucking fancy name for white oppressor.

331
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.040
Wait a second,
Kev.

332
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.020
I know you can act cavalier cavalier attitude.

333
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.740
Can you ever have a cavalier attitude and it's like a fucking,
like a good thing.

334
00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.500
Cavalier is like,

335
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.590
that's like a happy go lucky upper 1% or you know what I mean?

336
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.640
Like if they were broke,
they'd be,

337
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:10.720
they'd be oop Taylor with the fucking stick over their shoulder with the little

338
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.500
little fish hook on it.
You know,
just going to go skip some rocks.

339
00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:15.550
But all of a sudden,
you know,

340
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.250
if you cavalier and you're in the upper 1% is a white dude.
That means a,
I dunno,

341
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.800
it's a bunch of kids digging for fucking,
um,
diamonds.
I don't fucking,

342
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.250
let me look at this.
Okay hottie disdainful.
I,
cause I was Ron Hardy,
disdainful

343
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.810
or supercilious.
I don't know what that word is.

344
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.960
An arrogant and cavalier attitude towards other offhand

345
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.090
Cleveland Cavaliers.
He's,
is it anything,
it's gotta be something else.

346
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.950
Yeah.
Are they really the Cleveland arrogant constants?

347
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.350
I would think they named themselves.
It can't be,
that's it's to a horseman.

348
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.000
There it is.
Especially a mounted soldier a night.

349
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.780
Yeah.
Oppressive,
oppressive wire.
White Guy.
Uh,

350
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.350
one having this spirit or bearing of a night,

351
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.220
a courtly gentleman Galleon,

352
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.800
these guys are arrogant.
Huh?

353
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.160
A man escorting a woman or acting as their partner in dancing.

354
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.750
All right.
We're slowly getting to the NBA lifestyle here.

355
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.200
They're coming out of the shower and all the horrors hanging out,

356
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.960
waiting to get him his fucking magic.
Johnson used to say,

357
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.430
you've got chastised for that.
These women,
they're out to get you after the show.

358
00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.440
Oh,
that's offensive to women,
not the horse.
That's who I was talking about.

359
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:39.970
Sweetheart,
go back to your soccer mom cave with your red wine.
Thank you.

360
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.080
Um,
in the okay.

361
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.590
And adherent of an adherent of Charles,

362
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:50.380
the first of England and his contest with the problem.

363
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.770
It's amazing that I speak this language and there's so many words that I've just

364
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:58.030
never seen before and have no idea how to pronounce.
All right.

365
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.320
As an adjective hottie disdainful.
And that's super Cylus.

366
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:06.340
Whatever the fuck that is offhand,
that's a good name for a fucking dance.

367
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:08.290
Like when those meatpacking district dance clubs,

368
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.620
I got to go down in the SIF has fell off last night.

369
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.180
I'm [inaudible] girlfriend totally fucking now.

370
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.940
And their parents like,
I'm not against you.

371
00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:21.510
I don't have to transplant all right offhand or unceremonious

372
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.830
of or relating to the Cavaliers.

373
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.330
But that's a fucking lazy definition of relating to a characteristic of the

374
00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:34.470
cavalier poets or their work or I don't know what a cavalier is.

375
00:22:34.471 --> 00:22:39.270
This is either a gentlemen a night,
a poet,

376
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.960
or a cunt.
You know,
one of the other,

377
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.240
I guess it depends if you live in Cleveland or not.

378
00:22:45.241 --> 00:22:49.620
They probably think they're a bunch of gentlemen.
They're not yet at animals.
Oh,

379
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:53.040
those.
That's a special kind of animal that lives up there in Cleveland.

380
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.933
You know what I mean?

381
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.660
You know why that Lake caught on fire?
It wasn't the lake.
It was very,

382
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.020
you know what it was because so many of those animals walked into at bay.

383
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.243
That's what happened.

384
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.450
They took that beautiful water that God may and they turned it into something

385
00:23:13.821 --> 00:23:16.760
flammable.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah.

386
00:23:16.761 --> 00:23:19.400
They always say the mistake by the lake and they always say that Lake Erie

387
00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:23.840
caught on fire.
It didn't catch on fire.
It was,
it was way more understandable.

388
00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:26.990
It was like a,
I think it was a whatever the,
the runoff,

389
00:23:26.991 --> 00:23:29.990
they went into the city and they were just dumping all their pollution into it.

390
00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:33.560
They didn't light a great lake on fire.
Um,

391
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.400
<v 2>yeah.</v>

392
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.960
<v 1>I don't know.
But now with all that fracking,
the fracking down the road,</v>

393
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.260
shit,
I go to get my God damn above ground pool.

394
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:47.610
Next thing you know I'm having a fucking,
except I'm the main course.

395
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.430
So are we understand that a,
you are upset,

396
00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:55.240
but we don't feel that our company has anything to do with your above ground

397
00:23:55.241 --> 00:23:58.110
pool catching on fire.
Oh fuck you and your soup.

398
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.790
Um,
all right,
let's read some advertising here for this week.
Dirty Lemon.

399
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.200
It sounds the only stupid fucking jokes and the dirty Sanchez.

400
00:24:08.201 --> 00:24:12.310
You know those fucking joke book jokes and everybody seems to love for fucking

401
00:24:12.311 --> 00:24:16.780
me.
And it's when you fucking take a piece of road beef,
slap her in the tent,

402
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.820
then you come on her foot.
Oh,
is that what it's called?
Doing those jokes.

403
00:24:21.821 --> 00:24:24.390
He's got called the get the fuck outta here.

404
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.780
Cause I don't wanna hear any more of these stupid he'd get rid of.
He moved it

405
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.320
to rub one out and just fucking relax with your knock.
Knock Dick Jokes.

406
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.220
All right.
Dirty Lemon.

407
00:24:36.221 --> 00:24:40.810
Dirty lemon is a wellness beverage brand featuring ingredients that have been

408
00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:45.040
well established in the,
Oh God.
Here's another English word.

409
00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:46.270
I can say a nat,

410
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.050
nat natural pathic community nature pathic

411
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.640
naturopathic
knit Toora paddock.

412
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.810
Anyway,
so there's three types of these fucking things right now.
Sleep,

413
00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:04.260
detox in skin plus hair.
Oh Shit.
I might get some of this.

414
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.070
And each one contains the juice of one lemon,
no sugar,

415
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.940
and it's under 10 calories.
I have no idea what the fuck this stuff is.

416
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.660
Their sleep drink,
for example,
includes magnesium.

417
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.800
Was there anything grosser than milk of magnesium when you were a kid?

418
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.590
You meet some milk of magnesium.
It came in that blue bottle.

419
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

420
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.790
<v 1>What was I supposed to do?
Coat your esophagus.</v>

421
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.170
Was that for a fucking sword?
Swallower um,

422
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.790
put me in a lot of that backstage at the circus and he should,

423
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.270
one contains the juice of one lemon.
No sugar is under 10 calories.

424
00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:44.010

571
00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:34.220
stuff when I was in Gainesville,
Georgia.

572
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.180
I sent it to my podcast guy who's now going to edit it.

I'm going to start doing those city tours again.

579
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.930
I'm going to make little stupid videos.

580
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.620
I'm going to get that fucking thing going.
Speaking of which,

581
00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:07.910
I'm going to be in Phoenix this week,
Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday,

582
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:12.170
flying in Sunday night to see the fucking Celtics,
Isaiah Thomas.

583
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.460
I'm against the Phoenix Suns there on Sunday night.

584
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.180
I'll see you guys at the game.
Um,
oh,
I'd also like to thank uh,

585
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.440
some people at the Tampa Bay lightening for hooking mean forest shop with some

586
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:24.831
tickets.

587
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:29.831
We got to see a Nikita coop giraffe get a hat trick against the auto was

588
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:34.670
senators.
There was a great fucking game,
great fucking game.
You know,

589
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.780
Tampa,

590
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.430
Tampa Bay came out and it was like they will fucking owning them and then all of

591
00:35:39.431 --> 00:35:42.820
a sudden auto what goes,
hey,
easy.
They're easy.
They're,

592
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.430
and then they took control of the game and then after the fucking,

593
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.360
the first intermission,
I don't know what,

594
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.920
I don't know what sort of a third time adjustments that they used.

595
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:55.450
It's not half time for all you non hockey fans who tried to say that there's two

596
00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:58.930
halftime's in hockey,
you know that always makes me feel smart.
I'm like,

597
00:35:58.931 --> 00:36:00.430
mathematically that doesn't make sense.

598
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.450
There's a third and then there's two thirds through the game and if you ever

599
00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:07.060
played pickup hockey three on fucking three,

600
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.930
if you've ever fucking done that and you look any,
there's no substitutions.

601
00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:13.870
You know why you would know why they take two breaks.
Okay.

602
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

603
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.460
<v 1>Then I fucking lolly gagging around like a bunch of baseball players and they</v>

604
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:23.220
just need to stretch once every seven 30 very sprinting.

605
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.990
Someone could beat the shit out of you and just sit down for five minutes.
Okay.

606
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.240
You're going to need to take a couple of breaks.
All right,

607
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:31.650
let's talk gas monkey garage.

608
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.193
<v 4>MMM.</v>

609
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.100
<v 1>Uh,
Monday night's episode was the episode that they've been teasing the whole,</v>

610
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.140
the whole fucking season.

611
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.100
The shit that you read about on social media before the season even started.

612
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.990
The bearded wonder Aaron Kaufman came back from vacation.

613
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:50.943
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

614
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.790
<v 1>He fucking just,
he's straight up quit.
It wasn't,</v>

615
00:36:55.791 --> 00:36:59.210
he didn't give notice.
Say I'll help you on a couple of builds.
He was just like,

616
00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:03.290
I am out.
It's been a great run.
I'll fucking see you later.

617
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.080
<v 4>And uh,</v>

618
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.010
<v 1>can Richard Rollins as always was hilarious.
It's like,</v>

619
00:37:09.011 --> 00:37:10.030
I feel like I'm gonna Puke.

620
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.203
<v 0>Yes.</v>

621
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.001
<v 1>Can you go?
Oh,</v>

622
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:19.260
he's only said that a few times during the series and it's always fucking

623
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:22.120
hilarious cause I feel like the word puke is kind of,

624
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.560
that's like from my generation.
Like he graduated the high school the same year.

625
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.390
I watched the show a lot.
I'm not a psycho,

626
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:31.680
but he even mentions all the time he built that fucking,
that mercury comet.

627
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.240
You mentioned that he graduated high school in 87 and,
uh,

628
00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:38.790
I should have graduated in [inaudible] 86 but we're not going to talk white.

629
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.430
Why I didn't because I'm a cause you cause you're hurt because you hear me read

630
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:44.730
out loud.
It should have happened in 86 it was,
I think I'm a year older than him,

631
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.130
but Puca just feel like nobody says that.
I never hear it.
I don't hear it enough.

632
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:53.940
And he's only said it a couple times.
He said it la,
uh,

633
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.580
on Monday when Aaron quit feel like going to puke.

634
00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.140
And he said it when he bought that Ferrari that had been in that major accident

635
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.190
and it was like,
he's big,
this giant investment,
like 300 grand.

636
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:07.790
He went in with the other,
the fucking rich dude up the street and Lex,

637
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:10.530
all the European stuff.
I don't know why.
I can't remember his name.

638
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:14.430
I only seen him and fucking 9,000 episodes and afterwards he was just,

639
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:18.690
he was so fucking nervous.
He was talking about,
cause I feel like I'm gonna Puke.

640
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.550
I Dunno why.
It always makes me laugh.
So anyways,
um,

641
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.280
<v 0>okay.</v>

642
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.530
<v 1>As a fan of the show,
you know,
it was like watching van Halen breakup.
It's like,</v>

643
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.150
oh fuck,
now they're going to bring in,
you know,

644
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.700
some other guy who wasn't David Lee Roth,
not shitting on Hagar,
you know,

645
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.620
I'm just saying,
you know what I mean,
you like the [inaudible] the original guys.

646
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:45.621
So I was actually happy that they stay for the rest of the episode.

647
00:38:45.771 --> 00:38:50.590
So they was showing Aaron at his house and he was doing this build.

648
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.180
It was fucking hilarious and everything fit engine went in,
transmission,

649
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:58.570
everything fucking winded fine.
Um,

650
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.130
and then he just got up and took a break and went over and was feeding his

651
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:06.790
horses and I'm just like,
oh,
there you go.
Although when he was,
you know,

652
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.490
he was trying to make this race car and he was taking all this shit out,

653
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.470
you know,
that they don't need so he can make it lighter,

654
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.220
watching him have to do that by himself.
I bet that kind of sucked.
But,
um,

655
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.150
I'm just hoping as a fan that Aaron gets his own shows because I'd read a really

656
00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:26.470
good interview and it wasn't all this he said,

657
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:27.251
she said Shit,

658
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:32.251
it just seemed like he wanted to do more adventure is builds of cars that,

659
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.120
you know,
when you're not on a TV show,
you know what I mean?

660
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:38.390
You're kind of under the constraint.

661
00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:40.200
He was just saying how fast they will build cars,

662
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.180
kind of limited what they could do.
And a,

663
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.460
I think that that was probably the reason why he left.

664
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.640
Just got a little burnt out or whatever.
But,
um,

665
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:50.710
<v 4>okay.</v>

666
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:55.490
<v 1>It's fucking brutal man.
I mean that was the guy.
So we'll see what happens.
But</v>

667
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.340
I have faith,

668
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.070
I have faith that they're going to find someone to replace him and I'm hoping

669
00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:02.570
that I'm going to get two shows out of it.
Yeah.

670
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.313
<v 4>MMM.</v>

671
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:10.180
<v 1>I Dunno,
but whatever.
It's definitely the end of,
of a Goddamn era.</v>

672
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.070
And,
uh,
I'm trying to think of my,

673
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.080
my favorite builds that they've done on that show.
Um,

674
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.250
I always liked the random shit that they did.
Like,

675
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:25.150
I've mentioned this before,
I love when they did that low rider and I don't,

676
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:28.840
can't remember if it was one of those like a 85 Oldsmobile cutlass or something.

677
00:40:28.841 --> 00:40:32.980
I love that they just gave Casey a chance to fucking show off what he could do.

678
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.780
And he was showing all that different kind of,

679
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:37.310
instead of just painting it black or green.
Um,

680
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.860
but I understand that they always say,
you know,

681
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:42.670
those are the two colors that sell and you got to make you fucking money.
But um,

682
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.980
there was another time they built this car,

683
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:49.000
can't remember what it was and it was this white car and on top Casey did this

684
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:52.840
lace thing on the hood and I'm gonna sorry on the roof.

685
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:55.990
I fucking love that.
Um,

686
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.650
then they have a fucking Lincoln Continental.

687
00:41:00.651 --> 00:41:05.510
I've always loved the random shit as opposed to the,
uh,
the more obvious stuff.

688
00:41:05.511 --> 00:41:09.020
I love that fucking mercury comment that they made,
although I got to tell you,

689
00:41:09.021 --> 00:41:12.770
I like the fucking white and blue color scheme better when they first had it and

690
00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:13.940
I liked those rims better.

691
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:17.390
But if they just did all the gas monkey shit underneath it and slammed it down

692
00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:22.010
to the ground,
that's a fucking killer car.
I don't know.
I like weird shit.

693
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.913
Um,

694
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.920
and my biggest heartbreak on that show was one time when Richard Rollins blot

695
00:41:27.921 --> 00:41:32.120
that fucking cab over engine truck,
that jeepers creepers truck.
And I was like,

696
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:35.030
oh my God,
what the are they going to do to this?
And then he just,

697
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:37.880
somebody came in like,
the next day I'll give you an extra two grand for,

698
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:40.660
he's like,
I fucking get outta here.
And I was just like,
what the Huh?

699
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.930
I want to see them build more trucks.
I hope they do.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

700
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:52.340
Uh,
so good luck to Aaron Kaufman.
I hope I see him on another TV show.

701
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:57.080
Whatever I should give a shout out to is,
um,
he's got,
um,
he has his own,

702
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.740
he's got his own,
uh,
um,
company that gets it,
builds parts for,
believe it or not,

703
00:42:02.741 --> 00:42:07.420
Ford f 100 hundreds.
What?
I have 68 FordF 100,
and I believe it's called,

704
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.010
I think it's called arc light.
Just look up Aaron Kaufman,
arc light,

705
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.500
and you'll actually find that article.
I should put a link to it.

706
00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:16.810
It's a really good article about,
um,
why he left the show.

707
00:42:16.811 --> 00:42:20.050
And I thought I was happy that it wasn't a bunch of mudslinging or anything like

708
00:42:20.051 --> 00:42:20.231
that.

709
00:42:20.231 --> 00:42:22.910
It just seemed like it was time and he wanted to go in a different direction.
So,

710
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:28.390
so that's it.
That is the podcast for this fuck and weak.
Um,

711
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.750
no it isn't.
This is just me checking in on you.

712
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.330
I'll do the real podcast on Monday.
This is not a real podcast.
All right.

713
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.470
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.
You've constant joy the music.

714
00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:43.471
And he was doing an extra half hour of greatest hits from a podcast and a

715
00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:45.250
fucking Monday gone by.

716
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.853
<v 5>Wow.</v>

717
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.210
<v 6>So anyways,</v>

718
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.890
I went up to see some family over the 4th of July to celebrate the birthday of

719
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:47.840
this country.
And,
um,
as I'm driving up,

720
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:49.830
<v 0>okay,</v>

721
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:54.450
<v 6>I'm listening on the radio and evidently I looked up the song on,</v>

722
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.090
uh,
on the Internet.

723
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.570
It's a Carrie Underwood song,
who I don't,
I don't know what she has.

724
00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.010
I'm guessing she's white cause it sounded country and she had little Twang in

725
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:09.710
her voice,
but I don't want to piss off any Koreans out there.

726
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.490
She might've been Korean,
um,

727
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.130
as a song called before he cheats.

728
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.440
So I'm driving a log and you know,
I'm driving my buddy's car.

729
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:23.570
This is how I'm going to fucking defend myself.

730
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:26.470
That I was on a radio station that was actually playing this and I was just sort

731
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:30.620
of clicking the,
uh,
the preprogram radios,

732
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.170
fucking whatever.
You know what I'm saying?
And I'm hot.
I feel like shit.

733
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:39.390
Cut me some slack this week.
So anyways,
this song comes on and this,

734
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.240
this Carrie Underwood chick is sitting there singing this song going to rack now

735
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.130
he's probably slowed dancing by hand with the frat now.

736
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.810
And she's singing about her boyfriend.
I got the lyrics right here.

737
00:44:51.811 --> 00:44:52.321
Right now.

738
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:57.120
He's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey

739
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:57.841
right now.

740
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:02.310
He's probably up behind her with the pool stick showing her how to shoot a
combo.

741
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.500
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

742
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.340
<v 6>And then they go into the chorus and she goes and he don't know,</v>

743
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.020
um,

744
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:13.910
that I dug my keys into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel

745
00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:17.060
drive,
carved my name into his leather seats.

746
00:45:17.061 --> 00:45:19.550
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,

747
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.430
slashed a hole and all four tires.

748
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.170
And all I could think was,
why don't you just break up with them yet?

749
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.013
Dumb cunt.

750
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.553
<v 7>You know what I mean?</v>

751
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:35.140
<v 6>What are you going to do?
You're going to do all this shit.</v>

752
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.000
Then he's going to get mad and then what you're going to make up after five days

753
00:45:40.001 --> 00:45:41.500
and then you're going to blow him again.

754
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.830
I hate this fucking song and I'm going to tell you why,
because it's,
I,

755
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:51.780
I'm pretty sure it's a hit.
It's on the radio,
right?
Uh,

756
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.450
I dunno.

757
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:57.050
And what I love about this is people will listen to this song and they won't

758
00:45:57.051 --> 00:46:01.010
even question the rationale of what the fuck someone's doing in there.

759
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.610
Because so many people in life,
myself included,

760
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.130
you,
you,
you,
you play it.
You're like powerless in life.

761
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.180
You just play the powerless card,

762
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.453
<v 7>you know,</v>

763
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.120
<v 6>just get out of the fucking relationship.</v>

764
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.210
I fucking hate this song and this is one of these songs too.

765
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:23.080
We're fucking women all get together and they started saying,
Hey,
guy,

766
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:28.220
cat has car.
You're all a bunch of dumb cunts.

767
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.420
Okay,
you're fucking stupid.
Just break up with the guy.

768
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:33.510
<v 7>Okay.</v>

769
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:34.380
<v 6>Just break up with them.</v>

770
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.390
Not even to mention the fact that now you're going out there and you're,

771
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:43.560
you're,
you're doing damage.
I don't know.
Is that a felon?
That's not a felony.

772
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:44.394
I don't know what it is,

773
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.750
but it's just a classic thing where a woman would listen to that song and at no

774
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:52.500
point would she ever think may,
maybe I could get arrested for this.

775
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:57.390
I am damaging somebody's property.
No,
you got to fucking vagina.

776
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.550
You can just go out and broad day light.

777
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.590
You don't even have to wear a fucking mask.

778
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.890
Do you know what I would have to do if I wanted to go out and go fuck up

779
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:08.070
somebody's car?
I would have to wait for the,
first of all,

780
00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:11.310
I'd have to make sure I had an alibi.
It'd be like I was killing somebody.

781
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.340
I had to make sure somebody could cover for me and say that I was fucking

782
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:15.390
somewhere.
Right.

783
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.430
I had to put it on some God damn cat suit and a fucking a mask.
Right?

784
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.660
Like I'm in that dead presidents movie and all I would able to get,

785
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:28.980
I'd be able to get off one quick hit,
right?
One quick hit.
Let's,

786
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.600
I want to start carving it up like a pussy.
Right.
But if I,

787
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:34.360
if I really was going to go out there and smash somebody headlights,

788
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.360
I could hit one and the second the car alarm goes off,

789
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:39.640
I have to fucking take off and then run home,

790
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.760
get out of my little fucking fucking a little cat suit and then try to put on my

791
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:47.770
pajamas.
So when the cops show up,

792
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.200
because you know they're going to find some sort of fucking fingerprint,

793
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.880
I gotta Act like I'm not out of breath.

794
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.880
Like I actually have been sitting there for fucking eight hours watching TV.

795
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.530
I don't know.
I just,
I can't stand,
you know,

796
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.480
it just reminds me of when that movie,
a fatal attraction came out.
Right.

797
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.810
And the amount of women who would just sit there and you see that movie?
Huh?

798
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.600
Yeah.
That's what you get.
You get,
you know,

799
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:16.240
this no thought of like this bitch put a rabbit in,
in,

800
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:19.810
in boiling water does not have that.
Women are there.

801
00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.070
They're out of their fucking minds.
But that's not even the point of this.

802
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:25.800
My point of the Carrie Underwood song,

803
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.100
it actually made me feel like a loser because the amount of fucking times,

804
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.050
I mean I haven't gone out and fucked up somebody's car,

805
00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:34.590
but the amount of times you don't,
what does that song is?
That song?

806
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.680
It's a powerless song.
That's what the fuck it is.

807
00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:41.970
And I went to the whole lyrics to see if she breaks up with them in the end and

808
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:46.380
there's sort of an ambiguous line in the end where she goes,
uh,

809
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.610
because the next time he cheats,
oh,
you know,
it won't be on me.

810
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.930
So that's sort of ambiguous because it could mean because I broke up with them

811
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.440
or it could be because he doesn't want to get his truck fucked up.

812
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.290
So I dunno.
You know,
I,
I just,

813
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.560
I just fucking annoys me.

814
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.430
That song just annoyed the shit out of me
on,
on,

815
00:49:14.431 --> 00:49:19.200
on both levels.
Well,
you got somebody,
it's like,
just break up with the guy

816
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.480
and your solution is,
you know,
something,

817
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.110
if a girl ever fucking cheated on me that,
that I would break up with them.

818
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:32.950
I'm not saying I wouldn't flip out and I give him a good fucking trashing

819
00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:37.830
verbally,
but I would never go and like,
uh,

820
00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.190
you know,
throw all their clothes out in the front lawn and Burnham.

821
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.483
<v 7>Okay.</v>

822
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:48.640
<v 6>You know,
why wouldn't I do that?
I don't know.
I don't know why.</v>

823
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.240
I think a lot of it has to do because I'd be fucking worried I'd get arrested

824
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.590
for damaging property.

825
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:58.690
Why do women have an exemption from damaging property?
I don't understand it.

826
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:05.390
Of a woman sat there smashing up somebody's car and broad daylight because the

827
00:50:05.881 --> 00:50:08.670
guy cheated on him.
People would be laughing.

828
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.770
I would be laughing everyone.
It's,
it's a comedy.
It's just hilarious.

829
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.820
But if the exact same scenario was going down in a guy,

830
00:50:16.821 --> 00:50:19.560
did it [inaudible] be the classic,
you know,

831
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.690
the cops come and they put you in that little,

832
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:26.040
you get tasered and they mush your face into the fucking pavement.
I Dunno,

833
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:26.641
I get it.

834
00:50:26.641 --> 00:50:29.960
Women have carry a kid around and that God damn stomach for nine months,

835
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.290
but I don't think that gives you the right to go out and tax somebody for Arrow.

836
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:38.570
I really don't.
You know,
so why don't you guys just fucking relax.
All right.

837
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:43.390
You a bunch of God damn psychos.
You know,
with your,

838
00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:47.390
I'm on my period excuse.
So three weeks a month,
you're Outta your fucking mind.

839
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.270
I think if a girl goes,
even if you were cheating on a girl on a woman,
right?

840
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:54.440
And she fucks up your car,

841
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:58.580
I really think you ought to be able to go up to her and give her a nice fucking

842
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.490
two piece combination to the Goddamn fucking cabbage.

843
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.610
What do you think about that?
Right?
Just fucking,

844
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:07.070
just hook off on that fucking

845
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.820
<v 7>okay.</v>

846
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.420
<v 6>Hair teased head,
a lettuce on the top of her fucking shoulders.
Right?</v>

847
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.220
What would you go with?
I'm really gonna alienate a lot of my thoughts on this

848
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.260
and I want you to know that most of this is not me advocating punching a woman

849
00:51:22.261 --> 00:51:23.880
in the face.
Most of this is,

850
00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.960
I can't fucking sit in this stupid hotel room anymore.

851
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.270
I can't fucking do it.
I've had the God damn

852
00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.090
<v 7>okay.</v>

853
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.310
<v 6>Do not disturb light on for like four days.</v>

854
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:37.730
They probably think I overdosed in here.
I'm really big on that.

855
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:40.790
Don't clean up the room.
Beat it.
You know,

856
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.330
he had to come in and every three days and change the sheets like I'm royalty.

857
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.780
I changed the sheets like fucking once every three weeks.

858
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:53.330
Maybe that's only if that's only if they are white and I could tell how filthy

859
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:56.600
they are.
That's right.
Wrinkle your nose up.
You fucking pump is broads.

860
00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:00.860
That's how I live my life.
Um,
Jesus.
Why am I attacking women?

861
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.590
I don't know why.
What was I talking about?
Oh yeah.
If you,

862
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.190
if you could punch a woman in a face,
you allowed to punches,

863
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.880
what would you go with?
Okay.
Would you go classic?

864
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.320
Would you set up the overhand right with the jab?
Would you actually waste a jet?

865
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.280
You know,
waste a jab?
Would you go,

866
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.460
this is just evil.
All right,
I got to get off this fucking subject.

867
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.200
I know that song just annoyed me.
Um,

868
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.950
I hate those fucking songs when women just,

869
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.490
just openly talk about how they're going to go out and destroy a guy's fucking

870
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:34.730
property rather than break up with them,
you know,

871
00:52:34.731 --> 00:52:38.090
and it's considered some sort of justification,
you know,

872
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:43.010
rather than looking inward going,
you know,
maybe I'm a bad judge of character.

873
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:43.950
<v 7>Okay.</v>

874
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:48.210
<v 6>What sort of qualities of [inaudible] am I looking for in somebody?</v>

875
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.820
And I'll date that.
I mean,
it didn't,

876
00:52:50.821 --> 00:52:54.840
the fact that the guy had a souped up four wheel drive truck,
didn't that,

877
00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:58.260
give it a go within that?
Give it away on any fucking level,

878
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.900
Huh?
I mean,
souped up four wheel drive truck.
Carrie Underwood.

879
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.870
You dumb fucking,
what else did he have?
Huh?
Uh,
uh,

880
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.100
a fucking earring hanging down with a lightning bolt on the side of it to have

881
00:53:11.101 --> 00:53:12.430
this fucking song sticks.

882
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.530
<v 7>Okay?</v>

883
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.550
<v 6>This is one of the,
you know why I hate this sign this,</v>

884
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.940
and I'm going to do my whole podcast on this fucking song.

885
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.200
This is going to be one of those fucking songs when I'm the on the road and I'm

886
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:25.180
hating my life,
you know,

887
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:29.030
and I just don't want to go back to the hotel room and be lonely and I'm going

888
00:53:29.031 --> 00:53:31.520
to go out to a bar and that song's going to come on.

889
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:36.110
It's fucking four fucking twats with their ear piercing.

890
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.520
I'm singing and I'm drunk.

891
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:41.420
High pitched voices are going to start singing every fucking word of that song.

892
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.740
Liked it.
They liked these fucking cunt bad asses.

893
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.550
<v 8>Ah,
okay.
And I'm done.
All right.
I'm done with that.</v>

894
00:53:49.551 --> 00:53:52.280
I'm done with that fucking Oh Jesus Christ,
that fucking song.

895
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:00.943
<v 5>Nope.</v>

896
00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:50.560
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

897
00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:54.670
It is a bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

898
00:54:55.390 --> 00:55:00.000
Uh,
what is it?
March 1st,
2009,
uh,

899
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.140
in like a lamb out like a lion.

900
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:07.090
I ate all that old fucking crap.
They always talk about,
you know,

901
00:55:07.091 --> 00:55:09.010
I've got to look at some fucking groundhog and the,

902
00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.380
what are they going to let that shit go,
you know?
Yeah.
I have the most shows.

903
00:55:14.381 --> 00:55:15.910
It's fucking left ball.

904
00:55:15.911 --> 00:55:19.920
Then it's going to rain for the next nine Dars JJ there.

905
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.260
If he's going to dress up in a top hat,
like it's the fucking old days.

906
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.310
You know what I mean?
Some people are just so fucking married.

907
00:55:27.311 --> 00:55:29.290
It's disgusting that they,
they,
they just,

908
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.850
that's all just repressed like sexual energy,
you know,

909
00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:38.770
they've been banging this same broad until her fucking uterus dried out,

910
00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.413
you know?

911
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.193
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

912
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:47.870
<v 8>So now they got to go out and they got a dress like fucking JP Morgan waiting</v>

913
00:55:47.871 --> 00:55:52.040
for some road to stick his fucking head out.
And then they got,
you know,

914
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:56.010
and if you're not familiar with the expression,
they have a,

915
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:59.270
what is it in like a lamb out like a lion and a lamb out.
Like,

916
00:55:59.271 --> 00:56:02.450
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It means,
you know,
if it starts off good,

917
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.720
it's going to end bad.
If it starts off bad,

918
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.160
it's going to end a good,
that's how that would go.

919
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:13.310
I am completely not even fucking prepared for this podcast.

920
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:18.500
Usually I wait until about 45 minutes in and I let you guys figure it out that

921
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:21.590
the podcast is going to suck for this week.
But I'm going to give you a warning,

922
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.440
almost like,
have you ever see like when a movie's coming out and they say,
uh,

923
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:30.730
this film has yet to be rated?
That means usually that means it sucks so bad.

924
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.400
We're trying to keep it away from the critics.
So,
uh,

925
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.090
by the time you figure out it sucks,
you're going to be looking at your date.

926
00:56:37.091 --> 00:56:39.880
Like,
oh,
I have to look good.
You know,
I saw the trailer,

927
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.960
we all could it be bad?
Will Smith is in it,
you know,

928
00:56:43.961 --> 00:56:47.830
he's playing some homeless guys,
even in the world.
Um,
yeah,

929
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:52.780
this podcast is going to suck.
Um,
I just got back from,
uh,

930
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.410
I was in Houston,
Texas and,
uh,

931
00:56:56.411 --> 00:56:59.290
I was so good in Texas and I don't mean comedically.

932
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.140
I mean as a person that,
um,

933
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:06.970
I was just mind numbingly boring fucking,
you know,

934
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:11.590
I'm not drinking no internet porn.
It,
you can't do it.
It's impossible.
No,

935
00:57:11.591 --> 00:57:14.590
there's never an expression out there that says beware of the man that has no

936
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:18.040
vice isn't there?
Hmm.

937
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.390
Can I just ask you that?
Can I just fucking throw that out there?
You know what?

938
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:26.440
This is why this sucks right now because I'm actually fucking trying to pull

939
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:31.441
something up right now that I have to play because yesterday was probably the

940
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:36.730
biggest fucking hockey game in the United States.
Um,

941
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.900
yeah,
probably since,
uh,
1980.
That's what they're saying.

942
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:44.310
I don't want to use that hack thing doable.
It'll knock old.
Yes.

943
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.710
I don't want to do that.
But it was fucking huge.
Every that we,

944
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:52.711
75% of Canada they were estimating was watching the gold medal game.

945
00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.700
And for all you Americans,
uh,
you actually not Americans,
all,
you,
all,

946
00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:58.990
you people from the United States,

947
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:04.500
the u s has a hockey team now called team USA and a every four years they play

948
00:58:05.591 --> 00:58:07.630
in the Olympics and a,

949
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:12.010
we made it to the final round for the gold medal and that game was yesterday.

950
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.790
I know it's a little obnoxious,
but that's how I felt in Houston.

951
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:18.280
If 75% of the people were watching it and Canada,

952
00:58:18.281 --> 00:58:22.180
I don't think there was more than 75 people watching it and fucking Houston.

953
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:25.930
They just completely didn't give a shit.
I went down,
this is base basically.

954
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:29.980
I don't want to ruin it for you,
but a Canada one,
um,

955
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:34.210
they just played a better game.
I think that they were a better team.
Uh,

956
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:36.220
yesterday,
I don't know what they did,
figured out their lines,

957
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:39.390
but it was night and day since we,
uh,
beat him the week before how they looked,

958
00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.470
they looked awesome.
I definitely thought they were a better team.

959
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:43.840
And what I liked was nobody really choked.

960
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:49.000
There wasn't any bullshit fucking calls.
Um,
I'll fuck you.
Canada.

961
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:51.820
What the offsite thing.
You guys got enough penalty.
Shut the fuck up.

962
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.660
I want to hear it.
You won the game.
Um,

963
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.500
but that play was offsite and we did get a goal,

964
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.370
but you know what I'm saying?
But it was pretty much,
it was,

965
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:04.930
it was free of that and it went into overtime.
And uh,

966
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.380
I so wanted the United States to win because,
uh,

967
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.560
obviously I'm a huge,
it was on two levels.
Obviously I'm a huge hockey fan,

968
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:19.180
but then secondly,
the level with which Canada gives a shit,

969
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.990
it is very few times that

970
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:26.990
<v 6>you get a chance to devastate an entire nation and it doesn't involve dropping</v>

971
00:59:27.751 --> 00:59:32.510
bombs on them.
You know,
like if we want that hockey game,
um,

972
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:33.840
I dunno what they would have been doing.

973
00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:36.690
Those people would've been slitting their wrists up there and their rig loose.

974
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:42.120
Sorry.
Just had to throw some ignorant American shit out there.
Like,

975
00:59:42.121 --> 00:59:45.180
you guys are fucking smart up there smoking his cigarettes,
sitting in a fucking,

976
00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:48.690
Tim Horton's eaten another fucking doughnut.
What you think?

977
00:59:48.691 --> 00:59:51.960
I never been to Calgary.
You never think you'd have a thought.

978
00:59:51.961 --> 00:59:54.120
I took that fucking highway up to Edmonton.

979
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.440
Pass all those fucking cows in the oil wells.

980
00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:04.560
Fucking guys,
everybody's acting like Dick Cosmopolitan,
all worldly.

981
01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.190
Even these days,
I'm getting tired of it.

982
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.720
I'm tired of listening to the fucking hype about how fucking stupid Americans

983
01:00:12.721 --> 01:00:16.140
are.
People who misstates here,
not North Americans in general.

984
01:00:16.141 --> 01:00:17.460
Just people from the fucking states.

985
01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:21.990
And then you travel and you run into the exact same shithead that you are with a

986
01:00:21.991 --> 01:00:24.750
different accent.
All right?
Get over your fucking cells.
But you know,

987
01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.740
I gotta give it up.
You got to give it up.
Uh,

988
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.780
<v 8>they won the fucking game.
So I figured I'd find the gayest</v>

989
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.710
version.
National Anthem.

990
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:45.680
I think this was a,
I don't know if this was old town or if this was incent.

991
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:49.440
Who did this one?
This is a tribute to Canada.
Our friends up north,

992
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.380
never harmed to fly.
Never started a war.

993
01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:01.950
Like to pretend you're from Paris,
right?
Stop blaming the east.

994
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:07.170
That arrogance goes right across the country.
Stopped with the arm down to Earth.

995
01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:10.920
Cause I'm from Winnipeg.
I'm not buying it all.
You guys,
you look down on us.

996
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.520
Okay.
I can even listen to the rest I got,
I got to leave it.

997
01:01:15.521 --> 01:01:16.960
You won the fucking gold medal.
Go ahead.

998
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.030
I bet you guys are tearing up up there right now.
Aren't you

999
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:25.360
crying into your fucking,
I dunno what some sort of winter garb.

1000
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.230
It's any worse than acapella singing.

1001
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:35.740
What is the worst mimes are acappella I think,
I think acappella lease.

1002
01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:40.180
You can hear him.
Him.
What's the deal?
Yeah.
Right.

1003
01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:43.060
Sons of bitches you want again,
but by the skinny of teeth,

1004
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.660
congratulations.
You fucks.

1005
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:50.450
<v 6>It's a hell of a game.
Does a hell of a Goddamn game.
You know,</v>

1006
01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:52.280
the best part was was uh,
the United States.

1007
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:55.520
For those of you in America who didn't fucking watch it.
Uh,

1008
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.870
Zach per receipt.
Where the fuck you say his last name is?

1009
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:04.900
He a fucking tied it up with 20 seconds left and 75% of Canada collectively shit

1010
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:08.660
their pants.
And I was like,
oh my God,

1011
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:13.640
it's going to happen now that they soiled themselves,
uh,
you know,

1012
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.610
they just fucking annoy me.

1013
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.100
They're cocky fans annoy me every fucking time it would

1014
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.770
<v 8>come down,
right?
Anytime the American is doing anything good,</v>

1015
01:02:22.771 --> 01:02:26.940
there'd always be that fucking idiot wrapped in the the America of the fucking

1016
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:31.650
Canadian flag gesturing at the fucking ice.
Like the ref missed something.

1017
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.400
That's what I don't like about Canadians when it comes to hockey,

1018
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.180
is their fucking,
you know,
this is our game.

1019
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.800
Did we get pissed when the Blue Jays won the fucking world series?

1020
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.900
I made me a little bit.
That was a no,
I don't.
Fuck,
I don't remember.

1021
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.520
You know what I did realize that the fucking Stanley Cup has not been in Canada

1022
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.840
since 1993 you know,

1023
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.610
so maybe that's why they went so crazy.
Hey,
what the fuck did they do?

1024
01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:04.320
Their metals,
by the way,
I kind of tapped out in the last couple of Olympics.
It,

1025
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:07.170
you still look cool and you still look like an Oreo cookie,

1026
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:10.050
but it was made out of gold.
It had the same sort of engraving,
right?

1027
01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:14.100
Had to like the Olympic sign and now it looks like you took the metal and you

1028
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:18.420
put it on the fucking railroad tracks.
Somebody ran over it.
You know what I mean?

1029
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:22.110
I don't know what have I'm fucking around.
Congratulations.
A,

1030
01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:24.990
that was a great game.
It was great for hockey,
but it was definitely a,

1031
01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:27.930
all you guys out there listen to me talk shit,
you know,

1032
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:32.130
and enjoying Peyton Manning,
losing the Super Bowl fucking up and all that.

1033
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.870
The Karma came back around.

1034
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:38.220
I was devastated all by myself out in Houston.

1035
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.010
And uh,
but it was,
it was still great man.
And you know,
I,

1036
01:03:42.011 --> 01:03:44.810
I did make fun of Michael Wilbon saying when he said,
ah,

1037
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.700
this is the best hockey out there.
I got to admit,

1038
01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.570
I got to admit without the,
uh,
without the fighting.

1039
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:56.790
Um,
the,
uh,
I don't know.
Do you guys like no touch icing,

1040
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.670
automatic icing?
I liked a lot of it.
I got to admit,

1041
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:03.900
I kind of liked the PG version of hockey.

1042
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:07.490
It was kind of Nice.
This is sacrilegious to be saying this,
but I kind of,
uh,

1043
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.590
kind of enjoyed it.
You know,

1044
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:12.870
to be great if a couple of goons would make it to the fucking the Olympic squad,

1045
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:15.300
you just so good.
They put you on there.
You just have like,

1046
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:20.280
you know George Lorac verse.
Uh,
I dunno who's the other big heavyweight,

1047
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:24.600
that fucking,
who's that big goon on,
on uh,

1048
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.930
Minnesota with that weird last name that has like three letter bs and an n in it

1049
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:34.770
or some shit.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead with the podcast.

1050
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.580
This is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,
March 1st,
uh,

1051
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.650
that aunties duel and um,
yeah,

1052
01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:45.780
I had a hell of a fucking weekend out there in Houston,
Texas.

1053
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.930
I want to thank everybody who came out to the Improv and um,

1054
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.010
I had great shows Friday night that led into Saturday night and Saturday night.

1055
01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:57.660
I think I might've had two of the best shows I've had in recent memory.
Um,

1056
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:02.160
they were just a,
everything sort of clicked.
I kind of,

1057
01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:06.930
I was sitting in this restaurant,
um,
eh,
this is,

1058
01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:08.850
this is how clean living I am.
Okay.

1059
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:13.851
It's right before 7:00 AM I having a salad with fucking a chicken breast in it,

1060
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:19.060
right.
I got my laptop,
I'm typing out this fucking script,
finishing it up,

1061
01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:22.480
drinking a glass of water,
getting the shit out of the way.

1062
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.360
And I just remember like,
just having this feeling like this,

1063
01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:28.960
this is what Tony Robbins does that you know,

1064
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:31.360
and that's how he has that fucking psycho.

1065
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.580
Terminally happy fucking smile on his face,
you know?
And um,

1066
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.240
I don't know.
I realized some shit in that moment.
I brought it to stage,

1067
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:43.960
I start a riff and the whole fucking thing worked and I recorded it.
But

1068
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.730
beautiful thing about the universe is when you hit something great happens,

1069
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.190
something else has to balance it out.

1070
01:05:51.191 --> 01:05:55.900
Like I get to see Peyton manning fuck up the Superbowl and thus make me feel

1071
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:58.270
vindicated.
And then two weeks later,

1072
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.170
a crushing fucking overtime loss.
It wasn't crushing cause they used,

1073
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:05.980
they used to beat us by fucking,
these will be just like seven to one.
All right,

1074
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:08.950
you got to admit,
okay,
you Canada fucks.

1075
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.010
Remember that back in the day it was a joke.
Our hockey was the joke.

1076
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.870
First of all,
90% of the people in the league were all from Canada.
Granted,

1077
01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:18.130
they were only six fucking teams,
but still,
um,

1078
01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.240
and you guys used to crush us and now we're breathing down your neck and a,

1079
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.610
you better enjoy that gold medal because I've got a feeling that's the last one

1080
01:06:24.611 --> 01:06:27.580
you're going to be fucking having for a while.
How do you like that?
Huh?

1081
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.760
Now you wait till fucking next year buddy.

1082
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:35.950
Now can you guys handle that shit talking?
All right.
Anyways,

1083
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:40.210
so twice this weekend I had incidents with people in the crowd.

1084
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.870
Um,
and both of them were women.

1085
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:48.190
And A,
I'm the first to tell you that I do have fucking issues with women,

1086
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:51.090
but the,
uh,
the first night,
um,

1087
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:53.170
I was on stage and there was this woman right down.

1088
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.700
I don't know if it's stage left to stage right from where I'm fucking added

1089
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.960
stage left.
All right?

1090
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:01.840
So I think that's the proper terminology.

1091
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.780
Why the fuck do you guys need to know stage left stage,
right?

1092
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:09.040
You're in the crowd.
You know,
I go down to midas.

1093
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.680
Do I need to know a fucking wrench they're going to use,
I don't need.
Okay,

1094
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:15.850
so stage left or right.
I'm looking down and,
uh,
this fucking girl is,
she's,

1095
01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:19.960
you know,
she's talking,
continue on with my jokes.
They looked down,

1096
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:24.310
she still talking.
So finally I say,
hey,
it is sweet tits.

1097
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.660
Why don't you,
uh,
what's the problem?
What are you talking about?

1098
01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:32.050
And then she does the usual,
ah Ha.
You know,

1099
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:35.410
I wouldn't say she was attractive.
If she was in from a small town,

1100
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:39.850
she'd be a Hottie,
you know,
just out of percentages.
But,
um,

1101
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.090
so she did the usual like,
what,
what I have a,

1102
01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:46.210
I had no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
You know,
10 minutes later I look back,

1103
01:07:46.211 --> 01:07:48.850
she still fucking talking gets a little more heated.

1104
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.050
I basically went to her table about six times until I finally told her to shut

1105
01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:56.500
the fuck up.
And then,
uh,
I don't really even fucking remember.

1106
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:57.970
Then all of a sudden,
next thing you know,

1107
01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:01.480
she's hammered and she's getting kicked out when I got like five minutes left in

1108
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:05.080
my show.
So she threatened to sue the place and all this type of shit.

1109
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.680
Now usually that's the end of the night.
You know,

1110
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.700
the whole crowd is fucking clapping as she's leaving because she's been fucking

1111
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:16.610
annoying.
Everybody around them who paid to see the show.

1112
01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:22.100
All right.
So,
uh,
usually that's the end of it.
But you know what this psycho did.

1113
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:27.130
She actually sent a letter to the Improv and she tried to pretend that that she

1114
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:29.960
wasn't herself.

1115
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:34.190
She tried to pretend that she was an impartial member of the audience who

1116
01:08:34.191 --> 01:08:38.570
completely agreed with her and thought that I was a fucking idiot.
So,
uh,

1117
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.260
I want to read you a little bit of this fucking letter here.
Um,

1118
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.730
to whom it may concern,

1119
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.760
I attended bill burrs first show on Friday the 26th and was utterly appalled by

1120
01:08:50.331 --> 01:08:52.940
his performance.
I love comedy.
Oh,

1121
01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:56.450
this is what you always have to do whenever you bitch.
Um,

1122
01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:00.260
and you're not there in person so they can't see what a radiant human being you

1123
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.930
are.
You have to.
Then after you state your bitch,

1124
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.610
you then have to fucking show how easy going you are as a human being.
So anyway,

1125
01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:11.510
she saw my show.
She was utterly appalled by by my performance,
and then she goes,

1126
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:16.660
I love comedy and I certainly expect there to be rudeness crudity and what can

1127
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:21.800
be offensive topics.
That's what comedy is all about.
It makes it fun.

1128
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:23.870
That being said,
okay,

1129
01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:27.660
now she's established how fucking cool and laid back she is back to trashing.

1130
01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:30.770
Oh fucking howdy duty.
Here she goes.
That being said,

1131
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:35.270
Bill Bird took it way too far and he was quite unprofessional to say the least

1132
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:39.710
while initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at.
Yeah.

1133
01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:42.590
That was the part where you were sober,
you fucking lightweight.

1134
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.670
That was the beginning of the show when you weren't fucking on your ninth

1135
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:50.510
fucking drink and you were actually paying attention to the show.
So yeah,

1136
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:53.930
initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at.

1137
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.860
I think as a person is trying to write as if it's medieval times and I should be

1138
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.200
like fucking holding this thing like a God damn scroll.

1139
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:03.590
I know that isn't medieval ish,
but she's using,
she's doing that biblical thing.

1140
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.620
What?
She's using extra fucking words to try to sound intelligent.

1141
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.760
While initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at it instead of being,

1142
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.840
at first he was funny.
Um,
anyways,
the show ended up,

1143
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:19.550
the show ended up being a complete disappointment.
Okay.
For,
okay.

1144
01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:23.030
This is her complaint here for at least 30 minutes.
He blast for me,

1145
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.760
God and the name of Jesus Christ.

1146
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.150
He outright degraded the Catholic religion.
All right.

1147
01:10:29.151 --> 01:10:33.230
Now that's complete bullshit.
I only blast some God,

1148
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:37.130
the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic religion for about seven minutes.

1149
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:41.090
30 minutes.
What am I fucking George Carlin.

1150
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.890
I can't talk about anything but 30 minutes.

1151
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.040
Maybe you weren't so fucking hammered.
You'd dumb cunt.
You know,

1152
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:49.460
you'd have a better perception of,
of,
of how much time had elapsed.

1153
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:55.760
Oh Geez.
All right,
let's continue.
Although I'll get this,

1154
01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:58.700
this and another thing,
another thing where she's,
she's pulling this move again.

1155
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.010
He outright to graded the Catholic religion,

1156
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:05.210
although I do not belong to this religion.
So now he's supposed to be like,

1157
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.420
wow,
she's not even part of that religion.

1158
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:12.170
And even she found it offensive.
Have you guys picked up on that?

1159
01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:16.500
On Youtube at all?
Like when someone wants to trash Obama,
um,

1160
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:19.200
they'll say like,
Obama is the worst president ever.

1161
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.260
And then they'll write and I'm a Democrat,
you know,

1162
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:23.820
like you can prove it either way,

1163
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.060
just trying to cut people off the pass before they go,
fuck you,

1164
01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:30.390
you fuck newswatch and right wing,
whatever.
You know.

1165
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.910
<v 7>Okay,</v>

1166
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:35.690
<v 8>women need to shut the fuck up.
And I'm a girl,
that dumb shits.
Okay.</v>

1167
01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.630
So evidently she was,
she was offended and she's not even,

1168
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.080
she's not even Catholic anyway.
She said it was offensive and what he said,
uh,

1169
01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:45.890
went on and on again,

1170
01:11:45.891 --> 01:11:48.830
while this type of thing should be accept a expected,

1171
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.040
he took it way too far and there was a young lady who like I and my friends was

1172
01:11:55.821 --> 01:11:59.600
becoming offended.
Yeah.
Of course she was because she's you,

1173
01:11:59.601 --> 01:12:03.800
you fucking psycho.
Can you believe that?
She thinks I'm this fucking stupid.

1174
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:07.190
And I know what this point is.
Probably not obvious to you guys,

1175
01:12:07.191 --> 01:12:08.900
but wait till I finish the rest of this.
All right.

1176
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:11.600
I'm probably going to sound like some maniac here,
but I don't give a fuck.

1177
01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:12.501
I said,

1178
01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:16.520
that was a young lady who liked I and my friends was becoming offended and said

1179
01:12:16.521 --> 01:12:20.420
a few words instead of few words to someone at our table.

1180
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:25.510
You fucking lying sack a Twat.
Anyways,
uh,

1181
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:29.420
she said,
uh,
when he rudely addressed her,
that's when I said,
Hey lady,

1182
01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.150
I guess lady his route.
Hey Lady,

1183
01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:36.410
could you do me a favor and maybe look at the show at some point.
Um,

1184
01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.830
he said when he rudely addressed her,
she told him that she was Catholic.

1185
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.640
That never happened.
He had no apologies or considerations.

1186
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.410
Just utter disrespect.
Okay.
First of all,
she never said that out.

1187
01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:50.960
She never said she was Catholic.
And if she did,
she said,

1188
01:12:50.961 --> 01:12:53.120
it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it.

1189
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:57.260
So how the fuck could this random fucking woman in the crowd here,
what she said,

1190
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.100
this fucking thing.
It's going to make me mad again.
All right,
let's continue.

1191
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:06.880
After he finally got off that subject,
his show just got worse.

1192
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.830
This is what she's on about her sixth strength.

1193
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:13.300
It appeared to my friends and I that he may have been getting heat from some of

1194
01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:15.940
the audience and that he felt uncomfortable.

1195
01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.320
This may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on the lady,

1196
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:25.310
the lady.
This is why I'm picking on her,
not because I,

1197
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.920
and as I'm doing my act,
by the way,

1198
01:13:26.921 --> 01:13:30.310
I keep looking down and she's getting some sort of Martini thing that looks like

1199
01:13:30.311 --> 01:13:32.560
there's a bear in it.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

1200
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.530
It's one of those chick fucking drinks,
you know?

1201
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.860
Like what if we took root beer and stuck a fucking roofie in it?
You know,

1202
01:13:38.861 --> 01:13:42.250
she was drinking those things.
Okay.
And uh,

1203
01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.730
so now she goes and this very male,
it goes,

1204
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.990
this may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on that lady.

1205
01:13:49.991 --> 01:13:53.140
Even at one point telling her to shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

1206
01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:57.760
I told you to shut the fuck up because you were talking the entire time you
twat.

1207
01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.120
Anyways,
this is downright unprofessional.

1208
01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.930
Who said that summer cannot say a few words to people at their table.

1209
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.390
Did you see how obvious this is that this is this the actual fucking woman who

1210
01:14:10.391 --> 01:14:12.930
would give a fuck much that you would write three pages.

1211
01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.610
They were quietly speaking and not making any noise whatsoever.
Oh,

1212
01:14:17.611 --> 01:14:22.140
yet you heard her say that she was Catholic on the other side of the stage.

1213
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:26.700
There was another table talking quite a bit more and they were louder due to the

1214
01:14:26.701 --> 01:14:29.790
drinks yet he did not pick on them.
Do you want to fucking,

1215
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:31.880
<v 3>okay.</v>

1216
01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.140
<v 8>All right.
Let me just fucking relax here.
This is even funny anymore.</v>

1217
01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:36.600
Like I totally lost.
I have,
I've lost the whole humor in this.

1218
01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:39.690
This is fucking making me so mad.
They were more disruptive than anything,

1219
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.090
although he of course made jokes about it.
All right.

1220
01:14:42.091 --> 01:14:44.760
There was this table next to me.
They were also drinking,

1221
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.150
but they were more doing that church thing where I would say something funny and

1222
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.390
then they were sorta like fucking repeating it so they were a little bit rowdy,

1223
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:52.590
but they were acceptable.

1224
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:56.370
This woman who was fucking out drinking every one at the other table had

1225
01:14:56.371 --> 01:15:00.510
basically essentially her fucking back to me to the point that if I fucking

1226
01:15:00.511 --> 01:15:04.080
punched her in the back of the head,
I would've got two minutes for boarding pat.

1227
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:07.710
Possibly a fucking game misconduct.
All right.
There's something for you.

1228
01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:11.640
Olympic hockey,
fucking people.
Anyways,
let's,
let's,
let's continue here.
Actually,

1229
01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:12.600
that would be roughing wouldn't it?

1230
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:15.900
Let's say I took the mic stand and I turned it sideways.

1231
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.410
I could cross checked her on the fucking neck.
All right,
here we go.

1232
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:23.730
Now we are convinced that his wrong demeanor was due to his discomfort after

1233
01:15:23.731 --> 01:15:27.810
realizing that he had offended some of the audience in order to justify himself

1234
01:15:27.811 --> 01:15:30.120
and ease any tension coming from the audience member.

1235
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.150
He said something along the lines of,
don't listen to me.

1236
01:15:33.151 --> 01:15:36.390
I'm just an idiot up here speaking.
Pray for me please.

1237
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:40.950
That was obviously a demonstration of his uneasiness.
That's this is,

1238
01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:43.890
this is how drunk she was.
What I was doing was I was,

1239
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:48.600
I was telling people in the crowd that if they were religious that I respected

1240
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.880
their religion.
All right.

1241
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1242
01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.830
<v 8>I just had,
I just personally don't buy into it.
Okay.</v>

1243
01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.240
So I'm only stopping right now to say this because I know some of you,

1244
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:03.570
you get so religious,
you get so into it that you can add,

1245
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.810
you get so holy that you can actually commit murder.

1246
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1247
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:11.980
<v 8>You know,
God's usually agile tool or you know,
vengeance.</v>

1248
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.480
I think that was the line I used.
I said,
okay,
you shouldn't be getting mad at me.

1249
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.510
You should pray for me to help me see the light in everyone.

1250
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:24.720
Got a huge fucking laugh at it about it.
Okay.
And this lady is basically us.

1251
01:16:24.721 --> 01:16:28.270
She's,
I can't wait to email her back.
I don't know.
I,
I've,

1252
01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:31.120
I've flipped flopped a hundred times in my head.
What I was going to say.

1253
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:32.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1254
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:34.600
<v 8>You know,
I just can't wait to,
uh,</v>

1255
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.180
I think I'm just gonna write back something really quickly.

1256
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.520
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1257
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.031
<v 8>Like Ruth,</v>

1258
01:16:39.031 --> 01:16:43.380
you actually pretending to not be the dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of

1259
01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:45.450
the funniest things I've ever read.
Something to that effect.

1260
01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:48.390
Basically let her know that I know that it's her and I'll see you next year at

1261
01:16:48.391 --> 01:16:52.410
the Improv.
You can't.
Um,
anyways,
I am very supplies surprised at your call.

1262
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.030
This is where she tries to um,

1263
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.340
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1264
01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:56.930
<v 8>This is where she tries to get me banned from the club.</v>

1265
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.780
I'm very surprised that uh,
your club hosted this comedian.

1266
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.310
It was a true disappointment.

1267
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.460
I am embarrassed as I was the one who suggested the Improv.

1268
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:07.100
When my friends and I were planning to answering a comedy show,

1269
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.480
I do hope that you will consider not this comedian back as he gives your club a

1270
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:15.590
bad name.
If this is a,
this had been my first time to the Improv,

1271
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.250
I never would have returned.
You might consider hiring some local talent.

1272
01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:21.050
There are several good comedians in the area.

1273
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.300
We are good friends with one of them.
If you like his name,

1274
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:26.150
I'll be happy to give it.
Did DPP a bit bit.
All right.

1275
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.910
As for the lady who we picked on,
she and her table,

1276
01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:31.100
we're unjustifiably asked to leave.

1277
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.820
There was no grounds on having them escorted from the show right in the middle

1278
01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:36.380
of it.
That's how drunk she was.

1279
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:40.970
She got escorted out 50 minutes into my one hour set and she's like,

1280
01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:42.770
she was escorted out in the middle of it.

1281
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:44.780
Do you understand how drunk this one was?

1282
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.620
I talked for Jesus about Jesus for 30 minutes.
No,
actually it was seven minutes.

1283
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.720
I was escorted out in the middle.
No,

1284
01:17:50.721 --> 01:17:54.140
you are actually escorted out 50 minutes into the show when you were on your

1285
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:56.060
fucking six drink.
You're drunk can't,

1286
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.720
there were no grounds of on having them escorted from uh,

1287
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.870
from the show right in the middle of it.
Again,
they were not being disruptive,

1288
01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:04.640
voted at all this,
this,

1289
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:08.150
this impartial person just wants to keep talking about how innocent this fucking

1290
01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:11.630
lady is that she never met.
If it hadn't been for bill burr picking on them,

1291
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:15.050
no one would even notice them.
Okay.
The kid you tell.
This is just the,

1292
01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:18.620
the fucking drunk argument they had and the crowd and in the car on the ride

1293
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:20.240
home,
the loud table.

1294
01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:24.050
And the other side though is the one that took away attention from his show.

1295
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.170
I do understand that it is private property and that anyone can be asked to

1296
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:30.590
leave at any time.
But this was wrong to do.
This is a wrong time to do it.

1297
01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:34.310
I personally believe that she should receive an apology from the Improv,

1298
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:38.180
but mostly from bill burr.
That's clearly not my call.
Just the thought.

1299
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:42.080
What a fucking,
uh,
I dunno.

1300
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:44.690
Did I take too long reading that fucking thing.
There you go.

1301
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:46.010
You want to be a standup comedian?

1302
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:47.510
That's what the fuck are you have to deal with?

1303
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:50.900
She's actually like a total fucking control freak.

1304
01:18:50.901 --> 01:18:55.901
And what happened that night was she completely lost on all levels.

1305
01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:57.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1306
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.501
<v 8>You know,
it's weird.</v>

1307
01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:01.890
You become like a part time psychologist as you're breaking down the crowd as a

1308
01:19:01.891 --> 01:19:06.480
comedian.
And she sat at the power position at the table.
The table.

1309
01:19:06.481 --> 01:19:10.380
Is that like a fucking,
we'll say like a 30 degree angle coming in stage left.

1310
01:19:10.381 --> 01:19:13.410
This is going to get technical.
Alright,
you fucks.
Don't,
don't,

1311
01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:18.120
don't leave me here.
She,
you know,
she didn't sit at the chair furthest away.

1312
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:19.830
If you sit furthest away,

1313
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:23.430
everybody you're at the table with has the back of their head to you.

1314
01:19:23.431 --> 01:19:26.520
So then when you want to fucking talk,
it's,
it's a difficult time.

1315
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.820
What she did was not only did she sit in the first chair,

1316
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:33.310
she sat on the first chair closest to me,
so the,

1317
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.600
so all she had to do was turn around.
She had the whole fucking tables attention.

1318
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.070
And when she stood up,

1319
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.820
when she went to leave her whole table stood up like a bunch of fucking minions.

1320
01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.770
You know,
like you remember that dude,

1321
01:19:43.771 --> 01:19:47.250
he used to carry the fucking umbrella for puffy.
That's how they all got up.

1322
01:19:47.251 --> 01:19:48.084
It was pathetic.

1323
01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.530
And people like that surround themselves with fucking weak people like that

1324
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:55.770
because any normal people,
person,
you know,
think about that.

1325
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.120
All you guys listening to right now,
if your,

1326
01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:59.970
if your buddy was being a drunk fucking asshole and got booted from the club,

1327
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.330
would you get up and leave immediately?

1328
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:07.990
Stand up like the fucking general just got up.
I mean,
I guess maybe you would,

1329
01:20:07.991 --> 01:20:09.070
could you be walking?
He's drunk.

1330
01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:12.040
Maybe it's going to go fucking walk out in a p on a cop or something.

1331
01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:16.360
I guess maybe.
I Dunno.
Anyways,
you know,
before I emailed her back,

1332
01:20:16.361 --> 01:20:18.730
what do you guys think I should write back and come up with something clever

1333
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:21.420
other than calling her a cunt like I did.
I think I'm just,
I'm,

1334
01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:24.130
I'm going to write back something to the effect that I realized that it was her

1335
01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:28.990
and um,
I dunno.
I don't fucking know.
Was that just a big waste of time?

1336
01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.800
Should I not have been bothered with all of that?
You know,

1337
01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:38.380
I dunno.
Dan and I had another incident with another fucking person.
I don't know.

1338
01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:42.970
I,
I have issues with,
with a beautiful women.
I really do.

1339
01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.370
This is actually a bit I want to do on stage and I'll just,

1340
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.390
I'll maybe I'll do part of it for you here at bay.
The basic idea,
I just,

1341
01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:52.450
I don't respect them on a certain level.

1342
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.080
I feel like I had to do something

1343
01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.150
to achieve in life.
All they had to do was basically they were born beautiful.

1344
01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:04.670
This is really not an accomplishment I guess.
You go to the gym,

1345
01:21:04.671 --> 01:21:08.300
you stay beautiful past a certain age.
It is an accomplishment I guess.

1346
01:21:08.301 --> 01:21:11.360
But you know,
I don't know,

1347
01:21:11.361 --> 01:21:13.490
for an order as a guy to get around beautiful women,

1348
01:21:13.491 --> 01:21:17.630
you have to accomplish all this shit in life and all they have to do to get to

1349
01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:21.770
where the fuck you're at after accomplishing all this shit is basically take a

1350
01:21:21.771 --> 01:21:25.280
shower and feather their hair back like Farrah Fawcett and they're in the

1351
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:29.630
fucking VIP.
You know,
I also don't like him because,
uh,

1352
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.140
I dunno.
I Dunno if they're smart.
They,
if they're smart,

1353
01:21:33.141 --> 01:21:36.080
they're absolutely stunning though.
I have to admit that.
But you know,

1354
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.850
if they're,
if they're dumb,
that's like,
it's like he got a Lamborghini.

1355
01:21:40.851 --> 01:21:44.600
But you find out it has a four cylinder in,
it won't even worse.

1356
01:21:44.601 --> 01:21:47.750
My fucking hybrid.
Did that make any fucking sense?
You know,

1357
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.720
they have that one default emotion.
Oh my God.

1358
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:54.680
And they give 58 different reads.
You know,

1359
01:21:54.681 --> 01:21:57.370
if they see something cute like a little puppy,
they're like,
oh my God.

1360
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:58.783
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1361
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.270
<v 8>You know,
if you do something sweet for from,
Oh my God,</v>

1362
01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:04.980
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1363
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.420
<v 8>You know,
you do something that they fucking hate.
Oh my God.</v>

1364
01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:13.520
Fucking idiots.
They got three words floating around in there and they're in VIP,

1365
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.660
you know,
slapped a fucking spit out of their mouth.
All right,

1366
01:22:17.661 --> 01:22:21.380
let's plow ahead here.
This is the Monday morning podcast and,
uh,
oh,
also,

1367
01:22:21.381 --> 01:22:23.950
you know,
I don't know why I didn't think to say this.
Um,
I can,

1368
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:28.580
I have a new player.
I've kind of abandoned Lipson already.

1369
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:33.350
Okay.
That was like my rebound girl after I broke up with fucking g cast.

1370
01:22:33.351 --> 01:22:36.650
It just didn't work out.
Um,
you know,

1371
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:39.560
like Eddie Murphy and one of the spice girls,
you know,

1372
01:22:39.561 --> 01:22:43.010
but fortunately I didn't impregnate a luminosity.
Luminosity.
I'm sorry.

1373
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:46.670
Just reading that,
uh,
Lipson,
I'm speaking of that.

1374
01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:48.220
I'll let the cat out of the bag.
Um,

1375
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:52.310
this is something I'm trying to do is to actually go on the internet and rather

1376
01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:56.420
than becoming,
even even dumber than I really am or is it more dumb?

1377
01:22:56.450 --> 01:23:00.140
I don't even know.
I know it's more stupid.
It's not stupid or is it?

1378
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:03.500
I have no fucking idea,
but all I know is,
uh,

1379
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:07.810
I'm trying to figure out basically how not to become more of a shithead online.

1380
01:23:07.811 --> 01:23:11.290
And I would really like to start this as a new segment.
Where is,

1381
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:14.080
are there things out there that I can look at?

1382
01:23:14.081 --> 01:23:18.700
I know ted.com I love that site even though I haven't been to it in a month.

1383
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.680
Ted like Ted kennedy.com minus the rape and alcohol.

1384
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.113
Um,

1385
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.400
there's one out here called luminosity.com l u m o s,

1386
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:34.270
I t y.com.
And it's basically games for your brain.

1387
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.720
And I'm telling you,
man,
it's fucking awesome.

1388
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.150
And I cannot even begin to tell you how low I scored on these things.

1389
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.300
Uh,
you know,
they got these things,
they got everything.

1390
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:49.870
Literally they got one game called like duck hunting,
right?

1391
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:55.420
And what happens is a duck appears on the screen while simultaneously,

1392
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:55.871
you know,

1393
01:23:55.871 --> 01:24:00.130
somewhere in your peripheral vision while simultaneously on the screen a letter

1394
01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:00.964
appears.

1395
01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.650
And then what you have to do is you have to click with a bird was and also

1396
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:09.760
remember the letter.
And then when the,
then they'll give you a series,

1397
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:13.060
like a lineup,
usual suspect of letters.
You got to pick the right letter.

1398
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:14.710
And then it's like wheel of fortune.

1399
01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:18.130
Do you got one letter and you're trying to solve the word and it's a name of a

1400
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:22.880
bird.
So you're fucking learning to look at two things at one time process,

1401
01:24:22.881 --> 01:24:23.714
both of them.

1402
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.520
And you're getting better at wheel of fortune all at the same time and learning

1403
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.550
new names of fucking birds that you didn't even know existed.

1404
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:33.700
That's just one fucking game.
Okay?

1405
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.290
So if we can get back into the ying and Yang,
the balance of life,

1406
01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:43.291
if you want to somehow balance off nine hours of fucking going on to Youporn and

1407
01:24:44.171 --> 01:24:47.770
watching people get kicked in the nuts on youtube,
I highly,

1408
01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:51.400
I can't recommend this site highly enough.
You could sign up,

1409
01:24:51.401 --> 01:24:52.750
you get a free week of games,

1410
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.780
luminosity.com l u m o s I t y.com and then it,

1411
01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:02.650
you know,
even the membership is not that bad.
But,
um,
I don't know.

1412
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:03.610
I'm not the brightest guy,

1413
01:25:03.611 --> 01:25:07.660
but I think I have good common sense and I have a feeling then at about 10 years

1414
01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:12.820
after all the how to get fucking a six pack abs books have been written,

1415
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:18.030
somebody is finally going to focus on the brain and start to realize that your

1416
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:23.680
brain,
like you fucking midsection can turn to mush the exact same way.

1417
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:24.514
And like I,
I,

1418
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:29.670
I definitely think my brain is not nearly as sharp as it was 20 years ago.

1419
01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:33.340
It's weird because as you get,
you get older,
you know,
that whole thing,
you know,

1420
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:37.600
you get older,
you get wiser,
you know,
basically you're learning from fucking up,

1421
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:42.760
but you're not as sharp.
And,
uh,
I dunno,
this is this,
this,

1422
01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.793
um,

1423
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:50.230
this site was the closest thing to doing like mental pushups and they're cool.

1424
01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:52.150
They're fun games,
man.
It taps into the video.

1425
01:25:52.151 --> 01:25:56.860
I actually have a new found respect for video games were like,

1426
01:25:56.861 --> 01:25:58.290
um,
you know,
I,

1427
01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:02.200
I got away from video games because they were just eating up all of my free
time.

1428
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:06.360
The last one I really was grand theft auto part three and a,

1429
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.200
it absolutely consumed my life.

1430
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.090
And the thing about that game was even after I finished the game,

1431
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:17.150
I had to get the cheats.
I'm going to lie to you.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1432
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.860
It had to cheat,
you know,
um,
when I finally finished everything,

1433
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.670
I would still play the game and just go on those rampages.

1434
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.150
And I found it to be like a stress relief and uh,
but it,

1435
01:26:28.151 --> 01:26:29.780
it was just like too much.
But after it seriously,

1436
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:33.530
you have to play in those games.
I kind of realized that.
Um,
look at me.

1437
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:35.390
I'm too fucking stupid to convey this idea.

1438
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:39.380
Just go to luminosity.com and if anybody else knows any other sites like that or

1439
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:43.330
just something that,
uh,
can give me some mental setups,

1440
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.700
I would really like it because I'm,
I'm getting into that stuff.
Like,

1441
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:49.280
I don't know if I told you guys a comedian,

1442
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:50.900
I forget who the fuck it was told me about.

1443
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:53.330
There was some book out there that was saying,

1444
01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:57.950
I'm a great exercise to do as if you're like lefthanded is to start doing things

1445
01:26:57.951 --> 01:27:01.430
with you that you normally do with your left hand right handed.
All right,

1446
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.130
I'm gonna wait for you guys to finish doing the Dick joke there.
Ooh.

1447
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.760
Fuck a robot.
Oh,
well wait,
fueling somebody else.
Uh,

1448
01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:11.780
you guys fist bumping in your cubicles with that hack joke from fucking make me

1449
01:27:11.781 --> 01:27:16.130
laugh in 1977.
Can I continue with my podcast?

1450
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:20.910
Thank you.
Um,
no,
it actually,
I don't know what it does.
It's,

1451
01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:25.040
it's somehow it actually makes you more,
uh,

1452
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:29.360
God,
I'm so fucking stupid.
What is the word?
Um,

1453
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:32.960
like say if you were playing guitar,
say if you're,

1454
01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.060
if you're a left handed guitar,
it's like I am,

1455
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.610
it's so pathetic to even call myself a guitar.

1456
01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:42.020
Someone who attempts to play guitar,
I play left handed.
If you actually,

1457
01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:46.070
if I were actually to fuck around on a right handed guitar and try to learn to

1458
01:27:46.071 --> 01:27:46.904
play something,

1459
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:51.290
if I then the the second I went to the lefthanded guitar,

1460
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.380
you would actually learn it quicker.
I have no idea why,

1461
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:57.890
which should be obvious at this point because I could barely fucking explain it.

1462
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:01.580
So anyways,
I fly a lot.
It drives me nuts.
I hate flying.

1463
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:06.890
And so what I do when I fly is I actually sit there and I listened to music and

1464
01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:09.830
I write the lyrics with my right hand rather than my left hand.

1465
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:13.910
And I've actually gotten like halfway decent at it and a,

1466
01:28:13.911 --> 01:28:18.020
at the very least I'm thinking of someday if I'm unfortunate enough to have a

1467
01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:21.590
stroke,
you know,
my turnaround time's going to be incredible.

1468
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.150
I'll be robbing them out.

1469
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:27.500
It'd be right in fucking letters catching the drool with my opposite hand.

1470
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:32.420
You know,
it's so fucking bad.
Yeah,
that's what it is.

1471
01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.400
Join me.
But come stroke proof or what have not stroke proof become a,
I dunno.

1472
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:42.810
Cut your rehab costs 50%.
God knows nobody has fucking health insurance anymore.

1473
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.780
Could be a good thing.
Right?

1474
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.730
Have I said anything funny in the last fucking 19 minutes?
I have no idea.

1475
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:53.030
Somewhere in the middle of that letter I got fucking mad again and all the funny

1476
01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:57.080
went out the window.
And I'll tell you the first rule of fucking losing a crowd.

1477
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:00.200
Well I guess no confidence and have a no jokes would be first,

1478
01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:05.250
but other that it's just going up there and be in an angry fucking psycho.
Um,
oh,

1479
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:07.170
I want to thank everybody for,
uh,
you know,

1480
01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:10.500
last week I talked about women's curling and a,
and by the way,

1481
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:11.760
I totally enjoyed the Olympics.

1482
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:14.800
I love the Winter Olympics and I'm sick of people shitting on him.

1483
01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:18.000
All these late night talk show hosts talking about Hulu.
They're fucking boring.

1484
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:18.720
Really?

1485
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.490
Why don't you go do another lame monologue about fucking that girl who got eaten

1486
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:27.510
by a fucking whale.
Give me your take coming out there wearing a suit.

1487
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:32.280
Like you have a fucking war one before you had the Goddamn show.
Sorry.

1488
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.800
You know I get heated when people make fun of the Olympics.
You know,

1489
01:29:34.801 --> 01:29:37.330
I was talking about how hot the fucking women of curling were.

1490
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:43.120
A little bit of phlegm left.
Um,
and somebody said,
uh,

1491
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.030
was actually saying like,

1492
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.950
I was trying to figure out why I was finding these fucking women so attractive

1493
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:50.610
other than the obvious that they were good looking women.
This guy actually said,

1494
01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:55.050
hey,
bill,
uh,
beside the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor,

1495
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.500
I really set that up bad.
He's saying,

1496
01:29:58.501 --> 01:30:03.180
this is why men find women curlers attractive.
I just blew that joke.

1497
01:30:03.181 --> 01:30:03.930
He said,

1498
01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:08.190
besides the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor.

1499
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:09.660
I have,
dude,
I,

1500
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:12.480
you so deserved a huge laugh on that and I just fucked you out of it.

1501
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:15.450
I'm sorry about that.
Um,
anyways,
he says,

1502
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:18.120
I have figured out why we love watching this so much.

1503
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.890
When they release that stone,

1504
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.170
the way they let it slide out of their hand is reminiscent of the way a skill

1505
01:30:25.171 --> 01:30:30.171
for woman releases your cock after delivering a massive hand job.

1506
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:32.251
First of all,

1507
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:37.251
I hope you're a surfer cause that's the only reason why to the massive hand job,

1508
01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:43.200
um,
fucking massive hand job.

1509
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:46.830
Or maybe you just have a fucking bit,
oh,
maybe I'll just,
you have a fat cock.

1510
01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:51.480
I Dunno.
So anyway,
she goes,
uh,
they don't drop it.
Don't push it.

1511
01:30:51.481 --> 01:30:56.481
Just let it slide out naturally as they go to sleep with my boxes around my

1512
01:30:56.521 --> 01:31:00.210
ankles.
Oh,
I forgot.
That was creepy.
I know I read it.

1513
01:31:00.211 --> 01:31:03.030
I was supposed to just read the beginning joke cause I thought the joke was

1514
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:05.130
fucking great.
I forgot the fucking picture and his

1515
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.840
guys with those fucking insect looking legs.

1516
01:31:09.841 --> 01:31:12.900
Some guy's legs like insects with that fucking hair all over him.

1517
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:18.090
Skinny fucking legs were a mess.
Fucking mess.

1518
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.650
I'm like praying mantis legs.
Anyways,
I'm a long time ago.

1519
01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:25.530
I talked about unacceptable.
This is when,
you know,
the podcast sucks on,

1520
01:31:25.531 --> 01:31:29.940
I'm just plowing from fucking topic to topic and there's just no sort of a no

1521
01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:33.440
segue other than dead silence.
Um,

1522
01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:37.980
let's go to youtube videos for the week.
Let's,
let's,
let's go over here.
You know,

1523
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.890
I feel like the fucking dumb fuck on,
uh,

1524
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.810
on like jeopardy when there's like five difficult topics in one easy ones,

1525
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:51.180
you know,
great scientist,
architecture,
medieval,
whatever.

1526
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.560
And let's go,
let's go with the

1527
01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.010
developments in a lawn chair for 100.

1528
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.960
That's not even an easy as it up till five.
I'm just too dumb.

1529
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:07.630
I'm too fucking dumb.
Whatever.
You know what?
I played those brain games.

1530
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:11.770
I'm too stupid this week.
Here's a youtube video to look up.
Look up.
Do Schoff,

1531
01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:16.360
d o u c h e o f f a Douche off.

1532
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:19.480
Maybe you'll find that humorous.
I can't remember if I did.
I think I did.

1533
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:23.260
I believe I did because I left it there.
Uh,
bad wedding stories.

1534
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.970
This is another topic.
Who the fuck do I sound like I'm doing right now?

1535
01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:30.923
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:34.460
<v 8>Did somebody to do a Bob Dole impression.
Lay out a fucking the worst.</v>

1537
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:39.890
Can I tap out at this fucking point 37 minutes in a bad wedding stories.

1538
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:43.490
Um,
hey bill,
I haven't listened to your podcast since the beginning.

1539
01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:46.700
Decided it was about time I emailed you and told you how much I enjoy it.

1540
01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:50.900
Thank you very much.
Uh,
the okay,

1541
01:32:50.901 --> 01:32:55.070
let's get to the,
uh,
to get to the marriage thing.

1542
01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.520
Um,
okay.

1543
01:32:58.521 --> 01:33:03.440
I got to marriage story when I was 23,
I was dating a girl and she got pregnant.

1544
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.840
Oh Dude.
Okay.
Uh,
so we decided to get married.

1545
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:11.840
Okay.
Stupid.
Fucking move number two,

1546
01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:16.340
even though a month before this I was thinking about dumping her ass.

1547
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:20.960
Stupid mistake number three.
Actually that was the smart move.
That was,

1548
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:23.930
that was the three card Monte right there.
Don't knock her up.

1549
01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:29.270
Don't fucking merrier.
Wait,
knock her up.
Mary,
her dumper ass.

1550
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:33.380
You know which one had the marble?
You fucked up.
All right,

1551
01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.070
so all the plans are made,
our families meet each other.
Okay.
Just cause I,

1552
01:33:37.071 --> 01:33:37.341
you know,

1553
01:33:37.341 --> 01:33:40.490
had to do that stupid three card Monte joke in a desperate attempt to try to be

1554
01:33:40.491 --> 01:33:43.190
remotely funny at this point.
You know,
it was,

1555
01:33:43.191 --> 01:33:45.620
I have a blue wind screen this week.
I'm going to blow that.
I'm going to,

1556
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.290
I'm going to blame it on that one.
You know,
my fucking dog ate the orange one,

1557
01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:53.600
so I'm going to blame it on the blue wind screen.
Anyway.
So basically,

1558
01:33:53.601 --> 01:33:56.330
sky's 23 years old.
He knocks up this fucking girl.

1559
01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:58.220
He decides to get married even though he,

1560
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:02.090
he thought about dumping our month before.
So anyways,
so all the plans are made.

1561
01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:07.190
Um,
families meet each other,
invitations are sent out,

1562
01:34:07.191 --> 01:34:09.710
all that bullshit.
So three days before the wedding,

1563
01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.570
I'm watching some stupid movie where this guy tells his other guy that his dad

1564
01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:18.350
told him before his wedding,
it's never too late to change your mind,

1565
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:21.800
to which his friends says,
but you're not married.

1566
01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:25.660
And I guess it is.
That's a lap.
So anyways,
uh,

1567
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:30.620
so taking this as a sign from God that I just happened to be watching this
movie.

1568
01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:35.390
I canceled a wedding.
Great.
Fucking move.

1569
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:40.940
All right.
Which just suffice to say,
brought a shitstorm into my life.

1570
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.150
The worst part is that I actually felt so bad.

1571
01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.290
I married the chick three months later.
Oh Dude,
you were out.

1572
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:54.020
You were fucking out.
So basically I was a pussy.

1573
01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:58.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
But two,
that's a hard thing.
You were dealing with a lot of shit at 23.

1574
01:34:58.461 --> 01:35:02.000
Your parents were crying.
She was knocked up.
Yeah.

1575
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.200
I wouldn't say you were pushing,
you gave into peer pressure anyways,

1576
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:11.330
we were married for seven years with every year being worse than the year
before.

1577
01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:14.270
So we're divorced,
so we're divorced now.

1578
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:17.510
So I guess I should have gone with my gut to wrap this up,

1579
01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.210
I got a little gripe with,
with chicks.

1580
01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.830
My ex used to ask me when the marriage was going down,
if I could go back,

1581
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.430
would I not meet her?
Which I would say,
fuck yeah,

1582
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.500
I would avoid you like the plague.
Which she would say,
uh,

1583
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.250
W at which point she would say,
but you wouldn't have our two kids,

1584
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:42.240
don't you love them?
And then he would say,
yeah,
but then I'd say,
but I,

1585
01:35:42.241 --> 01:35:45.080
I would never have met you,
so I would have never had the kids.

1586
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:47.840
So in that scenario,
the kids aren't even a thought.

1587
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:52.490
This of course would lead to a huge fight about my lack of caring,

1588
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:57.950
a moral to the story.
Don't use logic when talking to chicks.
All right?

1589
01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:02.050
That's actually not the moral to the story.
What it is,

1590
01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:06.770
is you got to think how women think,
you know,
which you know,
if you're lucky,

1591
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:09.050
at some point when you're 90,
you'll know,

1592
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.970
you'll understand 10% of what the fuck is going on in that brain.
Um,

1593
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:18.080
basically when she's asking you that,
she was asking that,

1594
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.390
I would guess one of two reasons.
One,
she was insecure that,
you know,

1595
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:27.230
you knocked her up and then you married her and you know that you were gonna

1596
01:36:27.231 --> 01:36:31.130
marry her.
Then you broke it off and then you fucking married her.
Uh,

1597
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.220
believe it or not,
I'm sure that's not how she dreamed of getting married.

1598
01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:37.940
She probably dreamed of meeting her soul mate and they were so hopelessly in

1599
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:40.790
love that everyone in the crowd had tears in their eyes for,

1600
01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:43.610
they never found a love.
So as great as theirs,

1601
01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.100
she could have been thinking that.

1602
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:51.490
And she wanted you to reassure her or she probably was just banging you,

1603
01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:54.470
you know,

1604
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:57.170
and didn't want to fucking marry you and didn't think that you were the one

1605
01:36:57.171 --> 01:36:57.501
either.

1606
01:36:57.501 --> 01:37:02.501
And all of a sudden she got knocked up and she probably sitting there looking at

1607
01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:06.410
the Saturday,
your fucking head.
One morning you're eating pancakes,

1608
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:11.000
trying to find where in the world she loves you.

1609
01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.050
You know,
on what fucking level.
You know,

1610
01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:17.600
just watching your temples going in and out as you're chewing,

1611
01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:22.460
just fighting that fucking urge to slam a toaster over your fucking head.

1612
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.870
You know,
just wondering how to hell that I ended up with this fucking guy.

1613
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.910
Why did I say Yes to this guy?

1614
01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:33.350
Why did I let him fucking drop a fucking load in me?
What is wrong with me?

1615
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.810
And just trying to make the fact that you had these two kids justice justice

1616
01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:43.710
enough,
you know,
that's what the fuck was probably going on.
But,
uh,
I dunno,

1617
01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:43.970
dude,

1618
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:48.140
you didn't really talk about how much of a nightmare the wedding was that that

1619
01:37:48.141 --> 01:37:51.680
was the meat of the story there.
I think you had the beginning and the end,

1620
01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:53.900
but what are you thinking is she's coming down the aisle?

1621
01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.770
What is your family thinking?

1622
01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.730
You're knocked her up and then you dumped her and yet you're like,
oh,
fuck it.

1623
01:38:00.731 --> 01:38:04.330
I'll marry or anyways,
and you're only 23.
They know you don't want to do it.

1624
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.540
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.730
<v 8>Those weren't tears of joy,
my friend,
you know,</v>

1626
01:38:07.731 --> 01:38:10.700
what are you thinking is you're up there,
you know,

1627
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:18.560
was your Cumber Bun like wringing wet with flop sweat as she was standing up?

1628
01:38:18.561 --> 01:38:19.550
I can't imagine that.

1629
01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:22.573
<v 2>Ah,</v>

1630
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:28.130
<v 8>has anybody ever just ran out the side door?
Because I could definitely see like,</v>

1631
01:38:28.131 --> 01:38:30.320
oh my God,
I don't know what to say.
How do I get out of this shit?

1632
01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:34.830
And then just in a panic when they started,
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,

1633
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.900
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,
dead,

1634
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:44.420
dead,
dead,
turn around and look at where is she?
Oh,

1635
01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.340
why the fuck didn't I have some wedding music underneath?

1636
01:38:46.341 --> 01:38:50.630
This would've would've been hilarious if I fucking prepared.
You know,

1637
01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.520
you're looking for the bitch,
where the fuck is he?

1638
01:38:52.521 --> 01:38:55.910
And then she comes around the corner and you're trying to make yourself lover

1639
01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.680
and she comes around the corner and you just see that fucking face and you see

1640
01:39:00.681 --> 01:39:01.890
those eyebrows at,
you know,

1641
01:39:01.891 --> 01:39:06.770
we're going to be touching by the time she's 40 and you just fucking run out the

1642
01:39:06.771 --> 01:39:09.950
side door in those cheap tuxedo bowling shoes

1643
01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.490
and you know what I mean?
And you're,
it's such a fucking panic,
you know,

1644
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:17.630
there's no way,

1645
01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:18.980
<v 2>okay</v>

1646
01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.650
<v 8>that you're going to be able to get your car keys out in time,</v>

1647
01:39:21.651 --> 01:39:25.850
get them into the door,
open the door,
lock the door and get in there.

1648
01:39:25.851 --> 01:39:27.650
And it's like people are going to be coming out,

1649
01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.330
running out of the church like some fucking Zombie movie as you're trying to get

1650
01:39:32.331 --> 01:39:36.150
your car started.
I mean the move there is you,

1651
01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.410
if anybody does that,
don't go to your car.
You keep running.

1652
01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:43.180
Okay.
Most people get married in the suburbs,

1653
01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:47.560
so headed head for a wooded area.
All right?
Go Online.

1654
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:50.470
Learn how to turn your fucking cumber bun and do a tent.

1655
01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:55.330
Hang out there for a couple of days.
Let Shit cool off.
Grow a beard,

1656
01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:59.920
come back to town,
get some provisions that point you'll be so fucking filthy.

1657
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.980
He just another homeless guy wearing a suit.
You know what I mean?

1658
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:06.260
<v 8>Just let her forget all about you.</v>

1660
01:40:06.261 --> 01:40:09.920
Then maybe they'll think that you're mentally ill and then uh,
you know,

1661
01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:12.650
one day you just show up on your mother's front steps and she faints.

1662
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:16.730
Her Dad catches you in,
punches you in the face.
Cause he's a former marine.

1663
01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.390
You know,
haven't we all seen this movie?
I'm trying to say,

1664
01:40:20.391 --> 01:40:21.770
run out the fucking door.

1665
01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:25.510
Run out the fucking door if you're in that situation,

1666
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:29.650
if you're in that situation.
All right.
Uh,
Bill,
longtime listener,

1667
01:40:29.651 --> 01:40:34.210
first time writer.
I got a winning story to tell you.
I'm 23 years old now.

1668
01:40:34.211 --> 01:40:37.190
The 23 year old.
I've been a,
here's one for you.
Uh,

1669
01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.550
don't go to a wedding or getting married at 23.

1670
01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:41.740
They all seem to have bad stories.
Um,

1671
01:40:41.741 --> 01:40:45.580
I've been to a few weddings and let me start by saying in this story,

1672
01:40:45.581 --> 01:40:49.330
it wasn't actually a wedding I witnessed.
It was a wicking,

1673
01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:54.100
a Wiccan hand fastening.
Okay.
Now they'll fit.

1674
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:57.030
For those of you not familiar with the wicked religion,
uh,

1675
01:40:57.031 --> 01:41:01.030
I just want to state at this point,
neither of my,
um,

1676
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.200
I can't remember if that's the one that actually has all those pagan symbols

1677
01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:09.791
that,
you know,

1678
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:14.791
the Catholic Church then said that they were devil signs according to the,

1679
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.490
uh,
fucking Rosetta Stone or whatever that fucking movie was.
I read the book too.

1680
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:22.990
What the fuck is the name of that Davinci Code?
Um,
whatever it was called,

1681
01:41:22.991 --> 01:41:24.280
a Wiccan hand.
Fascinating.

1682
01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:27.970
And I know that because my sister didn't invite people to our wedding,

1683
01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:30.580
she invited them to her hand.
Fascinating.

1684
01:41:30.970 --> 01:41:34.480
That's why he knew it was a Wiccan hand fascinate and not a wedding.

1685
01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:38.260
Because she said,
I'd like to invite you to my hand.
Fascinating.

1686
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:43.540
Jesus Christ.
Um,
he said,
if you're 41,

1687
01:41:43.541 --> 01:41:46.570
you still don't know when a hand fascinating is congratulations.
Thank you.

1688
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:51.130
Because I didn't,
so anyways,
he goes,
I'm 17 at the time,
my sister's 23 or 24.

1689
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:54.610
We both still live with our parents or boyfriend and unemployed,

1690
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:59.290
alcoholic living off money.
His mom left him when she died.
Ah,

1691
01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.690
there you go ladies.
There you go.

1692
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.130
You don't have to settle for less when there's guys like him out there.
Um,

1693
01:42:06.131 --> 01:42:10.210
anyways,
um,
the fuck am I,

1694
01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:14.050
why didn't I make this tight?
Bigger.
Jesus.
What a flop this podcast is.

1695
01:42:14.650 --> 01:42:17.770
So anyways,
so this fucking alcoholic was over for dinner one night.

1696
01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:21.910
He tapped his fork on the glass a few times to get everyone's attention.

1697
01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.130
We were three feet from him and immediately my stomach knotted up because I knew

1698
01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:31.550
this moron was about to say something stupid.
You got,
I got to meet you.
You guys.

1699
01:42:31.551 --> 01:42:34.990
It's fucking funny writers,
man.
Some really talented people.

1700
01:42:34.991 --> 01:42:38.230
Listen to this fucking podcast.
You guys write better than I do.
Anyways,

1701
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:42.820
basically he announced his engagement to my sister in front of my mom and dad

1702
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:47.680
pulled out to onyx rings and they put them on each other's middle fingers.

1703
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:50.470
You know,
I went to the Onyx Strip club and now Houston last night.

1704
01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:54.730
How funny is that?
Anyways,
it was dead silent and um,

1705
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.380
the look of a repressed horror on my mom's face was unmistakable.

1706
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.300
It was so awkward.

1707
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.800
So I just started clapping going Yay.
Quietly,

1708
01:43:05.801 --> 01:43:07.630
because nobody else joined in.

1709
01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.150
Oh,
that's great.
Is that your role in the family?

1710
01:43:13.151 --> 01:43:17.530
You're the person who always tries to make it better.
God bless Ya.
Anyways,

1711
01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.340
it was just dead silence and my sister and her boyfriend kissing each other like

1712
01:43:21.341 --> 01:43:22.510
everything was fine.

1713
01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.940
A few months later I found out they were financing those rings and going into

1714
01:43:27.941 --> 01:43:29.710
payments on them.
Every week.

1715
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.300
My sister's collecting child support and neither of them have a job and they are

1716
01:43:34.301 --> 01:43:37.690
financing onyx hand fastening rinks.

1717
01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:42.700
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

1718
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:45.250
I can't believe there's more to this story.
All right,
here we go.

1719
01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:50.290
Fucking knee deep.
I got to go the rest of the way.
All right.
Anyway,
so I finally,

1720
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:50.681
uh,

1721
01:43:50.681 --> 01:43:55.550
it finally gets to their hand fastening day and they're doing the ceremony right

1722
01:43:55.551 --> 01:43:59.300
on Newport beach.
It's in the middle of the day on a,

1723
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:03.800
on Sunday in the summer,
they didn't have,
oh,

1724
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:08.480
they didn't reserve a piece of beach or anything.
They just showed up and go,
hey,

1725
01:44:08.481 --> 01:44:11.450
let's have the wedding here.
Um,

1726
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.100
the family we had,
oh fuck.
I got to sit close to the damn screen.

1727
01:44:16.101 --> 01:44:19.940
I can't read anymore.
The family we have near the beach mostly all showed up.

1728
01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:22.490
All the people who lived near the beach mostly showed all,
oh,

1729
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.610
there were about 30 or 40 of us.
None of us,

1730
01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:29.450
none of us are dressed in beach close.
Half of them are in suits and dresses.

1731
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:32.090
There are no chairs.
There's not even an altar.

1732
01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:36.140
Everybody's just standing around hot and they can't sit down because there's no

1733
01:44:36.141 --> 01:44:38.570
chairs and they don't,
they don't want to ruin their clothes.

1734
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:41.990
My sister shows up in an all black gown with the veil.

1735
01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.580
The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux with his face painted like one of the

1736
01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:51.440
misfits,
kind of like a skeleton face.
Jesus Christ.

1737
01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:55.370
It sounds like the episode of the office.
Anyways,

1738
01:44:55.371 --> 01:44:57.410
they don't do any traditional wedding stuff.

1739
01:44:57.411 --> 01:45:01.550
They just go right up front of the crowd with their Wiccan priest or whatever.

1740
01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:04.370
The Wiccan priest is basically just a friend of theirs.

1741
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.050
He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff from a book in some other language,

1742
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.020
my sister and the boyfriend or responding in some of their language.

1743
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:14.630
Nobody has any idea what's going on.
Then all of a sudden,

1744
01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:19.631
the boyfriend pulls out this crazy looking knife with a what?

1745
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:24.320
A hilt.
I don't know what that is.
Uses it to cut my sister's veil.

1746
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.580
Then pokes the end of it into his finger until he's bleeding.

1747
01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.380
He sticks the knife into the sand and wraps his bloody hand around my sister's

1748
01:45:33.381 --> 01:45:36.980
neck while they kiss the stone.

1749
01:45:36.981 --> 01:45:41.090
Hippie priest holds up his book and said something loud in that different

1750
01:45:41.091 --> 01:45:41.924
language.

1751
01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.440
I assume it was equivalent equivalent of I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1752
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:49.310
I'm sure being comedian.

1753
01:45:49.311 --> 01:45:52.730
You've heard the sound of 50 people gasping simultaneously.

1754
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:56.960
Family members in suits and dresses are just walking away at this point.

1755
01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:01.940
A lifeguard saw what the boyfriend did with the knife called the cop and the day

1756
01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:06.020
ended prematurely with him getting cuffed and driven away in a police cruiser.

1757
01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.520
Jesus Christ.
Anyways,
thanks for the podcast.
I really enjoy it.
Jesus Christ.

1758
01:46:10.521 --> 01:46:13.790
How about a fucking round of applause for that story?
All right.

1759
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:18.080
I think I have to read up on the a Wiccan religion.
You know,

1760
01:46:18.081 --> 01:46:19.340
one thing I did like about that,

1761
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:22.880
I did like the fact that they just showed up and just decided to have a wedding

1762
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:26.510
and they avoided all those other costs.
Um,

1763
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.990
cause I wanted to say halfway through that like,
you know,
they didn't have,

1764
01:46:29.991 --> 01:46:33.770
they didn't reserve that piece of the beach or anything and I was thinking like,

1765
01:46:33.771 --> 01:46:37.280
well he never had to back in the day.
You know what I mean?

1766
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:39.860
You just fucking had a wedding.
There was,

1767
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:42.980
it wasn't like nine zillion fucking dollars.
Didn't matter where you were,

1768
01:46:42.981 --> 01:46:47.981
but I guess you have to do that now because there's nine zillion people and

1769
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.030
bankers run the

1770
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:52.490
<v 6>fucking world.
Hey,
speaking of that,
did you get,</v>

1771
01:46:52.491 --> 01:46:55.880
somebody sent me an email the other day,
evidently Europe elected a president.

1772
01:46:56.850 --> 01:47:01.610
Do you hear that?
Europe elected a president,
not England,
not France,

1773
01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:05.780
Europe.
The entire continent now has a fucking president,

1774
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:08.120
has one guy in charge of all of them.

1775
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:13.340
See that just like those three d TVs that are only a few months away,

1776
01:47:13.341 --> 01:47:17.030
that new world daughter is going to be available right down at the best buy

1777
01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:21.530
coming,
sewed,
come and fucking soon.
If you go on and read about the,
uh,

1778
01:47:21.531 --> 01:47:25.560
the bailout,
uh,
rolling stone has a great article and a,

1779
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:30.080
usually I try to stay away from their politics because there's so brutally to

1780
01:47:30.081 --> 01:47:34.310
the left.
It's fucking ridiculous.
Um,
you know,

1781
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:38.840
they never trashed Democrats or when they do,
it's so like light hand.

1782
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:42.110
They just doing it just because they trashed of Republicans so bad.

1783
01:47:42.111 --> 01:47:45.500
They're trying to show that they're fair and balanced like those other fucking

1784
01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:50.450
maniacs.
Um,
Fox News actually has a store now when you go through the airport,

1785
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:54.760
which I think is hilarious.
They sell water and that type of shit.
So,
I dunno,

1786
01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:55.281
it's gonna be,

1787
01:47:55.281 --> 01:47:58.700
there's gonna be one fucking news channel is going to be one president and one

1788
01:47:58.701 --> 01:48:01.910
fucking currency of money and you better do what they say.
Oh I raw.

1789
01:48:01.911 --> 01:48:03.670
That's going to be the end of it,
my friends.

1790
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:07.050
<v 8>Um,
anyways,
if you want to check it out,
it's the,
um,</v>

1791
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:12.150
it's the rolling stone that actually has a Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck on the

1792
01:48:12.151 --> 01:48:13.830
cover.
And if you guys are fans of music,

1793
01:48:13.831 --> 01:48:17.190
I guess they're going to be doing a tour together,
which is unbelievable.

1794
01:48:17.191 --> 01:48:20.880
They used to be big time rivals back in the day and now they're fucking in their

1795
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.390
sixties.
They're like,
yeah,
let's get some money for the medication we now need.

1796
01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:29.630
And uh,
I guess they're going to be doing a tour and a,
and with that,
um,

1797
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.410
I didn't have time,
you know,
cause I,

1798
01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:34.210
I got a couple of weird weeks coming up guys.
I've got to tell you this world,

1799
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:36.000
I usually take Sundays off,

1800
01:48:36.001 --> 01:48:40.440
so I'm flying home on Sundays and so then I get a good night's sleep and I can

1801
01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:45.240
give you a decent podcast.
But,
uh,
this week and this upcoming week one,

1802
01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:49.620
I'm going to be at the Improv in San Jose and I am working Thursday,
Friday,

1803
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:53.560
Saturday,
and Sunday.
So I won't be a,
it is a quick flight,

1804
01:48:53.561 --> 01:48:56.550
so next weeks will be a good podcast,
but that's why this one was so late today.

1805
01:48:56.551 --> 01:49:01.500
So I apologize and I didn't get a chance to recommend any of the music that you

1806
01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:06.120
guys have been sending in,
but I'll definitely try to read it next week.
And,
um,

1807
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:10.050
I finally have gotten into Pantera to a sick fucking level.

1808
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:15.750
And,
um,
if you get a chance,
um,

1809
01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:21.000
download a vulgar display of power or cowboys from hell.

1810
01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:26.340
And um,
I actually used to play in this fucking,
uh,
you know,

1811
01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:31.110
garageband and,
uh,
my brothers and some of their other friends,

1812
01:49:31.111 --> 01:49:33.300
she used to get in to thrash and I,
I was never into it.

1813
01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:37.170
I was more like into ACDC and John Bonham and trying to get my bass drum is fast

1814
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:40.320
as bottoms,
so I never got a double pedal or any of that shit.
Well,

1815
01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:44.250
a few years ago,
I finally got one and listening to cowboys from hell,

1816
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:48.070
I gotta fucking get that down because,
uh,
I dunno,

1817
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.030
combination of Vinny Paul and Tim Alexander Brulee make me want to play double

1818
01:49:52.031 --> 01:49:54.970
bass and Alex Van Halen.
Those are,
uh,

1819
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.710
and I'm actually listening to the lamb of God.
Now,

1820
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:57.760
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1821
01:49:57.761 --> 01:50:01.480
You guys sent me that old school fucking hip hop from the late nineties.

1822
01:50:01.481 --> 01:50:06.130
I fucking devoured that shit.
And then now I'm going into,
into,
into thrash.

1823
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:11.860
I Dunno.
I like all of it.
I like all of it except country music.
Oh,

1824
01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:12.521
speaking of which,

1825
01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:16.180
you've seen that stupid song that fucking woman wrote about being a redneck

1826
01:50:16.181 --> 01:50:20.170
woman.
How she likes being a redneck woman,
a k if you guys,

1827
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:24.430
if you got crushed in this economy,
if you want to get rich quick scheme,

1828
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:29.850
just write an anthem that celebrates being a complete fucking moron.

1829
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.590
And um,
and,

1830
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:38.950
and you basically tell people that underachieving in life is a good thing and

1831
01:50:38.951 --> 01:50:42.280
people will absolutely love it.
Like just sing those stupid songs were like,
God,

1832
01:50:42.281 --> 01:50:43.900
Ryan,
I have a beer.

1833
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:48.901
And sit in my own to where then fucking eat a steak and visit all the countries

1834
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:56.430
because whales never going to be better than being rob here with my book and

1835
01:50:56.591 --> 01:51:01.360
Banjo and a bear ran a tennis fit.
All right.
Something like that.

1836
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:03.640
It has to rhyme,
you know,

1837
01:51:03.641 --> 01:51:06.400
and then you got to throw the fucking flag and then I'll tell you right now,
if,

1838
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:10.150
if,
if,
if country musicians ever did stand up,

1839
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:14.170
they would be the fucking worst comedian.

1840
01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.760
They would be the exact kind of comedian.

1841
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:19.840
I hate the one that panders to the crowd,
which is what,
you know,

1842
01:51:19.841 --> 01:51:21.820
the ones that fucking sit there and they look at this guy,

1843
01:51:21.821 --> 01:51:25.720
he knows what I'm talking about.
Right back me up ladies.
You know?

1844
01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:28.300
Well it is crowded because looking crowd and I give yourselves a round of

1845
01:51:28.301 --> 01:51:29.500
applause for coming out tonight.

1846
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.850
God always loved coming out is one of my favorite cities.
You know,

1847
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:37.660
they say that every town.
So it doesn't fucking mean anything.

1848
01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.700
That's what country singers alike a lot of them fucking singing those songs

1849
01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:47.590
about supporting the troops.
I mean,
I mean you fucking pussy.
Take a chance.

1850
01:51:47.650 --> 01:51:50.500
You know,
you write a song support in the fucking troops light,

1851
01:51:50.501 --> 01:51:53.200
like any critic out there is now going to say like,
well,
you know,

1852
01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:56.050
it's kind of hacky chord progressions.
I've heard that before.

1853
01:51:56.170 --> 01:52:00.130
They can't because you're insulated by fucking putting our troops in front of

1854
01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:03.730
you.
You fucking pussy
and bullying.

1855
01:52:03.731 --> 01:52:07.780
I liked bear in ice cream.
If you don't get the fuck out country.

1856
01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:11.440
I like,
I like,
I like beer and ice cream too.

1857
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.090
You know he's got everything in there,

1858
01:52:13.091 --> 01:52:15.310
but saying we shouldn't fucking punch babies.

1859
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:19.930
Don't punch babies and don't step on the American flag.

1860
01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:23.440
And if you do,
I'm going to punch you in the face.

1861
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.490
Everybody.
All right.
Thanks for listening to this week.
Sorry.

1862
01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:31.020
It was so disjointed and fucked up,
but that's what you get when it's free,
Huh?

1863
01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:34.210
Oh,
little Catholic guilt there.
I do it for you.

1864
01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:39.760
<v 5>I did it [inaudible].</v>
