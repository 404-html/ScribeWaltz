00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.620
Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.450
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.130
Just checking in on you.
It's 9:25 PM here.

4
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:16.090
This is a really weird podcast.
I'm going to be taping this on my iPhone.

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.630
I'm probably going to do half of it and then I'm going to head out.

6
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.470
It's my last night in Scotland.
I,
my last night just Portland.

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.840
I had a fucking blast,

8
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:29.290
but I gotta tell you met Jesus Christ to have to spend in three fucking days in

9
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:33.700
Scotland,
Scotland ball go by bottle wall,

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.060
um,
the apart five bottle of warm,
um,

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.050
I fucking,
I just want to be dry it,

12
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:45.800
it's just rained essentially nonstop and it didn't even have the fucking decency

13
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.390
to just rain.
It's just been slowly,
just fucking spitting in your face.

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530
And I finally was talking to this cab driver on the way over and he was just

15
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:58.300
going,
I was like,
does it always rain during the summer over here?

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.810
Cause there's summer,
there's no summer in Scotland.

17
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.990
Summer in Scotland is you go to Turkey,

18
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:07.810
Greece or Spain or some shit like that.

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.730
He just basically saying,
I guess the sun never fucking shines here,

20
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.830
you know,
is it any wonder why everybody is so God damn funny up here.
Um,

21
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.260
I,
oh man,
I had such great shows and one of the,
another really weird venue.

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.810
I didn't even know what the fuck it was.

23
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:29.680
It took me like to my third show to realize it was a gymnasium.

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.520
I finally saw a backboard like a basketball rim,
you know,

25
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.060
with the glass and it was just sort of cranked up against the ceiling.
And um,

26
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
I dunno,
just really like,
it's weird.
It was like totally fucking bizarre,

27
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:47.040
but some of the best shows I've had on the tour and just really had a great
time.

28
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.600
Scottish people are fucking hilarious.

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.290
So even when people yelled out half the time they said Shit funnier than what I

30
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:56.100
was talking about.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,

31
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.420
trying to pack up here.
Oh man,
I packed perfectly on this fucking tour.

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.440
I absolutely fucking crushed it all they have.

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.670
I'm going to be over in Europe tier for 23 fucking days.

34
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.810
I have a little bitchy ass stewardess little wheely thing.

35
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.710
And a backpack and that's it.
You know why?

36
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.850
Cause I fucking traveled and I've done the thing where you bring light fucking

37
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:24.440
five pairs of tee shirts,
three different fucking workout things.
Sweatpants.
Oh,

38
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.350
oh what if,
what if we go ballroom dancing?

39
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
What if another night we go to a bull fight?
Um,

40
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
you know what if for some reason we do some jousting right and you just pack

41
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.260
every stupid ass fucking outfit and you know what happens?

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.800
You like five days into your fucking trip and you realize that you've worn the

43
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.440
same t shirt every single day and you know what?

44
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.240
No one gives a shit and there's nothing worse then is because then you start

45
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.350
buying shit over there.

46
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.190
There's no fucking room and you just looking at all these fucking tee shirts and

47
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.710
all these sweatpants and these stupid fancy hats,

48
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:57.920
whatever the fuck it is you're into that you're brought and you never wore.

49
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.800
I actually still packed too much shit.
There's a,
there's a,

50
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.500
I got two great tee shirts.
I've yet to use them.
You have to fucking use them.

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.950
No one knows you out here.
No one gives a shit you think is going to walk by,

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.200
you know,
you know,
walk by someone and they'd be like,
oh,

53
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.850
that's that fucking tourist came by yesterday wearing the same t shirt.

54
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.960
You know,
it's not high school.
Nobody knows who the fuck you are.

55
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.310
Anybody can blow anybody away.
Um,

56
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.670
so uh,
yeah,
that's it.
Yeah.

57
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.580
I packed like an absolute champ and now,
now I'm home.

58
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.940
I'm going to the motherland.
Now I'm going to Germany where uh,

59
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.800
I've never really done a background check on me,

60
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:43.020
but I just looked at a little bit of the family tree.

61
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:45.670
I got a lot of German last names in the tree,

62
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:50.671
so I know I got a significant amount of fucking Germans letting me,

63
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.750
dude,
I got to give it up to the Scots.
You know,
a lot of countries you go to,

64
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:58.320
their money just looks fake and stupid.
The fucking Scott's got great currency.

65
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.820
These coins actually seem like they're worth something and they got a wait to

66
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:06.940
them.
You know,
they got some good designs on them.
Um,

67
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.240
plus it always helps.
So people from Scotland talk like the pirates,
you know,

68
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.480
just gives a of some sort of level of like,
I dunno,

69
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.150
credibility to anything that the fucking saying.

70
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.600
I'm sure the audio is a little fucked up and literally packing right now as I'm

71
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:21.434
talking to you,

72
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.270
I'm going to try to knock half of this out before I get outta here.
But um,

73
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.860
tonight I actually had my first night off,
you know,

74
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:31.581
in 10 days.

75
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:36.581
I did 13 shows in the last 10 days and I was doing at least an hour and a half

76
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.380
every night for the most part except the first show here.
Um,

77
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.260
they told me to only do an hour,
but after that,

78
00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:46.050
every other one I tried to do like a buck 15.
So I've done,
I dunno,

79
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.480
somewhere between 23 and 25 hours of stand up.

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.930
And it was really nice to have a,
a,
a day off.
But,
um,

81
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.970
I actually went out tonight and I saw the great time he Tiernan add,
uh,

82
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.760
this place called the gilded balloon and he's an absolute legend in Ireland,

83
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.000
Irish guy,
absolute legend there all through Ireland,

84
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.530
all through fucking Great Britain and into Europe.
And uh,

85
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.701
it was great,
man.

86
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.730
It was fun to be an audience member just sitting there watching an absolute

87
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:21.690
master up there,
storyteller and all that stuff.
Man,
it was so cool.

88
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.010
And um,
I just got to hang out and join,
but you were fucking sucks.

89
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.530
The number one fucking thing that I cannot stand about going to two alive to

90
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.050
anything where you got to have these rows of chairs.

91
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.520
I just got this perfect seat in the back,
right.
No problem.

92
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.450
There's like one row behind me.
I deliberately sat in the back,
you know,

93
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.000
cause I want to get the whole thing.
I want to watch him do his thing.

94
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:49.330
I want to see the crowd react.
I want to see,
you know,
I just,

95
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.640
I just want to take the whole thing in,
right.
And uh,

96
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.430
I'm sitting there in this right before the fucking show starts.

97
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.510
Just like every time you go to a movie like I'll thank God,

98
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.450
no one arounds talking to him,
he's talking right.

99
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.950
And then the fucking loud count comes walking in right before the lights go down

100
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.640
to show the coming attractions.
Right.
Same thing happened.
And uh,

101
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.550
that Tommy show,
everything was great.

102
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.330
I'm chilling out and then I never really got a good look at this guy,

103
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:21.080
but this guy just sounded like the biggest mouth breathing moron ever.

104
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.060
He sounded like his diet was horrible.
They just drank in boost.

105
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.760
He was like having problems just breathing.
And then when he laughed,

106
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.280
you could just sounded do,
you could just tell he was dumb.

107
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.863
He just sitting there going,
yeah,

108
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.113
<v 1>then you go</v>

109
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.110
<v 0>the whole fucking time.
And then when he would,</v>

110
00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:42.570
if he would inhale like too much like that,

111
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.990
then he would cough and I would feel the wind on the back of my neck like every

112
00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:50.640
third or fourth cough.
So now I am totally like lean forward because you know,

113
00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:54.350
it's Tommy show,
it's fucking sold out and I got to lean forward like,

114
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:55.051
like I dunno what,

115
00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:58.890
like I'm playing catcher or some shit and then I got to kind of look up so my

116
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:02.550
neck is fucking killing me.
I can't lean back.
And the guy,

117
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.580
it took every,
every skill that I have of blocking people out,

118
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:11.090
which my skills are terrible to try to make this guy not ruin the show.

119
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:13.160
Fortunately,
Tommy was so fucking funny.

120
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.880
I was still able to enjoy it,

121
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.570
but the guy behind me was so annoying me that even when he would laugh because

122
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.160
he had such a dumb laugh.
I'm like,
this,

123
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.300
you didn't fucking get what Tom was saying,
that he's too fucking brilliant.
Yeah.

124
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.030
That for a fucking hour it was like a Mel blanc voice.
Um,

125
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.930
you know,
which way you did go.
That's what it reminded me of.

126
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.650
Is it still fucking recording or did it turn off?
All right,
good.
All right,

127
00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:46.710
well I've knocked down like seven minutes of it.
Um,
there's a very,

128
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:51.711
a very important man in town right now is a teen idol sensation from the Urbine

129
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.240
Anthony Program.
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go to a local bar,

130
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.080
have a couple of SAS Barilla's with them,
see how his festival,

131
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:05.670
when I'm wearing my action slacks that I bought,

132
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.780
I know they're not literally called action slacks,
but I don't give a shit.

133
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.820
These things are,
you know,

134
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:14.640
anytime you have on pants that look like they could go with the suit,

135
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.600
but you could also do yoga in them.
Those are fucking action slacks.

136
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:20.760
I don't care how cool they make them now.
You know,

137
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.200
I don't care what NBA player fucking dances around with them doing all the

138
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:28.350
tricks with the ball and then hits a fucking three pointer.
You know,

139
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.790
I forget who makes these things.
It's the one that has the h on it,

140
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.200
the Hardcastle and McCormick,
what do they call it,
under armor?

141
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.130
You know,
I don't know.
He's always trying to have a bad ass name for this ship.

142
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.930
So anyways,
um,
Cuda Scotland,

143
00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:49.920
thank you to do the French festival and everybody that,
that,
uh,
that came out.
Uh,

144
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:52.680
and thank you to everybody in Amsterdam that I talk about Amsterdam.

145
00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:56.400
You have the day I think I did on the pocket and on the,
yeah,
I did.

146
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.640
Oh I also forgot to mention,
I went up to,
uh,

147
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.550
I went up to af say today,

148
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.240
which is this hike where you get a 360 degrees view panoramic view of I'm amber

149
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.850
and I have the fuck you supposed to say.
And I suppose to say Berg.

150
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.350
Evidently the locals get annoyed and on a clear day,

151
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:23.070
which I don't know that they even have here,
um,

152
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.880
you can,
uh,
you can see all the way to Glasgow,

153
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.500
which I performed there a couple of times.
So,
um,

154
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.400
I went over there and I was gonna meet fucking Derosa and Ari Shaffir,

155
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.420
but you know,
I couldn't figure out where the fuck they were adding.

156
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.250
Of course it was raining,
so I was just like,
I'll just meet you guys up top.

157
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.140
You know,
cause it's like all these different ways in.

158
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.600
And I climbed up this fucking thing.
It's hilarious.

159
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:49.890
There's just no signs telling you where to go.
It's this giant fucking thing.

160
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:52.590
And it's just,
if you find it,
you find it.
They don't give a fuck.

161
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.440
Half of it was these,
these rocks,

162
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.060
these lava rocks that I swear to go on any one of them,
any one of them,

163
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.730
if you slipped and fell,
if you hit it,

164
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:07.050
you shattered your elbow or fractured your fucking skull.
There was no railings.

165
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.250
There was no signs.
Watch your step.
There was just like,
yeah man,
you know,

166
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.780
just keep walking up the hill.

167
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.020
Eventually you'll get to the highest one and you'll know where the fuck you're

168
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:20.070
supposed to go.
There's just a bunch of tourists.
Like,
is it up that way or did,

169
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.340
did we go the wrong way?
You know?
And um,

170
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.620
it was fucking pouring down raining.
Nobody gives,
gave a shit,

171
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.850
no concern of a lawsuit.
It was funny,
like reminded me when I was a kid,

172
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.900
when picked my right before everybody got sue happy in my country and uh,

173
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.310
um,
ended up getting all the way up to the top and I,
you know,

174
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:44.250
I don't have a raincoat because I'm a man,
you know,

175
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.350
or I probably shouldn't even say that.
I guess if I was a real man,

176
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:47.184
I would've bought one.

177
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.250
Would address the fact that you need a coat for when it rains.

178
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.050
Specifically a raincoat.

179
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:56.370
But I've never been able to get myself one because they just always,
I dunno,

180
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.750
I just,
I just remember as a kid,
if you had a fucking rain cold plas,

181
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.600
like third grade,
you just,
it just meant it could you,

182
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.560
could you please beat the shit out of me?
No one had a fucking rain coat.
Right.

183
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.300
You didn't,
you just fucking,
I used to a bit about that.
Puts your shoulder

184
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.000
<v 3>zap.
That was it.
Right.
So I was up there with this,
I dunno,</v>

185
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.130
I dunno what the material was,
but it,
it,

186
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:21.090
it fucking totally lost the battle with water.

187
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.800
And I got all the way up to the top and of course the wind is whipping around

188
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.180
and I'm waiting for Ari and Derosa to show up from whatever side of the fucking

189
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.250
hill they were coming up.
But uh,
you know,
I was thinking like,

190
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:40.230
all right,
Ari is in good shape.
You know,
I know he's done some MMA stuff.

191
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.600
I don't think he's going to be the problem.
I don't think he's the,

192
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.880
he's the wheel that's slow in that wagon down.
I know it was to Rosa.

193
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.950
He was probably fucking making that face.
He always makes.

194
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:51.060
And I was just standing up there,

195
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:53.740
I gave him like five minutes and I was just like,
fuck this,

196
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:57.520
I don't see them anywhere.
And uh,
ended up walking down,

197
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.350
went this different way and I had on like new balance sneakers,
you know,

198
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:05.950
the Steve job ones,
which are people was giving me shit going,
you know,
you know,

199
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.830
those are old white guys.
Sneakers,
like SNL did a,

200
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.120
did a whole sketch talking about how those are old white guys,
sneakers and um,

201
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.460
you know,
it's like,
well,
I'm an old white guy

202
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.790
so I will wear these sneakers.

203
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.520
They were not good for the slippery love or rocks or whatever the fuck they are

204
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.810
up on a Arthur's seat.
And uh,

205
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.530
this fucking cunt was coming down behind me and he had like the climate boots on

206
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.560
and shit and he's like breathing down my neck.
And I was feeling the same

207
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.720
<v 0>kind of stress I feel anytime I go out to play around a golf,</v>

208
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.520
which I never do because I hate that sport.

209
00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:47.940
And one of the things they hate the most about it is the stress of the people

210
00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:48.774
behind you.

211
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.260
They're always better than you and you just feel like a fucking asshole.

212
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:54.750
Like you're holding them up.
I always tell people to play through.

213
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.930
It was that exact same level having anxiety,

214
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.160
except you just got to throw in the fact that you could possibly fracture your

215
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:02.994
skull.

216
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.220
<v 3>Um,
so I finally had the guy go around me and it was,
it was</v>

217
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.610
<v 0>definitely a relief.
Hang on a second here.</v>

218
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:13.090
I got a text to Rosa and let them know that I'm gonna meet him at that bar.

219
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:13.924
Hang on.

220
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.380
<v 3>So anyways,
I made it down without hurting myself and I was already like,</v>

221
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.870
had knee his voice in my head thinking like if I fall down and I fucking break

222
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.240
my elbow Assam Shit,
I'm never going to hear the end of this.

223
00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:30.800
Cause she told me not to do it.
She's like,
you've been working too hard.

224
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.630
Yeah.
You know,
you got a cold.
You're,
you're being an idiot.
Don't go up there,

225
00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:38.090
you're going to fall down and blah,
blah,
blah.
And it's just like,

226
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.860
well you stopped fucking Jinxing me.

227
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.140
You ever hear you attract what you fear?
That's what you're doing right now.

228
00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:47.780
Fucking leave me alone.
And uh,

229
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.000
so of course I don't listen to her.
This is the thing about being a married guy.

230
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.880
You can't listen to your wife because when you do,

231
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.900
there's a party and the dyes and side,
you know,

232
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.030
and then when ends up happening is,

233
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.450
is then you lose your spirit and the light in your eye goes up.

234
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.720
And after the fucking person who blew it out,

235
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.720
that person actually has the nerve to then look at you and,
and,
and,

236
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.180
and like not like you anymore because they look at you like you quit.

237
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.380
It's fucking nuts.
I don't know if that's true,
but,
uh,

238
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.660
I just said it so I'm going to go with it.

239
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.380
I think that that's what they do is like subconsciously,
um,

240
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.740
I don't know why I would say that.
Anyways.
Um,

241
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.800
thank you for all the tweets.
By the way,
the fellow supercar lovers out there,

242
00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:39.440
then joy,
um,

243
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.860
those clips that I sent you of those fucking insane cars that the,

244
00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:45.980
uh,

245
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.980
those Saudi Arabian kids in their twenties flyover into.

246
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.610
You know,
I was thinking about that too.

247
00:14:53.611 --> 00:14:58.611
There's no fucking way you can fly a Lamborghini from Saudi Arabia to London for

248
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:02.300
20 grand.
There's no fucking way.

249
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:03.830
<v 4>Okay.</v>

250
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:08.030
<v 3>There's no fucking way and less,
well,
maybe this is what it is.</v>

251
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:12.560
Maybe because the whole fucking thing is filled up and the charging everybody 20

252
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:17.460
grand that you get,
like the discount price.
I'm just going by,

253
00:15:17.461 --> 00:15:20.910
you know,
I dunno.

254
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.430
You mean if you rent a decent fucking car,
right?

255
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.940
If you were in such a stupid analogy,

256
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.760
but if you rented decent fucking car,
right?

257
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:35.400
How much money that costs you to just fucking rent it for like the week?

258
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.630
That's a bad analogy.
I just,
I know there's no fucking way.

259
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.850
There's no way they're only going to charge a 20 grand.

260
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.010
I wouldn't build the fuel alone,
the fucking fuel alone.
Do you know when I,

261
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.510
when I fly,
uh,
when I rent a helicopter,

262
00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:56.680
cost me 300 bucks to rent a helicopter.
That's why I don't do it that often.

263
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:59.860
It's not a fucking cheap thing and I'm just fucking,
you know,

264
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.000
going to fly it for an hour.
These guys are flying it all.
There's no fucking way.

265
00:16:04.001 --> 00:16:05.880
It's 20 grand.
I Dunno.

266
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.950
Do you realize the arrogant level that I have that I actually think that I know

267
00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:15.390
what it costs to fly Lamborghini from the Middle East to Great Britain?

268
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.760
How would I possibly know that?
I have no fucking idea,

269
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.980
but I'm watching those kids zipping around in those cars made me uh,

270
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.430
go on a youtube and I was watching a ton of clips of a,

271
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.070
you know,
those cars versus each other.
All these tests,
you know,

272
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:35.300
test drives and reviews in all of that.
I got to tell you something,
man,

273
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:40.301
there's a lot of fucking jerk offs out there that have these fucking cars.

274
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.220
There was this one kid,
it's just like,

275
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:47.060
I mean you would think that this guy was into like some comic con shit and he's

276
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:50.310
just like,
you know,
you know,
we still up youtube,
you know,
they always have that.

277
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.510
Is there anything worse when you just want to find the clip and then you get

278
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:58.370
sucked into somebodies fucking stupid TV show on Youtube,
you know?

279
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.120
Okay guys.
So here's the deal.
This guy has a Lamborghini.
It's like,

280
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:05.330
I know you fucking cunt.
I don't need you to tell me about it.

281
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.110
Somebody told me about it,
which is why I'm on here looking for this shit.
Sorry,

282
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.600
not yell.
And the way I usually do that,
just the people next to,

283
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:15.300
I have a little kid,
so I'm trying not to scream too loud here.
Um,

284
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.760
that's my number one fucking thing.
I cannot stand anything else about youtube.

285
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.380
I fucking love,
you know,
but I hate how they have that.
Like it'll be like a,

286
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.610
like whatever you want to fucking watch.
Like whatever the latest thing.

287
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:33.120
What's the latest thing that happened?
I will say that swimmer there right now,

288
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.480
the Bong head guy,
right with the fucking,
uh,

289
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.970
you know the 20 foot body there,
right?
He was given that guy that death stare.

290
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.200
I saw a clip.
It's like,
so and so give so and so the fucking death stare.

291
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:50.070
So what do you think I want to watch?
I want to see this guy give the guy that

292
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.300
<v 0>death stare and every fucking thing I hit on youtube.
Youtube.</v>

293
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.670
Okay.
So as we all know,

294
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.210
the swimmers and like act out swimming and they're trying to be all like fucking

295
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.900
interesting and stepping towards the camera and coming back.
It's just like,

296
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:08.850
you fucking Mano.
Browde can't just show me the fucking clip,

297
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.290
you know?
And then what the worst thing is,
is once the clips out there,

298
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.620
then every count out there,
then it has to do some fucking remix of it.

299
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.500
And they think it's going to be fucking hilarious.
And some of them are,

300
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:24.480
but 90% of them stink.
You know?
I don't know.
Do you guys see that?

301
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:25.720
You'd ever see the remix of the,
uh,

302
00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:28.140
the Tourette's syndrome guy who totally didn't have Tourette's?

303
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:28.780
He was just acting,

304
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.170
<v 3>I think,
but he was still funny.
Um,</v>

305
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.430
somebody sent me that one on Facebook.
That one was funny.
I'll say that.

306
00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:40.490
I enjoyed that one.
Sorry.
From a little fucking commodity.
Hey Man,
I'm fucking,

307
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.010
this weather's really,
yeah,
it's really getting to me.
So,
um,

308
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.650
I don't know what to expect tomorrow when I go to Germany,
but,
uh,

309
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.900
I'm going to a Cologne,
Germany,
not Munich,
not Berlin.

310
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.730
I'm basically going to the Worcester,
Massachusetts of Germany,

311
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.080
as far as I can tell.
You know what I mean?
It's like you're going to California,

312
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:11.050
you know,
you're not going to La,
you're not going to San Francisco.

313
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.240
I feel like I'm going to the Sacramento of Germany.

314
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.080
I have no fucking idea.
And,
but this is what I do.
I'm not going to look it up.

315
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.660
I'm not going to look at the pictures.
I'm not going to do anything.

316
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.830
I'm just going to shit on them.

317
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:29.200
And then tomorrow I'll start my show of probably getting heckles from people

318
00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:32.800
going.
Actually,
we're a number one in commerce.
Um,

319
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.860
this is some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

320
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.060
I just can't imagine,
you know,
it's so fucking incredible is after I do Cologne,

321
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.530
I'm going to drive over to Antwerp,
Belgium.
And as far as I know,

322
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:48.700
I'm going to be passing through with a battle of the bulge was in,
uh,

323
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.400
in World War II.
Um,

324
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.403
<v 4>okay.</v>

325
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.910

I don't know.
I guess just people live over there.</v>

326
00:19:57.911 --> 00:19:58.920
I don't know if they,
if the,

327
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:02.230
the weight of where they live really hit some just cause they're there.

328
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.890
You know what I mean?
It's kind of like here in Scotland,

329
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:07.630
there's all these fucking touristy shops.

330
00:20:07.631 --> 00:20:12.170
We can buy a fucking kilt and a bunch of Plaid Shit,
you know?
But if you,

331
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.220
if you look at the people who live here,
none of them wearing that shit.

332
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.590
Okay.
Yeah.

<v 3>Yeah.
They're sick of it.</v>

335
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.890
I've been going around here trying to get authentic fucking Scottish cuisine and

336
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.590
I've,
there's more goddamn places to get Italian.

337

You can get falafels like it's anything but Scottish food.
Yeah.

338
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.350

We don't want to eat it.
Okay.

339
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.710

00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:50.760
There's no fucking God damn guilt when you were in Scotland and it rains every

421
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.610
day,
you go walk around and you say,
hey,

422
00:25:53.611 --> 00:25:58.500
my balls are dry because it my undies,
I lift up my fucking skirt.
Oh yeah.

423
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.510
Who wants to play the bagpipes?
No one.
All right,
me undies.
Uh,

424
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.400
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

425
00:26:05.401 --> 00:26:08.790
you spent almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're Matthew

426
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:12.940
mcconaughey.
And then it's like,
I don't think he wears underwear.
It does it.

427
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.640
He's too busy running down the beach with those fucking leaves in his hands.
Uh,

428
00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:21.840
but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

429
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:25.760
clothing,
your underwear's probably boring.
Well,

430
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:27.230
me undies is here to change that.

431
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.300
Some reason they can't handle the fact that you fucking underwear just looks at

432
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.320
regular underwear.
Uh,

433
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.230
every pair of me undies is made of a sustainable source.
Modal,
modal,

434
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.380
a fabric.
That's twice as soft as cotton.

435
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.370
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies.
But once you try them on,

436
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.190
you'll understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

437
00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:52.830
That always bugs me.

438
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.940
It says nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies yet I have to

439
00:26:55.941 --> 00:26:59.660
continue fucking reading them describing this shit for another three minutes.

440
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.640
Either you can describe it or you can't me undies.
What's with all the copy?

441
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:10.400
Um,
I love when people say that I don't have this like no words can describe.

442
00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:13.070
Well then shut up and just shut the fuck up.
Alright.

443
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.420
Just stare straight ahead and finish your drink,
right?
You can't.
All right.

444
00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:21.920
If you don't,
the first pair of me undies,
they're free.
No questions asked me.

445
00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:26.120
Andy's is to test dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a

446
00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:27.320
statement with your underwear.

447
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.850
Which statement do you need to make other than my Dick won't pop out when I walk

448
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:34.820
across the front of the bed,
over to the bathroom.
Uh,

449
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.920
whether anyone could see them or not.
Remember,

450
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:40.070
superman shipping is free in the United States and Canada.

you only start com slash for burp.
Sorry.
Oh,
here they are.

457
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.040
Oh,
what time is it everybody?
It's time for MVMT watches.

458
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.720
You know,
when you're,
when you're in your early twenties and thirties,

459
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.450
money can be tight to keep doing drugs.

460
00:28:14.451 --> 00:28:17.030
It'll have the same thing will happen in your forties and 50s.

461
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:22.390
And then in your sixties,
you know,
you'll be sleeping outside.
Um,

462
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.970
if you're not careful,
dressy well could quickly drag your bag.

463
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.900
Why am I yawning so much?
Kind of a nice night's sleep.
Uh,

464
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.880
like spending $400 to $500 on a department store.

465
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:39.881
Watch is some brands out there charging insane prices for watches that aren't

466
00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:43.450
even worth it.
Well,
if you want to look great when you go up,

467
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.370
it's still have money to buy him or her a drink.

468
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.710
I love the political correctness of that.
Oh yeah.

469
00:28:48.711 --> 00:28:51.050
Because so many women are going up buying guys drinks.

470
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.490
Close your eyes and even try and imagine what the fuck that looks like.
You know,

471
00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.720
I,
I've never seen that in my life and all my fucking years of going out there

472
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.710
trying to be nice to these fucking who was,

473
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.730
I think maybe two or three women have ever bought me a drink.
You know,

474
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.740
I've bought plenty of women at drink,
plenty of fucking women to drink.
You know,

475
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.490
Jesus Christ is a line around the fucking block.
And you know,
did,
did they,

476
00:29:18.491 --> 00:29:20.500
did they fucking pay me back?
I don't think they did.

477
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.550
The one that you can't afford a watch,
right?
Checkout Movement,
watches.com I've,

478
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.020
I've seen them before and these watches are sharp.
I hate when they do that shit.

479
00:29:29.021 --> 00:29:32.230
I haven't seen it before.
You fucking send it to me.
I never saw him before that.

One more.
Oh,

495
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.540
simply safe everybody.
You know,

496
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.320
thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.

497
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.880
Isn't that ironic?

498
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.070
And the home security industry wants you to believe it's your only option.

499
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.720
They've got hoards of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of

500
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:48.400
their longterm contracts.

501
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:53.470
You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.

502
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.150
Like that fucking movie,
that Stat Kevin Costner.

503
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.380
It's a robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands,

504
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:07.570
but there's a better way to protect your home.
Simply safe home security.

none.

and they have a little award show.

508
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.390
Does Billy crystal come out and host it and do a little song and dance

509
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:26.200
beforehand?
Okay.
Security professionals watching,

510
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.870
ready to instantly send the police.
And I love that they're not the cops.

511
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.690
Oh my God,
something's,

512
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:39.460
I bet they still have the balls to have a fucking uniform too and it's just 1499

513
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:42.130
a month.
That's less than half of what companies charged.

519
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.390
Evidently that's how he's saying.
Um,
I gotta be honest with you,

520
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.430
it does not sound right.
Um,
but whatever,
I don't write this shit.

521
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.260
Hey.
So I went out last night and I had a couple,
two,
three,
four,
five,

522
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:21.400
14 drinks last night and I was wearing my action slacks there.

523
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.770
And I gotta tell you,
I know this sounds like more advertising,

524
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.410
but a big fucking,
you know,
I tried to knock the head off my beer,

525
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.780
which I thought I did,

526
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.460
and then I looked down and it landed right on my leg and I went to shit.

527
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.980
It's gonna Stain.
I wiped it off and like

528
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.460
<v 3>literally nothing happened was totally fine.</v>

529
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.550
They like the greatest fucking pants I've ever had in my life,

530
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.350
but I look like a complete asshole with them,
you know?
But you know,

531
00:32:50.351 --> 00:32:54.950
this is not how life is.
Isn't there always a price to pay?

532
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.070
Um,
all right,
so this is it.

533
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.090
This is my last fucking few hours here in Scotland.
And,
um,

534
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.230
two would not have had a better time,

535
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:11.260
but I am fucking ready to get out of this gloom and fucking doom of this God

536
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:17.030
damn place.
Holy Shit.
I mean,
it just feels like march.

537
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.820
It's August and it just feels like it's cold.
It's fucking rainy.
It's overcast.

538
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.110
Uh,
went to a couple of great bars last night was funny.

539
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:31.490
Talking to de Rosa draws us.
He's such a fucking animal,
you know.
He's like,
Hey,

540
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:33.710
let's go to the festival fucking bar.
It's like,

541
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:36.560
why the fuck would you want to go to the comedy festival thing?
We would,

542
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:40.250
they last night they're serving Guinness and Scotch and plastic cups.

543
00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.693
<v 5>You don't</v>

544
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.750
<v 3>have a little bit of respect for yourself.</v>

545
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:48.800
Can we at least go to a place that has a,
has a glass,
you know,

546
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.110
so we ended up finding some bar.

547
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.863
<v 5>MMM.</v>

548
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.541
<v 3>It was great.
You just,</v>

549
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:58.270
can we just come walking in and there's these two guys sitting down.

550
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.810
One was playing the guitar,
the other guys playing the accordion,

551
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:05.730
this singing all these fucking songs.
It's tremendous,
right?

552
00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.490
This is what kills me.
I apologize for making all you guys yarn.

553
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.960
I don't really apologize.
This fucking podcast is for free,

554
00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:14.860
so I don't give a shit.

555
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:22.050
This is what kills me is I'm sitting at the bar and after about fucking a half

556
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.850
hour,
I find a look over it.
The fucking people,
uh,

557
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.810
with the guitar and the accordion and I look over now there's a woman sitting

558
00:34:31.451 --> 00:34:31.620
there,

559
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.440
she's playing the fiddle and there's some other guys sitting down there and he's

560
00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:38.800
playing the accordion.
I mean,
what are the odds of them?
What are the,

561
00:34:38.801 --> 00:34:42.940
what are the odds that you're even going to walk into a bar and there's somebody

562
00:34:42.941 --> 00:34:44.950
that,
that Ha Natalie has an accordion,

563
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.460
knows how to play it and a half hour later somebody else comes in.

564
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.060
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

565
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.970
<v 3>And you can just hand it off to them.
Like it's a fucking guitar.</v>

566
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.473
<v 5>You know?</v>

567
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.410
<v 3>What is it a fucking squeezebox festival over here?</v>

568
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.440
I've never seen that in my life.
Do you have any fucking bars?
I've gone to.

569
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.650
I don't either,
but it's a lot.

570
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.060
I've never seen anybody play an accordion and a bar in my life till I came to

571
00:35:10.061 --> 00:35:13.150
Scotland.
I,
right.

572
00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.820
It's fucking guys playing the shit out of it.

573
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:19.120
And then when I look over to go see the Eddie van Halen and fucking,
you know,

574
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:24.190
squeezebox is still playing.
It's,
it's somebody else.
But then again,

575
00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:25.450
maybe he called up his friend.

576
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.223
<v 5>Right.</v>

577
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.750
<v 3>And you know how plumbers though other plumbers,</v>

578
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.203
<v 5>right?</v>

579
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.550
<v 3>Hairdressers hanging out with hairdressers may be accordion players hang out</v>

580
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:38.070
with each other.
I don't know.
It's kind

581
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 6>of a weird thing.
Right.
Do you think a
serial killer cell,
that's,</v>

582
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:46.230
that's one that's very rare.
They don't hang out with each other.
You know,

583
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.370
it's just a quiet,

584
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.630
unspoken respect that they have with each other as they sit there on death row.

585
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.890
You know,
I wonder if that's a regret.
You know,

586
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:59.100
I should have hung out more with more complete fucking sociopath's.

587
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.140
If I could do it all over again,
you know,

588
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:03.360
I would have been part of a serial killer team,

589
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.560
so I could have shared those members with people.
Fucking,

590
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.840
that was really dark.
I apologize.

591
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.350
<v 5>Um,
all right.</v>

592
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:17.840
<v 6>I think I gave you my half hour.
Yeah,
there we go.
Okay.
So,
um,</v>

593
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.120
thank you for listening.
I am now my way to Germany and uh,

594
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.840
very excited.

595
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.360
Never been there before and I was just talking to a friend of mine has played

596
00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:30.910
some gigs over there and said they're always fucking great crowds,

597
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.260
which makes sense,
you know,
it makes sense that they would be great crowds,

598
00:36:35.261 --> 00:36:37.560
you know,
they got to make up for,
you know,

599
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.450
they're going to make up for it,
you know,
starting a couple of world wars,

600
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.370
right?
I was poor pastor,
so I'm going to give them shit today.

601
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.330
I'm going to give them shit.
I'm just going to be like,
you know,
you,

602
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.730
you fucking guys,
all your contributions that you've made,
you know,

603
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.810
from audio tape to some of the greatest automobiles people have ever seen.

604
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.370
And it's just,
it's just a goddamn shame that

605
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.140
no one's ever going to think of that first because you picked one Ron guy,

606
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.450
that's all.
They didn't show me.
They just,

607
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:17.451
they picked one wrong guy and it just turned out to be the biggest fucking

608
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:21.540
lunatic in modern history.

609
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.360
Somebody had to pick up.
You know,
this is a thing too,

610
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.610
as Trump is doing what he's still wanted.
People like,

611
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:32.670
if people try to compare Trump to Hitler,
you know what I mean?

612
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:36.030
Let me give me a fucking break.
He's nowhere near and Hitler's league,

613
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.273
<v 5>right?</v>

614
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.370
<v 6>Hitler used to crush those speeches.
Donald Trump is just rumbling,
bumbling,</v>

615
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:45.204
stumbling.

616
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.693
<v 5>You know what I mean?</v>

617
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.520
<v 6>His whole campaign has just been like a fucking Hail Mary and went up in the air</v>

618
00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:56.260
and everybody's going knock.
Yeah,
Dow,
knock it down.
Right.

619
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.750
What happened?
Or lack it goes up and he tries to catch the fucking thing.

620
00:38:01.751 --> 00:38:04.600
It's someone slaps it out of his hand and then landed.
It's,
I dunno,

621
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.810
landed in Hillary Clinton's fucking cleavage.

622
00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:13.060
And now these are the two clowns we've got to look at.
Tell you it's a rough one.

623
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.210
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll,
uh,
have a wonderful weekend.

624
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.400
You and I'll check in on you.

625
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.953
<v 5>MMM,</v>

626
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.670
<v 6>no,
I'm checking in on you now.
I'll talk to you on Monday.</v>

627
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.260
That's what I'm trying to say.
Right?

628
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.773
<v 5>Okay.</v>

629
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.890
<v 7>Abraham,
kill me a son.
Say,
man,</v>

630
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.310
you must be putting me on.
No,

631
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.690
I say you can do what you want him.

632
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.960
Next time you see me coming,
you better run.

633
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.930
Where do you want this?
God Six.

634
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.963
There was

635
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:14.770
Georgia,
Sam,
he did a bloody nose
and get him.

636
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:18.880
No clue.
Can I go?

637
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.230
That is all in one place.
I know Sam,
Sam,

638
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:26.170
tell man quick man,
I got to run

639
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.120
with his gun is way down.

640
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:38.830
Highway 61.

641
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.990
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

642
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.140
August 11th.
And uh,

643
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.790
this week I am going to be at the Improv in Miami,

644
00:39:56.791 --> 00:40:00.780
Florida on uh,
August 14th.

645
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.900
That's Thursday through Sunday.
August 17th.

646
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:08.220
And I'm one of those days I'm going to a Florida Marlin's game,

647
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.900
the Mylans as they say back in Boston.
And um,

648
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.750
that is the last professional baseball team franchise that I need to see.

649
00:40:18.751 --> 00:40:23.430
And then I have seen all of them.
And,
uh,
it was something that,
you know,

650
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.260
as I've been on the road over the years,

651
00:40:25.261 --> 00:40:29.910
I always wanted to go to every baseball stadium and,
uh,

652
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.750
I will have accomplished it this week and got to admit it's kind of an empty

653
00:40:36.001 --> 00:40:40.560
feeling,
you know what I mean?
Because it's not the goal.

654
00:40:40.561 --> 00:40:43.890
It's more the journey,
you know,

655
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.230
you don't really think it is really,

656
00:40:46.231 --> 00:40:49.530
it's the fact that I went to all of them by myself.

657
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.030
I think that that's what it has to do with actually the last third I started

658
00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:55.110
going with other people,

659
00:40:55.111 --> 00:41:00.111
but I have pictures of me in front of every major sports stadium that you can

660
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:04.350
think of.
God dammit,

661
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.840
that exists or doesn't exist anymore because they've torn down so many of them

662
00:41:09.841 --> 00:41:12.420
since I'd been on the road.
Um,

663
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.480
I have like a certain level of OCD where I get in.

664
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.170
It's not like I open and close the fucking door 58 times as,

665
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:27.090
um,
you know,
counting up to 100 by odd numbers,

666
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.430
which I guess is in Paul hundred and one by odd numbers.
Yeah.
Um,

667
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:33.710
I don't have kind of shit.

668
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:38.060
I just have like I get into shit and when I get into what,

669
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.090
I just get psycho into it and it lasts for about a month and a half and then I

670
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:49.340
just don't give a shit about it anymore.

671
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.090
And that probably explains why I haven't been able to sustain a relationship in

672
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:57.530
my life.
Um,
it's a whole nother story,

673
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.551
but no,

674
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:02.420
it's something that I did when I went on the road because going on the road

675
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:02.931
sucks.

676
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:07.931
But I remember as a kid when I used to watch before there was ever even sports

677
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:09.980
center,
let's go back here,

678
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.960
go back in the day for all you youngsters out there who enjoy,
you know,

679
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:20.000
five or six different 24 hour sports channels.

680
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.040
Um,
back in the day they didn't,

681
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.160
they didn't have shit like that.
They sports used to come on,

682
00:42:28.161 --> 00:42:30.680
you'd get the local sports guy in my neck of the woods.

683
00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:35.330
It was Bob Lowe Bell and the guy would come on,
you know,
six o'clock news.

684
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.360
He would come on at about six 36 35 and if you were lucky,

685
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:45.170
you'd get six,
seven minutes of sports.
You know what I mean?

686
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:48.950
And that'd be,
you know,
whatever the greatest play around the league was,

687
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.460
you'd get that and then maybe you'd get a whatever your closest rival was doing,

688
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.150
but it was very quick and it was very local.

689
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:04.250
It was definitely just mostly about your team and how your team fit into the

690
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:07.220
overall scheme of stuff.
And uh,

691
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.440
but I remember he used to watch this week in baseball.

692
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:13.910
He used to come on once a week with,
with Mel Allen and it,

693
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.320
well how's that sound?
Was like been done,
done,
done.

694
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.190
Bought up a Ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba.

695
00:43:20.191 --> 00:43:23.690
And I'd be sitting in my pajamas watching the fucking show,
you know,

696
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:24.560
I get chills.

697
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.730
Sports were bigger than life back then cause I was a little kid and they also

698
00:43:28.731 --> 00:43:33.590
didn't come on all the time.
You know what I mean?
They didn't,
back in the day,

699
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:37.130
if Manny Ramirez went from the fucking red sox to the Dodgers,

700
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.690
that would be,

701
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.920
it'd be in the paper for a day or two maybe locally,

702
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:46.790
but around the all whole league of be there once to just be an MP.
Just a blurb,

703
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.790
American league,
slugger,
Manny Ramirez,
attention,

704
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:53.421
ladies and gentlemen,

705
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:56.170
all the ships and say they would just be a quick little thing and that would be,

706
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.190
it wouldn't be up his ass every five seconds,

707
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.230
measuring the length of his dreadlocks the way they do now.
So,
um,

708
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:08.960
that's the thing.
So I don't know,
as a kid,
I always wanted to go to,
uh,

709
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.800
I used to think about that.
How cool would it be to go to the different stadiums?

710
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:15.200
So when I went on the road,
it dawned on me one day,

711
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.070
I don't know where the fuck I was at,
maybe I was in Seattle and I was like,

712
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:23.840
you know what,
the fucking kingdom,
the fucking kingdom,

713
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.350
Seattle Mariners,
Seattle Seahawks,

714
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.220
that bald guy who paints his head,
like the helmet,

715
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:35.370
that fucking place is right down the street.
And I would just,
uh,

716
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.990
if I had time,
I would go to a game.
And,
um,

717
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.750
I dunno,
I just started doing it.

718
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:45.180
Then I just started scheduling my road gigs around it.

719
00:44:45.181 --> 00:44:47.670
And this is how my OCD kicked in.
It was like,
you know what,

720
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:52.110
I'd like to go to all the great baseball stadiums.
Started off with that.

721
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:56.100
I'll go to fucking,
you know,
Fenway,
which I've where I'm from,
Yankee stadium,

722
00:44:56.101 --> 00:45:00.090
Wrigley,
Camden yards,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then it became,
ah,

723
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.320
I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna know every baseball stadium.
Right?

724
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.050
And then my OCD was like,
well,
I don't,
well what about footfall?

725
00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.240
I'm like,
I'll go to all the football.
Then it became all the hockey,

726
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:13.074
then it became,

727
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.160
I am going to go to every fucking stadium in all four professional sports.

728
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.303
Okay.

729
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:28.430
And I'd be on the plane like rain man writing down and those little cocktail

730
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:31.770
napkins that you get from the stewardesses,
right.

731
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.780
And I would be writing down how many I had and which divisions,
like,

732
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.610
like a fucking psycho.

733
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.560
And it was something that totally appealed to my brain and made the flight go by

734
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.210
quicker.
So a long story short,

735
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.260
I believe I used to know this shit because I kind of stopped giving a fuck.

736
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:52.581
You don't.

737
00:45:52.581 --> 00:45:57.180
It was when I went to a golden state warriors game by myself when they socked.

738
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.480
And I was holding their free go warriors sign.

739
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.640
That's when I knew right then and there,

740
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.300
I think I have that picture on my website to build [inaudible] dot com and I

741
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:07.820
think I wrote underneath,
it's something about,

742
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:12.330
that's when I realized that I had a problem or I was sick,
but um,

743
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.230
I don't know.
It's like 122 teams or something.

744
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.750
They might have added a few since I last did the Raymond thing,

745
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:24.690
but I have been to
I think like 85

746
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.110
85.
Can you fucking believe that by myself for the most part,

747
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:35.990
like 72 of those I went by myself and um,

748
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:41.070
this is the last baseball one and then I can basically check baseball off other

749
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:44.460
than a few new stadiums that they,
that they made.

750
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:48.930
I haven't been in the new Philly one.
I haven't been to the new Padres one,

751
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.120
but other than that,
I've been to all of them,
which is pretty fucking cool,

752
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.140
but also pathetic and sad on some level.
Um,

753
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.140
but I literally just forgot my whole fucking train of thought there.

754
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.210
That was such a long goddamn story.
Oh,
I know.

755
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:10.260
So last one I'm going to go down into is this fucking the Marlins one and it's

756
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.900
going to be a day game in fucking Miami.

757
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:16.820
So it'll be like nine zillion degrees out and uh,

758
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:20.960
then we'll be done with baseball then.
You know what?

759
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.400
Then I'm not going to know what the fuck to do with myself.

760
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.930
That's the empty feeling.

761
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.060
I'm not going to know what to do with myself when I go on the road and uh,

762
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.850
and it's the summertime.
What the fuck am I going to do?

763
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.330
What am I going to do to kill a day?
Go to a museum.

764
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.660
You know,
something.

765
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.570
This would actually be fucking interesting if I actually took pictures of all

766
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:45.430
this shit.
I can make a great coffee book,

767
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:51.550
Coffee Table Book of all the Shit I've done by myself.

768
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.240
The space needle,
I didn't do it by myself.
Oh,
I did.
I,
yes I did.

769
00:47:58.241 --> 00:47:59.500
I went up that by myself.

770
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:03.400
And another time I was doing a college gig with Ben Bailey.
Oh,

771
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:04.330
we didn't go up in it.

772
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.680
He just wanted me to take a picture of him with that thing in the background

773
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.920
I think.
Right.
Jesus Christ.
I'm this,
this,

774
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:17.440
this podcast is really depressing.
The Shit on me.

775
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.790
Let's bring up some good memories because you're probably thinking right now,

776
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:23.500
if you're a baseball fan,
you probably like bill,

777
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.160
what were your favorite fucking state of best?
One I went to was a,

778
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.220
the old tiger stadium.
Um,

779
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.550
cause we have that upper deck that went around the entire,

780
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.810
the entire field.
And I remember I went to a game,

781
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:42.790
it was an inner league game against the pirates and it was dusk and it

782
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.624
literally,

783
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.070
I don't know why it looked like it was 1907 when you were in there and you

784
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.450
literally thought ty Cobb

785
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:56.020
would come running out on the field screaming a bunch of racist shit or whatever

786
00:48:56.021 --> 00:49:00.370
the fuck they say about him.
The hard drinking racist,

787
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.490
he'd sharpen the spikes in carnival that,

788
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:05.470
that guys in the hall of fame and Pete Rose's.

789
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.560
And although I understand it on a level,
you know what I mean?

790
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:15.390
Because what Pete rose did actually I would say affected the entire integrity of

791
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:20.670
the game.
He could have brought everybody down,
but you know,

792
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.990
you know what the bottom line is?
I mean,
they just busted a rough word,

793
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:26.560
mob ties and the fucking NBA,
you know what I mean?
And uh,

794
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.340
we're still watching hoop and people are still gambling on it.
You know why?

795
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:33.700
Because we have fucking nothing better to do.
All right.

796
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:37.940
That was a long ass fucking story.
Um,
I hope it was remotely interesting.
Ah,

797
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:43.000
let's get it onto the podcast.
Questions here.
Uh,
question number one,

798
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.420
Bill,
if you,
Lisa,
some brutal questions this week,
by the way.

799
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.960
I think all the superficial ones are over and you guys are going from Merrill.

800
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:53.950
So listen to these fucking questions and if you knew to my page,
okay,

801
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:59.110
if you are new to my page,
you know,
if you haven't gone over to,
uh,

802
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.460
to Facebook,
you know what I mean?

803
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.070
Does anybody else feel like when you're in my space,
like you're,
you're,

804
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.550
you're in like a failing restaurant.
You know what I mean?

805
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:16.760
That's what I feel like I'm just staring across them all at the newer,

806
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:21.550
shiny or one,
you know,
I got my apron around my waist,

807
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:28.100
you know,
my wife,
my fantasy wife comes up to me.

808
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:31.760
Just go on.
It's okay if people will come back,

809
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.430
you know,
we've been down before.

810
00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:38.720
We could get through anything as long as you are me and I love you,

811
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:46.160
God damn cough ruin that Improv.
Um,
anyways.
Okay.
Question number one.

812
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.950
If you had to choose between losing your ability to perform standup slash being

813
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:56.900
funny,
meaning you'll never perform again.
Never be on radio,
a radio show.

814
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.330
This dude even took radio out of the picture and I'd have to go work at a normal

815
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:07.100
job in quotes or lose the ability to get an erection.

816
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.210
What would you pick?
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
Yeah,

817
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:16.620
and in my life on both of them,
but

818
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.460
after a long painful thought,
ah,

819
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.640
I had to go to

820
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.270
either one that I picked.

821
00:51:29.271 --> 00:51:32.330
My life is over and it's going to ruin the enjoyment of the other thing.

822
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.650
You know what I mean?
Like if,

823
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.140
if I can still get an erection now,
I'm just not a comedian anymore.
And then,

824
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.340
then,
then you say,
I have to go work a normal job.
First of all,
do it.

825
00:51:43.341 --> 00:51:45.110
I've been doing standup for 16 years.

826
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.250
That's kind of a huge gap to have in your resume.
All right,

827
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:53.120
I have a communications degree and you're taking my ability to do radio off the

828
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:56.150
fucking table.
So,
uh,
basically

829
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.900
my option is to go wash dishes in a restaurant and try to fuck every waitress

830
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:07.790
who works there or continue living my dream as a comedian.
You know what?

831
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:08.624
I'd have to,

832
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.100
I'd have to choose losing the ability to get an erection.

833
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:19.310
Can I take Viagara Bob Dole can't get an erection.

834
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:23.870
And I know he was real happy when that shit came out,
I guess.

835
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:27.300
Is that cheating?
Um,

836
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.980
now because you know what?
I have a chance to make

837
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:36.110
my mark as a comedian because it's something I'm really good at and I can

838
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.900
actually somehow work my way

839
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.480
up the ladder and at least feel like I achieved something.

840
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.350
And,
uh,
I mean,
what am I going to get into the,
the,

841
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.193
the,

842
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.280
the pussy fucking all time pussy getting guys,
you know what I do at this point,

843
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.680
you know,
I mean,
ah,
Jesus Christ.
You,
you're an asshole.

844
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:07.340
Whoever wrote that you were an asshole.
It's a great fucking question.

845
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.160
Jesus Christ.
Would I be funny if I couldn't fuck anymore?
Holy Shit.

846
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.590
The pent up energy,

847
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.760
I'd be like 80 years old still jumping around like fucking Brian Regan.

848
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:23.620
They'd be like,
I don't know.
He does it.
He,
he never lost the fire.
I'll tie.

849
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.880
Did I fucking did it?
I couldn't.
I hadn't been able to fuck this.
I was 40.

850
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.650
How about that?
All right,
question number two.

851
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.760
Uh,
okay,

852
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:37.470
so you didn't get to this one last time.

853
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:41.580
So let's see if you do this time around most humiliating medical experience.

854
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:45.630
What do you think?
Jock itch or a colonoscopy,

855
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.080
however the fuck you say it.
A colonoscopy without a doubt.

856
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.930
You know what I mean?
A jock itch.
I believe that's over the counter.

857
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.670
You just have to subtly walk down that aisle at the pharmacy and act like you're

858
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.390
looking for diet coke.
You know Jock Itch,
isn't that right?

859
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:06.900
Next to athlete's foot,
you just walked down the itchy aisle.

860
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.760
What would happen if you put the athlete's foot stuff

861
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.830
in your job?
What is jock itch junkets basically.

862
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:22.950
It doesn't mean you sweat your balls off.
You don't change your underwear.

863
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.100
First of all were boxers.
Okay.
Creates a little more ventilation.

864
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:33.600
You don't keep everything,
all that.
It's just disgusting.
That's fucking gross.

865
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:39.270
Jesus Christ.
One painful question.
One one disgusting one.
Alright.
Colonoscopy.

866
00:54:39.271 --> 00:54:42.060
Yeah.
I don't want to do that.
I don't want it.
No,
I don't want to do that.

867
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.741
First of all,

868
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:46.620
because they're going to be able to figure out a way that to look in your ass

869
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:49.320
without going into your ass.
I'm holding out for that.

870
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:54.240
I've seen some stories on the news about it.
Nobody's entering my ass.
I don't.

871
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:58.410
Okay.
I don't give a shit if he got the fucking lab coat on or any of that crap.

872
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:01.320
I'm not doing it.
I'm not.
No.
Fuck you.
And I'm looking in there.
Yeah.

873
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:04.560
You're going to find something the same way.
I mean,
I'm fucking 40 years old.

874
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:07.080
You're going to find something.
I'd be like,
if you had an old car,

875
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.440
somebody starts fucking,
you know,
looking down in the Pistons,

876
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:15.330
you're going to find something down there.
Know we need to do,
yeah,

877
00:55:15.331 --> 00:55:17.730
nothing.
That's what we need to do.
You asshole.

878
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.830
Stop trying to make a mortgage payment with my anus.
All right.

879
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:28.770
Oh Jesus.
All right.
Sorry.
I'm still a little fucking sick here.

880
00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:30.930
All right,
number three,
bill,

881
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.900
have you ever had a problem with the girlfriend getting mad at you that you

882
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:37.290
whack off to porn?
You know,

883
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:39.630
whack off is one of the worst ways of putting it.
You know,

884
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.640
that really just makes me seem pathetic.
Like I'm just slamming,

885
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:46.440
slamming it against the inside of my leg.
Um,

886
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.121
and this guy says,

887
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:52.500
I don't girls who say that they consider it cheating and I think that's bullshit

888
00:55:52.501 --> 00:55:56.670
because?
Because it's not real and you just rub one out with a visual aid.

889
00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:01.200
I just don't think fantasy shit should be outlawed just because you're in a

890
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:04.260
relationship.
What do you think?
Well,

891
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:10.140
I admit that it isn't cheating because cheating,
um,

892
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:16.290
you know,
she ain't,
you got to be somehow with another live human being.

893
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.900
Okay.
And,
um,
no matter how enjoyable,
uh,

894
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:25.900
I almost said whacking off like you fucking rubber one out to porn can be,

895
00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.310
but it's still something pathetic about it,
you know?

896
00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.260
And that's that feeling of guilt afterwards where you think it's your parent.

897
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:38.980
If you know something your parents said or maybe your church,
but it isn't,

898
00:56:38.981 --> 00:56:43.840
it's the patheticness that's your male DNA going.
You know,

899
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.700
you couldn't find somebody alive to do this with,
you know what I mean?

900
00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:52.720
You're useless.
You're not a hunter.
You're a gatherer.

901
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.750
And why don't you go out in the kitchen and go eat some berries?

902
00:56:55.751 --> 00:57:00.550
You fucking pussy.
Um,
no,
I don't think it's cheating,

903
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.090
but I don't think you should do it,
uh,
with your girlfriend one about it.

904
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.380
Unless she's into it.
You know,
how creepy would that be?
Well,
she,

905
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:10.210
she's like one of those creepy fucking dudes.

906
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.780
If you see those dudes who like want to see somebody banged their wife and they

907
00:57:13.781 --> 00:57:15.940
just sit there peak in and while you're doing it,
you know,

908
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.050
you haven't seen those videos.

909
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:21.180
It's fucking creepy things with the girlfriend was like that on to Pekin.

910
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.910
I'm literally losing every female in the podcast right now.
They're all going

911
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:31.570
tot up.
All right.
Um,

912
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.420
yeah,
I don't think it's cheating,
but uh,
I also,
you know,

913
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:41.050
I'm really anti porn.
I just don't think it's good.

914
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:44.500
I just talk about that on stage.
This is how I view,
I feel like,

915
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:49.530
I think your soul is like pixelated and every time you look at some shit that

916
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:53.410
you shouldn't,
this shouldn't be looking at a couple of cubes,

917
00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:57.220
just float away and,
and you never get them back.
You know what I mean?

918
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.590
It's kind of like that back to the future,
you know,

919
00:58:00.591 --> 00:58:03.790
we start to fade away except it's your soul,
you know,

920
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.110
she's probably slipped the fuck am I talking about?
All right,
here's somebody,
um,

921
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.880
starts off,
it says my best question yet.

922
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:17.890
We'll give this guy patting himself on the back.
How do or how,
uh,

923
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.940
how do you feel about potentially hurting slash embarrassing your family?

924
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.950
I think they mean with,
uh,

925
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:29.980
with some of your material.
Um,
yeah,
I'm definitely conscious of that.
That's why,

926
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:34.750
you know,
I usually just tell over the top stories and,
uh,

927
00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:38.830
I try not to make anybody look too,
too bad.
I toned everything down,

928
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:43.150
but I'm definitely conscious of that.
So,
yeah.
How I feel about that,

929
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:47.140
I feel like I don't want to embarrass them.
Um,
question number five,

930
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:52.120
what is your favorite Olympic event to watch?
And by the way,
phone,

931
00:58:52.121 --> 00:58:57.110
sex is the cure for AIDS is my new myspace quote.
Um,

932
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.920
oh,
thank you.
I'm glad you and Julie one on,
let's see.

933
00:58:59.921 --> 00:59:03.850
What is your favorite Olympic events?
We'll watch Jesus Christ.
Uh,

934
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.180
what is it?
Um,
I like the 100 meter dash,

935
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:14.290
the one that Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis did.
I liked that one.

936
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:18.250
The fastest fuckers on the earth.
I don't mind the swimming.

937
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:23.840
I actually like the volleyball,
especially female volleyball,
you know,

938
00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.650
I dunno.
Volleyball makes girls,
the thighs are all sick.

939
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:31.330
They'll get booties anyway.
Those fucking,
uh,

940
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.860
sergeant slaughter onesies.
Um,

941
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:41.090
the boxing,
I like a lot of this shit to downhill skiing.

942
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.350
I like,
I actually like a lot of the events,
the hockeys great.

943
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.700
Jesus Christ and I have the basketball.
I haven't watched any of them.

944
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.710
I don't know why.
I haven't watched any of it.

945
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:55.010
I just realized I really liked the Olympics.
Um,

946
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:58.040
I'm hoping there's some point they come back to La and then when the coliseum

947
00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:01.650
right down the fucking street,
wouldn't that be great?
Uh,

948
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.660
uh,
uh,
all the way I see USC Trojan saw.

949
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.730
How the fuck does the Olympic Song,
wait,
I'm hearing it then.

950
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:17.610
Wow.
I can only hear the first note.
I'd suck on that name.
That tune show.

951
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.570
How does it go now?
I've got the Trojan Song in my head.

952
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.450
Don't you fucking hate when you do it?
Wait a minute.

953
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.360
Oh,
it's fucking,
that's the graduation song.

954
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.340
Fuck.
Does he Olympic Song Go.
You know what?

955
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.910
If anybody can email me writing like almost like,

956
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.550

You know,
anything that that's stressed.

957
01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:49.910
He just capitalize

958
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:54.800
the DA,
Da,
Da,
Da,
dat,
dat that,

uh,
that,

959
01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:56.510
that,
that that's it right there.

960
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:02.250
Just had to think of fucking Jim Mckay able to see blah,
blah blah before,

961
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.180
um,
all right.

962
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:09.740
And with that we are now into last week I was sick and uh,

963
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.630
what do you guys want to hear first?
You want to hear,
uh,

964
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.610
we'll close with underrated.
Overrated,

965
01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:17.150
which is a topic that's really been taken off.
So if he hadn't been listening,

966
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.130
people have been sending into the,

967
01:01:19.131 --> 01:01:24.131
in their list of shit that they think is overrated and underrated and a very

968
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.490
passionate subject because you know how it is you watching TV and there'll be

969
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:30.380
somebody who you think is,

970
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:35.470
is who is great and they're not on TV or you think a band is cool and no one's

971
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:36.854
listening to them.

972
01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:40.250
And then there's something that everybody's into and you just think it

973
01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:43.190
absolutely sucks and it drives you nuts.

974
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:45.350
After a while you start walking around talking to himself.

975
01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:47.750
And that's how I think that's why the a,

976
01:01:47.751 --> 01:01:50.960
the overrated or underrated list have taken off.
But before we get into that,

977
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.920
for those of you like myself who don't like getting cold,

978
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.780
here are some people's cold remedies.
All right,
Skye,
number one.

979
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:04.010
Uh,
I see you got a cold,
aren't you perceptive?

980
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:07.760
Um,
he said,
here's a rough recipe to handle that cold.

981
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.850
And this is what I love about this fucking email.

982
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.290
This is a recipe and he gives me no measurements whatsoever.

983
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:20.640
All right?
Hey,
here's the recipe.
It's beef or can be chicken.

984
01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.250
Caltough a k a soup.

985
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.810
So it's beef Caldo or chicken Caldo or I guess soup,
okay?

986
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.810
I Dunno what the fuck cal domains,
but he says,
also known as soup,

987
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.550
like a committed a crime.
It needs an alias,
okay?
You make,
you make this,

988
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:37.590
you'll be straightened two days Max.

989
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.740
This is what always happens when you have a cold.
People come up to you,

990
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:44.490
you got to call bird.
All you gotta do is this,
man.
I'm telling you,

991
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:48.210
I do it all the time and every get a fucking call and three weeks later you see

992
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:52.440
the guy,
he's got to fucking call and you're like,
dude,
what happened?
Uh Oh dude.

993
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:57.120
You know,
the show didn't make the stuff well,
why didn't you make the stuff?

994
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.160
If it's,
uh,
if,
if,
if it automatically makes you not get a cold,
he fuckin ass all.

995
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:05.040
First of all,
nobody knows how to cure the common cold.
If you did,

996
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:10.290
you'd release it onto the market and you'd make a zillion dollars like that.

997
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:13.140
Chica did the airborne thing,
but this guy,

998
01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:16.020
evidently he's giving this thing away for free and be very cynical here and I

999
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:19.080
apologize.
All right,
here you go.
And uh,

1000
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:24.020
you'll be straight and to treat A's Max.
All right.
Um,

1001
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.510
[inaudible] he also said trash the tree that the t you got to,

1002
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:32.100
you need to get that cinnamon apple t the celestial shit with the lady in the

1003
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:35.250
front.
Yeah,
that's exactly how it went to the store.

1004
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:38.400
You got that cinnamon apple tea.
You know the [inaudible] seal shit with the,

1005
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.350
with the lady in the front there.

1006
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:44.520
Could you please not use that language in the store?
Okay.
And it's a woman,

1007
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.580
not a lady.
Okay.
We've progressed this weekend phone,
I'll fuck you.

1008
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:52.270
You con security.
All right.
Anyways,
you eat that stuff up.

1009
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.220
Sugar.
I'm okay.
Here are the ingredients for the soup ingredients.

1010
01:03:56.221 --> 01:04:01.050
Chicken or beef,
carrots,
cabbage,
corn,
potatoes and Jalapeno pepper.

1011
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.460
That's capitalized.
Not that can shit,
but the raw stuff,

1012
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:10.380
the stuff they pull out of the ground.
Get that peppers green in the soup.

1013
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.720
I don't know what it is,
but it helps for real.
Oh,

1014
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.990
but it helps for real son.
Anytime I'm sick,

1015
01:04:18.991 --> 01:04:21.390
if I have even feel something coming,
Bam.

1016
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.320
Capital letters make some Colorado and it's over and done.

1017
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.690
All right,
so maybe it doesn't matter.

1018
01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:30.330
Maybe you just take some beef or chicken stock.
Is that what you're saying?

1019
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.010
And I throw some carrots in there.

1020
01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:35.970
I feel like bugs bunny or fucking curly on three stooges.

1021
01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:36.830
I just throw the shit in.

1022
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:38.050
<v 9>They're going on.</v>

1023
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.960
<v 8>They just fucking throw in there.
Alright.</v>

1024
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.410
Compliment the soup was some corn tortillas too.
Hey,

1025
01:04:48.411 --> 01:04:50.090
if there's any Latino people listening to this,

1026
01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:54.020
can you please explain to me all that shit?
I get all that shit confused.

1027
01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:58.250
It's like I am anxiety when I go into a Mexican restaurant cause all I know it

1028
01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:03.251
Tacos and Burritos and when he get into tortillas and I chat at OPA and

1029
01:05:03.621 --> 01:05:04.454
Gorditos,

1030
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.880
I don't know what the fuck it is and I don't even know if it even is authentic

1031
01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:12.881
at this point because basically my education on Mexican food is Taco bell

1032
01:05:13.611 --> 01:05:16.670
commercials and I know that's white people doing it.
So,

1033
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:21.010
and they're just making up shit.
You know what I mean?

1034
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.270
They put extra layers of cheese in it.
Uh,
what is a Tortilla?

1035
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.180
Is that one of those round things

1036
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.450
that you fold up and it becomes a Burrito?
I Dunno,

1037
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.160
but anyways,
this guy says hazard was having with some Limonada.

1038
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.020
Is that,
is this kind of Latin,

1039
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:44.500
is that like fucking Mexican for lemonade or is there actually something called,

1040
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:45.041
oh,

1041
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:50.041
Limonata l I m o n a Da and put some garlic salt in there too.

1042
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.220
Also heat the meet up first then dumped the water.

1043
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.250
Do you know what this fucking recipe doesn't even make sense?

1044
01:05:57.251 --> 01:06:01.450
You'd be the worst fucking shift
on the food network.

1045
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:02.950
You've got it all.
You know this,

1046
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:07.951
there's no amounts getting it right in a dasher garlic salt and it puts some

1047
01:06:08.651 --> 01:06:12.520
fucking garlic salt in there too.
Okay,
I'll do that.
All right.

1048
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.830
Number two is if somebody else's,

1049
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.850
I'm actually getting stuffed up as I'm talking about this lead here in the bed.

1050
01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:21.710
Okay.
Number two.
Um,

1051
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.920
okay.
You've been sick on your podcast at least three times before.

1052
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.740
I think you get sick about every six months.
Ha Ha.

1053
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:33.460
There are signs the body gives that you should start to recognize before he get

1054
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:37.810
fully sick.
The first side you get.
Take something for God's sake.

1055
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.840
Ha Express is calling me a fucking idiot.
Um,

1056
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:47.920
I keep a bottle of Tylenol extra strength.
As soon as I feel a little different,

1057
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.230
I take two.
What?
I'm cool in the morning.
Try it.

1058
01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:54.850
I'm sure you'll get sick before Christmas.
Let me know if it works.
All right.

1059
01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.040
Why am I getting all fucking stuffed up now?
All right.
Number three,

1060
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:04.300
take new snacks for the kids.
For the congestion.

1061
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.030
The stuff is money for colds,
you know,

1062
01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:10.640
at this is just all over the counter shit.
You know what I mean?
I want,

1063
01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:13.960
I wanted like somebody secret grandparent were fucking recipe like that guy

1064
01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:16.900
above me.
Maybe that's why he didn't give me any sort of a,

1065
01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:22.630
he didn't give me any sort of fucking measurements.
He's protecting the recipe.

1066
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:25.240
All right,
here's one for garlic.

1067
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.730
Last week I was telling you how people say that garlic works.

1068
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:32.260
Here's a guy who claims he never gets sick.
He says,
first of all,
uh,

1069
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:35.050
I used to get back in the day I was a fucking health wreck.

1070
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.540
I used to get colds at least once,
twice a month.

1071
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:42.340
But today I haven't had a cold in about two years.
Now the secret is garlic.

1072
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:46.780
Whenever I feel like I'm catching a cold,
I eat two to four garlic cloves.

1073
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.440
I don't mash them up our slice them or anything else.

1074
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.750
Pussy like sky's very judgmental.
All right.

1075
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.720
And I just cut them up in two or three pieces and pop them like pills along with

1076
01:07:58.721 --> 01:08:03.190
a shitload of water.
And then of course I brushed my teeth.
Um,

1077
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.021
Hey,
who?

1078
01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:10.021
I know that it might sound somewhat off putting and somewhat off putting and

1079
01:08:11.111 --> 01:08:15.410
maybe a tad bit disgusting,
but dude,
it's fucking worth it.
You know what?

1080
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:16.244
I'm going to try that.

1081
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:20.750
I always go with the natural shit or whatever.

1082
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:25.550
I always go with however we originally did it because I just have a feeling that

1083
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.520
everything else is just fucking an evil way of making money.

1084
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.580
You know what I mean?
Don't listen to me.

1085
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:34.760
I know what the fuck I'm talking about that that would rule out penicillin which

1086
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:37.460
has saved people's lives and add it to the population problem.
And

1087
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.180
you know what I mean?
That's why everyone in China rides a bike.

1088
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.520
Not because they can't afford a car,
they just,
you wouldn't get anywhere.
Um,

1089
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.430
and then that's not even sure.

1090
01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.490
They don't all ride bikes and just made that up cause I was trying to get onto

1091
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:54.440
the overrated,
underrated,
the new hot topic here on,
uh,

1092
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:58.310
on my podcast.
Jesus Christ.
I'm running out of energy here.

1093
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.220
I still have lingering effects from that fucking super cold.
I called last week.

1094
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:03.980
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated.
And then I'm going to get the fuck outta here.

1095
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.770
Okay.
And once again,
people just let you know.
I do have my,
uh,

1096
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:10.440
my one hour special coming up as you can see the banner at the top of the page

1097
01:09:10.441 --> 01:09:12.530
and I look at me looking to the side like,
wow,

1098
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:17.300
I really do have a special August 31st.
Okay.
Overrated.

1099
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.710
Underrated.
Um,
let's see.
Fucking okay.

1100
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.520
Overrated.
Overrated.
Hang on,
let me get to it.
Let me get to it.

1101
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.110
Here's something that I,
that is overrated and not living up to the hype tattoos.

1102
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:35.150
Everyone in their fucking grandmother have the God Damn Tattoo and it's

1103
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:39.530
completely ruined the outlaw rebel status at once,
at once.
Had,

1104
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.140
you know what?
I got to agree with that.

1105
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:47.210
That's who you used to mean you are a bad ass.
You know what I mean?
As a guy,

1106
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:47.841
you know what I mean?

1107
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:50.680
That you could walk into a bar and if someone fucked with you,

1108
01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:55.550
you'd knocked her ass out.
And as a woman it used to mean you bet aware.

1109
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.970
Two condoms because I have fucked a lot of guys.

1110
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:04.580
That's what it used to mean.
Now it just means you're a follower.

1111
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.111
You know what I like?

1112
01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:09.590
I like the people who would have been the people who just got tattoos,

1113
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:13.550
but now they have to take it to the next level and they're doing that thing

1114
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:14.720
where they're

1115
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.780
trying to turn their fucking ear lobes into a gymnastic rings.

1116
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.680
I really don't understand that at all.

1117
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:26.450
That it is the most fucking disgusting thing.

1118
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.820
People getting tattoos on their faces now,
like that rapid,

1119
01:10:30.821 --> 01:10:35.230
they're out of Atlanta,
young wheezy,
wherever he is from.

1120
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.620
He turned me on to that guy recently.

1121
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.240
I actually think he's fucking funny as hell,

1122
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:42.290
but the tattoos or re I was actually joking with somebody.
You know what?

1123
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:43.640
That guy has tattoos look like.

1124
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.210
He looks like he walked into a tattoo parlor and looked at the wall and goes,

1125
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:51.290
yeah,
let me get all that.
Just give me a tattoo of your wall.

1126
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.710
You know what I mean?
There's just no rhyme or reason to it.

1127
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.670
Every once in a while you'll,

1128
01:10:55.671 --> 01:11:00.200
you'll see like a really cool tattoo,

1129
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.980
like a,
I saw this girl in Denver.
She had a,

1130
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:08.120
and I didn't even want to say this because then I think someone else is going to

1131
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:08.990
do it and then it's going to,

1132
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:12.350
these tattoos will become like the hacky barbed wire tattoo.

1133
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.560
This girl just had a tattoo of a bunch of different like pinup girls from the

1134
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:20.130
1940s and that's all they were.

1135
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.050
She'd have like 100 a forearm,
one on the inside,
one of the top one,
the uh,

1136
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.710
biceps.
So it was kind of like bond,
Scott's tattoos,

1137
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.280
the old,
the original singer of AC DC.

1138
01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:37.200
We just had like a fucking eagle or a dragon on his forearm and you looked at
it,

1139
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.780
you could see what it was and to look cool wasn't like those,
you know,

1140
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:44.370
those sleeves that people get like Tommy Lee where it just looks like a scribble

1141
01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:48.540
pad.
They'll sing her the fucking worst.
You can't see anything.
I don't know.

1142
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.310
All right.
So I guess I'm agreeing with you.

1143
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:54.630
I think if you get like a one really cool personal tattoo and also you keep

1144
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:59.340
yourself in shape,
uh,
the tattoo can still look cool,

1145
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.410
but you definitely have to take some sort of Jujitsu at that point to make you

1146
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:07.500
worthy of having the fucking tattoo or at the very least committed a felony,

1147
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.610
you know.
Anyways,
some of the other overhead stuff,

1148
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.640
the Hummer h three celebrities and shopping.

1149
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:21.990
All right.
Something I don't get,
uh,

1150
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:25.770
the douchey trend of those tee shirts that say famous.

1151
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.800
What kind of tool where something like that.

1152
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.270
I don't know if I've seen those.

1153
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.090
That's one of those things I don't think I've seen about.

1154
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.120
I know you're talking about,

1155
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.600
that's Kinda like the loser tee shirt is another one.

1156
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:44.490
People that liked the rascal flats or Kenny Chesney,

1157
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.380
I dunno who the rascal Flatts are.
Kenny Chesney,
is he the guy who married that,

1158
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:52.920
that um,
that chick from Jerry Maguire,

1159
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:58.950
what the fuck is her name?
All I can think of is an Haitian,

1160
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:02.800
that's the first name that popped in my head,
but I know it's not her.
Um,

1161
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:07.960
the diary of,
of
uh,

1162
01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.530
what is that fucking girl?
You know the girl I'm talking about,

1163
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.140
I'm in that country style.
You always want,

1164
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:17.040
I knew about the guy cause I can't stand country music.

1165
01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:20.010
I don't mind some of the oldest shit from the 50s,
early sixties,

1166
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:24.210
but country music today.
It's socks.
All right.

1167
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:29.430
It's just beyond corny.
Oh my God.

1168
01:13:29.431 --> 01:13:33.810
Somebody who was playing Garth Brooks the other day,
that guy fucking blows.

1169
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:35.641
I hate how they,

1170
01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:39.930
like they always start every line way down low and then they moved their way up.

1171
01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.140
Oh God.
Kill yourself.
Fucking kill yourself.

1172
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.900
Country Music socks.
You know,
I wouldn't,
I,

1173
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:58.860
that's the only genre of music that I can just say that unequivocally straight

1174
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:00.900
across the board.
It just sucks.

1175
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.170
It always sounds like a bunch of fucking corn balls who think they're cool and

1176
01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:10.590
that line dancing,
we do that stupid shit.
We,
uh,

1177
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:15.990
lift your leg up and you whack the arch of your fucking cowboy boot and then the

1178
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.310
whack the other side of it.

1179
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.880
Terrible.
Absolutely terrible.
Um,

1180
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:28.480
and I also don't like how they all have to act like they're so fucking pure.

1181
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.460
You know what I mean?
Like they're not getting groupie pussy,
you know,

1182
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:37.990
and then they write all those patriotic songs,
cashing in,
you know,

1183
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.070
America is going to go blow you up and all that shit.

1184
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:43.550
That was one of the greatest parties ever.

1185
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.420
Do you guys ever see that fucking those guys from South Park?

1186
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.660
That was my favorite part of that movie where they did the movie with the

1187
01:14:49.661 --> 01:14:52.990
Marionette puppet puppets there and they did the,
uh,

1188
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.060
they did that song.

1189
01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:59.140
What would you day he had gave your lap of freedom.

1190
01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:03.340
What would you do?
I was such a subtle,

1191
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:08.160
wonderful slam on people who made those songs.
Anyways.
Um,

1192
01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:12.100
all right,
another overrated thing.
Guitar Hero.
Thank you.

1193
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.060
Bunch of fucking nerves.
That's another great south park episode.

1194
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:19.390
South park is fucking genius,
by the way.
If you're not watching it,

1195
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:22.720
if they're still making genius episodes and no one ever talks about it anymore.

1196
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:28.000
MTVS overrated.
Yeah.
MTV They faced,
they've sucked for 20 years now.

1197
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:33.130
Reality shows.
I don't think that those things are overrated.

1198
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:37.480
I got to argue on that one.
People know there's shitty shows,
you know?

1199
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:40.450
It's kind of like the Jonas brothers.
People just know that that sucks,

1200
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.530
but there's morons and they're into it.

1201
01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.450
A Metallica is overrated.

1202
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.670
In the eighties early nineties they kicked ass,
but nowadays,
no.

1203
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:55.420
Wow.
Packing a legend there.

1204
01:15:56.570 --> 01:16:00.160
A Hannah Montana.
How can she be overrated?

1205
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:02.790
She's not overrated.
She's like a,

1206
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:08.250
what do you walk up to an 11 year old and make her cry about her lunchbox.

1207
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.780
This person's really mean.
All right,
everybody.

1208
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:15.700
You see in every week's issue of every single entertainment magazine,
examples,

1209
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:20.140
Brad Pitt,
Angelina Jolie,
Lindsay Lohan,
Britney spears,
Miley Cyrus,

1210
01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.530
delos magazines.
So seeing the magazines sucker,
right?

1211
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:26.200
Brad Pitt was also in snatched.
He was also in fight club.

1212
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.060
He's made some good movies.
He played the fucking,

1213
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:32.890
the pothead and a true romance.

1214
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.550
I don't think he's overrated.
I just think he's better looking at me.
He gets,

1215
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.270
you know,
painless pussy.
All right,
underrated.

1216
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:45.040
I think I literally caught a cold again during this fucking podcast.

1217
01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:47.080
This is really long by the way.
I'm sorry guys.
Let me just,

1218
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.560
this is the end right here under it.
Something else that is,
uh,

1219
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.010
I'll wait somehow.
I got this in the yoga.
This is another overrated.
The iPod.
Oh,

1220
01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.340
I liked this one.
This guy said the iPod is overrated.
I don't like it.

1221
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.080
I'm sure it's a wonderful toy,

1222
01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:05.680
but honestly everyone I know who has one has something bad to say about it.

1223
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.770
Whether it's shits the bed or only plays part of a song.
I Dunno.

1224
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.880
I'm just a guy who goes against the pop culture bullshit.
No,

1225
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:17.120
I would say the Ipod is the Ipod,
like,
uh,

1226
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.310
if he can't get them fixed either,
you know what I mean?

1227
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.480
Like you stereo back in the day when you had a record player,

1228
01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:31.040
it didn't like become obsolete six months later.
You know what I mean?

1229
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.920
And your friend would get a new record player and they could play way more

1230
01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:36.290
records.
It's bullshit.
Yeah.
I don't,

1231
01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:40.850
I actually lost my iPod about two years ago.
I haven't had an iPod in two years.

1232
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:44.720
And,
uh,
I don't give a fuck because,
uh,

1233
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.310
you know,
they're fucking expensive and you'll lose them and they break easily.

1234
01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:52.670
Exactly.
The back of them is made out of the same material.

1235
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:56.240
Like if he'd make like a cheap toaster or something,
you know what I mean?

1236
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.790
It's made out of aluminum and evidently the disk that spins a shit in there,

1237
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:02.960
whatever the fuck it is,
is right behind it.
And if you dent that,

1238
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:07.220
it rubs up against it.
And that's what fucks it up.
And,
uh,
I love that too.

1239
01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:09.980
When you go in the iPod store and then they're just like,
um,

1240
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.030
have you ever dropped your iPod?
No.
Never.

1241
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.870
There's no gravity in my apartment.
You fucking asshole.
Yes,
I did.

1242
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:23.450
Let me get,
that's not covered.
You don't cover gravity.
All right.

1243
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.130
Um,
underrated things around in a rated good books,
music,

1244
01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:33.830
movies and art.
Uh,
I would definitely say good books are,

1245
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:37.700
I don't think music's underrated.
I think people across the board,
like music,

1246
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.360
movies aren't,
I guess,
you know,
people,
you know,
good,
good music.

1247
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:45.350
You mean movies are going to a museum.
I love this one.
Underrated.

1248
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.420
Kenny Rogers roasters.
That place was good,
awesome chicken.

1249
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:55.790
You know what I ate there.
It wasn't bad.
It was comparable to pop eyes.

1250
01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:00.960
Is there a clean Popeye's in the world,
by the way?
Every time you walk in there,

1251
01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:04.220
the biscuits on the ship.
But those are the dirtiest fucking restaurants ever.

1252
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.910
All right.
Backer was underrated.

1253
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:12.911
Hilarious Sitcom that ran from 1998 to 2004 on cvs starring Ted Danson.

1254
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.860
Um,
that's show sucked.
I didn't like it.

1255
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.670
I didn't buy Ted Beck dance and be an angry,
you know why he couldn't play angry?

1256
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:26.970
Because he was already on a show that made syndication,
you know,

1257
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:30.170
and now he was alright.
And then he was on another one that made syndication.

1258
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:34.340
So he had so much fucking money.
How can you be angry?
It's like ice cube.

1259
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.670
I just don't buy the anger anymore.
He's got another album coming out and shit.

1260
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:41.170
It's just like,
how are you still mad,
dude?
Okay.

1261
01:19:41.171 --> 01:19:43.820
Even making platinum albums for 20 fucking years,

1262
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:49.170
you seamlessly stepped into movies starring in them.

1263
01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.210
Okay.
And now you're making your own.
I mean,

1264
01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:55.010
he's got to have like fucking,

1265
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.260
he's got to be worth half a billion dollars at this point.

1266
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:01.490
He still has that scowl on his face.
His eyebrows really annoy me.

1267
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.210
They're always touching whenever he delivers his shit.
You know what I mean?

1268
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:09.780
You're not that angry ice.
All right?
Did I just say ice?
Like I knew him.

1269
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:13.010
Like I say his whole name.
You're not that angry as Cuban not buying it.
Right.

1270
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.560
You fucking 48 years old.
All right.
Okay.

1271
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:22.440
Rush.
This person said is underrated.
One of the greatest rock bands,
to be honest,

1272
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:27.150
they have been a band for 34 years and still not inducted into the rock and roll

1273
01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:31.410
hall of fame.
It's bullshit.
No,
it isn't.
It's not bullshit.
Rush socks.

1274
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:36.840
That band sucks.
Okay.
Musically,
technically what they're doing is incredible,

1275
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.070
but the songs stink.

1276
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:43.130
And Getty Lee's voice is annoying and I just find they're playing to be real

1277
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:47.960
robotic.
There's no feeling in it
today.

1278
01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.250
[inaudible] I

1279
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.640
got Byron and right on the beat,
they're not pushing it.

1280
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.860
And I laid back are literally right on it,
like a fucking drum machine,
uh,

1281
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.490
to fucking thumbs down.

1282
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:08.250
And Getty Lee just seems like somebody you'd want to grab by his ponytail and

1283
01:21:08.251 --> 01:21:12.720
just spin them over your head like a fucking helicopter.
Uh,
all right,
last one.

1284
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:14.580
Dirty work.
The movie dirty work.

1285
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:18.030
It's a hilarious movie starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange and was produced

1286
01:21:18.031 --> 01:21:21.930
by Bob Saget.
Um,
you know what,
the trailers or that movie looks funny.

1287
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:24.300
I might rent that.
And speaking of that,

1288
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:29.301
if you want to watch one of the fucking most jaw droppingly awful movies of all

1289
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:31.410
time,
and I'm going to end on this.

1290
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.160
I actually finally watched the movie neighbors starring John Belushi and Dan

1291
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.890
Akroyd.
It is without a doubt,

1292
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.690
one of the biggest pieces of shit that I have ever seen in my life.

1293
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.273
And uh,

1294
01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.030
I remember the big thing about that movie was John Belushi was playing the nerd

1295
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:56.220
and Akroyd was playing the crazy guy.
And I dunno,

1296
01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.280
I think they were so nervous that people at the time would not accept John

1297
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.030
Belushi as the nerdy guy,

1298
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:08.100
that every time they showed his character to reinforce that he was a nerdy

1299
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:12.090
character is if I couldn't tell on my own,
they would play like this.

1300
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:15.690
You know,
trombone like this loser.

1301
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.250
Every time they showed his character,
it's like,
dude,
I got it.

1302
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:24.450
He's the fucking loser.
But I'll tell you,
the movie makes absolutely no sense.

1303
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.333
And it just,

1304
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.590
it just ends on just some dumb joke and it doesn't,

1305
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.620
it doesn't like remember in an apocalypse now when Marlon Brando's character

1306
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:42.621
talks about seeing the inoculated stack of arms and saying he wanted to pull his

1307
01:22:44.371 --> 01:22:48.150
teeth out,
that's what that movie made me want to do.

1308
01:22:48.151 --> 01:22:51.660
Like literally my teeth hurt.
It was such a bad fucking movie.

1309
01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:56.670
All right,
this fucking podcast is way too God damn long.
Um,

1310
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.810
and you know why it's so long now.

1311
01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:00.660
It's because everybody's throwing on giving me all this great stuff,

1312
01:23:00.661 --> 01:23:04.400
all this feedback,
you know,
so I appreciate all that type of stuff.
Uh,

1313
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.610
maybe I'll just try to start picking the top ones.

1314
01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:09.340
I just feel like I got to read all of them because people take the time to send

1315
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:13.540
them in.
But I think I just did like a 40 minute podcast.
Um,

1316
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:16.250
I don't want to get somebody fired out there if you actually listen to this in

1317
01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:21.130
your cubicle.
Um,
so anyways,
that's it.
I'm going to be at the,
uh,

1318
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.370
once again,
I'm going to be at the Improv,
Miami,
Florida,

1319
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:27.610
and I will be whatever the day game is at the Marlin's.

1320
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:31.930
I'm going to be at that game.
Okay.
And then only be 500 people there,

1321
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:34.630
so I'll be easy to find.
So if you there,

1322
01:23:34.631 --> 01:23:39.160
please say hello and come on down to the Improv on the 14th through the 17th.

1323
01:23:39.161 --> 01:23:39.994
I'll be down there.

1324
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:45.160
Please look for my special August 31st on comedy central and that is it.

1325
01:23:45.161 --> 01:23:48.820
And I really appreciate all the feedback and everybody's been giving me the

1326
01:23:48.821 --> 01:23:52.060
podcast questions.
Please keep them coming.
Even if they're painful,

1327
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:56.020
they're fucking great and a underrated overrated.
I'll let shit.
Alright,

1328
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:56.630
that is it.

1329
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:59.650
<v 2>Uh,
I hope all you guys have a good week.
I'll talk to you next Monday.</v>

1330
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:37.170
<v 7>12th may tell them
things</v>

1331
01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.180
she says in as much do you weigh?
He said,

1332
01:24:42.181 --> 01:24:46.640
come here and staffing
limit.

1333
01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.760
Tell a second mother.
This has been
done

1334
01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.280
since day one.

1335
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:05.143
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1336
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.490
<v 7>He was bad.
Next.
Whoa,
whoa,</v>

1337
01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.950
Bro.
Modo who nearly fell off the floor,

1338
01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.970
he said never engaged in this kind of thing.
They fall by body.
Yes.

1339
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:27.380
I think it can be a very easy,

1340
01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.730
we'll is
put some bleach us out in us.
