00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.780
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:06.050
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:08.450
August 4th,

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.230
2000 and fucking 14 you know what?

5
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.930
I'm going to energy my way through energy.

6
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.890
I'm going to energy my fucking way through this podcast.
It is Sunday night.

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.780
If you need to not wait.

8
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:24.020
I gotta make sure my windows are closed because I have a feeling I'm going to be

9
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:26.330
screaming.
Yup.
Walker.

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.720
Close this one over here and that's all good.
We got it all airtight.

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.360
My little podcast,
panic room.
Here we go.
All right.

12
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.070
How unprofessional is that?

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.280
You can hear me walking across the room and I think that

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.590
<v 1>that's the appeal of this podcast.</v>

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.760
You know the listeners feel like does actually in the room

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.390
<v 0>with you.
Shut up.
You overanalyzing cunt.</v>

17
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.680
You don't host a podcast.
You don't do anything creative,

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840
so you don't know what the listener is doing.

19
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.330
In order for you to know what the listener is doing,

20
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:03.410
you'd have to interview a whole fucking bunch of them to try to get a vibe.

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.210
All right there,
podcasts,
weekly,
whatever fucking magazine you're right for.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.480
I didn't ask for your review.
There is no review.
There is no podcast,

23
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.770
but this is just frustration.

24
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.180
This is just frustration because I got a bunch of Shit I got to do tomorrow.

25
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:22.790
What are you gonna do tomorrow,
Bill?
Well,
I'm going to have another meeting,

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.360
another meeting about a,

27
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:29.361
the downstairs that I had that evidently was fucking built by whoever owned this

28
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.860
house back in the 19 fucking 50 oh God.

29
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:38.450
What a shit show.
What a fucking shit show.
Hey,

30
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:39.780
buy a house.
Yeah.

31
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.950
<v 1>How's,
what's a good investment?
It is a,
a,
you know,
in life you have,
you have,</v>

32
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.460
you have assets add,
you have liabilities.
So you get a house.
That's a fucking,

33
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:50.600
yeah,
I could

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.480
<v 0>bullshit.
I don't want to hear it.</v>

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.940
You don't own a house is like owning a house is like having a fucked up kid.

36
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.010
Okay.
Who's just never going to get his shit together.
Okay.

37
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.450
And the mom keeps taking his side and you're like,
no,
he's a bum.

38
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.500
He's a bum.
He needs to get a fucking job.
He needs to do something.

39
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.440
But the mom just thinks is cute.

40
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.710
Is somebody knocking who's knocking my being too loud.

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.970
Is that some fucking squirrel that moved in downstairs to my fucking house?

42
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.280
Ah,
I swear to God I didn't even care anymore.

43
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.040
I do care if,
if,
if,
hey,
what was that knocking Nia,
was that you?
Okay,

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.410
well you knocking at me cause I was being too loud.
Okay.
All right.
Anyways,

45
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.080
who the fuck was I?
Was I talking about squirrel moving in downstairs?

46
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.590
You know what jokes on you?
Squirrel joke's on you.

47
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.080
You're better off in that fucking tree.
We,
that tree wasn't all rotted out.

48
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.400
These fucking assholes have whoever built this shit.

49
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:02.200
I hope if fucking still alive and you're listening to this,

50
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.040
you're probably laughing because you remember when you built the shit and you

51
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.600
didn't know what you were doing.
I live the head would

52
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.940
like in dirt,
like they built a wall in the dark.

53
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.860
Okay.
Now I wasn't the greatest.
I wasn't the smartest in shop class,

54
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.590
but I knew that you didn't fucking put a wall into dark.

55
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.510
Oh my God.
I swear to God.
If I could,
if I could do this all over again,

56
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.520
if I could do this all over again,
you know,
I would've been condo guy now,

57
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.330
but then I still would have had to fix it.
That's it's a fucking shit show.

58
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.460
It really is.
It's just an absolute shit show and a,
so I'm having,

59
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.380
I think it's the final meeting with these guys where now we're finally just

60
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.540
going to be like,
well,
this is the last wall.

61
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.810
This is the last part of the downstairs that we've uncovered.

62
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.490
So that can't possibly be anything more fucked up.

63
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.350
So that's the only ditzy,
only thing I feel.
I only,

64
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.640
that's the only light at the end of the tunnel does point where it's just like

65
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:09.550
there's nothing left that hasn't been pulled apart.

66
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.840
That debt that can be fucked up.
And now we start all over again.

67
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.450
So those of you who've been following this fucking story about my house,

68
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:22.600
you might remember last week that I had that little funny thing where they

69
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.230
pulled away the plaster and there was dirt behind the wall,

70
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.480
held back by a giant plastic tarp.
Okay.

71
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.520
I'm a did this fucking,
I swear to God there,

72
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.550
there are a hut in the third world that are built better than the bottom of my

73
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.710
fucking house was Jesus Christ.

74
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.750
Zero effort,
zero effort.
All they did,

75
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:54.160
they just fucking nailed shit together and it's still like tree forts.

76
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.310
<v 0>Tree forts are built better than the fucking downstairs.</v>

78
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.240
Jesus fucking Christ.
Then I find out the fuck.
And
you're like,
yeah,

79
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.380
the church really wet there.
It's really what yet?

80
00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:12.360
Because this is the fucking watermain.
Whenever the sprinkler comes on,

81
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.760
there's,

82
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.610
I got a fucking lake out my front yard right up next to the foundation though.

83
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
That's always good.
That's always a good place for a nice fucking,

84
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.270
you're on private pond every fucking morning.
Ooh.
Yeah.

85
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:30.360
That's not good.
That's not good.
We need to replace that.
Of course you do.

86
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.201
Of course you are.

87
00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:33.930
Why don't we just knocked the whole fucking thing down and we'll start over

88
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.740
again.
All right.
And so I can somehow make money like half of this,

89
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:42.180
I'll turn into a fucking pizza hut.
Alright.
And I'll try to get some of that,

90
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.500
that fat fuck money to maybe pay for the other half of the house and then maybe

91
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:50.400
I can buy out the guy who bought the fucking pizza hut.
Ah,
whatever.

92
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.280
You know what I mean?
You don't know what I mean?

93
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.640
Unless you fucking been in this situation.
If you have,
if you have been,

94
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:01.350
then my fucking heart goes out.
It goes out to you,
goes out to you,

95
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.430
whatever,
whatever,
whatever.
All I know the dream people,

96
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.200
the dream was at this fucking thing was going to be done right before football

97
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.940
season.
Okay.
And I was going to go out and buy a new flat screen TV.

98
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.260
Okay.
I don't have many dates in the fall.
I was actually going to be home.

99
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.310
I can enjoy the NFL package as it happens.
Right.

100
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.010
That was the fucking dream.
But you know,

101
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.610
as I say that there's political prisoners being tortured all around the fucking

102
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:32.630
world.
You're not that.
That's when you know your house is fucked up.

103
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.610
When you have to think about somebody getting waterboarded to be like,
wait,

104
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.540
<v 3>set that bad.
It's really not that bad.</v>

105
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.150
<v 0>You know,</v>

106
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.810
I was thinking about that today when I went out to go get some fucking dinner,

107
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.790
went to go and I'll pick up a couple of burgers

108
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.463
<v 3>and uh,</v>

109
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.500
<v 0>you know,
I'm sitting there,
you know,
texting with the lovely Nia going like,</v>

110
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.570
do you want a vanilla chocolate chip cookie

111
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.880
ice cream sandwich or do you want these salt and Carmel with snickerdoodles?

112
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.050
Okay.
And I'm actually getting frustrated because she didn't write me back.

113
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.710
And I know the burgers are common and then I'm calling her and she's not picking

114
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:12.670
up because she's watching,
you know,
orange is the new black,

115
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.510
you know,
basically,
uh,

116
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.880
Clam Oz for those of you want to get

117
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.813
<v 3>caught up.</v>

118
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.950
<v 0>I can't watch that fucking show.
I can't watch it.
I just,
I,</v>

119
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.900
they feel like they talk too much and there's not enough just fucking people

120
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:35.960
getting stabbed.
I know they're women.
I know them.

121
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.900
We'll fucking advanced in US socially,
but at the end of the day,

122
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:41.570
it's a bunch of prisoners.
They were in there for a reason.

123
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.490
I want to see more stabbings and less talk.
I never even watched.

124
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:49.880
I watched like fucking probably three minutes collectively of Oz.

125
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.770
And it was like,
that's what I thought prison was.
This is fucking horrific.

126
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.750
And that show was even toned down.
I couldn't watch it.
We,

127
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.390
um,
so anyway,

128
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.330
she wasn't picking up the phone and I'm literally getting frustrated and then I

129
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.330
realized just the ridiculousness of the whole thing.

130
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.000
So I just sort of sent her a text.
I wrote all in caps,
hey,

131
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.960
get your face out of the computer.
A decision needs to be made,
you know,
like,

132
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.510
it was really important which one I'm going to get her.

133
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.040
So I went with the fucking classic vanilla and chocolate chip,
you know,

134
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.300
sort of a metaphor for the two of us old geezers right.
And uh,

135
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.380
then she calls back,
you know,
the second you make the order,
then you know,

136
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:31.580
you're fucking girls gonna call.

137
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.820
Actually I wanted the truffle oil fucking with the fucking licorice in it.

138
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.510
But fortunately she heard the angst in my voice and she just,

139
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.550
she just went with the,
uh,
with the classic,
you know what I mean?
Let me,

140
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.640
and big to be honest with you,

141
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.770
like how out of control is your food addiction when you,

142
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.810
you order a salt and Carmel Sugar Salt and throw a fucking candy bar in there

143
00:08:56.221 --> 00:09:00.060
too,
you know,
that's like speed balling,
like speed balling.

144
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.110
If I can talk speedballing with,
with a little dessert.
Um,

145
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.790
so anyways,
that's my life.
That's all I have to talk about.

146
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.290
It's all I have to talk about is that,
um,
Oh,
other than that,
yeah,

147
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.600
his motorcycle,
somebody had a loaned me.
I told you guys I fucking,

148
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:19.860
I decided to uh,

149
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.810
to give it back and the guy just sold it as fucking killing me.

150
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.300
I know I made the smart move,
you know,

151
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.350
riding a motorcycle in La is a,

152
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.750
it's like riding a motorcycle in Los Angeles.
I mean,

153
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.510
there's no other way to put it.
It's just fucking,
it's uh,
it's a,

154
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.100
it's just too many God damn people you know,
you don't like if I was a dictator,

155
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.910
right.
And I just was just complete sociopath.

156
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.370
Just didn't give a shit about the fifth commandment.

157
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.760
The amount of people that I would have eliminated in this city just in general

158
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.120
so I could get around a little bit better and I could ride a motorcycle every

159
00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:00.460
once in a while.
Fuck,
I'm a dictator.
Right.
I should tell,
you know,

160
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.400
I should right around when everybody else has curfew,

161
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.180
when they're supposed to be home,
you know?
But then I couldn't ride around.

162
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:08.661
I'd be worried.

163
00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:11.570
I'd be only guy out there and everybody would know it's me and then everyone

164
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:16.160
would resent me.
So then I'd get fucking whacked.
See,

165
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:21.161
this is why dictators have to kill so many fucking people because when you try

166
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:26.690
to run the whole thing yourself,
you just can't get past the level of resentment.

167
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.120
So you have all this power and you can't go anywhere.

168
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.870
So you got to kill a bunch of people.
That's basically it.
It's common sense.

169
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.633
What are you going to do?

170
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.520
Is there ever been a dictator that just backtracked and it was just like,
ah,

171
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:43.370
I listen man.
Like I know he killed a lot of people.
I,

172
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:46.160
you know,
I've got a little carried away.
Ah,
Ya,
you know,

173
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:51.140
I had a plan and um,
you know,
it's not working.

174
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.210
It's not working.
So,
um,

175
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.630
I'd like you to forget about all those people that I killed.
You know,

176
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.030
a lot of them probably friends and family admitted.
Admittedly,

177
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:02.330
I got a little crazy for the last 12 years.
Uh,

178
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.710
but I just of want to ride a motorcycle and I don't want you guys to shoot me,

179
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.420
so let me finish.

180
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.450
So I've decided that ice cream is legal again and that,

181
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.740
you know,
people can go outside

182
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.610
whenever they want until like 2:00 AM.
How about that?
Is that better?

183
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920
Is that better?
Are you guys starving so much that you can't,
uh,

184
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.870
send an email at this point?
Oh,
that's right.
I outlawed the Internet.

185
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.260
I've forgot about that.
Is anyone even listening to this?

186
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.430
Anybody?
Um,
yeah,
that's too much stress being a dictator.

187
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.230
You know,
I understand them though.
I understand it.

188
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.820
He probably thinks that I'm fucking,
that's when you don't want,

189
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:47.940
you know what I'm saying?
You know what I say to you,
Mister,
you know,

190
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.040
I fucking drive to work and I drive home.

191
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.630
Miss is I go to the fucking gym and I got my own little fucking online fricassee

192
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.270
business,
whatever the fuck you do.
All right?
I want you to start traveling,
okay?

193
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.960
And you go out there,
you see what you see,

194
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:09.730
and then you fucking report back to me and I want you to then what they straight

195
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:13.330
face.
Tell me that you don't understand dictators a little more.

196
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.673
<v 4>C'Mon.</v>

197
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.920
<v 0>You're going to see what I see.
You're going to go out there</v>

198
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.960
and you can see.

199
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.320
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

200
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.120
<v 0>First of all,
you're going to eat.
I don't know.</v>

201
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:26.290
What the fuck are you going to say?
He just,

202
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.610
you know what it is you're going to become,

203
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.070
you're going to become grumpy like me.
That's what it really is.

204
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.000
It has nothing to do with seeing shit.
You just sick of standing in lines.

205
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.280
You know,
you sick of that cut in front of you,

206
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.410
recline in his seat on the fucking plane.

207
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.390
You know he's sick of fucking people who engage in conversation with the

208
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:46.450
cashier.
You know,

209
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:52.670
little fucking idle Chitchat,
Huh?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It really has been raining.

210
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.610
It doesn't limit,
you know those fucking people.
Right.

211
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.090
<v 4>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.460
<v 0>Okay.
It's not you keep it going.</v>

213
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.710
Keep the fucking line going.
You can't,
now that you're up there,

214
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:05.540
you don't give ignite Ui.
You got all fucking day.

215
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:09.530
Two seconds ago you were in line with me exchange and looks like he fall

216
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.540
believers yet,
and then you get up there and what do you do?

217
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.920
You become part of the fucking problem.
Right?

218
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.630
And you know what I say my little fucking inner Stallman.

219
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:22.160
I say dated from my world.
You're gone.

220
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.520
You're done.
You're going to write to a fucking labor camp.
Okay?

221
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:28.280
You want to Chit Chitchat,
go break some fucking rocks and talk to people.

222
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.420
Oh Jesus.
Not all of this has to do with the fact that I just,

223
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.920
I just want to see the downstairs in my house again.
Yes.

224
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.380
Site that was to finally be out.

225
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:40.760
I have an apartment and to have stairs that I walked down that didn't lead out

226
00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:43.760
to the street actually led to more rooms.

227
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.900
<v 4>Oh my God.
I swear to God.
I swear to God.</v>

228
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.900
Never again.
Never again

229
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.130
<v 0>Moose kid.
No.
What am I gonna do?</v>

230
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:00.070
Am I going back to an apartment smell and other people's food and hearing their

231
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:04.370
arguments,
listening to him.
Fuck him.
Right?

232
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.470
I don't want to do that either.

233
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.873
<v 4>That's it</v>

234
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.500
<v 0>stuck with this place.
So they're going to fix it.
Right?</v>

235
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

236
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.140
<v 0>Okay.
I could have done a half fast job,
but you know what?
I chose to fight back.</v>

237
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.530
I chose what I chose to fucking

238
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.810
fix it the right way and it is costing me a fortune.
It's costing me a fortune.

239
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:32.180
Everybody.
Oh my God.
Well,
you know we,

240
00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:34.020
we could,
we could,

241
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.700
we could do this and that'll last like six fucking years.

242
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:41.430
All we could do it the right way.
It'll cost nine zillion dollars and well,

243
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.950
what do you want?
What do we think?
I'm going to say do it the wrong way.

244
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.460
It's not the construction people's fault in case they're listening to this.

245
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.720
I know the console lived here before me,
but it's,
it's just,

246
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.620
it's just getting to that point.
It's getting to that fucking point.

247
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.890
I want it to start.
I want to rebuild,
to start.

248
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.920
I want to stop the tearing down and having to re fix all the fucking shit so we

249
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:10.760
can just build something on it.
Oh Man.
I swear to God,

250
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.050
I swear to God I need like three boxes of fucking tampons this week.

251
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.820
<v 4>Ah,</v>

252
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.380
<v 0>feels good.
That feels good to get that out.
So anyways,
how,</v>

253
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.910
what's going on in your world?

254
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.640
<v 4>Hmm.
MMM.</v>

255
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.130
<v 0>What am I,
there's no fucking way.
I just rag for 15 minutes on that.</v>

256
00:15:30.131 --> 00:15:34.150
I think I did.
I think I did.
Um,

257
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.770
let's see what happened to me last week.
What happened to me this week?
Anything,

258
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.020
anything of,
of,
of uh,
American,
you know what,

259
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:45.070
I was sort of podcast boy this week.
Um,

260
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.080
a couple of days ago I went on the podcast,
uh,

261
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:53.130
professor blast off with a Tig Notaro uh,

262
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.640
Kyle done again and David Hunsberger and um,

263
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.240
had a great time on that one.
I don't know.

264
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:04.750
I think I want to say that one comes out.
No,

265
00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:07.640
I don't know when that one comes out.
And then today I did Kevin Pollux,

266
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.880
which was fucking awesome because a,

267
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:13.870
I've been watching that guy movies for like 20 years and uh,

268
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.770
he has this awesome podcast slash talk show thing.
It's videoed,

269
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.550
videotaped,
live to tape,
whatever the fuck they did over there.

270
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:27.070
I was a whole studio,
you know,
and uh,

271
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:30.850
I did that today.
And that one is going to be out on Tuesday.

272
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.360
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.340
<v 0>And generally speaking,
I got along very well with Kevin Pollak until the end,</v>

274
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.110
when after I left,
he did the all,
all we had a gift bag for you.

275
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.980
God Damn it.
I forgot to give it to you at that old trick.

276
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.290
That'll trick.
In other words,
I know what he was saying.
If you did a better job,

277
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.880
we had a free tee shirt for you.

278
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.810
So just to let you know the level that I performed on,
you know,

279
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.210
Kevin is old school show business.
Okay.

280
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:03.230
You either bring it and you get the free tee shirt or you don't,

281
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.210
and then that's it.
You just get a text message.
I'm fucking with you man.

282
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:09.960
I had a great time and I'm

283
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.590
<v 2>okay.</v>

284
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.650
<v 0>I hope you guys watch it cause it's,
it's a really,
really cool one.
And uh,</v>

285
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.100
I think I found another person I could smoke a cigar with,

286
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.420
which is awesome and it's scaring the shit out of me considering,
uh,

287
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.520
Tony Gwynn and now I'm seeing,

288
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.760
do you know Jim Kelly also had some sort of mouth cancer or whatever,

289
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.780
one of the fuck it was.

290
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.580
<v 4>MMM.</v>

291
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.450
<v 0>And I'm sitting there watching this tear jerker story and I'm halfway through it</v>

292
00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:38.850
and I started thinking that I smoked cigars and I'm just like,

293
00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:42.510
I really got to lay off this fucking habit.
And uh,
you know,

294
00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:47.010
just space it out a space it out a little bit more.
You know,
you know,

295
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.000
when you have a bad habit,

296
00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:51.480
what you do is you look for Keith Richards of your habit.

297
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:54.540
And if they're still alive,
then you can lie to yourself that you're okay.

298
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.830
Like a verse,
he always brings up Schwartzenegger he's just like,
dude,

299
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.330
I heard,
I heard that that guy never doesn't have a cigar in his mouth.

300
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.980
That's what he says.

301
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.360
That's the level of the lie that we're telling each other because that's how

302
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:13.990
much we,
uh,
that we enjoy him.
But,
um,
whatever.

303
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.910
I hadn't had one since Montreal,
which was Saturday,
so I went eight days.

304
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.320
So if I smoked one once every eight days,
that would be like,
what,

305
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.670
three or four a month as the overlap,
the change there,

306
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.050
which would be 36 to 48 a year.
Yeah.

307
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.400
Jesus.
Ah,
fuck.
What happened to me?

308
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.440
<v 1>Um,
Billy used to be such a good boy.
What happened?</v>

309
00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:46.030
You start hanging around the wrong people.
Oh,
that was my generic,

310
00:18:46.031 --> 00:18:50.890
uh,
just off the boat accent.
How do you like that?
See Kevin Pollak.

311
00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:55.750
Fuck with that one.
Um,

if you take all your business calls yourself,</v>

315
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.270
it's really hard to look like professional,
isn't it?
Or to get anything done.

316
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.620
You're being a secretary and you're trying to drive the ship at the same time or

317
00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:20.830
their secretaries on boats.
I don't think so,
but you know what I'm saying.

318
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.150
Anyways,

toll free number,
professional voice greeting,

321
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.630
and a dial by name directory,

322
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.680
ie voice transforms any phone into your business phone.

323
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.580
When your customers call,
they're automatically sent to wherever you are.

324
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.490
You can be at home,
it could be at the office,

325
00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.040
you can be sitting poolside with a cold beverage,
if you know what I mean.

326
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.960
You'll always sound like a fortune 500 company with he voice and you get all of

327
00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:57.430

330
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.640

Dollar club,
everybody,
the big razor companies,
you know what they think?

341
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:51.640
They think we're stupid.

342
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.830
Every year they're rolling out some ridiculous new shaving technology gimmick,

343
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.620
don't they?
And they expect us to shell out big bucks for it.

344
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.260
Do you really need a razor with a vibrating handle though?
Yeah.

345
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.700
<v 5>Well you're weird.
If you dove,
do you really need that roller pivot ball?</v>

346
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.810
Backscratcher egg timer,
laser pointer corkscrew.
You get the point.

347
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.910
Do you need it?
I know I don't.

348
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.190
We were shaving just fine before any of that shit and I definitely don't need to

349
00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:22.520
spend any harder and money on it.
I don't know about you guys anyways.

which is unbelievably underrated by the way.
Okay?

362
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.280
You sit there and you hack up your face,
even with a good blade.

00:22:05.281 --> 00:22:07.740
It's really rough on the elite and your little baby face there.

People Join Dollar Shave club.com/burr Bravo,

That's dollar shave club.com/burr.

369
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.140
I even know if that's right as far as the phonetic.
Um,

370
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.790
all right,
let's get back to the podcast here.
So,
uh,
yeah,

371
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:40.170
that's what I did this week.
I did a couple of podcasts and um,

372
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.760
and I just basically vacated my house.
Why these guys were,
uh,

373
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.970
doing the thankless job,

374
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.320
<v 5>uh,
fixing the bottom of a house.
I don't know how they do it.</v>

375
00:22:52.321 --> 00:22:53.730
It's really amazing what they do.
Actually.

376
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.020
I still go down there when I block out how much money I'm spending,

377
00:22:58.021 --> 00:23:01.080
I go down there and I look at what these guys are doing.
Cause I,
you know,
I,

378
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.630
I got,
I'm getting this thing done for clash.

379
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.210
Hence financially I'm taking either the age,
but um,

380
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.920
it's gonna be great when it is done and I know a lot of you,

381
00:23:13.921 --> 00:23:18.780
why don't you take some before and after pictures,
um,
you know of it,

382
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.350
of your house.
And I say,
yeah,
well why don't you let me hang out with your baby?

383
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.660
You fucking Weirdo.
This isn't enough.

384
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.020
I'm sitting here sitting here and my goddamn house talking to you.

385
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.090
It's just never enough with some of you people.
And I,
for one have had it.

386
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.620
I'm taking it out on everybody.

387
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.080
<v 5>Whoever the client was that fucking put the wood in the dirt,
you know,</v>

389
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:43.330
can't talk to your spirit because you probably dead.

390
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:45.980
If you would dumb enough to do like that.
There's

391
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.550
<v 0>no way you live beyond the fucking Lyndon Johnson.</v>

392
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.950
What if that spirit is still in this house?
You know,

393
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.880
cause they were an unsettled soul.
They're going to get mad at me right now.

394
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.630
We shouldn't be.
Should be laughing at me.
All right.

395
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.520
Ghost of fucked up past.
Um,

396
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.430
what if there's weird noises that only you guys can hear right now?
I can't hear.

397
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.610
Is that fucking I,
you think I did a bad job?
Shame.
Huh?
That was my 1950s.
Guys.

398
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.230
You know.
Sorry.
Oh fuck you.

399
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.100
You wing a podcast every God damn week.
Alright.
Um,

400
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.640
what can we talk about next?
Oh Hey.
I actually,
uh,

401
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.090
I played a bunch of drums this week.
That's what I did.

402
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:33.860
I got out of the house and I just went,
ah,

403
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.820
it's such a great fucking hobby to have when you're hemorrhaging cash.

404
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.750
It's great to be out there and uh,

405
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.700
be able to hit something.
And I go through different phases.

406
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.750
I either listen to some really new shit or I go back and I listen to some old

407
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:52.900
shit.
And um,

408
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.240
I had been listening to a bunch of new shit recently.

409
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.190
Like I started listening to like top 40 music.
Just,
you know,

410
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:04.870
just every once in a while is you stand on stage with a microphone.

411
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.730
You kinda got to check in on what younger kids are listening to,

412
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:10.510
even though I know it's not all of them,
but a dude,

413
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.840
there's a fucking song that I must've heard 50 times in a week listening to pop

414
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:18.020
radio top 40 because they played the same fucking two songs.
It seems,

415
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.890
even though it's top 40 math doesn't work out.
But you know what I'm saying?

416
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.120
This is fucking song.
I,
I finally,

417
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.610
after like the 50th time a hearing now,
you know,

418
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.990
that's why you got to be so rude.
Don't you know,

419
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:38.280
I'm human tool of going to marry anywhere.

420
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.830
That's stupid fucking song.
Do you know?

421
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:44.700
For the longest time I listened to that song for the longest time,
he,
last week,

422
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.930
I thought he was talking to the woman he was gonna marry going,

423
00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:52.320
why are you being so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too.

424
00:25:52.321 --> 00:25:55.380
Obviously she's hurting his feelings and he's going to marry or anyways,

425
00:25:55.381 --> 00:25:57.240
I'm sitting going to do,
what are you doing?
Put the brakes on.

426
00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.940
This is not the move you want to be making.

427
00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:02.820
She's being rude to you and you got to remind her that you're a fucking human

428
00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:06.150
being.
I mean,
that's,
it's kind of a red flag,
right?

429
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.290
I know Dr Phil wouldn't stand for it,
but then again,
it's the guy being shit on.

430
00:26:11.291 --> 00:26:15.940
So he knows where his breads butter.
You need to be more human.

431
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.583
Um,

432
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.150
that's what that fucking corrupt cop look and jackass would say.

433
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.140
Um,
I actually wouldn't fuck with that guy.
I feel like that guy,

434
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.000
he seems like he's really tall and like he wouldn't have a problem with

435
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:33.280
murdering somebody,
you know?

436
00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.060
And he'd fucking lean on you like a heavyweight too and just wear you out.

437
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.370
Feel them all up on you.

438
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.860
You know he's got a hairy chest with that fucking bald head.

439
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.690
<v 5>Um,
anyways,
so it turns out that song,</v>

440
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:56.450
why you got to beat who that fucking and he's talking to the the

441
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.830
<v 4>yeah,</v>

442
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.900
<v 5>the dude who's going to be his father in law.</v>

443
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.903
<v 4>Okay.</v>

444
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.060
<v 5>I did the whole song just fell apart for me.</v>

445
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.110
Why you got to be so rude?
It's like,
first of all,
stupid.

446
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:14.900
<v 4>If</v>

447
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.630
<v 5>your potential father-in-law doesn't think</v>

448
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:18.760
<v 4>okay</v>

449
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.410
<v 5>that you're good enough for his daughter,</v>

450
00:27:20.411 --> 00:27:22.450
why don't you clean up your English a little bit?

451
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:29.290
You said that to your potential father law.
Why you got to be so rude?

452
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.060
<v 4>Okay,</v>

453
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.040
<v 5>there you go.
I'm going to marry her anyway.</v>

454
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.750
You know what?
The father in law's right?
Fuck or Weber's sang that song.

455
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.620
You don't deserve her.

456
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.103
<v 4>You know</v>

457
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.520
<v 5>let's,
she's a dumb cunt.
That's how I feel about that song.
Everybody.
So anyways,</v>

458
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.150
they bill,
it's top 40 white.
Why are you taking it so seriously?

459
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.490
What was another song I kept hearing?

460
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:02.150
I kept hearing that song with that girl was she was Kinda over,
uh,

461
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.620
putting her hands in the air.

462
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.230
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

463
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.430
<v 5>Oh really?
Yeah.
You kind of over it.</v>

464
00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:10.900
That's why you wrote a whole fucking song about it.
Ah,
Jesus.

465
00:28:10.901 --> 00:28:13.960
None of this has to do with anything other than the fucking crater that it did

466
00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:15.520
as a blow me right now.

467
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.843
<v 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

468
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.670
<v 5>You know what?</v>

469
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.050
I'm going to contact Tom Hanks on Twitter and see if he'll come up over to my

470
00:28:24.051 --> 00:28:27.380
house and I'm just going to stand downstairs and I want him to look down my

471
00:28:27.381 --> 00:28:32.090
stairs and do that fucking laugh.
That's my little make-a-wish.
Like when he did,

472
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:35.510
when he,
when he had the money pit.
If you could just do that for me,

473
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.470
maybe it would be better.
Well,
wouldn't that make me Shelley long chalet?

474
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.720
Don't I met the chick.
My Dreams fucking name is Shelly.

475
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.440
Could you fuck a girl named Shelly?
No.

476
00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:55.750
Shelly Chalet.

477
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.780
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

478
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.610
<v 5>Sounds like you're getting laid.
The 1920s.

479
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.540

Um,

480
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.430
I know this podcast is all over the fucking place.
Oh,
Ethel,

481
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.760
that sounds like a lifetime shelf.
Oh Ethel,

482
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.770
you old bag of shit.
Um,

483
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:20.970
<v 4>yeah.</v>

484
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.200
<v 5>All right,
let's try and get this podcast back on track here.
What,</v>

485
00:29:23.201 --> 00:29:25.830
what was I going to talk about?
I was going in a direction.
Oh yes.

486
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:28.880
So I played a bunch of drums this week and uh hm.

487
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.270
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

488
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.190
<v 5>I uh,</v>

489
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.930
<v 4>okay.</v>

490
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.920
<v 5>No I did the usual shit.</v>

491
00:29:33.921 --> 00:29:37.010
I like playing into some of it like whatever fucking rap,
hip hop,

492
00:29:37.011 --> 00:29:38.090
whatever the fuck you call it,

493
00:29:38.091 --> 00:29:40.910
that Neil listens to always ends up filtering into my shit.

494
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.500
So she's listened to this little Wayne stuff and uh,

495
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.130
that Shit's always fun to play drums too because first of all,
they do shit that,

496
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.710
you know,
you need an extra limb for,
you know what I mean?
Cause they can do,

497
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.470
can keep,
I don't like the high hat going,

498
00:29:54.471 --> 00:29:57.140
why they're doing fills and that type of stuff.
So it's kind of a,

499
00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:03.200
what the fuck song was I listened to,
to uh,
was it blue sky?
Please get,

500
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:08.080
I see you with my red bus.
You're fucking Greg.
Turn your shit to red wine.

501
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.640
Don't fuck up my high end word.
I'm too gone by.

502
00:30:11.641 --> 00:30:15.370
And what she get Dick Weed and ignore that the DWI,

503
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.820
some of the mile heads crawling my shit fucking my little deal.
But that,

504
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.770
that fucking song,

505
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.870
let's show him when he gets into that part where you start seeing shit,

506
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.080
I don't know what it is like that fucking makes me want to go work out or

507
00:30:28.081 --> 00:30:32.230
something.
I really enjoy it.
God Damn it solves as a that.

508
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:36.160
And then also I went back and I was playing too.

509
00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.270
I went back to my,
my old,
my old days,

510
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.410
um,
mammary.
He's,
I went back to a motley Crue,

511
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.920
Dr feelgood and I gotta tell you,
Tommy Lee,

512
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.160
brutally underrated as a [inaudible] drummer.

513
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.520
Just fucking brutally underrated as a drummer.

514
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.160
He was respected in the 80s and then somewhere in the 90s,
uh,
you,

515
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:04.410
you know what happened?
The sex tape came out.

516
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.670
He had his dick blowing the horn on a boat going fucking red man.

517
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.440
That kind of canceled out a lot.
A lot of the great drum parts.

518
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.500
If you're a drummer,
if you just a fan of music,

519
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:20.310
just go back and listen to that song.
All the shit

520
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:26.740
that's going on in that song.
And um,

521
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.850
oh,
so,
you know,
it's funny,
I was trying to explain it to nia today and like,

522
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.420
you know,

523
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.530
she always just looks at me like it's adorable how much I like drums and that,

524
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.890
you know,
women look at you when you talk about your hobby.

525
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.750
They don't give a fuck.
They like it that you have your little hobby.

526
00:31:44.751 --> 00:31:49.100
But you know,
women don't,
if you're not making money off of it,

527
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.230
if at the end of all of it,
they don't get a pair of shoes,
they just,

528
00:31:54.231 --> 00:31:55.280
they don't give a shit.

529
00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.230
So she's looking at me like I'm adorable when I'm sitting there talking about

530
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.430
how that like he does this thing.
That part was,

531
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:09.540
I got one thing you'll understand doctor [inaudible],

532
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.240
he's playing the bell on the offbeat and then he comes back playing it on the

533
00:32:15.971 --> 00:32:20.640
beat,
right as he's crashing the symbols and all that.

534
00:32:20.641 --> 00:32:24.090
It's one of the most fun songs they ever tried to fucking break down in a while

535
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.790
to try and play.
It's got all these different sections.
Like,

536
00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:31.770
I'm a fucking nerd for this shit.
This is like,

537
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.510
this is how much of a fucking nerd I am.

538
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.100
Like I actually wrote it out.
We're gonna look at my iPhone here,

539
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.630
a section.
Then there's The B section

540
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.693
<v 6>to the sea,</v>

541
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.370
back to be back to c,
then B,

542
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.510
then d,
then B,
then c,
then B,
The d again,

543
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:59.220
<v 5>then back to a,
then d,
then in each section where the fuck did that come from?</v>

544
00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:01.110
And then d and then they ride out in this f

545
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.090
fucking unreal and the B section,
they play four fucking times.

546
00:33:06.091 --> 00:33:10.470
Then every other time they play two times and they fucking did this shit while

547
00:33:10.471 --> 00:33:11.304
on heroin.

548
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.840
Entertaining tens of thousands of people at the same fucking touch.

549
00:33:15.841 --> 00:33:16.680
Just one song.

550
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.100
And I got to say some Tommy that unbelievable fucking drums on that song.
Uh,

551
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.780
and really tasty.

552
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

553
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.600
<v 5>Just tasty shit that he did it.
No,
they,
aw,
he's gotta.
I Dunno,</v>

554
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.510
you guys aren't drums.
What the fuck?
I don't know what I'm talking about to shit,

555
00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.430
whatever.
It was my one little fucking ray of light this week.

556
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:36.264
What do you want from me?

557
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:41.130
So I sat down and tried to figure out that whole song.

558
00:33:41.131 --> 00:33:43.410
That's what I did this week to distract myself.

559
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.780
Cause you know the running joke in this house is when,
when,

560
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.010
whenever we hear the noise downstairs is,

561
00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:55.780
I always go near the air that that's the sound of progress.

562
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.030
Swear to God.
I'm going to start crying if this project doesn't turn the corner.

563
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.670
I think I'm just going to get a nap sack,

564
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.270
like a stick with the red handkerchief and I'm gonna make a couple of peanut

565
00:34:09.271 --> 00:34:12.090
butter and jelly sandwiches.
I'm just going to walk away from this fucking thing.

566
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.440
Ah,
Christ.
When is it going to turn around?
You know,

567
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.860
if the Cleveland browns were a house,

568
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:27.160
how many fucking losing seasons can we have?

569
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.880
Why don't we going to pick the right quarterback?
Um,

570
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.760
whatever.
Whatever
the fuck it is.

571
00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:41.260
What it is,
it has to be done.
It has to be done.
Oh didn't I tell you that?

572
00:34:41.261 --> 00:34:43.330
My sink upstairs,
shit the bed,

573
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:45.910
and we had a plumber come over and look at it and he's just like,
yeah,

574
00:34:45.911 --> 00:34:50.010
you need a whole new sink.
Oh,

575
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.170
you know,
I've wanted to,
I wanted to turn.

576
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.410
I'm wanting to turn into Anthony Michael Hall in that moment when he's in the

577
00:34:58.411 --> 00:35:02.130
breakfast club,
you know when he starts crying,
when he goes,

578
00:35:02.131 --> 00:35:06.660
do you know why I'm here?
Yeah.
Like I wanted it.

579
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.190
I wanted to do that to that guy.

580
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:13.140
I wanted to fucking cover my eyes like Anthony Michael Hall did and Dee Brown

581
00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:14.520
did in the Dunkin contest.

582
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:21.260
And I was just going to fucking cry and tell them that I'm here because I was

583
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:23.030
told that a house was a good investment

584
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.240
and my entertainment would have been how fucking uncomfortable he was.

585
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.490
But of course I pussied out and I didn't do it.

586
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.070
I was just like,
you can't just fucking just rip out what's underneath there.

587
00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:43.980
And so,
well then I could do that.
I could do that,

588
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:47.810
but I'm just letting you know that,
you know,
there's no guarantee there are ripe.

589
00:35:47.811 --> 00:35:52.810
Rip It out.
Read the whole fucking thing.

590
00:35:52.811 --> 00:35:54.880
I know what's going to happen.
I don't want them to go onto their,

591
00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:57.610
cause I know when he goes into that wall is going to be something else,

592
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.553
you know.

593
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:02.783
<v 4>Okay.</v>

594
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.910
<v 5>Jesus Christ.
It's probably a fucking body in there.
I mean it's the only thing.</v>

595
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.800
The only thing else I haven't found,
you know,

596
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.020
even when they first fucking had the water damage down there,

597
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.780
the Goddamn tree fort of a walk in closet they had,

598
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:15.980
when they were pulling this shit out,

599
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.390
there was all these rat turds and crap that God knows how long they fucking Ben

600
00:36:20.391 --> 00:36:21.224
in there.

601
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.540
So at some point there was a family as something living in the walls here.

602
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:28.250
What kind of fucking animals

603
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.820
then all I did was set up traps.

604
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.890
<v 4>Okay.</v>

605
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.350
<v 5>I Dunno,
I was just</v>

606
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.580
shit show absolute shit show.

607
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.630
Oh God.
I wish I knew how to drive a bulldozer.
You know,

608
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.310
I'd steal one and get bulldozer insurance and then I've fucking drive it through

609
00:36:51.311 --> 00:36:54.200
this house.
And then I just played a hoe,
but I was in bed.

610
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.990
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

611
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.780
<v 5>Well we filed a stolen bulldozer right up the street</v>

612
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.270
anyway.
Ah,
fucking what are you going to do?
What are you gonna do?

613
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.190
It is what it is and here's what it is.
Okay.
I,
you know,
I gotta be honest.

614
00:37:09.191 --> 00:37:11.230
This is the first time I've really lost my shit.

615
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.050
Other than that I had been fine.
Okay.
I kind of lost my shit and uh,

616
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.910
speaking of losing their shit or at least shitting the bed.
Oh No,

617
00:37:21.911 --> 00:37:22.810
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

618
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.850
I was talking about the drumming thing cause I had to go around to,
uh,

619
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.320
I wanted to help,
uh,
a friend of the podcast here,
Benny grab,

620
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.990
he's one of the greatest new drummers to come along that I've seen in a long

621
00:37:37.991 --> 00:37:42.130
time.
You had an unbelievable,
his last DVDs,
instructional DVD was incredible.

622
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.550
And right now he's trying to raise money because he's,

623
00:37:45.551 --> 00:37:49.420
things are not cheap to make and um,

624
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:50.860
<v 4>okay.</v>

625
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.680
<v 5>But he still wants to make one rather than just do these stupid little youtube</v>

626
00:37:53.681 --> 00:37:56.500
videos.
He really wants to,
to do it the right way.

627
00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.940
So he's trying to raise some money.
Uh,
if you like the musical at,

628
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.530
um,

629
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.740
this guy is just top shelf artists and his heart's in the right place.

630
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.760
And I know he's gonna make a killer DVD.
So if you'd like to donate,

631
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.150
if rather than donate to the podcast this week,
if you'd like to donate to,

632
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:19.960
I'll have the link up,
uh,
to Benny grubs,
um,

633
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.450
project that he's working on.

634
00:38:22.451 --> 00:38:26.080
I think he's like a little over halfway for the amount of money that he needs
to,

635
00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:30.940
uh,
to raise.
So whatever you can throw his way,
a buck,
anything will help.

636
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.370
Um,
and that,
that would be,
that would,
it would mean a lot to me.

637
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.030
All right.

638
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.760
Give me a little ray of light with all the bullshit going on downstairs.

639
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.860
All right.
Benny,
Greg,
B.
E n n y.

640
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:45.430
G.
R.
E.
B.
Um,

641
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.030
and we'll have the link of everything up on my,
uh,
the Twitter.

642
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

643
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.400
<v 5>Whatever the fuck you say.
The Twitter handle and my website.
All right,</v>

644
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.840
there you go.
So anyways,
and I was saying,
Oh yeah.
Speaking of shitting the bed,

645
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.900
uh,
Boston Red Sox,
a Jesus Christ.

646
00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:05.310
What happened when she apparently Yankees tonight and I missed it,
but,
uh,

647
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.360
kind of wish it meant something.
But,
um,
but it's not bad,

648
00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:12.120
but everyone in the world series last year and the year before that we totally

649
00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:16.680
shit the bed.
So I think this is,
this is the new red sox,
you know,

650
00:39:16.681 --> 00:39:19.690
we win it and then we go off the rails,
then we go away.

651
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.890
And then what are we doing?
What are we doing guys?
What are we doing?

652
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.700
We're supposed to,
we're supposed to,
yeah.
When the Games,

653
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:29.230
when the games and then we come back.
So from what I've heard,
we've been,
uh,

654
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.780
we've just been cutting bait.
I think we've kind of,
uh,

655
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.960
just said it ain't happening this year.
So,
uh,
you know,

656
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.910
a weird thing that's when my loyalty goes through the fucking roof.

657
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.900
That's when I really start tuning in.
You know,

658
00:39:44.901 --> 00:39:48.100
cause I feel like it's just going to get back to like basics that people would

659
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:48.911
just give a fuck,

660
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:52.040
are going to go to the games and they're going to pay attention as opposed to

661
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:55.210
the lab.
Bad,
bad,
Eh,

662
00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.170
<v 7>I love that day.
Ah,</v>

663
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:05.300
<v 5>only show up when they,
when,
um,
um,</v>

664
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.400
so anyways,
I'm actually as a baseball fan,

665
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:12.550
I'm torn with the Yankees right now because the,
as the Yankees,

666
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.660
I want them to shit the bed,
but I don't want Derek Jeter his career to end.

667
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.140
I want it to keep going as much as my whole time watching.

668
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.700
I will couldn't wait for the guy to retire because he was killing us for all

669
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:29.620
those years.
Now he's actually gone to retirement.
It's making me sad.
And,

670
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:34.420
uh,
I'd like to,
I'd like to see him go into the playoffs,
lose of course,
but,

671
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:38.290
you know,
get a couple extra rod Derek Jeter games,
you know,

672
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.990
is that so wrong?
Um,
all right.

673
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.850
What else?
Oh,

674
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.800
for those of you who haven't been on my website lately,
lately,

675
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:52.403
um,

676
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:53.560
<v 4>okay.</v>

677
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.780
<v 5>Or for those of you who've listened to this podcast a lot,
you know,</v>

678
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:58.680
once a year I go to a big college game,
uh,

679
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.340
the cup of my buddies and,
uh,
the pride or New Jersey,

680
00:41:03.341 --> 00:41:06.070
Paul Versey and um,

681
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:07.750
<v 4>okay.</v>

682
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.910
<v 5>This year.
Last year we went to,
uh,</v>

683
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.690
the Aggies versus Alabama saw Johnny football,

684
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.780
which I'm really hoping he has a great career.
First of all.
Uh,
I,
I've,

685
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.521
I've told you this before.

686
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:21.130
I think the Cleveland browns have one of the best uniforms and all the

687
00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:25.390
professional sports.
I just love the colors,
the simplicity of the uniform,

688
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.270
you know,
it's like everything that like all like,

689
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:32.680
like the direction that uniforms are going in is cool.

690
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:35.870
Is Oregon the Oregon ducks uniform is,

691
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.340
they've kind of started like a fashion shit show in football where everybody's

692
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:44.120
trying to have these disco uniforms and I'm telling you is cool.

693
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:47.240
As they look right now in like 10 years,

694
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.300
they're going to look like if you guys seen that picture of the rock early on in

695
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:56.960
his career that's been going around where we standing there with the flat top

696
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:01.040
and the fanny pack with the shirt tucked into the,
uh,

697
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:05.900
the fucking dad jeans,
which we all look like back then in defense of him.

698
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:08.300
Like,
I think a lot of these uniforms are going to look like that,

699
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:11.090
whereas the Cleveland browns is just timeless,

700
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.250
original NFL uniform.
And I love,

701
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.630
despite the fact that they've had a rough go of it,

702
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.590
they have not given in to that stupid,
hey,

703
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:26.591
let's get the fan base excited again and let's just totally fuck with the one

704
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:31.910
great part of our tradition and mess with our uniforms that I have to tell you

705
00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:36.670
how much I hate the New England Patriots fucking uniform.
I can't,

706
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:40.480
I have this weird thing where the old one makes me sick to my stomach whenever

707
00:42:40.481 --> 00:42:44.770
they go back to it because this was such miserable years.
So many of them.

708
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.810
But I tell you the old uniform with the black cleats,
I uh,

709
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

710
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.410
<v 5>I Dunno.
I liked that one better.
I liked the,
uh,</v>

711
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.050
the jets were smart to go back to their other one.

712
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.730
They were original one that Joe Willie one and I liked that buffalo has gone

713
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:03.710
back.
They've gone back to the white helmet.
Right.

714
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.700
I always forget after football season is over,
but they still kind of kept the,

715
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:08.534
uh,

716
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:09.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

717
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.160
<v 5>You know,
the buffalo with the,
uh,</v>

718
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.850
remember when NHL had the little trail behind the puck for fuck heads who could

719
00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:21.740
see,
you know,
a black object against the white surface.

720
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:23.540
They had to have that little trail.
They had that.

721
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:25.970
I like it when it was just when Oj was playing,

722
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:28.130
when it was just the buffalo just standing there.

723
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.360
I thought at the buffalo look way better.
You know what I mean?

724
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.260
Like a pillar of strength standing as opposed to that little cartoon thing.

725
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:39.830
But they at least went back to the white helmet.
Um,

726
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

727
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.230
<v 5>That's a great one.
Chicago bears is a great one.</v>

728
00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:48.100
Vikings Green Bay packers is a lot,
especially in that.
NFC,

729
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.550
I don't know what the fuck they call it now.
And I've seen north,

730
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.900
maybe the Norris,
the central,
whatever the fuck they call it.

731
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.800
Um,
I don't know.
They just,

732
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.250
I think so many the helmets,
they kind of got him right.

733
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.070
The Raiders have kept theirs.

734
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.493
<v 2>MMM.</v>

735
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.100
<v 5>Who's really fucked with this.
Seattle really fucked with theirs.</v>

736
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:14.810
But I felt that they did that in a good way.

737
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.730
Like I actually liked their new uniforms.

738
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.230
There was a period between what they're doing now in the Jim Zorn helmet,

739
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:23.180
which I liked the best.
Um,

740
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.320
there was a different period in there when they went to those darker uniforms

741
00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:30.230
and I,
I just didn't like him.
Like I think the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

742
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:35.190
I fucking hate uniform.
I like that old one.
Just ride it out,

743
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.340
ride it out,
and eventually you're going to get good.
And then he got,

744
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.740
you have all that tradition behind it.

745
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:44.130
Like the 40 didn't actually realize the 40 niners were a fucking joke when I was

746
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:49.080
growing up.
They were fucking horrific and um,

747
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.460
they just couldn't get anything done.

748
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:55.440
And then Joe Montana comes in the entire and Bill Walsh,

749
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:58.980
the whole thing changed.
Now you look at that,
that same logo,

750
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:04.080
and you look at it like,
uh,
I,
I see that,

751
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.740
that,
that uniform.

752
00:45:05.741 --> 00:45:09.630
And to me that means championship means like success is another good one.

753
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:11.460
That giants went back to their old ones.
Like,

754
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.920
I think football's doing it right for the most part.

755
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.660
So I guess it's just college football.
Is that what my problem is.
Dot.

756
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.040
I don't know.
Let's take a color,
whatever.
So as I was mentioning,

757
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:28.041
so we go to one big football game every year and this year it's lining up.

758
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.010
I think we're going to go to,
uh,

759
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:37.960
Miami hurricanes for us,
a Florida state.

760
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.470
And what's cool is it dolphins play the bills on that Thursday night.

761
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:44.260
So the Friday night we're going to play one of those Improv's down there.

762
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.790
And uh,
and then the Saturday we're going to the game.

763
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.050
It's going to be the shit
telling you right now.

764
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.130
It's going to be the fuck and shit.
And,
uh,

765
00:45:57.131 --> 00:46:00.040
that is my little beacon of light and I'm looking forward to,

766
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.500
other than continuing to try to fucking play to more motley Crue stuff because,

767
00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:09.340
uh,
yeah,
like I said,
I think Tommy Lee's really underrated.

768
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.130
Um,
so anyways.
All right.
So I've run my mouth long enough.

769
00:46:15.131 --> 00:46:17.530
Let's do a little fucking advertising and I'll get into the,
uh,

770
00:46:17.531 --> 00:46:22.480
the questions for this week.
Um,
all right.

771

<v 5>All right.
And that is the advertising for this week.
Okay.
All right,
let's,</v>

820
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:21.460
let's get into the questions.
Oh,
by the way,

821
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:23.320
I've got a couple of things to hype here.
Um,

822
00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.100
Nick Youssef phenomenal.
Up and coming comic up and coming to me.

823
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.100
He's a vet at this point.
He knows what he's doing.
You give him a mic,

824
00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.330
he knows which way to stand.
He knows how to tell them jokes.
Uh,
seriously,

825
00:49:36.331 --> 00:49:37.560
this guy is a,
you know,

826
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.560
I played down the comedy store a lot and this is one of the guys that,
uh,
I,

827
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:45.300
every time I see him he's better.
He's got his own voice and a,
he recently,

828
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.590
he is releasing his first standup album,
Tuesday and a,

829
00:49:49.591 --> 00:49:51.690
I'm going to tweet the link when it comes out.

830
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.120
And if you're into stand up comedy to the way I am,

831
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.480
you will download this and you will laugh your ass off.
You'll be like,

832
00:49:57.481 --> 00:50:01.140
God damn it.
Fuck Bill Burr.
I'm going to go see Nicu stuff.
All right.

833
00:50:01.141 --> 00:50:05.310
That's Tuesday.
All right.
And also speaking of Tuesday,
Tuesday night,

834
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.540
all things,
comedy network,
myself and Al Madrigal,

835

836
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.430
uh,
at nerd melt on Tuesday night.
We will also tweet that link as well.

837
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.320
And,
um,

838
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.920
<v 4>okay.</v>

839
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.740
<v 5>And that's it.
And I guess the only thing I'd have to say is,
uh,</v>

840
00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:31.480
my condolences to Steve,
Steven A.
Smith,
you know,

841
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:36.200
I don't know.
The Guy said you shouldn't hit a woman.
He said that.

842
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.260
And then he was trying to get 360 degrees dialogue going with this awful

843
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:43.790
problem.
Eh?

844
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.850
He got railroaded by a bunch of fucking psychos who,

845
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.120
you know,
unless you just say exactly what they want you to say,

846
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.240
the way they want you to say it,

847
00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:01.490
they get you suspended and shame on those fucking cowards that employ them.

848
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.500
They suspended him and he's fucking psycho alludes to spend a long enough

849
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.280
unfucking believable.
The guy literally says,
you shouldn't hit a woman.

850
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.830
Isn't that your message?
You know,

851
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.950
God forbid he tries to open up more of a dialogue.
You can't,

852
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:20.480
you don't agree with them,
fine.
You got to suspend the guy.

853
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.310
I don't understand this whole fucking thing now where everybody gets suspended

854
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:28.820
or they get fired.
Like does that change the person's opinion?

855
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:34.400
You know,
does it help the problem?
Let's just say,

856
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.640
let's just say you actually say something ignorant people should be allowed to

857
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:41.390
be ignorant,
not hateful,

858
00:51:41.391 --> 00:51:45.830
but you should be allowed to be ignorant and then you should as an adult be able

859
00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:50.330
to come to them.
Just say,
Hey,
listen,
our perspective is this.
Um,

860
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.620
it kind of seemed like you were saying this when you said x,
y,
and Z.

861
00:51:54.621 --> 00:51:56.600
Is that what you're saying?
Because that's how we interpret it.

862
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.810
And then he could be like an adult.
Now I didn't mean it that way.

863
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:03.200
I'm sorry you meant that it sounded that way.
What I was saying was this,

864
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.920
and you can be fucking adults rather than this,
this,
this,

865
00:52:05.921 --> 00:52:10.070
this fucking McCarthyism like witch hunt.

866
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:14.660
Now that goes on every time anybody says something other than the exact line of

867
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:18.140
bullshit that some stupid fucking group wants you to say.

868
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.720
It's not a stupid fucking group,

869
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:23.270
but you got your acting like a bunch of children.

870
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.330
I mean,
God,
isn't that what this guy's got it.
I understand it.

871
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.070
He said you should never hit a woman and you completely ignore that part.

872
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.880
What do booth is poured over here?
Eh?
What about your ass?

873
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.870
All right.
Um,
I want to be your Roti.

874
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.780
What's going on here with my computer?
Why did he just stop it?

875
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.690
No more fucking popups.
I command thee.
All right bill,

876
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:55.040
I want to be your roadie.
Hello Bill.
I'm a very loving and kind English man.

877
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.880
Who wants to be your Roti now Jesus.
Um,

878
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:01.183
now I want it.

879
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.260
Now I want to do this as you are a stand up comic and only use a Mike.

880
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:11.180
And this works for me because I'm a lazy cunt who won't even carry my own drums,

881
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:15.650
let alone anyone else's shit.
But I think I can push myself to hand you a mic.

882
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.580
Don't ask me to book hotels as you will find yourself sleeping in your rental

883
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:23.990
car.
Don't ask me to get you food as I'll go and get,
I'll go and get it,

884
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:27.870
but we'll probably eat it and don't ask me to do any phone calls.
I like,

885
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:31.080
this guy's being upfront or mail as it just won't happen.

886
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.270
You won't even use periods,
you fucking asshole or capital letters.
He says,

887
00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:39.030
I've been told I'm a bit of a lazy bastard,
and this is true.

888
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:43.320
As you can probably tell from the lack of grammar and spell check in this email.

889
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.370
I think 25% of the takings per show is a fair wage.

890
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.920
Email me back and let me know when I start.

891
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.950
Actually don't bother as I probably won't show.
Yeah.

892
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:57.250
Just forget the job I got to play.
All right.

893
00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.710
I've got to play Xbox.
Sorry.
I thought that's it.
Xox uh,
I got to play Xbox.

894
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.450
All right,
sir.
Well,
you know something.
I got to respect your honesty.

895
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.983
<v 4>MMM.</v>

896
00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:14.710
<v 5>Yeah.
Paul,
you know,
if ever you know,
you,
whenever x-box ends,</v>

897
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:22.010
if the next time you email you and you actually use periods and capital letters

898
00:54:22.011 --> 00:54:23.690
to start a sentence to help me out,

899
00:54:23.691 --> 00:54:26.540
I see that you're actually beginning to take this job that you're not going to

900
00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:30.100
get seriously.
And that's what I need to see from you.
Um,

901
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.980
if you want to make it to the second,
the second round,
it's like a reality show.

902
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:39.080
Who wants to be a roadie pretty fucking fat?
He's only 11.

903
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.820
While my mom obviously pumps out big kids,
I was born at 13 pounds.

904
00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:48.500
Holy Shit.
How big is your mother's pussy?
Sorry.
Um,

905
00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:49.820
he at 11.

906
00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.040
<v 4>I was a 10 pounder.
You know,</v>

907
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:58.190
<v 5>I was a fucking little baby tone of myself,
so I shouldn't say stuff like that.</v>

908
00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:02.420
And both of us have always been at least a head taller than our peers.
Oh,

909
00:55:02.421 --> 00:55:05.930
you're like,
you guys are these corn fed kids,
Nebraska,
Iowa,

910
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.590
offensive line white guys.
That's what I'm guessing.
Uh,

911
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.940
and both of us have always been at least a head taller than it appears since he

912
00:55:13.941 --> 00:55:14.810
was about nine.

913
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:19.811
He started shoving every piece of fatty or sweet food into his mouth and taking

914
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:24.560
it to a new limit.
He's 10 years younger.
Well,
Shit.

915
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:28.650
You know,
you were 13 pounds.
Of course your mother need a break.
Uh,

916
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:33.140
he was 10 years younger and at least six inches shorter.
Dude,

917
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.320
a woman giving birth to a 13 pound kid.

918
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.250
The reason why they took a 10 fucking,
she took a 10 year break.

919
00:55:40.251 --> 00:55:44.390
That was like when the Rangers signed a Ra to a $250 million contract.

920
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:49.010
It took him 10 years to fucking recover from the,
let me get any sense.

921
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.930
You know,
I dunno.
Anyways,

922
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:54.200
he's 10 years younger and at least six inches shorter than me,

923
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.630
but is nearly the same waist size,
34.
Oh my God,
he's got a 34 inch waist.

924
00:55:59.631 --> 00:56:02.900
How tall is he?
Because I was a big kid too.
I know.

925
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:05.570
How shitty is to be overweight,
especially at that age.

926
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:08.000
The fat jokes are relatively easy to take,

927
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:13.010
but it sucks knowing that girls just won't be into you,
uh,
the way you are.

928
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.690
I want them to,
uh,
to go.

929
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.290
I don't want him to go through that and especially don't want him to run out to

930
00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:21.010
run into any health problems associated with obesity.
Yeah man,

931
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.780
this kid could get like that.
Childhood diabetes.
Uh,

932
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:30.370
the worst thing is my parents don't do anything about it and get mad at me when

933
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:31.480
I try to talk to him,

934
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.300
him or them to try and work on it.

935
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.660
It seems like that no matter how gently I put it,

936
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.620
they think that I'm just making fun of him or being kind of new age,

937
00:56:43.621 --> 00:56:45.780
diet freak or something.
Well,

938
00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:48.960
I'm going to guess that your parents are probably not in the best shape either.

939
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.933
Um,

940
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:55.650
or they're just those parents that just love the kids so much to a fault that

941
00:56:55.651 --> 00:56:58.590
actually sometimes they might be hurting them where they need a little bit of

942
00:56:58.591 --> 00:56:59.424
tough love.

943
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.600
I said I also get the feeling that they are ashamed of how fat they have allowed

944
00:57:03.601 --> 00:57:07.800
him to get and just try to avoid the negative feelings that they have when

945
00:57:07.801 --> 00:57:11.070
confronted with it.
Okay.
Now I'm thinking they're in shape.
He goes,

946
00:57:11.071 --> 00:57:12.510
I'm at a loss at what to do.

947
00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:15.830
And I don't want to come home from school to a miserable,
sick,
sickly.

948
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.770
Fatso have a little brother.
If you have any thoughts on how I can approach this,

949
00:57:19.771 --> 00:57:23.250
I would really appreciate it.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,
first of all,

950
00:57:23.251 --> 00:57:24.270
you're a great older brother.

951
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:29.340
Sound a very caring individual and you're trying to please everybody.
Um,

952
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.203
<v 2>okay,</v>

953
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:36.110
<v 5>so there's two ways to do this.
You can go Scarface,</v>

954
00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:38.420
you know,

955
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:42.920
put on a Tuxedo and get a little drunk and just fucking just say everything you

956
00:57:42.921 --> 00:57:46.400
have to say and then walk out.
Second,
I did a bad guy.

957
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.330
<v 2>Okay,</v>

958
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.380
<v 5>the last time you're going to see a bad guy and in this good of shape you could</v>

959
00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:55.680
go out like that or you could,

960
00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.720
I think this is,
this is a two pronged attack here,

961
00:58:00.721 --> 00:58:03.990
which you have to do is you have to sit down with your parents first and

962
00:58:03.991 --> 00:58:07.050
considering you've tried talking to them face to face and that hasn't worked for

963
00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:11.910
some reason.
A letter seems to work.
If you sit down and you write a letter,

964
00:58:11.911 --> 00:58:16.410
I might give it to your mother first cause you know,

965
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.010
divide and conquer.
Women are much more,
uh,

966
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.070
emotionally advanced than guys are.

967
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:24.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

968
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.890
<v 5>Um,
so I would try to get her on your side first and just say that,</v>

969
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:30.340
you know,

970
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.270
just basically say what you said to me a little less harsh without the f words.

971
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:36.940
I know that you were trying to make it probably funny for the podcast,

972
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:41.140
which I appreciate,
but,
uh,
that's what I would do.
And then,
um,

973
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:47.420
you know,
not to get all fucking serious here,

974
00:58:47.421 --> 00:58:52.421
but your younger brother is on the road to have a very short life.

975
00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:58.320
If,
uh,
if he's going to do what he's doing,
if he's going to do what he's,

976
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:03.640
what he's doing.
Okay.
And unfortunately I have firsthand experience in that and,

977
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:07.280
and you know,
it sneaks up on you and next thing you know,

978
00:59:07.281 --> 00:59:12.020
you're in your forties and your fucking a lot of stuff,
you know,

979
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.230
chickens come home to roost,
so to speak.
Um,

980
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:20.200
so I dunno,
I would,

981
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.630
<v 0>that's a tough thing,
man.
How do you talk to a fucking 11 year old about that?</v>

982
00:59:24.631 --> 00:59:28.950
I don't know.
I,
this is actually beyond me because what he literally has his,

983
00:59:28.951 --> 00:59:31.710
he has an addiction to food.

984
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:33.960
Like he has to get off the smack,

985
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.380
he's got to start eating salads and he's got a break that sugar salt.

986
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:41.310
It's like you speed balling,
you know your sugar goes through the roof,

987
00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.780
then you do the salt that goes through the roof and you just go,

988
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.070
you just go on Pizza,
Candy,
Pizza,
Candy,
Pizza,
candy,
whatever,

989
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.470
insert different food.
But that's what you're doing.

990
00:59:49.471 --> 00:59:52.320
You're literally addicted to it.
Um,

991
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.930
like I had a sweet tooth most of my whole life.

992
00:59:54.931 --> 00:59:59.931
I don't have it anymore because they started doing that eating veggie twice a

993
01:00:00.181 --> 01:00:03.930
week and that totally just cut out my sugar,
salt cravings.

994
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.620
And it gave me a new feeling after I was done eating,

995
01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.240
of being energized rather than being like,
oh man,
that was awesome,

996
01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:16.770
but I need to fucking lean to one side here.
Um,

997
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.310
like the other night I had this fucking steak dinner,
man.
It was fucking great.

998
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.970
And you know,
it was bad for me because my voice just dropped down like a pirate.

999
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.950
Let me ta dish a dish steak.

1000
01:00:29.951 --> 01:00:34.670
Would you put Titi Chanel fucking cream ish Minaj.
Um,

1001
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.750
it was delicious.
It was fucking delicious.
And um,

1002
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.690
but I actually only got a six ounce steak.

1003
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.370
I now I know insert what do you will fucking pussy.
It was

1004
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.443
<v 4>mmm.</v>

1005
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.840
<v 0>I got their best steak.
So it was super expensive.</v>

1006
01:00:52.841 --> 01:00:56.120
So my wife's like,
well,
why don't we both get six ounces each?
I'm thinking,

1007
01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:56.954
well I want eight.

1008
01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:01.600
And when the six came I was pissed because it was so fucking small.

1009
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:05.530
So actually it was eating smaller bites and I got full and I was totally

1010
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:09.850
satisfied.
Um,
so it wasn't as full.

1011
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.530
I don't know.
It's like eating is something you really,

1012
01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:16.620
the older you get to is you really have to fucking think about it.

1013
01:01:16.621 --> 01:01:19.980
Like there's no reason when you get older that you have to become a fat fuck.

1014
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.170
It's just that your metabolism has changed and you're not changing the way

1015
01:01:25.171 --> 01:01:25.591
you're eating.

1016
01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:30.570
You're still eating like you're in college when you just ate like shit.

1017
01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:32.040
And you still woke up when you were fine.

1018
01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.530
Now if you're already out of shape at that age,

1019
01:01:34.531 --> 01:01:39.090
that's a major red flag,
but it's easily corrected.

1020
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.290
So if you're young and you listen to this and you're out of shape,
the great,

1021
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.460
I mean,
you're young and if you just start eating right,

1022
01:01:47.461 --> 01:01:48.990
just read up on nutrition.
I barrel,

1023
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:53.991
I know so little about nutrition and just me the little that I know I don't have

1024
01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:57.840
to work out as much now.
So

1025
01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:00.510
I don't know.
I would go that route.

1026
01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:04.680
I would write a letter and I give it to your mom first.

1027
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.960
We'll try to maybe divide and conquer.
I don't know.

1028
01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:10.890
I don't know the relationship you have maybe a dad's to softy.
I have no idea.

1029
01:02:10.891 --> 01:02:12.630
But I would try to divide and conquer them.

1030
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:17.340
And then your parents could just subtly,
you know,

1031
01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:19.110
stop buying that shit.
Food,

1032
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.390
<v 5>not have it in the house.</v>

1033
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.190
They could start making healthier meals and um,

1034
01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:30.800
you know,
and when you come back from school,
I mean,
I don't know man.

1035
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.860
Just go fucking do some shit where the kid's going to have to be active.

1036
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.980
Um,
I mean,

1037
01:02:36.981 --> 01:02:41.690
11 is a tough age to try to have a serious conversation about stuff like that.

1038
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.910
Um,
if you were going to do what I would do it talking about yourself,

1039
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:52.080
you know,
and the experience that you had or something.
I mean,

1040
01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:54.780
that's the best I can do a good luck with that,
man.
But you're a,

1041
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:58.410
you're a good person,
man.
You're good older brother.
I hope it works out for you.

1042
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.130
All right.
Dilemma.
A deer,

1043
01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.730
slick bill flair.
Woo.
He wrote the wool.

1044
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:10.380
I love the podcast and hearing you solve problems that should be in quotes.

1045
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:15.060
I have a dilemma,
a dilemma that you,
and maybe the lovely Nia could help me with.

1046
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:19.800
Uh,
my wife and I have been happily married.
Oh,

1047
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:20.700
maybe I should get it right here.

1048
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.000
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1049
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.090
<v 5>You know,
sometimes I know she hears me</v>

1050
01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:40.390
and I know what that means now that means I'm watching my show that you always

1051
01:03:40.391 --> 01:03:42.940
make fun of.
She,
I have watched one of those fucking real housewives shows,

1052
01:03:42.941 --> 01:03:46.780
which I actually got into one of them.
She just kept like a pop song.

1053
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.900
She just kept playing it and playing it.
The Real House wives of New Jersey.

1054
01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:54.550
I'm actually watching that shit now.
Um,
but I can't watch the other one.

1055
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:59.070
That one that's out here,
the Orange County one,
those fucking women,

1056
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.790
they just look so exhausted all the fucking time.

1057
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:07.140
It's because they're trying to look hot.
It's like what's wrong with you?

1058
01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:11.220
You're a mom.
Okay.
You did your time.

1059
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:15.150
Relax Karen.
Some sweat pants.

1060
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:21.870
Okay.
Uh,
dear slick,
Bill flair.
Woo.
Uh,

1061
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:25.530
my wife and I have been happily married a little over 10 years.

1062
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.640
When we got married,
I was working a low paying,
going nowhere job,

1063
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:32.520
but I saved my money for months and bought her an engagement ring.

1064
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.160
It wasn't much and was all I could afford,

1065
01:04:35.161 --> 01:04:38.940
but she accepted it very graciously and has come to mean a lot to her.

1066
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.450
I'm doing much better in my life.
Look at you.
Good for you.

1067
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.870
Do a much better in my life now financially that I was then.

1068
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:49.620
And can afford to buy or something much nicer.
My dilemma is this,

1069
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:53.100
should I tell her what I paid for the first ring and tell her I want to get her

1070
01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:56.850
something nice,
something a lot nicer now that I can afford,

1071
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.640
uh,
or just leave it alone since she does appreciate it.
And by the way,

1072
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:03.300
I just bought,

1073
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.830
I have bought or other jewelry in the last 10 years but just not another wedding

1074
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:10.410
ring.
Dude.
Fucking leave it alone.

1075
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:17.050
Leave it alone.
Um,
leave it alone.

1076
01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:18.300
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1077
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.000
<v 5>Okay.
If that ring means something to her,</v>

1078
01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:22.900
<v 2>uh,</v>

1079
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:28.120
<v 5>I think it's kind of a nice sentimental reminder of how far you guys have
common,</v>

1080
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:30.820
how successful you are.
And I think that she's,

1081
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.530
she's a great person that she's not going like,
I god gon,

1082
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:38.770
I ring it isn't as big as this other bitch at works ring.
You got a great one.

1083
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.170
And um,

1084
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.480
<v 2>okay.</v>

1085
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.620
<v 5>I know you're feeling because it's also like you probably go in like,</v>

1086
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.920
I dunno,
you probably hanging out with,
you're doing really well financially.

1087
01:05:49.921 --> 01:05:52.170
You probably hanging out with other people doing well financially and their

1088
01:05:52.171 --> 01:05:55.800
wives' show up with a giant rock on their finger and yet you're getting
insecure.

1089
01:05:55.801 --> 01:05:59.820
But if she's not insecure about it,
then I would leave it alone.

1090
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.990
If you're buying or other nice things.
Um,

1091
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.820
I actually think it makes the ring even more special.
She has like a,

1092
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.770
you know what a beautiful earrings or whatever.

1093
01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:14.580
You bought her a necklace or something like that and then she has that,
that uh,

1094
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:18.030
that ring that you got her.
I think that's actually cool.

1095
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:23.540
And she can tell the story.
She probably likes telling the story.
Ah,

1096
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.600
you got a great relationship,
sir.
Congratulations.
Don't fuck with it.

1097
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:32.880
Don't fuck with it.
All right.
Use my downstairs as a metaphor.

1098
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.880
Don't start pulling down the walls.
You have no idea what's behind them.

1099
01:06:35.881 --> 01:06:39.690
You don't even want to know is it holding up the structure?
Leave it alone.

1100
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:45.300
Okay.
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated.
Overrated.

1101
01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.470
Being a sports fan.

1102
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.150
My two favorite teams or the Colorado Rockies and the Tennessee Titans,

1103
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.500
uh,
could I be any less relevant in the sports world?

1104
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:59.940
10 months out of the year I spent in crushing disappointment.

1105
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.590
Fantasizing about what?

1106
01:07:01.591 --> 01:07:05.190
It's like a falling with team that actually won a championship.

1107
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:08.520
You lucky cont will do well,
I don't understand.

1108
01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:12.660
How are you a Denver Fan of just the baseball,

1109
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.780
you know,
look in the last like 15 years,
16,
17 years,

1110
01:07:18.781 --> 01:07:20.190
you won two super bowls.

1111
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1112
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.540
<v 5>Two Stanley Cups.
Nuggets have one shit.</v>

1113
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.280
Rocky's have one ship,
but then no.

1114
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.830
Well you basically got a baseball team in the last 20 years.
You,

1115
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:37.110
you're doing fine.
Tennessee titans.
Uh,
I don't know.

1116
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:41.700
I'd have to understand why you,
uh,
you went that route.
I respect that though.

1117
01:07:41.701 --> 01:07:45.030
Most people who don't root for the teams that are in their state usually pick

1118
01:07:45.031 --> 01:07:49.260
like a successful one.
Like I'm a big Yankee fan or I always like the,
uh,

1119
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:55.590
oh,
what else?
Fucking always when Shit,
I dunno.
I like the,
uh,
whatever.

1120
01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:58.770
I like the Patriots.
We have one shit in 10 years.
What am I talking about?

1121
01:07:58.771 --> 01:08:00.450
All right.
Underrated.

1122
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.620
Having a 500 plus CD collection.

1123
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:09.630
My friends gave me shit for paying for my music.
Oh God.
Bless you for,

1124
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.540
for every artist out there who was actually putting out shit that costs money,

1125
01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.980
the fact that you're actually paying for it,
God bless you.
Uh,

1126
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:19.040
but as you said before,
it's like having the gold behind your money.
Oh yeah.

1127
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:20.060
Having your CD.
Yeah.

1128
01:08:20.061 --> 01:08:23.630
Because you can lose your entire music collection if something happens to your

1129
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:26.640
laptop and all of that crap.
Right.
Uh,

1130
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.600
it just,
the fact that you need these fucking in devices to play him on that are

1131
01:08:32.601 --> 01:08:37.580
constantly like becoming outdated and then they get filled up like his stereo

1132
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:40.010
never got filled up.
Uh,

1133
01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:43.400
but the other side is you can listen to it anywhere you go.
So I dunno.
I,
I,
but I,

1134
01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:46.070
I like what you're saying.
Anyways.
She says my laptop shit,

1135
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:49.810
the bed recently and it was nice knowing that I didn't have to go through virus.

1136
01:08:49.811 --> 01:08:54.680
He fucking websites online to get all 4,000 songs back.
Oh,
that's great.

1137
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:59.660
I'll tell you,
you know what,
I'll throw in an underrated,
uh,
Amazon dot coms.
Uh,

1138
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.860
I started downloading music from them because I was sick of iTunes not having as

1139
01:09:06.891 --> 01:09:09.320
a,
as good as selection and what I was trying to find.

1140
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.210
I saw this great documentary on muscle shoals and they were talking about Aretha

1141
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.450
Franklin and I wanted to get,

1142
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.980
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1143
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:21.170
<v 5>MMM.
The fuck is the name of the album.</v>

1144
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.330
I wanted to get like the album in,
uh,

1145
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.240
hang on a second.
Let me find it.
The name of it.

1146
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:32.660
I wanted to get one of her early albums.
I wanted to hear the whole album,

1147
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.860
which was really exciting to me.
I guess it was called.

1148
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:40.990
I never loved a man the way that I loved you and I wanted to hear all these

1149
01:09:40.991 --> 01:09:44.570
songs cause you know,
after a while when you have as many hits as she does,

1150
01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:46.280
they just play the hits.
And whenever they,

1151
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:51.050
after a while they start phasing out the albums and it's like,
oh,

1152
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.200
you know,
there's actually more Aretha Franklin music that I have in here.

1153
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:55.070
I want to hear this shit.

1154
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:59.280
So I go on iTunes and of course all they have is greatest hits,
volume one,
two,

1155
01:09:59.281 --> 01:10:02.510
when all this type of shit,
you know,
who's zooming who,

1156
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.510
whatever the fuck they had on there.
But,
uh,

1157
01:10:05.511 --> 01:10:09.690
I was actually able to download that whole album.

1158
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.510
Then I got to hear the muscle shoals.

1159
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.790
They're legendary band that played with them.

1160
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:17.450
I had saw the documentary and I really listened to their playing and that drama

1161
01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:21.810
is fucking incredible.
His name escapes me.
Um,

1162
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:26.830
so I would say that that's underrated.
Oh,
and by the way,
to,
you know,

1163
01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:30.370
who was underrated in my world was a Kenny Wayne Shepherd.

1164
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:34.990
I was like a lot of Stevie Ray Vaughan and fence where when he died,

1165
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.700
it was just such a blow.

1166
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.780
Then any blues guitarists that came along that was influenced by him,

1167
01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:42.940
I would listen to for three seconds and be like,
ah,

1168
01:10:42.941 --> 01:10:46.780
he's just doing the Stevie thing.
He's not Stevie.
And,
um,

1169
01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.290
long story short,
uh,
they came to town,
he came to town,
uh,

1170
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.950
playing the Greek theater and,
uh,
Chris latent from double trouble was on drums.

1171
01:10:56.951 --> 01:11:01.230
I'm like,
I gotta see this fucking show.
So I went up there and,
uh,

1172
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:05.440
I saw them play and they were fucking unbelievable.

1173
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:10.330
He's an unbelievable guitarist.
He's fucking amazing,
totally underrated.

1174
01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:15.420
And,
uh,
like most great artists,
he's bad at promoting.

1175
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:19.260
Like I wanted to give him a shout out.
He's not on Twitter,
you know,

1176
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.040
if he stunk,
he'd be on Twitter,
but he isn't and he's just,

1177
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.690
and he's got a keyboard player that he's out with.
Two,
this Guy Riley Osborne,

1178
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:32.010
who I'd never heard of who of course is played on a zillion things or they did a

1179
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:35.310
slow blues thing or something and that guy just started playing.
It's funny,

1180
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:37.860
he looks like Burt young and I,

1181
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:40.290
it doesn't really smile a lot and the guy was just,

1182
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.420
just a beast.
Just the real deal.
You're just basically,

1183
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:49.470
you were watching the real deal.
The entire band was phenomenal and uh,
you know,

1184
01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:53.570
to actually go out and see live music now is,
uh,
I dunno,

1185
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:57.310
I did that a couple of times this week.
Um,

1186
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:01.020
I saw a couple of live bands in the viper room.

1187
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:05.400
I just Kinda did that this week to get my mind off the bullshit downstairs.

1188
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.930
But if he,
if,
if Kenny Kenny Wayne Shepherd band is coming your way,
if you like,

1189
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.370

I don't Blues Guitar and that type of them,
these guys,
I don't,

1190
01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.670
I don't know who's out there doing it any.
I mean,

1191
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.310
I know there's always somebody going to say,
well,

1192
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.450
you know the fuck's that kid's name there.

1193
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.190
The slide guitars,
uh,

some frigging Derek trucks.
Is that his name?

1194
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.980
I'm not in that world.
I don't know what the fire,
no,
he's unbelievable.

1195
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.990
I've seen some of his stuff.
Uh,

1201
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.800

1202
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:57.240
