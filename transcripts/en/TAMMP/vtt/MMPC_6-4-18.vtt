1
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.730
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.570
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:12.040
June 4th,
2018.
What's going on?

4
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.820
How are you,
how you doing Lottie?
I'm in Dublin,

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.690
Dublin,
Ireland.
Um,

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.300
I've been on a fucking plane for,
I don't know how long.
Uh,

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.220
we left lax and uh,

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.970
what were you supposed to leave in the afternoon?
And then,
uh,

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.420
there was some problem with the hydraulics.
They back the fucking thing up.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.330
They pulled it forward to back that up.
They pulled it forward like,
you know,

11
00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:41.650
two and a half hours later we finally left,
which is all good cause you know,

12
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.160
it's Don Rickles says,
and casino rather,
it's,
you know,

13
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.140
it's better down here then you know,
up there.
Right.
Um,

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.910
so I was just sitting on the fucking plane and uh,
they didn't give us any food.

15
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.820
They get a little cup of water.
It was it two and a half hours,
the late nothing,

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.930
no food,
no drinks or anything and all,
I was thinking,
I was on Air France there.

17
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.460
I was like,
oh,
this is how these fucking people stay so skinny.
You know,

18
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.730
they just leave you on there.
They don't feed you or nothing.

19
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.843
<v 0>MMM.</v>

20
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420
<v 1>So anyways,
but I kept my mind occupied.</v>

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.070
I was transcribing a pan terrorists song.

22
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710
I get into shit,
you know,

23
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.950
I fucking eats up all the time

24
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.920
rather than sitting there,
I didn't do that.
Or I play solitaire on my phone.

25
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.770
It's somebody get me a deck of cards.
They're like,
you know,

26
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:37.610
you can just get an app for that.
I'm like,
that is really a lot easier isn't it?

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.230
Plus I feel you win a lot more with the APP.
You know,

28
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.290
cause it wants you to keep playing or a deck of cards.
They don't give a shit.

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.760
They just want it done.

30
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:51.320
They got your money that done that fucking solitaire game though.
Don't get it.

31
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.161
Don't get it.

32
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:55.880
Because they got like 50 fucking ads every time they shuffle the cards.

33
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.000
Every time you win a game,
every time you move your hand,

34
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.140
they got like another ad.
They put the x in a different spot every time.

35
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:07.390
If you don't really hit the x and it goes to another fucking page,
you know,

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.720
so somebody gets credit for,

37
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:13.520
I'll look of viewing a click and I don't know,
I don't,

38
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.880
I don't pretend to understand these things.
So anyways,
yeah.

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.273
<v 0>MMM.</v>

40
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.740
<v 1>This podcast is going to be a all over the place.</v>

41
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:26.630
I'm going to tell you that right now because I was debating whether or not to do

42
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.800
it,
uh,
before I left.
And I was like,
well,
don't do it before you leave.

43
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.190
It'd be more exciting if people hear you talk to yourself in a different country

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.580
that allowed a new fucking flavor.

45
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.813
<v 0>MMM.</v>

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.010
<v 1>They gave me this crazy room.
Oh Shit.
My Room Service.
Hang on a second.</v>

47
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.580
Jesus Christ.
All right.
It just ate my fucking room service and I put on the,

48
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.580
the news over here.
It's just like the news back home.

49
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.830
All depressing shit I got with a gun though.

50
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.410
But this is the difference between the U S in Ireland.

51
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.070
It was a 38 Smith and Wesson with five rounds of ammunition.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.060
When they said what kind of gun it wasn't how much ammunition was there.

53
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.220
I almost went aw.
Oh,

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.700
fucking hilarious.
Is that um,
yeah.

55
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.650
Not about gloom and doom.
Tara t one people right here.

56
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.760
Look here today when a tractor went off,
it's fucking rails is at Hash hate hard.

57
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.280
A fucking volcano erupted down in Guatemala and [inaudible] have a hood and

58
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:36.390
habits,
you know,
great accents and everything,
but just all depressing shit

59
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.780
at grand mother was later yesterday.
Today

60
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.610
when she was found half eaten by her cat.
If,

61
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.190
if we can divide this too.
I'm

62
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.570
sorry,
I'm fucking punch drunk.
I fucking just ordered this shit or a BLT.

63
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.440
Not the most healthiest thing.
There was no bacon in it.
It's that uh,

64
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.060
rest of the World Bacon,
you know where it looks like him,

65
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.070
but it has the consistency of fucking Lod was delicious.

66
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.690
And I ordered the side salad.
I specifically said side salad,

67
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.920
no fucking fatalities.
Right.
And they still brought me French fries.

68
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.900
I have the side salad,
but you know it is,

69
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:22.770
if you see fucking French fries sitting there and there's a salad,
right?

70
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.340
The Salad,
that's the plain gene girl next door.

71
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.850
You want to fuck that big at horror up the street,
right?

72
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.640
You're going to go after the cup of potato dish.

73
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.690
Fucking man is mayonnaise over here.
He can't,

74
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.270
he can't have the ketchup over here.
Although they brought up some heights.

75
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.880
European ketchup sucks.
It's all natural there.
Yogurt sucks.

76
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:50.020
It's also all natural.
You know,
I can't even get through a cup of it.

77
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.980
All right?
If I'm not like got it.
You know,

78
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.060
at least four cups of sugar in an eight ounce thing of yogurt.

79
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:00.120
Like that's not yoga to me.
Um,

80
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.000
I charity one year old retired,
which can lead to,

81
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:06.640
we did your phd or would five rounds at the mediation.

82
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.700
The town was so shaken up,
they took the night off to go out and go drink.
Um,

83
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.580
this has been the Irish news.
Um,
and he was with the fuck.
Am I here?

84
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.430
I'm in Dublin.
What did I just write?
Berlin is my password.

85
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.220
Fucking idiot.
I really am done.
What do you guys listen to this?
I mean,

86
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:33.090
I appreciate that you listen to it,
but I really questioned you sometimes.
Um,

87
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.400
greatest thing about Ireland by the way,
it's going through customs now.
Granted,

88
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.250
I look like a fucking Leprechaun,
you know,
an older one who's getting who a bald.

89
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.370
All right?
It looked like a Leprechaun.
So uncle.
Okay.

90
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.560
Um,
they just let shit,
no work papers.
No,

91
00:05:55.561 --> 00:06:00.270
nothing goes like,
what are you doing here lady?
And I was like,

92
00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:04.710
I'm doing a show all by yourself.
I was like,

93
00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:08.010
Yep.
He's like,
all right.
They have a good one.

94
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.270
Welcome to the country.
You know
the other place you go to,

95
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.130
you get that fucking guy looks.
He's like,

96
00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:20.410
you seen the Bourne identity looking you up and down.

97
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.640
And he just starts thinking,

98
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.020
why you making me feel like I have drugs in my ass right now?

99
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.300
You know,
like I'm a mule.

100
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.960
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
so I'm here.
God dammit.
Hang on a second.</v>

102
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.260
All right.
Sorry.
Look adjusted from the Goddamn flight.

103
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.330
<v 1>You know,
sleeping in that recliner.</v>

104
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.673
<v 0>MMM</v>

105
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.230
<v 1>No,
you fall asleep on him on an airplane.
You're always like,</v>

106
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:55.130
this must be what it's like to be in a loveless marriage.
You know,

107
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.030
we just don't want to go upstairs because your wife's in bed and you just watch

108
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.700
TV to fall asleep and you fall.

109
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.100
You just lay in there and they're fucking lazy boy,
you know,

110
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.780
or you've been married so long that like,
oh,
I don't want to go up the stairs.

111
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.580
You just sleep right on the couch

112
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.840
doing that shit all night.

113
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.680
<v 0>Um,
I actually had a dream.
I couldn't fucking breathe.</v>

114
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.900
I have that dream.

115
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.500
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't do well on airplanes.</v>

116
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.740
I watched the 250 greatest goals and soccer and uh,

117
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.960
you know,
there was some nice ones.
There was some pretty pedestrian ones,

118
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.720
but I think it was also because it's so fucking hard to score.

119
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.350
And he also said the top 250,

120
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.840
250.

121
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

122
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.190
<v 1>Like who has the fucking time?
I'm glad somebody did it.
It took like it was,</v>

123
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.820
it was the perfect soccer highlight reel for an American.

124
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.880
I got to sit there for like 24 minutes and watch nothing but goals,

125
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.083
<v 0>you know?</v>

126
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.090
<v 1>I bet goalies hate that fucking highlight reel.</v>

127
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.510
It's like a fucking snuff film to them.
You know you don't scrape.

128
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:10.040
I have noticed about soccer is when you score and your blasted by the goalie

129
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.170
high on either side,

130
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.370
it's e they jump out of the water like a fucking sword fish.

131
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.860
<v 0>It looks like you know.</v>

132
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.530
<v 1>No,
no,
the water,
they jump up like a,
like a sword fish coming out of the water.</v>

133
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.170
And what's amazing is rather than just jumping up in fucking trying to block it,

134
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.400
they always have to turn around and watch it go in the net.
You know,

135
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.450
it's like the Matrix.

136
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.750
Don't you think he could jump a little higher if you want some goddamn concern.

137
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.150
Do you know where the fuck it's going?
If it got by ag nowhere it is.

138
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.700
You know he can hear the crowd.
You fucking piece of shit.
Right.
You know when it,

139
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.543
<v 2>okay.</v>

140
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.310
<v 1>Oh he's fucking look at this God damn soccer goalies there.
There,</v>

141
00:08:57.311 --> 00:08:59.590
there are no nosy group of people.

142
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.673
<v 2>Okay,</v>

143
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.410
<v 1>I missed it.
Where's it going?
Right in the back of the net.</v>

144
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.703
<v 2>Okay.</v>

145
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.470
<v 1>No,
I actually,
I didn't even look.
Are there like safety nets or anything behind,</v>

146
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.970
has anybody ever died?
Somebody blast the ball,

147
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.760
misses the net and then hit some fucking kid in the face.

148
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.180
That's the only thing that was missing from the Irish News.
Oh,

149
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:31.100
we look at daddy went down to the pitch.
Took a fork and soccer ball too.

150
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.590
You don't know [inaudible]
he'll be laid to rest

151
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.980
half six tomorrow morning.

152
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.583
<v 2>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.030
<v 1>That'd be really early fucking funeral.
Um,
get it over with.</v>

154
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:46.860
We're all fucking pasty over here.

155
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.810
The thing worst and bettering your son after he got hit in the face on the pitch

156
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.730
is getting a fucking sunburn.
My accent,
I can't do the Irish accent.

157
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.440
My wife reminded me of that guy that met me at the airport when I was in

158
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.820
Scotland.
Remember that?
That story I get off and the guy at the same,

159
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.150
it had my name on.
I came walking up on my hay and he just goes,
hello.

160
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.690
<v 2>Okay.</v>

161
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.400
<v 1>I'm like,
what your preferred bottle wall?
Who Do you prefer?</v>

162
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:21.170
Bill or William Bolo.
Bolo.

163
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.393
Um,

164
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.323
<v 2>how much?</v>

165
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.690
<v 1>Jesus Christ,
it's only been 10 minutes.
Fuck.</v>

166
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.190
Oh Man.
I should have called in sick.
Um,

167
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.370
you know what I always mean to do when I go to Dublin is to take a tour of the

168
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.813
Guinness Factory.

169
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.833
<v 2>You know,</v>

170
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.950
<v 1>I'm not,
I am not big on going to fuck on tours.</v>

171
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.410
I don't want to hear about it.
Oh.
They get his family,
they fuckin,
you know,

172
00:10:53.411 --> 00:10:56.050
they first made their first bite.
I don't care.

173
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.870
Just get to the part where I get my pint,

174
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.663
<v 2>you know.</v>

175
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:01.881
<v 1>Oh.</v>

176
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:05.330
But here's where we put the hops and the hops score and a big hopper Robbie had.

177
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.690
And then they stood them up or Seamus gets on a bicycle,

178
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.690
it's got some paddles on it and he go,
he wheels around.

179
00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:14.190
I'm going to keep my voice down.
People think I'm really disrespected.

180
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.043
I was going for right now.

181
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.773
<v 2>MMM.</v>

182
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.770
<v 1>This giant fucking Queen Elizabeth.
Fuck.
It's you in a big room like this Sealy.</v>

183
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:22.604
So like,

184
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.880
<v 2>okay,</v>

185
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.440
<v 1>this is like for shack or something.</v>

186
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.253
<v 2>MMM.</v>

187
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.750
<v 1>But I never ended up fucking getting down there.</v>

188
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.303
<v 2>MMM.</v>

189
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.940
<v 1>It's kind of stupid though,
right?
I mean,</v>

190
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.420
I bet I could go in online and just see a video.
I know what it tastes like.

191
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.280
<v 1>Kind of a degenerate alcoholic.
Are you think you know I,</v>

193
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.500
there's a bunch of booze I like,

194
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:47.600
I'm not going to go there and see how they make it.

195
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

196
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.250
<v 1>Salivating the whole tour.
Getting the fucking shakes.</v>

197
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.920
Oh Man.
Would you like to just dive in there?

198
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.910
How 17 year old fell into a vat of Guinness.

199
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.890
Hey Joel in cause he was burned from a volcano and Guatemala.

200
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.970
He got to jump in the ocean to Guatemala,
but he was Irish.

201
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.270
So we took the pain all the way back to London because he didn't want to

202
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:24.590
inconvenience anybody with his own emotions.
Um,

203
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.090
uh,
fucking new,
a fun over here,
man.
Uh,

204
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.030
this is going to be a good time.
My Show's tomorrow night at the three arena.

205
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.780
I don't know what that stands for.
It sounds like some Illuminati shit to me.

206
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.900
What was it?
The three banks that are left and all of Europe.

207
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.920
Are they part of the European Union here?
Who decided to leave?

208
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:53.220
Was it Brussels?
No.
Was it Berlin?
Nope.

209
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.840
Was it Great Britain?
I knew it was Brexit,

210
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.020
so I just try to guess all the Br.
Once I spell Berlin,

211
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.280
I preempt the Ar Brelyn um,

212
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.870
just to be interesting,
you know,
just,
just to try to keep it fresh globally,

213
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.950
you know.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

214
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.260
how about those fucking Washington capitals?
I'll say it again.

215
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.890
How about those fucking Washington capitals?

216
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.730
Tell you right now,
if I'm a fan of the Vegas Knights,

217
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.590
I gotta be thinking what is my,

218
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.520
what is our adjustment to their adjustment going to happen?

219
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.730
All right,
I'm going to go out and look.
This is waste of what happened.
Okay.

220
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:42.160
The capital's whatever the Fuck Vegas was doing in game one,

221
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.750
the capital's adjusted to it.
I think game three,

222
00:13:44.751 --> 00:13:49.100
I did not see an answer by the Vegas Knights.
Okay.

223
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.460
Uh,
as far as my limited knowledge of math goes,

224
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:57.200
they better fucking respond in game four or this series going to be fucking

225
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.223
over.

226
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

227
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.110
<v 1>No vet skin's going to be on the cops.
Gotta be great.
Either way.
It's,
it's a,</v>

228
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.960
it's an incredible,
it's going to be great.
I mean,

229
00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:07.910
I'm rooting for the capital's cause.
The Josh,

230
00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:10.990
Adam Meyers and um,

231
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

232
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.900
<v 1>You know,
and they plus everybody down there.</v>

233
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:19.760
They'd been waiting since 1974 the Redskins suck the nationals,
you know,

234
00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:24.440
I don't,
you know,
they used to be the senators or the Senate is twice they left.

235
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.310
One time they became the fucking Texas rangers and other time they became the

236
00:14:28.311 --> 00:14:32.450
Minnesota twins and the fucking expos came down to some nationals and they still

237
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:37.210
haven't won a title.
You know,
they're on their third fucking marriage.

238
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.010
Actually,
the senator's did want a title and like the 1920s,
I think

239
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.970
they went to the fucking White House.

240
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.210
Thank George Washington was still there when it showed up.

241
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.570
It's fucking wouldn't teeth.
You had to sit there and listen to,

242
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:56.440
I'm boring story how he said they made a bat.

243
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.000
Maybe it's the teeth out of his fucking Bazzi had as a kid.

244
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.821
How much is it?

245
00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:07.330
The guy lied his ass off that they had to come up with that dumb ass story about

246
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.080
I can't,
I can't,
I can't.
I can't tell a lie.
I chopped down the cherry tree.

247
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.070
What kind of ass kicking do you think he got over that?
You know,

248
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.690
when you really think about it?

249
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:20.350
Back then there was no supermarkets in the sky just chopped down a fucking tree

250
00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:23.990
that actually had edible fruit on it.
You know,

251
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.540
it was dad probably beat him with the ax handle,

252
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.650
knock their fucking powdered wig right off his head.

253
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

254
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.860
<v 1>Did rich kids wear powdered wigs back then?
You know,</v>

255
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.920
people would come up with key their horse

256
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.450
a shit.
Fuck you guys.
I've been on a plane for 12 hours.

257
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:50.600
I don't give a fuck if this is funny.
You know,
I mean I do,
I do care.

258
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.930
But anyways,
um,

259
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.560
<v 2>okay.</v>

260
00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.320
<v 1>Anyways,
so,
uh,
I watched game one of the NBA finals.
Uh,</v>

261
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:06.310
and I have to tell you when they fucking reversed that offensive foul call that

262
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.390
basically every summit jr Smith and I can't get mad at chair Smith cause I

263
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:13.550
didn't know what the score was either when he was dribbling it out and I was

264
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:15.640
going,
yes,
yes.

265
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.840
It was a lot of other people too that thought that thought they were up by one.

266
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.440
MMM.
The game was over on that offensive file.

267
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.450
And uh,
you know,

268
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.670
I've never seen them have a little powwow and reverse a call.
It's easy.
I mean,

269
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.133
I just,

270
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.550
I had like Tourette's when that happened and I was so fucking upset.

271
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.530
And so once again,

272
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.940
disappointed by the NBA and the way that they fucking run their league,

273
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.970
I was so mad.
I walked to my show that night.
I just,

274
00:16:50.971 --> 00:16:54.840
I didn't want to get in the fucking car.
I need,
I had to go for a fucking wall.

275
00:16:54.841 --> 00:16:57.630
I didn't watch the overtime because I knew,
I knew the words are going to win it.

276
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.430
I've watched enough games that when a fucking

277
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.660
kicking the balls with a call like that,
and then the rain man,

278
00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:09.960
dude on your team doesn't know that you fucking tongue tied and he runs out the

279
00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:12.900
club.
I,
you know,
what's going to happen.
So Lebron knew,

280
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.150
that's why he went back to the bench and he didn't talk to anybody.

281
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.080
I fucking,
I had two shows in La and I walked a both of them,

282
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.903
<v 2>yeah,</v>

283
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.100
<v 1>at one in a dive bar.</v>

284
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.070
And then another one add a little more upscale place that wasn't quite a comedy

285
00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:32.791
club and I just,

286
00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:35.940
I just walked to both of them and I could tell you this right now.

287
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.190
La has an unbelievable homeless problem.

288
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

289
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.770
<v 1>Holy Shit.
I mean,
they are fucking everywhere.</v>

290
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.990
Every doorway,
every nook and cranny.
There's somebody you know,

291
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:50.870
wrapped up in a like a fucking cocoon.

292
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:52.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.020
<v 1>A lot of mental illness out there.
It's unreal.
It's really unreal how</v>

294
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.180
we just fucking leave those people on the street,
you know,
mentally ill people.

295
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.970
<v 1>Oh No.
You still have those asylums.
She can't.
Yeah.
I don't know.
That didn't work.</v>

297
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.180
I Dunno.
I just need to try to take care of him.
It was really fucking depressing.

298
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.150
Then I was sitting there walking down the street going like,

299
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.080
did I really leave the safety of my car to fucking

300
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.260
<v 2>okay.</v>

301
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.650
<v 1>Walk amongst all these fucking people who've got God knows what kind of issues.</v>

302
00:18:32.651 --> 00:18:33.484
Right.

303
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.310
And I was standing there and this guy with this really dirty shirt was just

304
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:42.960
staring at me and I'm waiting for the light to say walk.
You know,
it's La.

305
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.560
You can't,
Jay Walk,
you'll get killed,
right?
And then I feel him.

306
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:50.250
He's just staring right at me.
I'm like,
Oh fuck,
here we go.
Here we go.

307
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.790
Oh,
freckles couldn't take your car.

308
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.460
Could you get all mad about a basketball game?
Right.

309
00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.560
<v 2>Guy Looks at me and he goes,
hey.
And I ignore him</v>

310
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.820
was hey,
I ignore him again.

311
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:12.030
And then he sorta like walked around Susan,
my vision.
He goes,
Hey,

312
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.640
I looked at him,
I go,
what?
And he goes,

313
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.680
are you chilling Mikael?

314
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.640
<v 1>I just go,
no.</v>

315
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.860
<v 1>Then it said walk.
And I walked away from,
and I felt a behind me</v>

317
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.420
<v 2>and I just kept walking.</v>

318
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.980
<v 1>Then I was walking too fast.</v>

319
00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:42.040
So then there was somebody in front of me and then he's doing this whole kind of

320
00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:44.170
looking back like,
why is this guy walking so quick?

321
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:45.923
<v 2>You know?</v>

322
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.840
<v 1>And I wanted to say to the guy,
hey,
you don't need to worry about me.</v>

323
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:50.280
It's the guy.
I'm walking away from it.

324
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.380
<v 2>Um,
anyways,</v>

325
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.150
<v 1>so that's what the fuck I did after game one.
Jesus Christ,</v>

326
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.200
the warriors have to be the most hateable fucking team I've ever seen in my
life.

327
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.530
You don't get enough stars on your team.
You got to poke Lebron in the eye.

328
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.990
Jesus fucking Christ.

329
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.340
That's some shit I fucking girl would do playing nerf basketball,

330
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.970
fucking disgrace.
And then Lebron gets out there with his old ass body,

331
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.950
takes a fucking charge.

332
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.000
I know his foot was work was moving and I know that would,

333
00:20:25.001 --> 00:20:28.460
after they looked at it,
you know,
they did get the call.
Right.

334
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:31.310
But what the fuck they,
they've never reversed something like that,

335
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.080
<v 2>that ever.</v>

336
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.410
<v 1>So like they were looking for a way for the warriors to fuck it when it was
just,</v>

337
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:43.910
it just,
uh,
I don't,
I don't know why I give a shit so much.

338
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.910
Why do I give a fuck about either one of these teams?

339
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

340
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:48.610
<v 1>I,</v>

341
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.690
cause what I'm rooting for is for sports to go back to the way they used to be,

342
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.500
where,
uh,
there was still free agency.
I'm not that old when I was growing up,

343
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:59.020
but there wasn't these pylons fucking tapes,

344
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.760
you know,
I dunno,

345
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.080
somebody sent me a thing about Lebron could possibly go to the Celtics.

346
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.860
He better not,
I don't want that title,

347
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.960
you know,
I dunno.
Bill,

348
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:20.710
you just old and all you do is complain.
I know.
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.001
I can't,

350
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:25.990
I just realize that the game isn't what it was when I was a kid and this new

351
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:30.360
game,
young people seem to be enjoying it.
Don't have a problem with it.

352
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.850
Should be in a way.
Where did it happen?
When I was a kid,

353
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.440
there was an old man playing in Oregon.
Um,

354
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.560
anyways,
uh,
let me do a little bit advertising reads,
there's this podcast,

355
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.320
I'm not going to make it.
Our people,
you know,
by the way,

356
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.950
this is my last week of my forties.

357
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.590
This is it,
man.
I turned 50 years old on Sunday.

358
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:00.840
Can you believe that?
I was 39 when I started this podcast.

359
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:04.320
Way back when,
way back in 2007,
man.

360
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

361
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.450
<v 1>When a guy named George W.
Bush was president and he was a son of a guy,</v>

362
00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:11.120
George Herbert Walker Bush,
and he,

363
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.620
he was the vice president of a guy named Ronald Reagan,
who,
who,

364
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.830
who used to be an actor

365
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.110
and your first four,
look at,

366
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.440
think about everything that has happened since I've started since I was 39 years

367
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:27.750
old.
Oh,
robots are gonna take over the world.
Miami,

368
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.040
she's going to be under Miami.
Miami's going to be underwater

369
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.370
reality TV show star.

370
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

371
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.660
<v 1>Became fucking president.</v>

372
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:39.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

373
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.820
<v 1>We're still fighting the same fucking war.
That's the one constant,</v>

374
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.820
that's the one thing you can hang your hat on.
It'd be like,
oh,
okay,

375
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.740
this is something I'm comfortable with.

376
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.360
There's something I'm used to who says you can never go home.
Yeah.

377
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.530
How long was it before I understood that?
I've talked about that before.
Right.

378
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.740
When they say you never can go home with the fuck you talking about a book,

379
00:23:01.741 --> 00:23:03.060
a flight right now and go home.

380
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.100
I never understood that they meant you're going to go and it's not gonna be the

381
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:10.140
same people and it's just going to be overwhelmingly fucking depressant.

382
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.173
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.640
<v 1>Well anyways,
yeah,
I'm turning 15.
I actually feel good about it.</v>

384
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.530
Dan got 50 push ups the other day.
Right.
That means I'm not going to die.
Right.

385
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.250
Um,
no.

386
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.870
My forties where my best decade as far as my life,

387
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.800
I got married,
I had a kid,
right.
Did a bunch of great shows,

388
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.650

Cleaned house,

389
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.080
cleaned fucking house.
Anybody that was a fucking bigger contin.

390
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:46.840
Me,
you know,
I got of,
so obviously it was a short list.

391
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.740
Sorry.
Easy joke.
What do you,
what do you want from me?
Huh?
What do you want to,

392
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.170
I've been on a fucking plane for the last fucking 12 hours.
Um,

393
00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.300
so I'm looking forward to another decade of experiences and knowledge gaining,

394
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.100
just living my truth.
I feel like for me,

395
00:24:06.101 --> 00:24:08.830

You want to look the best she can,
but you don't want to be.

419
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.200
You don't have to be a pain in the ass.
That's where the black tux comes in.

<v 1>You know it's important to protect your home with the home security system.</v>

465
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.770
Considering these fucking labels more and take away all the guns.

466
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.130

fucking sleeping.

467
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.480
That shit.
How can we protect your home and your privacy?

468
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.480
That's what I love about simply safe.

469
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:28.140
They obsess over details like no or home security company.

470
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.970
Here's an example.
Simply safe has a camera you can control from your phone,

471
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.030
but they want to protect your home and your privacy.

472
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:39.870
So they came up with this brilliant idea,
a private shutter for their camera.

473
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.410
Now simply safe wanted you to be able to hear the shutter click so you know it's

474
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:46.674
closed.

475
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.600
They wanted to have a light on it so you could easily tell when it's on and they

476
00:28:51.601 --> 00:28:54.480
needed to work for the entire lifespan of the system.

477
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.770
I Dunno what I'm talking about right now.
So simply safe.
Got To work.

478
00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:03.070
Testing different metals in hinge designs for months and months.

479
00:29:03.071 --> 00:29:05.830
The result and effective home security camera with a thin,

480
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.490
lightweight aluminum privacy shutter that will work every time.

481
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.820
It's the kind of attention to detail that sets simply safe apart,

482
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.030

I hate when you scroll down in the ad goes with you.

579
00:35:02.161 --> 00:35:04.470
Like that person that's just fucking tagging along.
You know,

580
00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:06.240

<v 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.620
<v 1>Oh Jesus Christ.
Would you look at these fucking things?</v>

583
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

584
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.630
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't look like any of these people.</v>

585
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.250
Well that's nice.
That's not really accurate.
I mean they should.

586
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.650
They should have at least one really pasty

587
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.430
couple of people of color in there.
Then they got some,
no,
nobody was blue eyes.

588
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.970
A couple of Simpson's colored people or Emoji colored now.

589
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.440
Well that's nice.
It's nice that they're doing it.
I bet.
I mean quit my age.

590
00:35:38.441 --> 00:35:40.220
Sends out an Emoji.
Do you know,

591
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.180
you know what emojis I use I all the one that I used the most thumbs up.

592
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

593
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.660
<v 1>Thumbs up.
What I love about thumbs up is it means,
uh,</v>

594
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:50.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

595
00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.430
<v 1>Yes,
I definitely want to do that.
Or it means like fucking whatever.</v>

596
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.760
We got to get together sometime man.
Hang up the arms up,

597
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.980
not fucking hanging out with you.
Right.
Or it could be like,
fuck yeah,

598
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.610
get out there fucking drag.
Um,

599
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.720
all right.
I should have made a top 10 lists of what I could do.
What am,

600
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:20.440
what am I going to do here to make my fifties you know,

601
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.550
the best me lived your truth.

602
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.120
Do you realize like the amount of shit that's going on in the world right now.

603
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.133
Okay.

604
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.250
And just to how self involved myself and club and literally doing a podcast,

605
00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:36.700
just talking to myself,
how's fucking self involved?

606
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.500
The world is right now,
you know,
live your truth.

607
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.650
Be the best.
You've fifty's the new 40

608
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.123
<v 2>you know,</v>

609
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.060
<v 1>everything has to be like,
come on with us for,</v>

610
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.080
so that's why you got those fucking assholes who work out in the garage and then

611
00:36:57.081 --> 00:37:00.080
they start running down the streets.
Everybody knows they will crossfit people.

612
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.800
Right?
Everybody knows they're working out.
It's like we get it,
Yo,
I work out too.

613
00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:07.340
I don't get to fucking start yelling at people who are having brunch.

614
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

615
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.170
<v 1>I don't know.
You know something that,
that right there,</v>

616
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.010
you can remember a few years ago they decided to do away with bullying.

617
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

618
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.230
<v 1>All right.
Which you know,
is a great thing,</v>

619
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.190
but I think you should be able to bully adults because the fact that that's,

620
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.100
you know,
it's not,
it's out of style to bully people.

621
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:27.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.600
<v 1>I think is how crossfit actually exists.
You know,</v>

623
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:37.580
if you basically categorize any sort of criticism is bullying.
You know,

624
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.470
how are you going to know when you're acting like a complete fucking tool?
Shit,

625
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.560
I just don't understand.

626
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.950
I don't find those crossfit people to be in any better shape than anybody else

627
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.270
doing any other workout.

628
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.810
And they had just parading up and down the fucking street.

629
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.610
<v 1>Like,
I dunno what,
like they're inspirational.</v>

631
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.703
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

632
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.280
<v 1>I've never liked,
you know,
I don't like people that do end zone dances.</v>

633
00:38:05.281 --> 00:38:07.440
I just don't like any of that shit.
It's just fucking,

634
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.310
and it's just,
it gives me Deuce chills to look at it.
I Dunno.

635
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.270
Maybe it's a good workout.
I'm going to start doing that,
you know,

636
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.750
do pull ups in my garage and then run up and down my driveway yelling shit.

637
00:38:20.751 --> 00:38:24.170
So my neighbors know that I just did a set of 10 fucking pull ups.

638
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.880
The Bern,
um,
Lebron is Celtic here.

639
00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:36.680
Kay.
Who is the question?
Hey there,
Billy.
Not from Boston.
Uh,

640
00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.540
what if Lebron went to Boston?

641
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:43.910
Kind of goes without saying that winning with Lebron wouldn't feel as good as

642
00:38:43.911 --> 00:38:46.880
winning without Lebron thoughts.

643
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.970
Oh Jesus Christ.
What am I the president?

644
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.900
You just fucking give me a half ass fucking question.
I gotta answer.
I know.
Yeah.

645
00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.140
Obviously,
obviously I'm a,
yeah,

646
00:39:00.141 --> 00:39:02.800
I would rather beat Lebron and fucking them.

647
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.080
Just join my team and then everybody like why it's a fucking pile on team.

648
00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:10.160
It gives a shit a bunch of championship.
Yeah,
obviously.

649
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.510
Thank you,
sir.
Those are my thoughts.
I have the obvious thought on that.
No,

650
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.660
I don't want that to happen.
I would like us to continue doing what we're doing.

651
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.970
We already signed a big free agent with a,

652
00:39:19.971 --> 00:39:23.990
what's his face there that hurt his knee?
Uh,

653
00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:28.380
ginger Vitus what the fuck is his name?
I Dunno.
I'm not,

654
00:39:28.381 --> 00:39:30.660
I'm on a Celtic,
I'm not,
don't know sound something.

655
00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:34.770
I'm just not a basketball guy.
Um,
and I missed all the games this year.

656
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:40.500
All right.
I got a kid,
man.
I got a kid and I,
I miss a lot of stuff.

657
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.600
The guy with the beard who thinks the world is flat,
right?
Is that the guy?

658
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.520
That's the guy again.
I just want to see,
you know,
it's like the New York Yankees,

659
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.970
New York Yankees,
you know,
they,
they,
they,

660
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:54.900
they built off of their farm team and drafting and all that fucking shit,

661
00:39:54.901 --> 00:39:58.680
and then they added one that's fucking stud from the Marlins there.

662
00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.940
Can't get mad at that.

663
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.853
<v 0>MMM.</v>

664
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.410
<v 1>Wait,
a couple of shrewd trades.</v>

665
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.040
We did give up Isaiah Thomas stuff.
Quite swear to God,

666
00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:12.500
if he still was still with the Celtics,
he woulda got his own.
He was like,

667
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.140
he's going to be a big Papi of the Celtics.

668
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.910
A whale of a tale bill.
Did you hear this?

669
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.700
Did you hear about this whale?

670
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

671
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.360
<v 1>By the way,

672
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.130
<v 2>okay</v>

that poor girl calling up if her ex boyfriend crying,</v>

674
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.290
it's,
she literally sounds like the impression me and Paul do when we,

675
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.340
when we do the crying thing,
right?

676
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.420
<v 0>Ooh.
Ooh.
She'd be like,</v>

677
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.110
hello.
I'm sorry I missed your call.

678
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:48.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

679
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:53.120
<v 0>I really hope you call me back.
I love you now.</v>

680
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.970
Do you want me to say that I love you and I miss you,

681
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.633
<v 2>Huh?</v>

682
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.420
<v 1>I'm not even,
I'm not even exaggerating.</v>

683
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.153
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

684
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.280
<v 1>I'm really sad that I missed your call.</v>

685
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.850
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

686
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.300
<v 1>fucking unbelievable.
All right.</v>

687
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:18.301
Pilot whale dies in Thailand after being found with 17 pounds of plastic bags

688
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:20.980
and its stomach.
Yeah.

689
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.280
And also say get excited because they had fucking ginger emojis.

690
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.403
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

691
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.270
<v 1>This is just what,
what are we,
what are we doing?</v>

692
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.851
Oh Man.

693
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:39.851
A male pilot whales struggled for five days to stay alive and Thailand near the

694
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:41.150
Malaysian border.

695
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:47.020
I'll tell you what's fucking crazy is those ocean currents of everything that

696
00:41:47.021 --> 00:41:50.000
think,
oh,
it's from there.
Their plot,
Malaysian plastic bags.
It's probably,

697
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:54.410
you know,
from fucking big fives sports in La.
Um,

698
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.461
Thailand,

699
00:41:55.461 --> 00:42:00.080
you're Malaysian border after rescue is found 17 pounds of plastic bags and its

700
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:02.500
stomach.
Hey,
you can't just eat one.
They like to read us.

701
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.590
The Washington Post reported on Sunday,
but it ultimately succumb to its illness.

702
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:10.040
The whale died on Friday,
the post road in and I tossed it was discovered that,

703
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.310
<v 2>yeah.</v>

704
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.870
<v 1>Thailand's Department of Marine and coastal resource said we're 80 plastic bags</v>

705
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.340
lodged in his stomach

706
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.130
as far from the first time wells have turned up sick or dead from ingesting

707
00:42:23.131 --> 00:42:28.131
trash experts say that the whale likely believed the bags for food.

708
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.580
<v 0>Uh,
God.</v>

709
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.740
<v 1>So what are we going to do about it?
What is the solution?</v>

710
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:41.663
<v 2>Okay.</v>

711
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.550
<v 1>Plastic pollution throughout the region is okay.
Wait a minute.
Let's see.</v>

712
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.580
There's anything positive here.
According to another report by the nation,

713
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.350
a 2015 study by the Ocean Conservatory and Mckinsey Center for Business and

714
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.640
environment found that Thailand was the world's six worst offender for dumping

715
00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:02.630
plastics into the sea.
So who's number one?

716
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.401
Silence.

717
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:08.240
Pollution Control Department says plastic waste is increasing by roughly 12%

718
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:11.270
annual with only 25% being reused.

719
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.440
The v I was pretty good that we reuse 25% it's better than what we used to do.

720
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:17.540
The vast majority of it is plastic bags.

721
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.950
The Bangkok Post writes that the 23 we're never going to get that shit out of

722
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:26.540
the ocean,
by the way.
It's like we just elk switch the cloth bags.

723
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.500
<v 0>Oh my God,</v>

724
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.010
<v 1>we are a fucking plague with shoes.</v>

725
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.270
Bill Hicks said that fucking 25 years ago,

726
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:43.950
the Bangkok Post writes that the 23 coastal provinces in Thailand generate

727
00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:47.080
around 11 million tons of garbage daily.

728
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.640
I thought it was gonna be a year of which approximately 1.1 million tons ends up

729
00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:53.050
being dumped directly into the seat.

730
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.760
Plastic pollution throughout the region is expected to remain a significant

731
00:43:57.761 --> 00:43:58.061
issue.

732
00:43:58.061 --> 00:44:02.110
As many Asian countries are spurring economic growth that is outpacing waste

733
00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:06.100
management infrastructure.
Here's the thing,
where the fuck do you put it?

734
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.973
You know what I mean?

735
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:14.880
I Dunno.
This is when you,

736
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.460
this is when you need hipsters because they're going to go,

737
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.090
go back the biodegradable shit.

738
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.580
She's trying to be cool,
but they're actually going to create a,
hopefully,

739
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:28.010
I don't know.
Oh boy.

740
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

741
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.820
<v 1>What the fuck are we doing?
These fucking,
what are they doing?</v>

742
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:39.390
It's just all about the fucking money.
They don't give a fuck wars pollution.

743
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:42.060
They don't kill kids.
They don't give a fuck,

744
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.630
and none of these fucking politicians as a goddamn thing about it.

745
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.640
<v 2>Okay?</v>

746
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.240
<v 1>It's just fucking unreal because they need the corporation's Marty.
It's just,</v>

747
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:55.920
it's literally,
it's like a suicide pact.
How the fuck do you get out of that?
Ah,

748
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:59.400
this is the press,
like the Irish News.
It's depressing.
All right.

749
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:04.100
Massachusetts male mentality.
All right,

750
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.650
here we go.
Hey Bill,
I'm excited to be going to show a,

751
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.300
your Boston show in the fall.
By the way,
man,

752
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:15.200
I transcribed that fucking Metallica song and it might double Bass player is

753
00:45:15.201 --> 00:45:17.990
finally coming together.
I just been sticking with it.

754
00:45:17.991 --> 00:45:21.010
Now of course it won't be on the road for a couple of weeks,
but I'll,

755
00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:22.900
I'll get it back up to speed.
Um,

756
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:24.230
<v 2>yeah.</v>

757
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.860
<v 1>You know,</v>

758
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.660
Lars has like these four or five signature licks and once you get those things

759
00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:33.680
down,
you can kind of do a real shitty version of all of their songs.

760
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:38.200
I still suck,
but like I can actually,
I'm starting to be able to play along.
Uh,

761
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.810
I could definitely do like the,
the 16th no thing,
but he does that little,

762
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.910
that triplet before the snare with a crash,
uh,
China that he always does.

763
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.640
Dad.
That.
Yeah,
that one's a little tough.
Uh,

764
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.380
love your podcast.
It's one of the things that keeps me saying,
all right,

765
00:45:54.381 --> 00:45:57.980
I appreciate when you say positive things about your relationship with your wife

766
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.560
and now you're so glad to be on the other side.

767
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:04.370
I'm a 42 year old single female and it's downright depressing around here.

768
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:07.520
I've been married so don't need to do that again.

769
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.480
We just like to meet someone who wants a steady monogamous relationship.

770
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:12.561
Unfortunately,

771
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:17.561
the guys around here seem to obtain their intimacy from their relationship with

772
00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:23.840
their male friends.
Women are viewed as an afterthought at best,

773
00:46:23.841 --> 00:46:27.350
but usually as a nuisance or a threat.
Oh,
you're in Massachusetts.

774
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.740
I got it is easy.
It's an easy fix.
Get into sports,

775
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.760
get into sports,
start watching sports,

776
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:41.530
increase your alcohol intake and your guy will be your best friend you ever had

777
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.670
a,
why do guys have a mob mentality when it comes to women?

778
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.150
They seem to think it's giving up to settle down,

779
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.060
but don't they fear being alone later in life?
Why did grown men care?

780
00:46:55.061 --> 00:46:58.510
What their friends think and why wouldn't they be happy?
They are.

781
00:46:58.511 --> 00:47:02.350
Boy is living with living a fulfilling life.

782
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.330
I'm cute and decent shape.

783
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.760
I'd say I'm a seven and a half and it looks department.

784
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.920
And you're humble being serious.
Yeah.
Decent shape.
You know,
you're honest.

785
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:17.080
Have a fun personality.
Can support myself.
I don't care about having kids,

786
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.920
but the schmucks I've been dealing with lately make me feel like giving up

787
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.410
altogether and another mystery to solve.

788
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:26.830
Why do my friends and I frequently see good looking good.

789
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:32.340
Why do my friends and I frequency looking guys and women who look miserable?

790
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.160
Uh,

791
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.040
if you wouldn't mind taking a few minutes to wax philosophical on the benefits

792
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.050
of relationship with the opposite sex,
that would be great.

793
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:45.540
Happy Birthday from a fellow Gemini.
Um,
all right.
Oh,

794
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.710
why did got,
why are guys afraid to settle down?
Well,
uh,

795
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.870
because women take guys for everything they've got in divorce court all the

796
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:56.704
fucking time.

797
00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

798
00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.810
<v 1>All right.
And like,</v>

799
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.740
there's only so many of those fucking nightmares that you can,
you can watch,

800
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:09.680
um,
before you're like,
why the fuck would I want to do that?
I mean,

801
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.260
that was my attitude for the longest God damn time.

802
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:16.520
And um,
when you get into a relationship,

803
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:21.550
a lot of times you are at the mercy of the females moods.

804
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

805
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.440
<v 1>And you know,
there's,
you know,</v>

806
00:48:25.441 --> 00:48:28.050
there's all this shit out here right now talking about all the shit that guy's

807
00:48:28.051 --> 00:48:32.070
do to women,
all this horrible shit.
But uh,
I'm waiting for the,
you know,

808
00:48:32.071 --> 00:48:35.700
the winds to turn and pull back a little bit and talk about,
you know,

809
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.600
just this constant fucking like,

810
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:40.880
<v 2>okay,</v>

811
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.890
<v 1>you know,
keeping you on eggshells.</v>

812
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

813
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:48.000
<v 1>You know,
keep it happy,
keep it happy,
keep her happy.
You know,
that happy,</v>

814
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.840
happy wife.
Happy life is what they say.
There's no rhyme for the debt.

815
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:58.090
There isn't.
So,
you know,
and everything is about you guys.

816
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.170
I'm just being honest.
You know the weddings all about you.

817
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:06.240
Valentine's Day is all about you,
the anniversaries,
all about you.

818
00:49:06.241 --> 00:49:09.220
It's all the guy.
What are you going to get her?
And it's like,

819
00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:14.470
it's all geared that you are so fucking privileged and lucky to have this
person,

820
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:19.660
but there's really not that sort of reciprocal mentality.
So,

821
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.620
um,
but when you're a single guy,
you know,
you got the world by the balls,

822
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.850
we make more,
more money an hour at dairy queen evidently,

823
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:32.050
or whatever the fuck it is that you guys are saying.
The Tappan Zee,
Yo,

824
00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.140
you hang out,
you watch sports,
you go down to the bar,
you talk some shit.

825
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:37.750
Maybe you get laid,
get up fucking blow job and you wake up the next day,

826
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:41.290
not in a relationship that's really appealing and you still have all your money

827
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.140
or a lot of it it's appealing.
Um,

828
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.580
I would also,
you know,
so I dunno,
I'm not,
I'm not,

829
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.440
I know you want me to say something positive.

830
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.010
I'm just answering that first thing.
Um,

831
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:01.380
you guys are terrifying and you act like you're not when you're talking to men,

832
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.310
but amongst yourselves,
you know,
amongst yourself.

833
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:12.470
I'm sure you're a little more honest about like,
you know,

834
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:17.350
the sanity
of,
uh,
you know,

835
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:24.190
so many women out there.
Yes.
There's just fucking nuts.
The fuck.
Or they'll,

836
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.530
they'll get pregnant on purpose.
I mean the,
the fucking,

837
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:28.850
they'll bring a person into the fucking world.
I mean,

838
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.700
crazy fucking crazy.

839
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.293
<v 0>MMM.</v>

840
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:38.800
<v 1>God.
I've got to try to see something positive here.
Jesus Christ.
Uh,</v>

841
00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.670
why you have a problem?
Well,
you know,
you're also like,
you're like me.

842
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:45.170
You waited a while.

843
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:47.783
<v 0>MMM.</v>

844
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.660
<v 1>All those people that are like want to find love and all that.
You know,</v>

845
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.230
you got a draft in the earlier rounds,
so when you were in your 20s,

846
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.550
there was a bunch of blue chip prospects there.
Now you're in your 42.

847
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:02.880
You got to try to find your six round draft.
Tom Brady,

848
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:07.320
that's what you have to do.
So it's going to be more work.
Um,

849
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.450
but I somehow pulled it off.

850
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.633
<v 0>MMM.</v>

851
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.700
<v 1>Grant,
but I was 35.
She was 25.</v>

852
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.133
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

853
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:22.170
<v 1>I moved up in the draft.
That's what I did.
Maybe want a date.
A younger guy,</v>

854
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.580
I dunno.
But I always looked at it this way that you know you're,
you know,

855
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:30.300
if you're out there and you seem cool,
if you're out there,

856
00:51:30.301 --> 00:51:34.230
there's going to be your,
your match is going to be out there.
But like it's,
it's,

857
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:35.500
<v 0>yeah,</v>

858
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:40.500
<v 1>dangerous as I just trashed women to go down that road to say they're all like</v>

859
00:51:41.201 --> 00:51:43.300
this or why does so many people blah blah blah.

860
00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:47.980
You start getting fucking jaded and the reality is you could do that about

861
00:51:47.981 --> 00:51:50.020
anything.
Why are most people fucking inconsiderate?

862
00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:51.670
Why most people fucking morons?

863
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.790
Why don't most people stand in a security line at the airport,

864
00:51:54.791 --> 00:51:56.890
rolling their eyes,
looking at you,
bonding it.

865
00:51:56.891 --> 00:51:58.540
Like can you believe how long this is taking?

866
00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:02.260
And then they do nothing to be prepared for when it's their time.

867
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.160
When it's showtime,

868
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:07.000
they just start to take the fucking belt off and all that and they become the

869
00:52:07.001 --> 00:52:09.730
fucking problem.
They don't notice it.
Okay.

870
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.550
That's why meeting somebody awesome is so fucking special.

871
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.870
Cause there's not a lot of them out there.
So you hang in there and a,

872
00:52:16.871 --> 00:52:19.570
I think you're going to find the person that wants to have the relationship you

873
00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:19.811
want,

874
00:52:19.811 --> 00:52:24.340
that you want and I think the relationship you're looking for is what a lot of

875
00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:29.230
guys are probably looking for around your age.

876
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:33.530
Right.
If I was you,
I'd get a divorce seat.

877
00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.040
They're already had his fucking kids already did that bullshit and then he can

878
00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:39.600
just fucking,
you know,
hang with you.

879
00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:42.870
You're not looking to get married and you're looking at have any fucking kids

880
00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:45.870
you can just fucking hang out and drink.
Cape Cod is and watch the pets.

881
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.940
There you go.
Big Bang.
Boom.
Nice.
Solve your problem.

882
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:56.520
Probably not.
A wife wants to use my computer.

883
00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:00.360
Oh Jason's where he got a bunch of porn on there.
Hey Billy Bob Burton.

884
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:05.340
I've dealt with my girl for five years and married for one and I refuse to let

885
00:53:05.341 --> 00:53:06.360
her use my computer.

886
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.640
Is it because of porn or cheating is because my PC is worth close to 20 grand.

887
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.530
What I used to work for graphic designer,

888
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:21.360
animator and gaming A.
I didn't know they made laptops worth that much.

889
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.450
I even had it set up,
so I am not,

890
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.740
so if I'm not within three feet of it,

891
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.050
<v 2>okay,</v>

892
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:28.950
<v 1>it is locked.</v>

893
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.010
I have a piece of jewelry with an RF ID chip that unlocks my PC when I'm near

894
00:53:36.361 --> 00:53:39.950
it.
Well,
I got news for you,
dude.
Anybody who wants,

895
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:42.380
who knows anything about computers can turn that fucking thing on from a

896
00:53:42.381 --> 00:53:45.700
different computer when they're not even in the fucking room.
I guarantee you a,

897
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:49.070
I told her even before we were married that she will never use my computer.

898
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.580
She has never had a phone that wasn't cracked or broken.

899
00:53:52.581 --> 00:53:54.500
And the last time she brought up my computer,

900
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.800
I bought her a thousand dollars PC of her own,

901
00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.660
which she lost within a week.
Am I being too unreasonable or Imi?
Right?

902
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.270
Not Wanting to ruin my computer.
Do you let Nia use your computer?
Uh,

903
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:12.160
yes I do,
but like my computer's a fucking mess.
Um,
no,
I don't think,
you know,

904
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:17.120
she hasn't demonstrated that she is.
You can take care of shit.

905
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:22.340
Here's the thing,
if she's,
if she was saying you couldn't use hers,

906
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:26.210
if my wife was like,
you can't use my computer,
this is super expensive.

907
00:54:26.211 --> 00:54:29.060
I do graphic designer,
I'd be like,
I don't want to use your fucking computer.

908
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.520
I hate computers.
Have Fun with your computer,
you know,
but um,

909
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.013
<v 2>you know,</v>

910
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.130
<v 1>it probably makes her insecure because that is where porn and cheating and all</v>

911
00:54:42.131 --> 00:54:46.120
that shit fucking happens.
So I'm choosing to believe you when this,

912
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:47.890
if you're not doing that shit.

913
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:49.060
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

914
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.620
<v 1>And if it truly is because you have this awesome fucking $20,000 fucking</v>

915
00:54:53.621 --> 00:54:54.454
computer,

916
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:56.630
<v 2>uh,</v>

917
00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.790
<v 1>yeah,
I don't,
I don't know what the problem is.</v>

918
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.913
<v 2>Okay.</v>

919
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.260
<v 1>I would just sit there.
You know what I would do?
I would take her phone.</v>

920
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.200
Yeah.
I would open my laptop and then I have her phone right next to it,
you know,

921
00:55:12.201 --> 00:55:15.680
with the cracked screen.
I go,
look at your phone,
look at my computer.

922
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:19.460
What's the difference?
Oh,
get your PC to honey.
Oh,
that's right.
You lost it.

923
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.760
You lost it.
That's right.
So now what?
What have we learned here?

924
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.740
And this is a thing.
Let her get mad.

925
00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:27.663
<v 2>Okay?</v>

926
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:32.540
<v 1>She's going to fucking storm away and be all fucking mad.
And then once again,</v>

927
00:55:32.541 --> 00:55:35.780
like I was talking about in that previous one,
she's gonna,
you know,

928
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.000
do that whole thing where I'm,
you know,

929
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.300
I'm saying the cal done a gang I'm mad at.
Yeah.
Um,

930
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.533
<v 2>yeah,</v>

931
00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:47.540
<v 1>she's just going to do that shit.
And you know what letter</v>

932
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.840
you just,
you just,
you sit over there,
pout all you want,
you know,

933
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:57.140
I'm right.
And then they'll get mad.
They'll,

934
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.730
they'll switch out of the pouty thing.
Then they get fucking mad.

935
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.700
It's a whole goddamn process.
Just be like,
no,
you can't,
you,

936
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.130
I would hold my ground on that one.

937
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:06.680
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

938
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.660
<v 1>Just say,
listen,
over the next year,</v>

939
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:13.280
if you demonstrate that you cannot actually be around computers without breaking

940
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.100
them or losing them,
you know,

941
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.160
maybe in 12 months I'll let you look over my shoulder.

942
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.443
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

943
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.940
<v 1>Just tell her that's not how works.</v>

944
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:31.930
You have to earn things.
All right?
Most of us do anyways,

945
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.330
but you wouldn't know that.
Listen to all these fucking feminists out there.

946
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:37.540
I think if you're a guy,
you just fucking show up.
People give shit.

947
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:42.850
I'm still hoping it becomes a level playing field.
I can't wait.

948
00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:44.903
I cannot wait.

949
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:48.580
That's going to be the greatest fucking thing ever when they realize what a

950
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:50.860
giant shit sandwich they still have to eat.

951
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.080
Oh,
it looked appetizing when you were peeking over the fence,

952
00:56:56.081 --> 00:57:00.490
didn't it sweetheart?
All right.
That's it.
Everybody.
That's the podcast here.
Uh,

953
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:04.800
thank you to everybody over here in Ireland.
Even before I do the show.

954
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:07.650
Thank you for everybody for buying tickets to come out to the show.

955
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.120
It's an honor and a privilege to be here.
Get Beautiful Emerald Aisle and a,

956
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.290
I hope I give you money for it tomorrow night.
Uh,
go capital's Anna.
You know,

957
00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:20.220
I also like the Vegas Knights to their coach gave a speech or something,

958
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.720
the GM the beginning of the year and then an expansion franchise if you don't

959
00:57:24.721 --> 00:57:25.980
watch hockey.
And he said,

960
00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.700
all you guys in this locker room are here for the exact same reasons.

961
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.310
The last team you played for didn't think you were worth being protected.

962
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.630
Me Right there.

963
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.210
They got the chip on their shoulder and they'd been fucking Moan every week.

964
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.530
Everybody down ever since till they ran into the Washington capitals.
Uh,

965
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.840
I'm going to try to find a way to somehow watch that game,

966
00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.810
although I think tonight comes on at like two in the morning,

967
00:57:48.811 --> 00:57:50.860
so I might be fucked.
Um,

968
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:55.620
and I don't know if I can't,
I can't watch the fucking NBA

969
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.690
Huda fuck reviews.
A charging call.

970
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.610
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

971
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.850
<v 1>the final few.
I've never seen that before.
My fuck.
Oh my God.</v>

972
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

973
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.020
<v 1>You know,
but thank God they did.
Thank God they did because I was able to,</v>

974
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.800
I didn't have to waste time watching the rest of the fucking game.
And then I,

975
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.121
you know,

976
00:58:13.121 --> 00:58:18.121
I went for a nice brisk walk is good for my hat.

977
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.640
Um,
that's it.
Guess what people were into June,

978
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:28.360
which means we are only two months away from the start of football season

979
00:58:28.641 --> 00:58:32.480
preseason just like that.
It's coming around again and the God knows the way.

980
00:58:32.481 --> 00:58:35.480
There's like four days off between every fucking NBA game.

981
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:38.420
You probably just going to have to do a,
you know,

982
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:43.490
the last week of June and July and then you're going to be right there.

983
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:44.960
Then you're going to be right there.

984
00:58:44.961 --> 00:58:48.770
Although I've gotten back into baseball some about going to that giants game and

985
00:58:48.771 --> 00:58:51.350
keeping score,
eating the peanuts,
drinking that fucking course.

986
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

987
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:53.463
<v 1>I liked it.</v>

988
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:54.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

989
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.670
<v 1>You know,
I went down and bought some cigars the other day.
Right?</v>

990
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.910
Oh bill eat French fries.
You're smoking cigars and drinking beer.

991
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:03.490
What are you doing?
Much joy.
It myself.
Um,

992
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:07.680
I walked into this cigar shop and I gotta be honest with you.
I walked in there,

993
00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:09.810
you know,
it was,
it was also a lounge where people could smoke and shit.

994
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:14.870
And I have never seen anybody smoking a cigar who did not look like they would

995
00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:16.770
just totally fucking relaxed.

996
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:18.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

997
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.340
<v 1>Just absolutely,
absolutely in heaven,
you know,</v>

998
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:22.610
<v 2>like</v>

999
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.980
<v 1>true cigar smokers.
I walk in no time.
I walk in,</v>

1000
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:29.060
I just go look at that guy just sitting there
cause I always have shit to do.

1001
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:30.620
So I run in and I buy them and then I run out.

1002
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:32.720
But I always see people just sitting there like that's what the,

1003
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.230
that's how you do it.
Come down in the middle of the day,
honey,

1004
00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:37.100
I'm going out for a minute.

1005
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1006
00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:42.340
<v 1>Where are you going?
No purchase.
Who is she?</v>

1007
00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:43.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1008
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.680
<v 1>Her name is low.
Uh,
Aurora,
Emerald.</v>

1009
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.710
Lao,
Aurora,
Emerald.
All right.
That's it.
Everybody.
I will see you.

1010
00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:54.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1011
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:57.670
<v 1>Tomorrow night if you're here in Dublin,
if not,
I'll check it on your,</v>
