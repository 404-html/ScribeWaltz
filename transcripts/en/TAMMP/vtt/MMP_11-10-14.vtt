00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.800
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:10.600
November 10th,
2014 hour.
Why?
Yeah,
how you doing?

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.310
What's going on?
Um,
how was your weekend?

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.990
Oh,
did it go by too fast?
They always do,
don't they?

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.760
Those fucking days off.
Nothing flies by like a fucking day off.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.500
It's unbelievable.
What a fuck does it work like that?

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.880
Why shouldn't a day off go by just a slow.
There was any,

8
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.510
if there's any sort of like,
just fucking fairness in the goddamn world.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.190
Wouldn't a day off go just as slow as a workday.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.410
You know this,
you know there's some egg head out there.

11
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.100
Well Tech Deck Lay yet dodge ball 24 hour.

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.670
Shut the fuck up actually.
You know what egg head,

13
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.000
why don't you hang out with me and my day off and then it'll fucking go just as

14
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.620
slow as a Tuesday.
It's nothing worse than a Tuesday.
You know,

15
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:03.900
everybody fucking talks about Mondays,
right?

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
Like dead fucking band where the dude was banging his own daughter,

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.010
the mamas and the Papas where they don't want to sing that song rainy days.

18
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:18.120
And Mondays always get me down.

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.200
You know what was that Karen Carpenter

20
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.220
sitting there just eating the crust of a sandwich.
Karat white.

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.980
Ya Don't do that bill dot.
Not too,
too early in the podcast.
All right.

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't,
don't fucking start giving Karen proper into shit.

23
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.670
Just cause you jealous cause she's a better drummer than you could ever be.

24
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.470
All right,
Bill fucking stand down.
Um,
no,
that's all it shit.

25
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:44.960
That old,
that whole thing where,
you know,

26
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.480
three weeks of working out is like negated by three days of bad eating.

27
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.863
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.520
<v 1>You know,
I don't know what it is.
Like,
uh,
I dunno,</v>

29
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.920
I become old Frito face the last couple of fucking weeks and it's like I never

30
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.340
did a pull up in my life,
you know,
so,
um,

31
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440
I got to get back on the stick.
I'm actually back here,
uh,
east coast last night.

32
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.010
I got to do the comics come home.
Um,
that was actually,

33
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:12.780
I thought it was going to be a guidance Serena,
again,

34
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.290
it was at the fleet at TD bank,

35
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.010
North Gatton fucking whatever,
whatever the fuck they call it.

36
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.830
Where the Bruins and Celtics play that we actually had the show there.

37
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:27.480
I had a great time.
I went on last after a bunch of BS comics.
Uh,

38
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000
and uh,
speaking of pull ups,
we were in the bowels of the,
uh,

39
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:37.140
of the arena and they had like these pull up bars,
which I imagined,
you know,

40
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:37.980
Bruins a Celtic,

41
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.400
she was probably the Bruins Celtics at two fucking tall to do a pull up,

42
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.320
aren't they?
Um,

43
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.040
and I was over there with Lenny Clarke who's like 63 years old and he does pull

44
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:51.300
ups and he fucking bangs out like 10 of them.

45
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:55.260
It's 63 Lenny class,
right.

46
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:56.730
This is what we're doing before we're going on.

47
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:01.660
He had just came off with his fucking lime green,
the guy such a character.

48
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.370
First of all,
he's wearing these uh,

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.670
daddy Warbucks like loafers with these gold inlays with the sweatpants and a t

50
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.680
shirt and he's walking around before the show.

51
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.570
So I'm looking at the shoes and I'm going,
all right.

52
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.030
Those are definitely his show shoes.

53
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.790
There's no way he's wearing the rest of that shit on stage.

54
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.510
And those shoes are the,
uh,
the,
the big,
Hey,

55
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.480
I'm in show Biz fucking part of the outfit.

56
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.220
And who would have known that those shoes were actually going to be that the,

57
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.690
the muted effect to tether the whole outfit to,
to a,
some sort of earth.

58
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.150
Um,
I believe he had on,
uh,
was hard.

59
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.870
I can't really tell because you couldn't look at him for too long,
you know,

60
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.830
without going blind.

61
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:49.831
He had on lime green fucking pants and I had some sort of Blue Pink Paisley

62
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.530
shirt tucked in as you do.

63
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.190
I mean that's just standard fair when you have on lime green plants.

64
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.430
And then he had on his fucking black slippers with gold inlay.
So anyways,

65
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:01.480
he's dressed like that.

66
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.020
I'm wearing my show shirt and we're in the bowels of the fleet or the TD bank,

67
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.170
North Gatton,
whatever the fuck they call it.
Right.
Um,

68
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.040
the jobbing.com center,
whatever the fuck they call the thing this year.

69
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.870
And they had the pull up bar and I was showing them how to increase the amount

70
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:21.860
of pullups that you can do by doing the negative.

71
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:26.200
She got to go the negatives dough,
right to fucking Boston Morons,

72
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.650
uh,
you know,
going up and then going down slowly,

73
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.980
you go down slowly cause usually you just let gravity do that well instead of

74
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.850
using your muscles.

75
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.960
And that will actually increase your pull ups over time if you do that,

76
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.851
you know,
if you do that.

77
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.220
And then every once in a while when you go to do your three sets of pullups,

78
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.260
you bang out the first set.
You just go until exhaustion,
as many as you can do.

79
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.330
And even after you can't bring your Chin over the bar,

80
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:53.350
you still do reps and just count reps,
you know,
and uh,

81
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.520
that's the way you go from 12 to 15,
15 to 17 and that type of thing.

82
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:02.521
So that's basically what we were doing while we were waiting to go on.

83
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.010
And,
uh,
Tony Vee was there and,
uh,
he brought some cigars.

84
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.120
Mark Marin was on the show.
Bobby Kelly was on the show.
Jimmy Fallon,

85
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.630
Jim Gaffigan,
uh,

86
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.520
Dennis leary hosted.
It was just,
um,

87
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.450
it was just,
it was a veritable hose Ho,
um,

88
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.430
of the whole scene.
And,
uh,
I already know,

89
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:33.460
I forgot a couple of fucking guys you had spent and when you do look a Gig that

90
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:37.870
God damn big,
but,
um,
it was just a great time.

91
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:41.230
All the Bruins were there and uh,

92
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.790
got to hang out a little bit with those guys.
And uh,

93
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.790
what else?
I Dunno,
it was just a,

94
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.270
my head's still spinning from being able to perform that fucking unbelievable.

95
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.560
Really unbelievable.
It was an amazing night Cam Neely Jesus Christ.
I knew,

96
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:02.200
I'd forget somebody can't nearly was there.
It's only his frigging um,

97
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.310
benefit.
And um,
then they had all these guys like made tapes and stuff.
Uh,

98
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.230
John Steward,
Conan O'brien and hilarious one.
Um,
all that stuff,
you know,

99
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.160
great time,
raised a bunch of money and uh,
you know,
I did my shit,

100
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:21.080
I got my new jokes,
you know,
I pissed a few people off,
but in and out,
it's just,

101
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.270
it's fucking weird.
It's just where my act is right now.

102
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.790
And it's one of those things with standup where,
uh,

103
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.870
it's not like learning how to play drums or guitar.
You can't practice it,

104
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.320
you know,
by yourself.
And then go out and go do it.

105
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.490
You have to try it out in front of people.
So,
you know,

106
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.380
overall I thought my set went well,
went off the rails a little bit or whatever,

107
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.720
but uh,
what are you going to do?
It happens,
you know,

108
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:46.530
every once in a while you go into the guard rail there.
But,
uh,
it was still,

109
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.020
I was still a great time.
It's always good to see all the fellas there.
And um,

110
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.340
I dunno.
So I can't believe it's 20 it was 20 years.

111
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

112
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.140
<v 1>20 years of that fucking thing.
And uh,
I actually,
this is how old I am.</v>

113
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.960
I did the second one
early on.
I did this,

114
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:11.910
I did the second one,
which seems like a about six years ago,

115
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:14.010
but it was actually 18 years ago,
believe it or not.

116
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.630
So there 19 years into doing it,
but it's the 20th one that they did and I did.

117
00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:20.670
The second one is for all you fucking egg heads out there,

118
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:21.660
who are going to send me tweets,

119
00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:24.390
going to actually all be through the fucking who can we shut the fuck up?

120
00:07:24.391 --> 00:07:27.000
All right.
I was 28 when I did the first one,

121
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:30.750
and now I'm 46 is basically what I'm telling you.
Um,

122
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.620
<v 0>okay.</v>

123
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.410
<v 1>I know it's crazy.
I can't believe how much fucking time has gone by.
Uh,</v>

124
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.460
Patrice has mom was there and Georgia of course,

125
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.890
it's always nice to see her and we were all excited about the benefit.

126
00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:43.020
We're doing it.
The third annual Patrice O'neil,

127
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.910
a comedy benefit that's coming up in February.
Once again,

128
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.060
we'll be at the city center in New York City,
um,

129
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.040
putting together that lineup as we speak.
Um,

130
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.660
I dunno.
So I'll always a good thing.
And of course the always adorable.

131
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:04.200
Jimmy Serpico was there looking as adorable as ever.
It's weird.

132
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.100
Most of us are aging,
but Jimmy Serpico for some reason,

133
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:10.850
he just keeps getting more adorable with every year.
You know,

134
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.170
you just want to pick them up and take them home.

135
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.850
I'm just fucking with him.
Um,
anyways,
so,
oh,

136
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.650
fucking Joe [inaudible] was there.
How the hell did I forget Joe,

137
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:27.720
you Aneta who actually fucking beat cancer this year.

138
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.210
Um,
and he has a terrifying,

139
00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:34.670
terrifying story as to how he got it.
Uh,

140
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.040
so if you'd like to hear it come out to a saga son,

141
00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:40.230
I don't know if he's going to do it.
I assume he's going to do it.

142
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.340
He told the story last night.
It's fucking unbelievable.
I think he,

143
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.180
I don't know if he says how we got it.
Um,
I was actually,

144
00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:49.560
once he started doing the story,
I was like,

145
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:52.620
I gotta get Outta here because if he's going to be to go in this level of

146
00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:55.880
personal stuff,
I'm going to bomb after him.
Um,

147
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.880
but he told the story of how he got it.
So,
uh,

148
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:03.500
if you can't make it to giggles and sagas tonight,
um,
up on route one,

149
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:04.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

150
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.670
<v 1>You know,
diagonally up from the fucking cat alone.
Uh,</v>

151
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.120
go see Jovian and live.
It's

152
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:12.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

153
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.500
<v 1>It's a fucking scary story because if he got it,</v>

154
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.570
any of us could potentially get it.
It's fucking terrifying.
And that,

155
00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.780
speaking of terrifying,
I,
uh,

156
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:30.040
my flight from Los Angeles into Logan Airport,
everything's going,

157
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.150
everything's going fine.

158
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.833
<v 0>Right?</v>

159
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.900
<v 1>We take off from a lax.
Yeah.
When you look down to the left,</v>

160
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:41.470
you see that little fucking barrier where Marine Del Rey is where Bravo airspace

161
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.083
is.

162
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.100
You know the helicopters go 150 feet off the fucking surface to transition the

163
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.980
bravo airspace.
We're fucking up and over those cuts.
We Bang a left,

164
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.540
we're climbing up.
You know,
going back over Hollywood was so high up.

165
00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:59.500
I can see over the Hollywood hills.
I can see into the valley.
You know,

166
00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:01.210
I saw it at Ucla campus.

167
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.240
Then you see a la coliseum went right over the fucking rose bowl and then right

168
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:10.240
off into the Mojave desert,
flew right over Vegas.
I looked down,

169
00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:11.300
I saw this strategy,

170
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.683
<v 0>right</v>

171
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.280
<v 1>then you're under Utah.
You go over the continental divide,</v>

172
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:20.460
the fucking rocky mountains,
and then we out.
We're out of the great plagues,

173
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.450
the food supply.
Everybody,
that's where they poison it.

174
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.130
Bright there from the hall monitors.

175
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.350
Zoma God bless America,
right?

176
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.720
Flying Right over our food supply that for some reason,

177
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.480
some reason we're letting these conch poison it,

178
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.513
<v 0>right?</v>

179
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.790
<v 1>Some reason we're going after the terrorist over there,</v>

180
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.080
but the fucking ones in the suits over.
Yeah,
it's okay.
So,
okay.

181
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.590
Spray the big casino all over it.
Keep the bugs off at fantastic.
Ah,

182
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.950
just rinse it under a faucet.
You'll be fine anyways.

183
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.220
Hey,
feed that cow some more cow.
Um,

184
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.110
cut the beaks off them so you fly over that shit right then.

185
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:10.980
I don't know.
By then the sun started going down and everything was fine.
And uh,

186
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.430
you know,

187
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.430
I was working on writing some stuff and shooting the shit with this guy and I

188
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:20.940
was telling me he's got this room he has and he's got a garage right with a room

189
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:23.970
over it,
which is my dream fucking house,
man.

190
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:27.360
I always wanted to have an old house with a detached garage with a room over at,

191
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:28.410
I already told you this shit.

192
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.800
I turned the upstairs into a drum room slash cigar bar slash hooker lounge slash

193
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:40.560
sports bar like every man wants.
Right.
Um,

194
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.820
so he basically had that minus the hookers,
minuses,
cigar bar minus the drums,

195
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:46.990
whatever.
He had his,
his fucking new pool table and all that shit.

196
00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:49.950
So we're having a great time.
Just a good guy shooting the shit with,

197
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.070
he wasn't coughing,
he didn't seem like he had a bowler was a nice time.

198
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.840
So all of a sudden we,

199
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.030
we started our initial said descended to the Boston area and um,

200
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.430
we're out over the fucking war,
you know,

201
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.380
and all of a sudden we were just doing like this circular pattern.

202
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.490
I think we were north of the city up by Newbury port in Marblehead and we're

203
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.300
just doing like this fucking circle.

204
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.840
And we go round and we go around again and I'm thinking,
uh,

205
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.210
this is a holding pattern that seems really low.

206
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.770
And uh,
the guy comes on and he's like,
Eh,
we haven't a,

207
00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:30.130
a little mechanical issue.
Let me try to work it out.

208
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:33.280
And then we have the ground shortly.
But I love that we're having,

209
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.260
we're having a mechanical problem.
Uh,
but we expect to be on the ground shortly.

210
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:39.850
That can be taken two different ways.

211
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.130
Either we're going to fix it and I'll be able to land this fucker or it's going

212
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:46.360
to be a catastrophic failure of something,

213
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:50.560
at which point gravity is going to take over and land this plane for us.
Right,

214
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.550
right.
To somebody back deck there.
Um,

215
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.950
so long story short,
um,

216
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.110
I wasn't even paying attention.
That's the weird part.
I wasn't nervous at all,

217
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.540
which was another weird thing.
So,
uh,

218
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.850
he comes on the fucking thing and he would going in for the landing and he said,

219
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:17.590
uh,
okay,
we're gonna begin our initial descent to a final whatever,

220
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:19.680
blah blah blah at Logan airport.
Uh,

221
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.900
just to let you know there's gotta be some emergency vehicles on the runway.

222
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.950
There's nothing to be concerned about.
This is just standard procedure,
but,
but,

223
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.950
but,
but it's like what the foot fucky going to be nervous about.

224
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:32.560
They brought up the fire trucks.
I know what this is for.

225
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.700
This is in case we're all covered in jet fuel in eight minutes and we're on
fire.

226
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.030
At which point you can't really save any of us.

227
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.590
You just preventing this airplane from burning down the rest of the airport is

228
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:49.540
we cartwheel down the fucking runway.
So anyways,
long story short,

229
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:53.470
there was a flap that was stuck.
Um,

230
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.580
somebody said it was stuck up,
but we had to land faster than normal.

231
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:01.260
So I don't think it was able,
I don't think it was moving.
You don't,

232
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:06.250
don't you go flaps down or whatever to slow the fucking thing down when you go

233
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:08.370
to land.
Isn't that what,
how these years of flying?

234
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.260
I believe that that's what happens.
Um,
what,

235
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:14.500
what have we had the land faster than a,

236
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.560
probably what you're supposed to probably outside the envelope is the pilot say

237
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.010
landed.
Not,
it didn't even land that heart,
you know,

238
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:28.270
and everybody in the back of applauds,
nobody in first class applauds,
you know,

239
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.440
cause they don't have any Sol's,
uh,
including myself,
you know,

240
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.110
and as we land and,
uh,
we pull over whatever and it was,
uh,

241
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.680
it was pretty fucking awesome.

242
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.210
Pretty awesome feeling knowing that the guy was that good.
The basically just

243
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.480
prevented us all from dying.
I guess.

244
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.030
They all do it every time they landed safely.
But uh,

245
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.530
to be able to kind of handle that,

246
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.170
I just can't imagine being that pilot up there.

247
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.020
You only like comforting feeling I would have,
would you,

248
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.580
you'd have more concerned for the people in the back then you did for yourself

249
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.650
so you can kind of stay relaxed and just be thinking,
I have to keep my,

250
00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:08.810
which so I don't kill these other people.
But other than that,
what if,

251
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.670
what our responsibility,
can you imagine that if I fuck this up,

252
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.520
I'm going to kill 350 people,
you know?
And then even worse,

253
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.190
whenever you know,
a plane goes down,
they examine it.

254
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:25.900
And if it comes down to being like,
even though that was a mechanical situation,

255
00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:27.160
you know,
at some point they tried,

256
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.950
they'd put it on the pilot insurance companies.

257
00:15:29.951 --> 00:15:34.690
So you know what it was Chucky's fought he fuck he wants the wrong kind of shoes

258
00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:39.000
and I was pushing too far.
Right,
right,
right.
They figure out something,

259
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.870
some out of blame it on the pilot,
you know,

260
00:15:40.871 --> 00:15:45.550
so they can kind of keep the lawsuits.
Had a minimum.
I Dunno.
I,

261
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.250
I w I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So whatever,
um,

262
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.530
this guy landed us there safely.
Thank fucking Christ.
And,
uh,

263
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.070
so I've been back here in my hometown for the last,
uh,

264
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.070
since Friday and I've been,
I've been pretty good.
I have not,
uh,

265
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.940
I have not hit one of my old,
uh,

266
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.750
eating haunts cause I put on a little bit of fucking weight there.
I was,

267
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:15.490
I was sitting in the Writers' room writingF is for family or our pitching jokes

268
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.220
as the writers write it.
And um,
you know,

269
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.360
you know the deal.
I get like five,
10 outside the fucking zone and I,

270
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.660
I stand in the mirror and I fat shamed myself.

271
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.690
I give myself a little fucking halftime speech,
you know,

272
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.190
what the fuck was that today?

273
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

274
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.570
<v 1>You know,
and then I get,</v>

275
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.470
I get myself back on the stick.
So,
uh,

276
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.990
I'm telling you all this shit that I say,

277
00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:46.230
despite the fact that I don't know why I didn't know anything about nutrition or

278
00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:48.960
I know very little.
I'm telling you my tricks fucking work.

279
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.110
When you just can't stop yourself and you know you've got,

280
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.680
you want to eat a large pizza and you fucking know it and you know you
shouldn't,

281
00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.750
you're actually stepping outside the craving,
you know,

282
00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:03.150
to be like,
dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

283
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.830
Do not shove that fucking wheel his shit down your throat.

284
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.530
Walk away.
All right,
drop the fork.
The walk away,
right?
You know it,

285
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.180
you know what you supposed to do,
but she can't that,
that craving,
that sugar,

286
00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:20.790
salt,
fucking craving.
It's just having you.

287
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:23.280
It's like you're not even controlling your body.
You walk over there,

288
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.460
that's when you just have to fucking override it with common sense and order a

289
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:30.330
fucking salad.

290
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

291
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.710
<v 1>As quickly as possible,
shoved that down your fucking throat and immediately,</v>

292
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.610
not immediately take about five minutes,
you levels,
whatever that is,

293
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:45.611
that craving levels off cause you full fills you up and then you look at that

294
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:49.790
page and you go,
what the fuck was I thinking?
Why the would I ever do that?

295
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.410
So I did that to myself.
I made a game plan before even left.

296
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.250
Um,
I went to the airport and they had one place you could actually get a salad,

297
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.940
right?
And I fucking shove that down my throat before I got on the plane.

298
00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:06.320
And then I got on the plane and then I was fine and I had a banana for the

299
00:18:06.321 --> 00:18:08.300
flight,
shove that down my throat.

300
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.120
I kept pounding the waters to keep the stomach full.

301
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:16.460
And at one point I had to give it and I bought,
I got a fucking whiskey and uh,

302
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.980
and then that was it.
And I was like,
all right,
did a great fucking job.

303
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:21.890
And then all of a sudden the plane broke and I was like,
Oh fuck,

304
00:18:21.891 --> 00:18:22.940
I should've got the Sunday.

305
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.570
Is it too late to order some phone?
Uh,

306
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
keep the drinks come in their suite at.
Um,

307
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.560
but have we ended up fucking landing safely and a,
I'm back on the stick.

308
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.460
Landed,
banged out my fucking a hundred pushups.
Right.

309
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.140
And the next thing you know,

310
00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:46.480
the next night I'm doing a Gig and before I go on stage,

311
00:18:46.481 --> 00:18:48.970
I'm doing pull ups with Lenny Clarke.
All right?

312
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:51.760
That's the kind of dedication you have.
So all you fucking assholes out there,

313
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:54.700
tell me about your metabolism.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right?

314
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:57.850
You know what you're doing and you know what you need to be doing.
All right?

315
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.520
You Fat.
It's not a fatal disease unless you fucking stay that way.
You know,

316
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.540
I got a buddy of mine,
right?
He's,
he's a tub of Shit,
you know,

317
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.010
and I've given up on them or just given up on him.
Uh,

318
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.010
because he went to the doctor and he goes,
he's just saying like,
dude,

319
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.910
my doctor said,
uh,
genetically,
my fucking heart is unbelievable.

320
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.760
You know?
And it's just like,
all right,
is that all?
He said?
That's all he said.

321
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.770
Oh yeah.
You don't have to worry about it.
You've got a great heart.

322
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.430
[inaudible] Sherry didn't say,
hey,
luckily you have a good heart,

323
00:19:30.431 --> 00:19:35.020
but if you continue to do this,
you could have the heart of a clydesdale.

324
00:19:35.021 --> 00:19:39.130
It doesn't matter.
You're going to take it down.
You know,

325
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.690
Jesus Christ,
people just go around,
walk around.
You've heard this before,

326
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.400
over the age of 60.
Like how many?
Like,

327
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.640
like fat people.
Do you see?

328
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.610
I'm not trying to be a dick to anybody who's overweight.
Okay.

329
00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:58.420
I'm rooting for you.
I'm just giving you some tough love here.
You don't see them.

330
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.320
You don't see a lot of like fat people like a fat 70 year old guy walking

331
00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:05.291
around.

332
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:10.291
Oh that's why all this Santa clauses at the mall or either some young fatty that

333
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:15.850
they put rouge on his cheeks to try and like make them look jolly,
you know,

334
00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:20.770
and then they put some cotton over this fucking eyebrows is a reason why there's

335
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:25.120
not a bunch of fat old Santa Claus because the dead,
right.

336
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.340
That's what I'm here to tell you on this podcast,

337
00:20:27.341 --> 00:20:32.341
Santa Claus died of a major cardiac arrest when he was 58 playing pickup down at

338
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:40.150
the y.
You know,
he thought he'd play center and just post up.

339
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.000
He thought he'd be fine.
He fuck forgot.
He had two.
They were playing full court.

340
00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:46.440
He had to get back on defense and that was it.
What was it?

341
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.720
You fucking collapsed right before we got to the half court line.

342
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.320
And right before he passed out and you heard the whistle blow for the backcourt

343
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.230
violation.
That's a true story.
All right?
And that's why to this day,

344
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.160
you have young,
skinny guys playing our Santa Claus at the mall.
See that?

345
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.650
Then you go,
and I hate to bring that up as we,

346
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.150
we ease in as we begin our initial descent into the holiday fucking season.

347
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.550
Oh Shit.
It's the holiday season.
Dolby,
Dolby doe.

348
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.880
Um,
till he has a deal.
You know,

349
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:19.180
you're gonna eat like an absolute fucking pig on thanksgiving.
You know,

350
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:22.630
you're going to eat like an absolute fucking animals in December.

351
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.550
You know it's coming.

352
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.250
So why don't you get in fucking great shape right before Thanksgiving and just

353
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:30.910
say,
listen,

354
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.410
I'm going to go off the rails on Thanksgiving Friday.

355
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.120
I'm going to get back on it Saturday.

356
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.880
I'll probably have a fucking Turkey sandwich with a little bit of stuffing in

357
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:43.720
there.
And uh,
maybe some spiked eggnog if I can fucking handle it.

358
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.170
And then a whatever,
then you're back on it.
Then Sunday,

359
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:50.260
you have a giant fucking salad.
Okay?
Then you go easy.

360
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.030
You go easy going to fucking you going into December,
right?
Oh,

361
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:57.400
he'd come all the holiday parties,
little wind shear,
right?

362
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.430
You're trying to keep it fucking level.
You know,

363
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.180
you got to go into these parties with the game plan and who's kidding who?

364
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.640
If you eat in the way you're eating and you are a tub of Shit,

365
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.450
you know on some level you don't love yourself.

366
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:20.020
It don't.
All right?
And that's how it manifests itself.
All right?

367
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.790
But the only thing bigger than your own hatred for yourself is probably your

368
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:28.540
disgust for other people.
I'm just using this as a pod.

369
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.130
Possible motivational factors.

370
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:34.900
So why don't you go into that party and look around the party and silently

371
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:38.350
compete with everybody there and as you're watching other people just shoving

372
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:41.770
this shit down your throat,
just know that you're going to win this game.

373
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.540
You're going to win this game tonight,
right?

374
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.030
You're not going to be the one who's going to come out,
right?

375
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.500
With a loss on this one.

376
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.000
I'd be standing there hand and I'll fucking cakes to people shoving drinks down

377
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:58.720
their throat.
Right?
Be that guy to take a couple of parties off.

378
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.960
Just drink waters and just watch what people do and you'll hear people going,

379
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.440
oh my God,
I have to stop.
And then I got,
I have to stop.
They can't fucking stop,

380
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.690
you know the settling with power right into that fucking sugar salt

381
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.900
fucking situation.
Right.
This situation,
um,

382
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.970
that's what you do.
Oh that's another thing too,
when you get to the bar,

383
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:32.971
if you can just order the water first and you drink that,

384
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.480
you know,
then you find,
you find that your brain's like,
oh yeah,

385
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.270
like some more water and then you,

386
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:42.460
you watch your friends start getting bleary eyed and that's actually kind of
fun.

387
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:47.461
You just stand there watching your friends like roofie themselves and you watch

388
00:23:47.611 --> 00:23:51.270
them say dumb shit to each other that they're going to have to apologize for and

389
00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:54.930
you walk out of this squeaky fucking clean.
Right?

390
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.770
You don't want to be fast.
Eddie,
you want to be Minnesota fats,
right?

391
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.700
You have a watch to the hustler.

392
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.860
I mean that when it gets all sloppy drunk and Jackie Gleason,
you know,

393
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.260
takes out the fucking towel.
Freshmans himself up,

394
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:11.600
throws his jacket on and fucking kicks Paul Newman's ass.

395
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.270
That's the guy you want to be walking out of the Christmas party then yet.

396
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:15.380
But you pick one,

397
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.520
you pick one fucking Christmas party where you're going to throw down.

398
00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:21.540
You got to have some sort of fun.

399
00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:24.210
Where are you just going to get absolutely fucking obliterated.
All right.

400
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.230
And that's the one,
your boss isn't there.
You know,

401
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.300
that's Skank you wanna fuck isn't there all the fucking temptations out there?

402
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:38.301
It's just you and the booze staring each other down like one of those fucking

403
00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:40.860
UFC posters,
right?

404
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.820
UFC 2006 the abomination,

405
00:24:44.821 --> 00:24:46.950
whatever the fuck they were out a fucking adjectives for those things.

406
00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:49.230
But I'm still ordering all of them cause I love it.
Right?

407
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.643
<v 0>Okay.</v>

408
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.750
<v 1>Just you and we are your favorite drink.</v>

409
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.420
Some of your friends with the game and a little bullshit Christmas tree,
right?

410
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.650
Whatever.
A couple of prostitutes dressed up like fucking Spanish girls,

411
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.470
which she never really had.
If you really watch those specials,
you know,

412
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.110
but everybody has their own version of you got to respect all religions,

413
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.490
you know,
get yourself a couple of horses running around,
you know,

414
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.830
to give you drinks,
you know,

415
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.090
creating this fucking utopia and uh,

416
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:24.590
that's the one you just get fucking blind drunk and you just celebrate the baby

417
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:27.770
Jesus the way it was meant to be.
That's how you do it.

418
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.610
Then the next day you're right fucking back on it.
You're right back on it.

419
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.760
And then you join me at the fucking Rose Bowl and watch me get blind drunk and

420
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:36.680
then that's it.
This you'd give you,
pick your spots,

421
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.490
pick your spots and you give it a little face wash and then you'd be fine.

422
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.440
You know,
is it me or do I sound more out of my mind this week then?

423
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.460
Then most weeks,
I'm not sure.
You know what it is right now it's football Sunday.

424
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.730
It's the middle of the afternoon.
Uh,

425
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.760
the first game of the week is on the one o'clock games basically back here.

426
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:02.420
East Coast.
And why aren't I watching?
Why could I give a fuck?

427
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.250
Because the Patriots are playing today.
I hate the fucking bi-week.

428
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.800
I hate it.
It's like all,

429
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:12.620
it's like that feeling when your team gets knocked out of the playoffs and all

430
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:15.350
those things.
It's like,
fuck,
now what do I got to do?

431
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.630
All of a sudden it's just like,
yeah,
yeah,

432
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:21.320
we're just going to give you an experience of the off season during the season.

433
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:23.770
Just give you that little flip,
make your heart skip a Goddamn beat.

434
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.870
So I don't know what to do with myself.
I want to watch that four o'clock game.

435
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.230
Um,
Seahawks versus the giants.
I always lie,
you know,
I liked the,

436
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.760
I liked the defensive teams.
Um,

437
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.530
and I'm also interested to see,
I want to see Eli.
Even all,
you know,

438
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.980
Seahawks haven't been as good as they were last year.
As always happens.

439
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.350
Know you went deep into the playoffs.
We won the fucking super bowl.
Uh,
you know,

440
00:26:47.351 --> 00:26:51.850
Pat Riley,
the disease of more that I learned through the Bill Simmons Book.
Um,

441
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.820
people leave,
try to get more money.

442
00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:57.760
Every coach thinks they're a fucking head coach.
All that bullshit happens,

443
00:26:57.761 --> 00:27:01.240
but still the core of the team is there.
And,
um,

444
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.400
I love watching Eli play against great teams because he always has big games.
So,

445
00:27:06.401 --> 00:27:09.460
um,
but it is a regular season,
so who knows how he'll perform,

446
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:12.070
but I'm looking forward to that one.
So that's the game I'm going to watch.

447
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.110
If you give a fuck.
Um,
at which point I had already happened.
Right.

448
00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.580
So why am I talking about it?
But because I've got to fill up an hour basically.

449
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.420
Oh my apologies.
Last week I guess the,
uh,
judging from the 2000 emails,

450
00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:30.130
I got an tweets,
the volume was a little low last week.
I apologize.

451
00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:33.480
We're still working out the niches on the,
um,

452
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.990
or the glitches I should say on the new,
uh,

453
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.890
the new all things comedy,
um,
podcast studio,

454
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.760
which um,
we hope to be,
have fully functional soon a,

455
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:49.060
obviously this week I'm back in Boston,
so I won't be using it,

456
00:27:49.061 --> 00:27:53.830
but next week I'll be right back in there.
Um,
so anyways,

457
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.460
what went on this week in the wild?
What went on in the world?
Tell,

458
00:27:57.461 --> 00:27:58.241
went on in the world.

459
00:27:58.241 --> 00:28:03.241
Fucking Phil Rudd Drummer of ACDC gets arrested for allegedly trying to hire a

460
00:28:04.061 --> 00:28:06.940
guy to murder two people and they found meth in his house.

461
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.533
<v 0>Okay.</v>

462
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.393
<v 1>You know,</v>

463
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.600
Phil Rudd is one of my favorite drummers of all time in my favorite band of all

464
00:28:14.601 --> 00:28:15.434
time.

465
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

466
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.590
<v 1>And I gotta tell Ya for the fucking life of me.</v>

467
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

468
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.180
<v 1>All right.
Who the fuck starts doing meth?</v>

469
00:28:25.181 --> 00:28:29.560
It's 60 years of age.
All right.
I hate to criticize the guy.
I love the guy.

470
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.950
Love the guy to death,
but what the fuck?
Meth.

471
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

472
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.660
<v 1>I mean still doing blow.
It's 60.
What the fuck that does do your heart,
man,</v>

473
00:28:40.661 --> 00:28:42.490
it's unreal.
If you saw his pictures,

474
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.370
he didn't even look like himself and he actually looked like he was missing some

475
00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:49.240
teeth.
Like this fucking guy was doing meth.
At least he looked like,

476
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:52.030
and he looked like those billboards you see when you drive through the Midwest,

477
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.990
not like Chicago,
not Ohio.
You get into the mid west,

478
00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:01.390
that slipknot country,
right.
That uh,
you know,

479
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.100
uh,
different factions of the Klan marching down the street.
Part,

480
00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:10.430
part of the fucking near the,
the Opera Pacific northwest,
right.

481
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.180
Montana,
Idaho,
Wyoming,

482
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.730
the badlands of the Dakotas.
Great.
That fucking level of meth.
Um,

483
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.010
but the charges have been dropped.
He still being charged with meth and uh,

484
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.550
but at least they dropped the,
um,
the other bullshit.

485
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.080
So as far as I can tell,

486
00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:35.040
I think they're still going to tour on this album with them.
Um,

487
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.960
but if they don't,
what do you think they would do?

488
00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

489
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.020
<v 1>Do you think they go back to Simon writer Chris Slade?</v>

490
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.080
I know Chris Slade openly as discussed.

491
00:29:45.081 --> 00:29:50.000
He did not like how he exited the band.
I don't know that they,

492
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.680
according to him,
I don't think they called them.

493
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.680
They basically had Phil run the band.
They had a dust up.
Phil run and Malcolm,

494
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.650
so much I know about this fucking band.
I actually know the true story,

495
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.730
but I'm not going to say it.
Why not build?
Because I'm not a dick.
Well,

496
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.240
I am a Dick because I brought it up.
I talked to a drummer,
another band,

497
00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:10.550
and he actually talked to Phil.
Rodney told the fucking story,

498
00:30:10.551 --> 00:30:13.760
why the fuck he got kicked out?
And uh,
you know,

499
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.550
it's one of those old reviews stories.

500
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.910
That's whenever he gets kicked out,
they get this Guy Simon,
right?
20 years old,

501
00:30:22.911 --> 00:30:25.550
Nixon,
you know,
he goes from fucking playing local bands and next thing you know,

502
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:30.050
he's in Simon Wright quits ac DC to join deal,

503
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.050
right?
I guess he was sick of playing the four for shit.

504
00:30:33.051 --> 00:30:34.400
He wanted to do something else.
So he leaves,

505
00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:38.870
then they get Chris Slade and after nine fucking years they decide they want to

506
00:30:38.871 --> 00:30:41.210
go back to Phil Rudd.
According to Chris Slade,

507
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.820
without him knowing he was out of the,

508
00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:48.200
he found out he was out of the band when the band sent out a press release that

509
00:30:48.201 --> 00:30:51.150
he was no longer in the band and that they had gotten back together with the

510
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.880
Phil Rudd,
um,
with,
you know,
if it went down like that.

511
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.990
And uh,
you know,
I'm sure when Chris Slade,

512
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.010
here's dirty deeds,

513
00:31:01.011 --> 00:31:04.850
he probably has a different fucking view of it now than other people.

514
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.060
Oh Jesus built,
did you really have to do that fucking old joke?
Well,
you know,

515
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.840
it's a long podcast.
What do you want from me?
So anyways,
nice to hear that.

516
00:31:11.841 --> 00:31:16.550
Phil Rudd is no longer being charged with,
uh,
hiring,

517
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.210
trying to hire a fucking Travolta and Sim,
uh,

518
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.360
Jackson's fucking characters in pulp fiction.
He's clear to that now.

519
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:28.250
Now it's just meth.
Now he's just another fucking guy on meth.
60 years of age.

520
00:31:28.251 --> 00:31:31.250
Come on Phil.
He was funny when I first read it,

521
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.870
somebody sent me a text that Phil Rudd and I,
I immediately thought,

522
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.943
<v 0>uh,</v>

523
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.100
<v 1>I immediately thought Paul Rudd and I was going like,
how the fuck?</v>

524
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.980
Who the fuck would that guy want to have killed?
He's a nice guy.

525
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:49.560
He's a family man.
What the fuck?
Like that one really blew my mind.

526
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:53.010
Then it was Phil Rudd and still kind of blew my mind,

527
00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:56.880
but it's still kind of understood it.
You know those rock stars,
right?

528
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.790
You get a couple of hit albums under your belt.

529
00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:02.400
Next scene know you got a pistol and a big bag of coke,
you know,
you know,

530
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.610
you don't know what you're saying anymore,
right?

531
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.970
You're pouring vodka in your mouth in a swimming pool while they film it.
Um,

532
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.940
anyways.
Oh good news.

533
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.710
I have teased the people down under Australia,

534
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.920
New Zealand and I have fucking threatened that I was going to be doing a tour

535
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:23.310
down there.
It is coming together,
the data together.

536
00:32:23.311 --> 00:32:25.680
It's going to be the end of January,
beginning of February.

537
00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:29.040
Right now it is a 10 day tour.
That's gonna win clue.

538
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.430
Uh,
two cities in New Zealand.

539
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

540
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.450
<v 1>All those fuckers,
uh,
Australian one,
Perth,</v>

541
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.970
Brisbane or wherever.
Fuck you said Melbourne,
Sydney.

542
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.330
Uh,
I don't know what else I got in there.

543
00:32:45.331 --> 00:32:50.331
And then we're also trying to possibly tie in Asian run in there where I might

544
00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:53.010
believe in a not do India.

545
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.680
We just have to see if there's any sort of interest there.
I mean,

546
00:32:55.681 --> 00:33:00.060
I know I won't make any fucking money,
but why when you go to India,
you know,

547
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.300
Christ,
I'm talking to those people every day on the fucking phone.
Anyways,

548
00:33:03.301 --> 00:33:07.980
anytime I get into some automated thing.
Right.
Be Nice to talk to.

549
00:33:07.981 --> 00:33:12.030
Some of the people are on the other end of that phone.
Um,

550
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.300
I know this woman that books Singapore,

551
00:33:15.301 --> 00:33:20.301
but I'm afraid to go there after that caning video and considering spitting gum

552
00:33:20.551 --> 00:33:24.700
out on the sidewalk is illegal.
Um,
I,

553
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.640
I don't know how they would react to my act,

554
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.380
like how many fucking lashings that would be,
but I'm not going to be,

555
00:33:29.381 --> 00:33:31.230
and you know,
having my butt cheeks,

556
00:33:31.231 --> 00:33:34.940
having muscle spasms as I'm waiting for the next hi.

557
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.153
<v 2>Okay.</v>

558
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.590
<v 1>Oh my God.
How bruised up what I be is fucking German,</v>

559
00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:49.020
Irish and pasty as I am.
Oh my God.

560
00:33:49.021 --> 00:33:52.770
After that first lash and it would look like a fucking faces at death video.

561
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.860
Holy Shit.
So anyways,
I'm really,

562
00:33:55.861 --> 00:34:00.600
really looking forward to going over there.
Speaking of ACDC,

563
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.290
uh,
bond,
Scott rest his soul,
his final resting place is in Perth,

564
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.470
so I'll definitely have to make a trip to that.
Um,

565
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.800
and then other than that,
you know,
I just,
I'm excited to go,
uh,
over there and,

566
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.300
uh,
you know,
watch my step.

567
00:34:15.301 --> 00:34:18.690
Don't step on any of those fucking brutally poisonous snakes they have.

568
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.010
We're actually trying to figure out how to do the tour right now because from La

569
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.860
to Sydney is a 14 hour flight and if you have a do it,

570
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.080
what you want to do is don't you see is tech the 4:00 PM flight.

571
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.750
All right?
You get on the plane,
you have a fucking meal.
Now you watch a movie,

572
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:40.650
then they bring you a meal,
then you watch another movie just killed four hours.

573
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.060
Then you go to sleep eight hours later,
there's your 14 fucking as 12 hours,

574
00:34:45.061 --> 00:34:48.060
right?
Whatever,
give or take.
Basically you wake up,

575
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.050
you're almost on final approach.
It's,
it's the best flying back sucks.

576
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.860
I don't know what to do.

577
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.980
I don't know what to tell you other than they get blind fucking drunk and take a

578
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:57.150
fucking horse tranquilizer.

579
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.110
You just going to have to kind of sit there and take it and keep looking at your

580
00:35:01.111 --> 00:35:02.640
window hour after hour,

581
00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:06.990
realizing you're over a place where there's nowhere to land.
Um,

582
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:09.241
so anyways,

583
00:35:09.241 --> 00:35:14.241
but so you fly 14 fucking hours from La to get to Sydney and then Sydney to

584
00:35:15.121 --> 00:35:18.930
Perth is basically like flying across the continental United States.

585
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.590
I want to say it might be a little bit shorter,

586
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.380
but who the fuck wants to do that?
But

587
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.500
<v 2>yeah,</v>

588
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.530
<v 1>my guy saying,
well,
what if you flew to Melbourne,
stayed there for a day,</v>

589
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.130
got a good night's sleep,
and then got up the next fucking day and then fly.

590
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.160
I'm thinking,
just get it over with.
Just fucking get it over with.

591
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:40.380
I don't know how we're going to do it,
but uh,

592
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.470
the good thing is once you're there,
you're there and,
um,

593
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.150
I don't fight jetlag initially.
You know,

594
00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:50.880
you gotta stay up.
You got to stay up.
Fuck that.
No,
you don't go to sleep,

595
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.330
go to sleep.
You wake up and fucking 11 o'clock at night,

596
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:57.960
like at seven in the morning and you just go on youtube and you watch old

597
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:02.760
Superbowls and,
uh,
you'll find a casino.
There'll be something to do.
Right.

598
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.540
Um,
but anyways,
I'm really looking forward to doing that.

599
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.360
And then also later on in 2015,

600
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.660
I'm going to be doing an eastern European tour,
possibly,

601
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:15.200
maybe torn in all of Europe.
And,
um,

602
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.280
so the way I'm going to try to do it is I'm breaking up my tours over a two year

603
00:36:20.281 --> 00:36:25.230
period.
I'm figuring out this strategy,
uh,
and the tours are eastern Europe,

604
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.970
western Europe,
Australia,
Asia,

605
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.400
and then Canada.
And then I always have,
uh,

606
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.410
the United States is an ongoing thing.
So I just sort of,

607
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:41.670
when I'm not touring the states,

608
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.780
I'll just break off and do like a 10 day tour of one of those.
Um,

609
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.650
and I've always been putting out my special on Netflix and has Netflix has grown

610
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:50.790
and they've gone worldwide.

611
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.960
I keep getting more people that know who the fuck I am and I keep expanding it.

612
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.340
And the great thing about that is as I,
you know,

613
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.990
as the dollar collapses,

614
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.020
I have all these different other fucking places where I can maybe earn money in

615
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:10.560
their currency and I can come back here and buy a pelt to put over my junk.

616
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.630
You know,
cause there's no ad ever leave this country.
You know,
uh,

617
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.990
just fucking would survive it.
Um,
so anyways,

618
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.930
and plus as I increased,
you know,
people like,
and what the fuck I do,

619
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:28.830
I got this cartoon coming out.
I know I'm hyping it 13 months early.

620
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.720
F is for family.
Uh,
we wrote another cow,
killer fucking episode.

621
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.240
I cannot wait for this thing.
I cannot fucking like no thing I've ever done.

622
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.270
I cannot wait for you guys to fucking see this thing.

623
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:46.470
And I know I'm an asshole for bringing it up this early,
but,
uh,

624
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.670
it is the most fucking fun I've ever had doing.
Netflix has been unbelievable.

625
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.480
Uh,
they're actually saying push it further,
push it further,
push it further.

626
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:57.660
They'd been ridiculous.
Um,

627
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.300
they've been unbelievable to work with and uh,
you know,

628
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:06.740
and just the people that I'm,
I'm writing the thing with and everything is,
is,
uh,

629
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.710
as I say,
they're writing it.

630
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:11.160
I just sit in the writer's room and I pitched my jokes,
but um,

631
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.180
I can't,
I can't fucking wait for this thing to come out,
you know?

632
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.770
And even if we only get to do six a,
I swear to God when I'm 80,

633
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:22.380
I'll be talking about how much fucking fun I had doing it and that's,

634
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.030
that is no joke.
Um,
so anyways,
what do we got here?

635
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:30.120
Let me see if he sent me the fucking advertisement.
You me killing time here.

636
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.600
Oh,
I've got to love the Bruins APP right here.
Up
to the minute.

637
00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:38.640
Fucking do you guys have,
do you guys have like the,
uh,

638
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.950
the apps are your favorite teams?
I love when they do that.

639
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.860
I have this one in the Nhl one tells me about all the trades,

640
00:38:43.861 --> 00:38:46.980
everything that's going on.
This is not a commercial,
by the way,

641
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:52.260
defenseman David were sofsky sustained a groin injury and will be out two to

642
00:38:52.261 --> 00:38:53.094
four weeks.

643
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

644
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.520
<v 1>You see that now I can get on with my fucking life.</v>

645
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.031
Oh,
you know,

646
00:39:00.031 --> 00:39:04.020
it was one of the coolest things I've got to do last night and I'm going to have

647
00:39:04.021 --> 00:39:07.500
a youtube link to this.
I got to talk to Adam McQuaid.

648
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.210
And I remember one of my favorite things,

649
00:39:09.211 --> 00:39:11.460
moments of the Bruins over the last few years,

650
00:39:11.461 --> 00:39:15.270
other than them winning the Stanley Cup and,
um,

651
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.450
and always Bruins Canadians Games,
they're always fucking great,
win or lose.

652
00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:22.560
They're always fucking awesome to watch.
Um,
was,
I remember we played the,
uh,

653
00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:26.520
the Phoenix coyotes and a Raffi Torres,
uh,

654
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.760
you know,
dirty play fucking as the elbow or shoulder and uh,

655
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.920
ferrets,
right in his jaw and

656
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:40.480
McQuade immediately as the dude was throwing the elbow or,

657
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.710
or the fucking shoulder,

658
00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:46.490
his gloves were already on the ice and he beat the fuck out of the guy.

659
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.500
It was just textbook how to stick up for your teammate and hockey.
And,
um,

660
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.070
once again,
you know,
I was,
well,
I'll have a link to that fight if I can find it.

661
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:59.120
Um,
and once again,
I was,
I was talking to a,

662
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.730
we were talking about hockey on the way over to the garden.
The,
uh,

663
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.840
the other night,
he still can't fucking believe I got to perform there.
And um,

664
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.220
you know,
we were talking about,
I was saying how,
you know,

665
00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:13.190
that was at bench clearing brawl that I've told you guys about a long time ago.

666
00:40:13.191 --> 00:40:18.170
I went to the game,
um,
I'll put that link up to,
I was at the old Boston Garden.

667
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.550
It was the Chris Nyland game when he took the button out of his stick and knock

668
00:40:22.551 --> 00:40:26.330
Middlebury's teeth out and then he got kicked out and when he walked by the

669
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.290
Bruins Bench,
Ken Lynn's been pushed him.
He pushed Ken's limits.
Blends man.

670
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.740
That's right.
Because Lynn's been,
you know,

671
00:40:30.741 --> 00:40:33.020
said something and then Lynn's been chased him down the hall like he was

672
00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:35.000
actually going to fight him and then,

673
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:37.160
cause he knew all the Bruins are going to follow next.
You know,

674
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.570
Canadians bench empties.

675
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:42.590
There's a fight on the isis fighting off the isis cops involved in all this
shit.

676
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.090
And someone was going like,

677
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.350
I love how like these are the great moments in hockey,
right?
And it's like,
ah,

678
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.410
Jesus Christ,
you fucking non watching hockey cunts,

679
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.100
these all the goals and all that shit.
You know,

680
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.190
those are all so great,
but the fighting is all,

681
00:40:58.191 --> 00:41:01.760
I don't understand why people have such a fucking issue with fighting and
hockey.

682
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.710
We've got to get the fighting out of hockey.

683
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.730
Do we have to get the fighting out of boxing lift to get the fighting out of the

684
00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:10.940
UFC?
If fighting is so fucking bad,

685
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:16.070
how can you have a fucking sport that that's what the sport is.
Oh,
it's barbaric.

686
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.420
Okay.
But if that's what you're trained to do,
then it's the sweet science.

687
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.010
You're a mixed martial artist.
But if you do it on hockey skates,

688
00:41:25.011 --> 00:41:28.340
you're a fucking animal.
I don't understand it.

689
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.080
I don't,
it's a part of the fucking game.

690
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.660
Oh Jesus Christ is with the phone.

691
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.540
But my parents house,
let's see how long those Gov's.
It's toe.

692
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

693
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.130
<v 1>Somebody downstairs.
Right?
Come on.
Somebody pick it up.</v>

694
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.490
Fuck six for me.
For the podcast.
For my own sanity.

695
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.990
There you go.
Somebody got it.
All right.
So,
um,

696
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.160
anyway,
I just don't understand what the fucking problem is.

697
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.760
I don't get how people,
we got to get the fighting out of it.

698
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.040
We got to get it out.
It's like,
dude,
you don't watch hockey.

699
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.970
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't watch it.

700
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.400
You know what I mean?
Do I sit there going,

701
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:18.080
we got to get the lay ups out of the WWE NBA.
There needs to be more dunking.

702
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.290
Give a fuck.
Play the game where you play it.
I sold,
I did just feel fuck.
I,

703
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:26.060
it drives me nuts.
Fucking drives me nuts,
whatever.
So I'll have,

704
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:29.960
I'll post that bench clearing brawl.
I'll also post,
um,

705
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.100
the,
uh,
Adam McQuade fight.

706
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.430
And then for all you fucking hockey purists that don't,

707
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:40.250
that just want to see goal scoring and all that fucking shit.
You know,

708
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:44.330
I like Olympic hockey.
Yeah.
I like curling toe.
Um,

709
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.230
I'll,
I'll post the,
uh,
whatever the,
whatever the fuck they get.

710
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:52.670
New Kid's name is there on Saint Louis.
Vladimir,

711
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:57.440
a fucking terantin off.
Whatever the fuck his name is.

712
00:42:57.441 --> 00:43:01.310
Let me see,
where the hell is it?
I fucking tweeted about them.

713
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

714
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.510
<v 1>I said the moves he was making me was,</v>

715
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.990
we're making reminded me of some of the moves I used to do in the late nineties

716
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:10.400
during my roller blading days.

717
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.480
And then of course I get a bunch of shit for rollerblading,
you know,

718
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.880
last I remember it.
Rollerblading.

719
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:21.800
That was a phenomenon that swept the nation.
You know,

720
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.870
am I wrong?
Am I wrong?
Thinking that,
uh,
Taryn,
Taryn,

721
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:30.270
Sanko flat American terrorists.
Sanko all right.

722
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.480
For all you people out there want to get the fighting on,

723
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:35.920
I'll just know that this is also still happening.
And that,
uh,

724
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.470
goaltending in the league is a post.
Patrick,

725
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:43.010
why is becoming an entirely different art in itself?

726
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:46.310
If you watch old hockey,
uh,

727
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:51.410
highlights and you watch those old standup fucking goalies,

728
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.190
you understand why fucking actually you,

729
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.650
I still can't believe it was so difficult to score 50 goals,

730
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:01.460
watching standup goalies.
They'd fucking just,
you'd come in and skate,

731
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:05.480
you'd shoot the puck and they'd either kick out their right leg or that left leg

732
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:10.040
pretty much straight out,
um,
the standup goalies.

733
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:12.770
And then once Patrick Walk came in and the butterfly that way,

734
00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:16.930
resolver like a Jimmy Hendrix moment,
like guitar was never the same.

735
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:21.410
Goal tending was never the fucking same after that guy.
And um,

736
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.320
I dunno,
whatever.
I'm probably talking too much fucking hockey.

737
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.350
There's like eight listener's going no,

738
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:29.570
if you want to hear it more hockey talk you,

739
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.160
what you want to do is go listen to Barton x puck off.

740
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.010
Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barton.

741
00:44:36.011 --> 00:44:39.210
Nick all right.
Sponsored by Crown Royal.

742
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.930
I don't even know if it is,
uh,
the puck off podcast.

743
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.960
You might want to check that out.
So,
um,

744
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.750
I think at this point I've talked myself out.
I'm going to wait for the,
uh,

745
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.770
wasn't I supposed to look for that?
I keep pushing the wrong guy.
Damn buttons.

746
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.090
You know,
I got one of these little fucking iPads with the keyboard,
you know,

747
00:44:57.091 --> 00:45:00.140
and I thought I was really smart and I,
and you know,
I hooked the fucking,

748
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.850
I sinked up the,
the,
the keyboard with the IPAD.

749
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.200
I didn't know he had to charge the fucking iPad.
The keyboard too,
right.
You know,

750
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:10.290
it fucking kills me.
That the one that fucking charges the fucking Ipod,

751
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.510
the iPad itself,
you need a different plug for the fucking keyboard.
These

752
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.960
fucking Steve Job cons.

753
00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:23.180
It's like how much fucking money do you nerds need to fucking make?
I don't know.

754
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.710

That was an easy week.
Everybody.

798
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.380
Only two reads.
I think I've insulted all my other,
uh,

799
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.690
advertisers,
you know,
they're not always so keen with some of my reads over here.

800
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:26.530
So,
you know,
what can I do?
What can I do?
What am I looking for?

801
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:30.170
I'm trying to figure out how far into this podcast I am.
48 minutes,
Jesus Christ.

802
00:48:30.171 --> 00:48:32.260
And I already,
you know,
last week when I was stretching for time,

803
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.870
I was so out of sorts being in that studio,
I forgot to actually,
uh,

804
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.620
I forgot to read the damn questions from last week.
So anyways,
let's see here.

805
00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:45.520
Here we go.
Here we go.
Um,
oh,
by the way,
my Yoko Ono,
Chuck Berry,

806
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.170
Berry video broke 100 million views.
Um,

807
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.141
let's see here.
And,

808
00:48:52.141 --> 00:48:56.680
and people have been sending me the following Yoko covering Katy Perry's

809
00:48:56.681 --> 00:49:01.630
firework.
Um,
and I don't want to trash Yoko.
I actually think our band is good.

810
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.810
I just fucking,
I more,
when I was doing that,
I really,

811
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:08.440
I was really insulting John Lennon,
you know,

812
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.340
one of the great musicians of all time.
So what the fuck am I to do that?

813
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.190
You know?
What are you going to do?
Just fucking annoys me.

814
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:17.770
Just seeing some guy just afraid.
I mean,

815
00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:21.820
do you like seeing you like seen a woman being just dominated by some guy and

816
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:24.580
she's too afraid to open a fucking mouth?
It's horrific to see.

817
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.670
It works both ways.
You know what it is.

818
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:30.820
You just wished that the fucking two psychos would get together,

819
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:33.880
but it doesn't work that way.
You know what I mean?
Too.

820
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:37.330
Selfish con can never be together because it's selfish.
Cons.

821
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.410
What they have to do is they go out and they find big hearted,

822
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:45.610
forgiving people that look the other way.
When you grab a microphone and go

823
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.040
in the middle of a fucking song,
it's not even an exaggeration.

824
00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:54.040
That's actually almost a dead on impression effects.

825
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.560
Darrell Hammond would probably be like,
wow,
bill,
that was really good.

826
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.340
Did you listen to audio of Yoko Ono as you drove around in your car?

827
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:01.780
And I'd be like,
no,
Daryl,
you know what?

828
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:05.280
I just naturally had that one you liked that you liked.

829
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:08.410
When I invent compliments from legendary comedians.
Um,
all right,

830
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:11.530
last alimony payment dance guy.
Bill,

831
00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:14.980
a million people have probably already sent you this or maybe you saw it

832
00:50:14.981 --> 00:50:16.900
yourself on Barstool.
Yeah,
I watched it.

833
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.040
I'm always on Barstool a Boston barstool by the way,
I'm always on that thing.

834
00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:25.300
They always have great videos.
Um,
you know,
some of some of the,
the,

835
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:28.150
the fucking people on there,
they're,
there's so Boston sports,

836
00:50:28.151 --> 00:50:30.730
you know what I mean?
That it gets it,
you know,

837
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.240
I'm one of those guys that if we have a piece of shit on our fucking team and

838
00:50:34.241 --> 00:50:37.090
you say he's a piece of shit,
I'm not going to defend them.
You know what I mean?

839
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.390
Which then gives me license to trash.
You're a piece of shit and then you say,

840
00:50:40.391 --> 00:50:42.250
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know what?
You know what?
You're right.

841
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.060
We got a piece of shit in our team too,
and then we get to drink together.

842
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.570
There's no fights.
There's no lawsuits.
Sottsass no broken teeth.
It's,

843
00:50:49.571 --> 00:50:50.171
it's wonderful.

844
00:50:50.171 --> 00:50:53.140
It's one of the great things about being an old guy is you see the middle
ground.

845
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.160
But I haven't said that.
I still love my boss and teams and uh,
I,

846
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.500
I love that site.
I love that site so many ways.
I mean,
uh,

847
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.620
the video is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

848
00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:06.880
It's Thursday morning at my shitty office job when I swear my feet started

849
00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:11.170
bouncing under my desk and pure joy for this man.
Uh,
I love you and love Nia.

850
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:13.720
Go Fuck Yourself.
Yeah,
it's a great video.
We'll post it.
This guy,

851
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:20.190
this guy is making his final alimony payment and he says how much it is.

852
00:51:21.851 --> 00:51:24.310
It's something like just under 10 grand.

853
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:28.960
This guy's been given some woman almost every fucking month.

854
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:32.230
Now granted,
this guy might've fucked up his own marriage.

855
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.850
He might've fucked around on our or whatever,

856
00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:38.851
but just Jesus Christ to have to give another human being 10 grand a month for

857
00:51:41.081 --> 00:51:45.160
fucking years.
And you did not maim them.

858
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:51.270
You didn't cause them an inability to go out and get a fucking job and earn a

859
00:51:51.281 --> 00:51:56.260
living is just,
it's fucking criminal.
And this isn't child support people.

860
00:51:56.261 --> 00:52:01.060
This is alimony.
You're giving somebody 10 grand a fucking,

861
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.530
it's just unbelievable.

862
00:52:02.531 --> 00:52:07.531
So this guy is making his last payment and he's doing this fucking dance.

863
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:14.920
It's one of the happiest guys I've ever seen in my fucking life.

864
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.230
It's fucking hilarious.
And um,

865
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:24.090
I do have hope that in the future when this latest push by women is over,

866
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.340
you know,
it's kind of like a game between the two of us,
right?
So right now it's,

867
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.480
it's hardcore women.

868
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.710
Everything bad that ever fucking happen between men and women.

869
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.390
It's going one way right now.
It's just guys need to grow up,
right?

870
00:52:40.391 --> 00:52:44.650
We got to stop talking to him on the street,
you know,
no more.

871
00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:49.510
She was asking for it.
Uh,
what else?
What else are they telling us?

872
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.320
Um,
you know,
we've got to listen more.
We need to cook more.

873
00:52:53.321 --> 00:52:56.410
We need to do a lot of their fucking jobs around the house that they don't want

874
00:52:56.411 --> 00:53:00.970
to fucking do because they have a job now,
you know,
it's like,
well,

875
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:04.080
so do I.
So I got to do the job and all the housework.

876
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:06.610
Is that what fucking saying?
No,
I'll pitch it now.
You won't,

877
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.770
you'll start to do it and then you'll come home.

878
00:53:08.771 --> 00:53:11.010
You say you're tired and then you bought him lip starts quivering,

879
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.400
then I feel like a bully and next thing you know I'm wearing a fucking Brent.
Um,

880
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.360
but I think eventually,
um,

881
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.580
unless my conspiracy theory is true.

882
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:23.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

883
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.590
<v 1>Uh,
my conspiracy theory is basically this,</v>

884
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.900
well,
let's finish the first thing.

885
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.901
Eventually at some point there's going to be a pushback by men about these

886
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:41.460
divorce settlements to try to get them a little more,

887
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:47.130
not as fucking crazy.
Okay.
Um,

888
00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.890
because I mean I just,

889
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.120
I don't think just the amount of fucking money and that she's used to a certain

890
00:53:55.121 --> 00:53:58.750
lifestyle.
I mean,
whoever came up with that was a fucking genius.

891
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:02.510
I mean how they got the,
I'm amu so certain lifestyle.
Yeah.

892
00:54:02.511 --> 00:54:05.660
The lifestyle you have when you were together,
this relationship failed.

893
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:11.660
All right.
So yeah,
you don't have that lifestyle anymore.

894
00:54:11.661 --> 00:54:15.270
And neither does he.
Why does one person or,

895
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.980
or whoever's making more money to be fair to women in this stuff?

896
00:54:18.981 --> 00:54:23.060
Because I know who the fuck would cause me has always bringing up the women who

897
00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:24.530
are getting fucked in this thing.
Cause you know me,

898
00:54:24.531 --> 00:54:27.500
I'm so fucking one side and it ignorant.
Um,

899
00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.220
<v 0>okay,</v>

900
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.000
<v 1>who got fucked over?
I,
I can't remember who it was she saying Halle Berry,</v>

901
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.321
one of those people,

902
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:37.020
it just has like some ridiculous payment they had that they had,
once again,

903
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:39.480
they just,
they were in the state of California,

904
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.490
they will make it way more fucking money.

905
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:45.090
And now the person that they used to be with gets to act like,
you know,

906
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.030
they,
you know,
I dunno what they have fucking crippled.

907
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.160
They can't go out and get a fucking job to these people.

908
00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:55.310
Do you realize that this people paralyzed from the fucking neck down who have

909
00:54:55.311 --> 00:54:59.000
written fucking scripts for movies that got made?
You know what I mean?

910
00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.090
You sit in there with all your fucking faculties and you want 10 grand a month.

911
00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:07.070
He was lazy sack of Shit is fucking unbelievable.
Unfuck of,
Oh man.

912
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.610
You know what?
There's a,
there's a,
there's an article.
Do I have it?
You know,

913
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:12.230
I'm going to get up.
I gotta get,
I gotta get this thing right now.

914
00:55:12.231 --> 00:55:13.064
Hang on a second.

915
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.713
It's a

916
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.650
Maxim magazine,
which,
who's kidding,

917
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:33.440
who Maxim magazine is basically a jerk off magazine for somebody either who's

918
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.180
still living at home with their parents and doesn't want to get caught looking

919
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:40.440
at porn or they plan on running for political office and that they know there's

920
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:41.670
no way to get it trace back.

921
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.660
This is probably actually the purest pornography that you could actually look
at.

922
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.070
Ah,
being an asshole.
It's not that bad,

923
00:55:50.071 --> 00:55:51.960
but it's one of those things where Maxim magazine,

924
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:54.870
a lot of times there's articles in there that I want to read about,

925
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.620
but the woman on the cover,
it always makes me feel like a piece of shit.

926
00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:03.360
Buying it like,
oh,
look at her,
you know.
Um,

927
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:06.900
but this one actually on the cover,
it said a hot wheels,

928
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:09.060
of course it said and say hot wheels.
It's got some,
you know,

929
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.070
gorgeous fucking woman with the fucking tanned up titties hanging out and it's

930
00:56:14.071 --> 00:56:16.650
2014 fastest muscle cars,

931
00:56:16.651 --> 00:56:20.640
sexiest supercars in the ultimate Jaguar.
Right?
So I'm like,
all right,

932
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:23.370
I'm getting on a plane.
I love fucking cars.
I want to read about shit.

933
00:56:23.371 --> 00:56:27.660
I'm a car guy.
I got a Prius.
Right.
Fucking Catholic guilt.

934
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:32.000
Go fucking buy yourself something.
You're freckled count.
Um,

935
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.130
so whatever.
So they got the usual layout here,
right?

936
00:56:35.131 --> 00:56:37.500
And they got this beautiful fucking car.
This is how old I am.

937
00:56:37.501 --> 00:56:42.450
So they had this fucking 20 something model laying on her back on the fucking

938
00:56:42.451 --> 00:56:44.080
hood and I'm actually annoyed by,

939
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.590
or like would you get off the fucking car so I could say it.

940
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:51.360
How fucking old am I at this point?
I got it when you fuck,

941
00:56:51.361 --> 00:56:53.910
that's the position you'd be and if I was banging you,

942
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.680
you're not going to fuck me.
Get out of the way of the car.
Um,

943
00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.290
but there were actually just doing the background on the,
on the model.

944
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.101
So they actually died.

945
00:57:02.101 --> 00:57:05.070
I didn't understand the layout of the magazine and you know,
she is gorgeous.

946
00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:10.020
She deserves to be laying on that car.
Um,
but I imagine,
well,
you know,

947
00:57:10.021 --> 00:57:12.370
a lot of women would be offended by it because you know what,

948
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:13.204
what does it really,

949
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.470
what they're really say it in this magazine is you get this car,

950
00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:18.480
you get this woman,
you know,

951
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.590
none of these photos does in any way,
shape or form.

952
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.730
Does it show that this woman could possibly own this car despite the fact that

953
00:57:26.731 --> 00:57:30.060
she's a model and a major magazine,
you know,
she has a nice car,

954
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.890
but the way they photograph her is this is the position I had the lay and just

955
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:36.990
to get a fucking ride in this God damn thing.

956
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.080
Although one of the photos she d she is carrying a helmet,

957
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:44.670
but that's probably just for safety.
Um,
anyways,

958
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.340
so I'm reading through all this shit and I come to this,

959
00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.710
this article and it's um,

960
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.490
you know me totally misjudging this magazine when I'm looking at it like,
uh,

961
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:59.250
like I live in fucking Utah.
What the fuck is it?
God dammit.
Bill,

962
00:57:59.251 --> 00:58:02.610
you had it,
you had the fucking article and you went off on a tangent.

963
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.200
<v 3>MMM hmm.</v>

964
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:08.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

965
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:10.471
<v 1>What the fuck is,</v>

966
00:58:10.471 --> 00:58:15.471
it was about this Formula One car race or we lost both his legs in a horrific

967
00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:16.794
crash.

968
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

969
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.970
<v 1>I swear to God.
How the fuck is in one thing,
one of the main articles.</v>

970
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.830
That's not one of the main articles.
You hype.
Well,

971
00:58:22.831 --> 00:58:25.830
I guess when you go to those kind of tits enough and I might,
there he is.

972
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:29.860
There he is.
You want to read an inspirational article?
This guy,
uh,

973
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.700
I hope I say his name right,
Alex.

974
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:34.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

975
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:38.300
<v 1>Is an rd.
I hope I said it right.
I right.
And you know,
I'm not,
you know,</v>

976
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.840
I'm not in the Illuminati.
Okay.

977
00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:43.380
So I don't know much about Formula One fucking racing.
Uh,

978
00:58:43.381 --> 00:58:46.020
and I also live in the United States.
So,
you know,
I watched stock car.

979
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:47.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

980
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:49.650
<v 1>I'm actually watching stock car now for the fucking fights.</v>

981
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:53.220
There's barely any fights any more in the NHL.
You all you gotta do is just,

982
00:58:53.221 --> 00:58:55.560
you know,
if you're really into fighting and you miss it in the Nhl,

983
00:58:55.561 --> 00:58:58.260
just watch the last three laps of an of a NASCAR,

984
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.500
Nascar race is race.
It's fucking great because they don't have,

985
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:08.970
because it's fighting is still so new to their sport.
Late high hockey,

986
00:59:08.971 --> 00:59:10.650
it's been going on since the beginning in new,

987
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.030
I mean allow over the last 10 years,
it's really gotten out of hand there.

988
00:59:14.031 --> 00:59:15.690
There's still no rules.
Like,
you know,

989
00:59:15.691 --> 00:59:18.240
first guy over the walls and automatic 10 game,

990
00:59:18.241 --> 00:59:21.640
I guess it'd be 10 race suspension.
They don't have any that shit.

991
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:25.060
So entire pit crews can fight other pit crews.

992
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:29.170
They have like a barroom brawl right out on there.
It's fits.
It's phenomenal.

993
00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:34.090
So anyways,
this Guy Alex Zenardi,
uh,
I hope I'm saying it right,

994
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:35.530
no disrespect to this guy.

995
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:40.060
He obviously is more of a fucking man than I'll ever be.
2001,

996
00:59:40.061 --> 00:59:43.180
he had a horrific car crash that nearly costs the champion race car driver,

997
00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:46.960
his life.
Um,
he spun out on pit row in,

998
00:59:46.961 --> 00:59:50.590
somebody came by going full speed and just clipped off the front of his car and

999
00:59:50.591 --> 00:59:54.430
took off both of his legs from the bottom just below his knees.

1000
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:57.790
And this guy has since become,

1001
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.180
he races bicycles and like,
uh,

1002
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:04.210
he got back behind the wheel of a car,
raced a little bit,

1003
01:00:04.211 --> 01:00:08.110
but now he got into bike racing and he competes in marathons now,

1004
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:12.520
the disabled a part of it and he's like the best in the world at it.

1005
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:17.320
And he's achieved so much that,
um,

1006
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:22.330
he actually said that if he could go back in life

1007
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:28.070
and go back to that moment of when he lost his legs,

1008
01:00:28.071 --> 01:00:32.420
he'd actually have to sit down and decide,
you know,

1009
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:37.280
whether or not he would want to avoid it again because he learned so much about

1010
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:39.540
life.
And I know that sounds like some corny horseshit,

1011
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.020
like obviously you want your legs,
but after reading this article,

1012
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.520
you totally understand as much as you could because you haven't gone through
the,

1013
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:50.630
uh,
the experience,
what this guy means.
And he also has this great thing about,

1014
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.140
you know,
when pushing yourself,
like your dreams,

1015
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:56.660
how to make your dreams come true,
is to set goals and all that.

1016
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.510
And he had this thing,
he used to call the five second rule.

1017
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.160
And the five second rule is when you thought you were at exhaustion and you

1018
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.340
couldn't go anymore,
you just hung in there for another five seconds.

1019
01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.010
And the thought process was,
who knows,

1020
01:01:10.011 --> 01:01:12.320
maybe in that five seconds the other guy would quit.

1021
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.670
And then he laughed after saying that.
I thought that was so fucking cool.
So,
um,

1022
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.440
anyways,
uh,
check that out.
It's,
it's the Maxim magazine.

1023
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.393
Um,

1024
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:27.350
it says hot wheels and there's a Jaguar or white car on the cover with this

1025
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.900
absolutely stunning woman who,
uh,
you know,

1026
01:01:29.901 --> 01:01:33.350
in a perfect world owns the car and just felt like sunning herself on the hood.

1027
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:38.540
Um,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
Uh,
a feminine straight man.

1028
01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:44.030
All right.
Good morning.
How you doing?
How are you all right,

1029
01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:47.150
he's got my limestone.
He said me and my husband loved the podcast.

1030
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.700
Thanks for making my Monday morning a little brighter.

1031
01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.130
Just wanting to share with you that in the last week,

1032
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:54.230
my husband has made pumpkin cookies,

1033
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:58.970
Pumpkin pancakes and Pumpkin pie from scratch.
Ah,

1034
01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.930
but fellow twinkle toes there.
Hey,
I tip my apron to you.

1035
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.880
Um,
he said,
yeah.
She says he is also a stay at home dad.

1036
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:12.020
Who drives the,
uh,
ave?
Oh,
I don't know.

1037
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:14.820
I'm not familiar with that.
Avail of the,
Oh,
hello.

1038
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.160
While I drive the Tacoma on top of that,
he doesn't get offended.

1039
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:23.090
I call him a pussy when I come home from work and I see him baking,

1040
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.020
I believe that is a slight one up.

1041
01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.610
He also has a thick beard and not only watches hockey,

1042
01:02:31.611 --> 01:02:36.140
but plays pickup games every Friday.
Most of feminine straight man.
I know.

1043
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:40.340
Go ducks and go fuck yourself.
We didn't really ask me,
uh,

1044
01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.030
you really didn't ask me any questions.
You know what it is?

1045
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:47.000
He's got a beard and he plays hockey.
You know what?

1046
01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:50.660
He's already more of a fucking man than most of us.
So you know,

1047
01:02:50.661 --> 01:02:53.690
he's got to balance it out.
He's got to bring that testosterone down.

1048
01:02:53.691 --> 01:02:55.670
He comes home,
he begs a cuff cookies.

1049
01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:00.080
It makes some Pumpkin pancakes and you come down,
you know,

1050
01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:03.750
you call him a fucking pussy and makes you feel like you're fucking doing

1051
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.320
something and the whole relationship works.

1052
01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.960
I don't think that's an a feminine straight man.

1053
01:03:08.961 --> 01:03:12.710
I think that's a fucking straight man who's comfortable with who he is.
Who uh,

1054
01:03:12.711 --> 01:03:14.600
you know,
what do you want?

1055
01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:17.810
You want me to go top shelf or you want me to put some fucking cookies on the

1056
01:03:17.811 --> 01:03:20.270
table?
I can do whatever the fuck you want.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1057
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.870
I have a beer and I know how to do shit.
All right.

1058
01:03:23.871 --> 01:03:28.190
Turning into a Douche after being dumped.
Uh,
you never want to do that.

1059
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.610
When you do that,
then they know that they want,

1060
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.900
what you gotta do is you got to take the feeling,

1061
01:03:35.901 --> 01:03:38.810
you got to push it down in and you've got to bury it all right?

1062
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.070
And then you let it out slowly up to six drinks on to unsuspecting strangers.

1063
01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.970
That's how you do.
No,
that's not what you do.
What you do is reality.

1064
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.180
What most men,
what you should do after being dumped is what you should do.

1065
01:03:50.181 --> 01:03:53.660
What Chris Bosch did after they lost the championship that year,

1066
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.430
I think it was to the mavericks,

1067
01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.960
he just dropped to the floor and he cried it out of himself and everybody made

1068
01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:00.590
fun of that guy.

1069
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:05.590
Do you realize how fucking much more healthier men would be if we could actually

1070
01:04:06.261 --> 01:04:07.094
do that?

1071
01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.760
It would be absolutely horrific for women to see and as much as they say they

1072
01:04:10.761 --> 01:04:14.240
want to see it,
they don't want to see it.
You know what I mean?

1073
01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.830
That'd be,
that's like the,
the,

1074
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.730
the male equivalent of watching your wife change your fucking tire.

1075
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.570
You don't want to see that.
Just see it.
Or I did jacking up the car.

1076
01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:28.960
No one what the fuck she's doing.
Or maybe making a strong throw from third base.

1077
01:04:28.961 --> 01:04:32.560
That's just some things that men and women,
you think you want to see it.
Yeah.

1078
01:04:32.561 --> 01:04:36.870
You don't want to say it,
but if she grunt a little bit,
when she throws her,
uh,

1079
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.740
just fucking threw a laser,
right

1080
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.640
ball takes a funny hop and she's still able to fucking ah,
fuck it.

1081
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.830
You don't want to say it.

1082
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:49.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1083
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.060
<v 1>Not saying it's wrong,
but there's just certain things.
It's just let,</v>

1084
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:57.300
just drives them up and sends us fucking,
you know,

1085
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:02.070
pitching to the right of the left there.
Oh,
fucking stand is down for the count,

1086
01:05:02.071 --> 01:05:05.400
if you know what I mean.
All right,
dear Billy boy.
Um,

1087
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:09.060
I actually should say young to the left if I'm going to go aviation here.
Uh,

1088
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.710
I am a 28 year old dude.

1089
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.770
The beginning of the year was life kicking me in the nuts.

1090
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.130
My girlfriend been together for 10 years,
left me for some rich older fuck.

1091
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.910
Oh Man.
Well,
if you want to feel better about yourself,

1092
01:05:21.911 --> 01:05:25.740
just listen to the eagles lying eyes,
you know,

1093
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:28.570
because that's what the fuck she just walked into.

1094
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:33.160
Unless he's only a few years older.
Um,
but if he's a lot older,
I mean,

1095
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:34.240
what the fuck?
Come on man.

1096
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.170
What kind of young woman wants to some guy's dick coming at them with their

1097
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.640
fucking salt and pepper.
Pubes.

1098
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.130
I mean that's a no woman lays in bed dreaming about that.

1099
01:05:42.131 --> 01:05:46.720
I can tell you that right now.
All right.
Needle needles,
needles.
Needless to say,

1100
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:52.420
he wrote needles,
needless to say,
but I will.
It got me absolutely heartbroken,

1101
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:56.020
depressed as fuck,
feeling that I lost all my goals in life.

1102
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.490
Had to leave our apartment,

1103
01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:02.550
which I renovated for us to finally be our no place like home place had to move

1104
01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:09.040
for awhile back in with my parents.
That's always a hard time.

1105
01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:13.900
Started hating my job.
Yeah,
dude,
that's awesome to what you got.

1106
01:06:13.901 --> 01:06:17.470
What you got going on here is you have a new beginning.
All right?

1107
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:22.500
You got to understand the kind of person that would leave you to go get with

1108
01:06:23.081 --> 01:06:27.520
some rich older guy.
I mean,
I don't know anything about your relationship.

1109
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.950
I mean it seems like you had a job.
You renovated the apartment.

1110
01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:33.520
You do seem like a motivated guy.
Be One thing.
If you sit around in your ass,

1111
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:36.550
look,
if you send it around your ass,
you're not doing anything.
You just,

1112
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:38.770
you cannot expect a woman to stay with you.

1113
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:45.220
You fucking useless as a man.
If you're not providing,
what are you doing?

1114
01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.380
You,
you're,
you're just a big kid.
They don't need that

1115
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.750
180 pounds of fucking xx.
Wait,
just dragging them down to the ground.

1116
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:59.920
They got one life,
they're going to go fucking live it.
So,
but you have a job.

1117
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:01.990
You renovated the place.
You sound like a good guy.

1118
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.710
Granted you're writing the email.
Here we go.
If it wasn't for,
uh,

1119
01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:10.390
for the best friends in the fucking world,
I don't know what I,
uh,

1120
01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.060
I do.
So it's been like eight months.
Got My shit together.
Loss.

1121
01:07:14.061 --> 01:07:18.340
Wade started learning a new language.
Hey,
you go started studying,

1122
01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:22.000
giving lectures in clubs and banging a hot,

1123
01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:23.890
smart 22 year old girl.

1124
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:28.120
And that banging is the shit he's saying here.

1125
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:31.810
Look at this guy turned his life around.
Uh,
you know,

1126
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:34.480
and I can tell you all your friends wish that they got dumped at this point.

1127
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:36.190
Seeing you all of a sudden walking around like,

1128
01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:38.710
you're the new Johnny Bravo there.
Uh,

1129
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.430
but the shitty thoughts about the x still stirring in my head.
Well,
it's natural,

1130
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:47.260
man.
You,
you were together for 10 years,
eight months later,
you know,

1131
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:51.070
one 22 year old and a new fucking a language.

1132
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.460
You still your norm.
That's normal.
He goes,

1133
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:58.930
I feel bad cause all that crap lands on this new girl.
Do that.

1134
01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:02.330
So that's the first wrong thing.
You've done 10 years of sharing experiences,

1135
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.670
kind of hard to forget and it always pops up.
I'm smart and sensitive to know,

1136
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.260
uh,
what I'm doing is wrong.
Well there you go.
Look at this gear.
An evolved guy.

1137
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.200
Um,
he says,
although something inside says,

1138
01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:19.060
do the fuck is wrong with you,
you should never say that to her.

1139
01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:21.470
Never compare her to the X.
Yeah,
don't do that.

1140
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.480
Never demand something she can't deliver.

1141
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:26.510
But somehow I still do it to the new girl and it hurts her.

1142
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:29.690
How do I get to stop being a Douche to this chick?
Well,

1143
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:32.870
step one is you're admitting it.
And how about this?

1144
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:37.550
There's a huge difference between 22 and 28 and a level of maturity.

1145
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.570
32 to 38 is not that much different,
but 22 to 28,

1146
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:45.330
you basically go from being a kid to being an an adult.
Um,

1147
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.550
even though legally you're considered an adult,
that's a,
um,

1148
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.110
that's a huge difference,
you know,
I mean,
if the 28 years old,

1149
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.900
you go out on a date with somebody and you go,
what's your major?

1150
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.990
That should be the beginning of when it starts feeling creepy.
You know,
it's,

1151
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.210
I don't know.
I always did.
I was just kind of like,
oh my God,

1152
01:09:03.211 --> 01:09:06.920
it's the first is don't fucking college.
You have a teacher in a semester,

1153
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:11.540
you know the fuck.
I mean,
it's just,
you can't even relate to it.
Um,

1154
01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.190
so how do you stop being a Douche to this Schick?
Uh,

1155
01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.280
I would actually sit down with their first off and I would apologize for doing

1156
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:20.940
it.
Um,

1157
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.250
that's the first thing you need to do and get it out in the open and just say

1158
01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:26.000
that,
you know,

1159
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm going to really work hard to not do it and please call me out when I'm doing

1160
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:36.140
it and I'm going to do my best to immediately stop it.
Just know that,
uh,

1161
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:39.960
I'm coming down from a tenured dump here and I got to,

1162
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.580
it's going to take me middle a little bit.
So if you can be patient with me,

1163
01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:48.170
but the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
And this is not fair to you.
Um,
that,

1164
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.420
that's the first thing I would do.
Yeah.

1165
01:09:49.421 --> 01:09:53.720
I would get a flowers and I would totally fucking apologize and be on my fucking

1166
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:57.590
best behavior,
you know,
for a while,
man.
Cause that's,
that's a,
it's a horror.

1167
01:09:57.591 --> 01:10:01.550
It's really a horrible thing to do to take out your life on somebody else.

1168
01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.410
Take out your childhood and other people,
which I did for fucking 15 years.

1169
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.710
You know,
it's bad.
Remember that?
What is that fucking show where that guy,

1170
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.640
my name is Earl,
you know,

1171
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.060
I could do that just with my fucking relationships with women was fucking bad.

1172
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.290
Um,
anyways.
All right,
so I'm not saying I'm above you or anything like that.

1173
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.780
All right,
we'll see that.
Put myself running a new level.

1174
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:26.390
I've done the same fucking thing.
So,
um,
if I could go back in time,

1175
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.224
that's what I would've done.

1176
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:29.690
If there was a podcast that I could have written too,
but I did,

1177
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.630
I was in a vacuum.
I was living in a podcast.

1178
01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:36.560
Let's world walking around from my Dick telling me what to do mixed with my

1179
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:39.260
childhood was a bad recipe.
All right?
Um,

1180
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:43.340
I've worked at one of the better known law firms in Los Angeles for the past

1181
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.930
decade to get right into it.
I've been having sex with money and my female dad,

1182
01:10:46.931 --> 01:10:48.890
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
dad,

1183
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.430
you never fucked somebody you work with.

1184
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:58.760
What was that from day about last night?
Jim Belushi,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,

1185
01:10:58.761 --> 01:11:03.680
Dad,
dad.
All right.
Uh,
all right.
He's got his dick out at work.
Everybody.

1186
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.840
Gee,
what could go wrong?
He's been banging her for about a year now.
Great.

1187
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:12.350
So she's probably developed feelings for your,
as women do,

1188
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.540
unless you've spaced out the fuck's from Christmas party,
the Christmas party.

1189
01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.880
What is it?
Is it the Santa Hat?

1190
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:22.780
Cause I want to know even going to have that fight at some point.
Uh,

1191
01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:27.280
we both stall at our desks until the rest of the office has gone home for the

1192
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.580
day.
And then we fucked like savages on the desk or in the break room.

1193
01:11:30.581 --> 01:11:34.930
I can guarantee it.
Everybody at work knows you fucking Guaran fucking tee you.

1194
01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.110
They could see it and your eyes were all animals.

1195
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:43.200
We can sense things the same way I'm standing on stage and the crowd sense if I

1196
01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:47.920
mean something or I don't if I'm joking or from not if I'm a good mood or they

1197
01:11:47.921 --> 01:11:51.180
can just sense it as I'm walking to the microphone without even knowing,

1198
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:52.960
even knowing that they have that skill.

1199
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.900
It's a survival thing leftover from caveman days.

1200
01:11:55.901 --> 01:12:00.340
The same way a crowd can do that to me.
Everybody at work knows you fucking.
Um,

1201
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.233
anyways,

1202
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.050
he says it's been great and I have no complaints.
So here's the thing.
One day,

1203
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:11.760
about a month ago,
our boss came back into the office and caught us mid act.

1204
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:17.010
All right?
If he takes his dick out,
all right and wants to join.
Now that's,

1205
01:12:17.011 --> 01:12:19.980
that's a fucking situation because your job's on the line.

1206
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.870
<v 0>Ah,
Jesus.</v>

1207
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:26.770
<v 1>See,
this is why you never take your dick out at work.
Um,</v>

1208
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.890
you'll fuck her from behind while I get to read the bottles.
Don't look our bet.

1209
01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.840
When I caught,
uh Oh,
that was gross.
Sorry.
Uh,

1210
01:12:36.841 --> 01:12:41.841
she told us to go home and that she'd be speaking with us individually the

1211
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.310
following day.
Oh,
she told you guys to go home and that's a power move.

1212
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:52.560
This is where it takes a twist.
When I ended,
when I went in to talk with my boss,

1213
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.610
I was certain I'd be fired.
However she,
oh no,

1214
01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.203
no.

1215
01:12:59.010 --> 01:12:59.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1216
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.960
<v 1>She closed the blinds,
locked the door,</v>

1217
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.200
hiked up her skirt to reveal she wasn't wearing underwear and told me to perform

1218
01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:11.840
oral sex on her.
What

1219
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.970
Dude?
Is this a red shoe diary?
I am calling bullshit.

1220
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:22.900
I know,
but how do you stop?
This is like a good summer.
He's a good summer.

1221
01:13:22.901 --> 01:13:25.990
Read everybody get up.
Let's,
let's all mentally go to the beach right now.

1222
01:13:25.991 --> 01:13:27.430
Like a fucking soccer mom here.

1223
01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.290
I assumed I was being blackmailed but didn't care because I need my job and I

1224
01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:35.860
like pussy,
dude.

1225
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:40.060
I I you like a fucking caveman.
What is wrong with you?

1226
01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.650
So it was a win.
Win.

1227
01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1228
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.230
<v 1>Let me read back.
It's the boss in there.</v>

1229
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:52.090
I'm confused as to whether the boss is in there or not.
When I walked,

1230
01:13:52.091 --> 01:13:54.190
went in to talk with my boss,
I would certainly be fired.

1231
01:13:54.191 --> 01:13:58.390
Whoever she closed the blinds,
lock the door.
All right.

1232
01:13:58.391 --> 01:13:59.500
I guess they have to keep reading here.

1233
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:04.540
The thing is she didn't stop.

1234
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:08.770
She calls me to office at least twice a week to go down on her for an hour.

1235
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.180
She says she has security footage

1236
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.380
<v 0>of my coworker and I having sex.
Oh wait a minute,</v>

1237
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.710
I missed that.
Your boss is a woman.

1238
01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:26.220
<v 1>Oh,
see the sexist me assumed you had a male boss.
There you go.</v>

1239
01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:30.180
There you go.
I got work to do on myself as another thing.
Wait a minute,

1240
01:14:30.181 --> 01:14:32.070
you got to go down on your boss.

1241
01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.160
She says she has security footage of my coworker and I having sex in the off
too.

1242
01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:43.580
This is a crime and that she'll fire is both,

1243
01:14:43.581 --> 01:14:48.410
unless they continue to serve as her.
So she's got to be old and hard up.

1244
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:54.230
This is a fucking nightmare.
What's worse to this can't be true.

1245
01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:59.360
You made this up.
Fuck you trying to get me during the holiday season.

1246
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.810
I can't.
Oh my God,
I can't stop reading this.

1247
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:08.110
What's worse is that my coworker doesn't know why she hasn't been fired yet and

1248
01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.960
I'm afraid to tell her about the deal I have with our boss.

1249
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:17.270
Oh Jesus Christ.
Dude,
this is like a bad movie.
If this is actually real,

1250
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:22.510
you fucking tell her and then you film her in the fucking act with you,

1251
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:28.180
your boss.
Right.
And then you say,
listen,
unless you give us both a fucking race,

1252
01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.080
we'll fucking will rat you out.
Actually No.

1253
01:15:33.081 --> 01:15:35.360
What do you want to do is go to the cops because then you know,

1254
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:38.570
cause then you're both doing it to each other and then somehow the state could

1255
01:15:38.571 --> 01:15:42.780
maybe send you all the jail.
Anyways,
he goes,

1256
01:15:42.781 --> 01:15:45.930
I realize this isn't the worst problem to have then.
You know what,
Dude,

1257
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:48.870
I don't have a fucking problem.
I,
I,
if you don't give a fuck,
why should I?

1258
01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.690
My boss isn't exactly unattractive,

1259
01:15:51.691 --> 01:15:53.910
but not someone I'd approach it a bar or anything.

1260
01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:57.450
I think Jodie foster in silence of the lambs.
So what do I do?

1261
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:01.170
Should I call her bluff and refuse to continue or should I suck it up?

1262
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.660
No Pun intended and keep on going.
Also,

1263
01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:07.440
I should tell or should I tell my coworker and risk ruining the relationship or

1264
01:16:07.441 --> 01:16:08.910
worst risk getting the word out.

1265
01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:12.840
Then I'm basically a whore and he help us appreciate thanks and go fuck
yourself.

1266
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:16.710
Uh,
or come fuck my boss with me.
Yeah,
this guy's a jerk off.

1267
01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.690
You don't give a fuck.
All right.

1268
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.390
Look at whenever you get tired of being a man whore,

1269
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.280
this is what you need to do.
You need to go Mickey Rourke here.

1270
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.590
Popa Greenwich Village.
You know,
you got to get a tape,

1271
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.580
you got to come in.
They're wired.
This is a great thing.
That sense,

1272
01:16:35.581 --> 01:16:36.450
you're not fucking her.

1273
01:16:36.451 --> 01:16:39.690
You can come in there wearing a god damn wire and all you gotta do is just have

1274
01:16:39.691 --> 01:16:44.280
her say some incriminating shit.
All right?
And then you get to walk in there,

1275
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.110
you know,
and then you just,
you grab it by your hand.

1276
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.920
Cause I gotta fucking tape tape.
I took off a dead cop,
right?

1277
01:16:52.921 --> 01:16:54.600
You give her that fucking speech,
you go out,

1278
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.810
you get your hair cut is just smoking a cigarette while some woman fucking

1279
01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:01.140
manicures your nails and you come walking in there,
Mickey Rourke,

1280
01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:04.140
Pope of Greenwich Village,
and you'd tell the bitch,

1281
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:07.740
I'm going to fucking put you in jail.
He'd give me a race.
Although I shouldn't.
I,

1282
01:17:07.741 --> 01:17:10.620
you shouldn't do that because now engaged in criminal activity,

1283
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.250
what you need to do is you got to have some fucking self esteem.

1284
01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.150
You know what I would do honestly,
because if

1285
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:25.040
I personally,
I wouldn't want any of this to come out.
Um,

1286
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:26.030
what I would do

1287
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:27.130
<v 0>okay.</v>

1288
01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:28.990
<v 1>Is I would get another fucking job.</v>

1289
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:30.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1290
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:35.430
<v 1>And then I would just,
I would walk away.
I would,</v>

1291
01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:38.130
I think I would just walk away.
Isn't that funny?

1292
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.620
This is the type of fucking thing that if a man was doing it to a woman,

1293
01:17:40.621 --> 01:17:42.900
it'd be like,
oh my God,
this stays to stop.

1294
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.140
But I guarantee you most of the women that listen to this start this,

1295
01:17:46.141 --> 01:17:47.580
this was a funny fucking story.

1296
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:49.223
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1297
01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:53.360
<v 1>I guess it is,
but it's just because they can't physically fucking don.</v>

1298
01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:55.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1299
01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:57.920
<v 1>I guess is the way where it's a fact.
I know.
I guess it's that thing,</v>

1300
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.750
that whole fucking thing that you could literally force yourself on,

1301
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.870
but she's literally forcing you what a fucking animal.
Like.

1302
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:08.360
I still don't believe that that's true,
but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
Um,

1303
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.253
underrated.

1304
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:13.110
<v 4>Uh,
there are song lyrics and the act,</v>

1306
01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:15.710
<v 0>what</v>

1307
01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:20.090
<v 1>there are,
these are song lyrics and the act is what is underrated.</v>

1308
01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:22.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1309
01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.480
<v 1>Uh,
just before doggy styling,</v>

1310
01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:27.510
a woman to go hunt one hut too.

1311
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:30.913
<v 0>What</v>

1312
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:34.210
<v 1>I hate when guys do shit like that.
Like,</v>

1313
01:18:34.211 --> 01:18:37.320
I never found any of those fucking jokes.
Funny.
You know,

1314
01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:41.630
like this is the dirty Sanchez.
Would you focus sticky?
Did you,

1315
01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:45.370
you will be good up top.

1316
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.910
You know that stupid frat boy fucking humor.

1317
01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:50.963
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1318
01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.910
<v 1>I always,
all of that shit always comes from a place of insecurity that like,</v>

1319
01:18:54.911 --> 01:18:55.211
look,

1320
01:18:55.211 --> 01:18:59.890
it's so easy for me to get laid that I can disrespect women in this fucking way.

1321
01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.753
You know what I mean?

1322
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:04.130
<v 4>Those are those Jackhammer in guys.</v>

1323
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.700
They don't know what the fuck they're doing in bed.
They just get on top of that.

1324
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.200
Those fucking guys that was poor fucking women got to put up with that shit.

1325
01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:16.100
Just someone who just was not blessed with any sort of fucking empathy,

1326
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:18.830
wasn't blessed with any Sorta,
uh,
fuck it.

1327
01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:21.760
Ain't no gift of touch or anything like that.
Those are all,

1328
01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:25.640
those are those dirty Sanchez fucking guy.
I always hated those fucking jokes.

1329
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:26.650
Yeah.

1330
01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:31.160
<v 5>Donkey Paul.
But you weren't a backer.
Is He really?
Is that right?</v>

1331
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.930
<v 4>Does that make you a man?
You fucking jerk off.
All right.
Anyways,</v>

1332
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:38.840
that's the podcast for this week.
I,
once again,
I want to thank,
um,

1333
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:43.940
Cam Neely and Denis leary for letting me be a part of this unbelievable charity

1334
01:19:43.941 --> 01:19:47.870
over the years and watching it grow from the Orpheum theater or budget guidance,

1335
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:52.190
Serena and now over at the fleet center or TD bank,
North Gatton,

1336
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:55.400
whatever the hell they call it now.
Um,

1337
01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:58.190
it's so great and it's such a raise,

1338
01:19:58.191 --> 01:20:01.310
raised all of this money and I'm like most of the charities,

1339
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:04.700
this money actually goes to the victims.
Phenomenal to be a part of it.

1340
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:09.660
It's always like a,
like a standup cup comedian,
like a high school reunion.

1341
01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:13.970
You know,
I get to see all these guys that I don't get to see enough.
Uh,
it was,

1342
01:20:13.971 --> 01:20:14.310
uh,

1343
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:19.080
just a phenomenal time and I want to thank everybody that bought tickets and

1344
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.720
gave to that,
that great charity.
And uh,

1345
01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:26.070
I look forward to doing many more in the future.
Hopefully God willing.
All right,

1346
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.430
that's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
