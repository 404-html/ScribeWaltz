00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.980
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bard is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.820
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.080
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.480
I'm just checking and just seeing how your week's going,
you know,

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.660
you know,
I would think if I was in New York Yankee Fan,

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:26.220
despite the fact we're only a couple of games up for the one game playoff,

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.810
I would say that I'm having a pretty good fucking Thursday,
you know?

8
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:35.640
Do you see the last couple of games?
Did you see last night's game in particular?

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.950
I'm going to tell you guys right now,

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.670
I am going to gradually wean you off of watching ESPN,

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.110
Fox sports west,
listening to the fan.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.380
Okay?
Nobody gets it right?

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.040
More Times in my own mind,

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.910
in my own world,
without doing any research on how any of those other people,

15
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:02.990
how many times they get it right?

16
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:07.991
Nobody gets it right more than the man you're listening to right fucking now.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.230
What the fuck did I say?
Well,
Bill,
you,
you've said a lot of things.

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.370
All right,
fair enough.

19
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.270
I have said a lot of things and I mentioned this fucking wire sucks.

20
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
Jesus Christ.
God forbid I turned my fucking,
this is unbelievable.

21
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.980
It's a brand new fucking wire.
Does anything work?

22
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.970
Is this how like China is going to slowly like they know they can't fucking bomb

23
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:37.080
us,
right?
So what do they do?
They just make everything just a little bit,

24
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.950
not fucking right and it just,
it's going to gradually drive him fucking crazy.

25
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.250
Now what do I do?
I've got to move this thing over here.

26
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.120
Bring this up because God forbid this,
any weight on this wire,

27
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.850
the second thing is weight.
All of a sudden it doesn't work.

28
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.310
Now it totally does it.
Come on.
I need to hear myself.

29
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.550
I need to hear myself talking about how great I am.
All right,
there you go.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.260
Um,
I told you motherfuckers,

31
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.470
I love how I'm mad at you guys.
Like you ever said no you didn't bill,

32
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.770
you never told us that.
Right?
Fuck is my water.

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.230
Oh Jesus.
This can be one of these dow.
There it is.
There it is.
Um,

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
I told you way back in fucking August when the red sox swept the Yankees and

35
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.740
ESPN fucking over

36
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.880
what's over ESPN.
Oh,

37
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.460
I guess maybe a divisional race.
Who gives a fuck?

38
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.650
You know what I mean?
There's still the wildcard
still the fucking wow.

39
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.510
That's like there's an ax murderer or outside your fucking house and you just

40
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.690
lock the front door and you leave the back door wide open.
You're like,

41
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:48.980
well I guess that takes care of that.
Not to mention if you have a wood door,

42
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.760
you know,
but so motivated axe murderer,

43
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.210
you know,
he could just chop down the door.

44
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 1>Jay actually would work in your,
it gives you time to try</v>

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 2>to find something to defend.
Defend yourself is acts,
you know,</v>

47
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
technically speaking will be a little more dull cause it goes through the front

48
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:13.170
door.
This is all beside the point.
I told you motherfuckers back then I was,

49
00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:15.340
I can tell David Price goes into the fucking metaphor.

50
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.730
New Custodian wintered Goddamn game.

51
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.390
I don't give a fuck that were out there sweeping the Baltimore Orioles.

52
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.843
<v 3>All right.</v>

53
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.920
<v 2>Regular season stats.
You know what that's like.</v>

54
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:31.630
That's like the guy who was the fucking big man on campus in high school.
Right?

55
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.390
He's a fucking lie.
He's a captain at is.

56
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.950
He's got the dimple in his fucking chair and he's banging a fucking cheerleader.

57
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.230
Right?
And everybody's like,
oh my God,
Hey,

58
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.700
it's Katie's going to be the president right

59
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.813
<v 3>now.
What happens?</v>

60
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.090
<v 2>You go back to the reunion and he looks like,
may no,
you got me.</v>

61
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
I'm just saying

62
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.050
like it doesn't make a difference if you win 89 games or fucking 129 games.

63
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:07.640
What murders is how you're doing against the fucking teams that you're going to

64
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:10.010
see in October.
You know?

65
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.130
But that's not the business that does those so and so's over and ESPN and Fox

66
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.460
News and whoever else.
I'm,
I'm lumping into the same fucking category.

67
00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:20.960
That's not the game they're in.

68
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.070
They're in the game of what the fuck you see is what the fuck it is.

69
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.700
And we will hype the shit out of it and not even remotely look at it

70
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.110
analytically.

71
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.860
<v 2>So then if what happens happens,
you can be,
like I said,
it was going to happen,</v>

73
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.590
but what you said was going to happen doesn't happen.
Then you get to do the,

74
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.730
what happened?

75
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.760
What happened was you got a namerd by a bunch of fucking victories against the

76
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:50.670
Orioles in the fucking tigers in bunches.
These are Jake,
Jake.
I mean huge guys.

77
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.660
Gate gate hit like over 9,000 home run junior regular season.

78
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.200
And you were absolutely anemic in the playoffs.
Well,
yeah.

79
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.050
Well how did they do against the fucking Astros?

80
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.213
<v 3>Sorry.</v>

81
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.270
<v 2>Anyways,
you know what?
You know what that's like the,
it's like watching Paul.</v>

82
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.490
I love Paul to death.
I got to get him on the,

83
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.370
I have to get him on this fucking podcast cause I'm always making fun of them

84
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.030
and I want you guys to know that it comes from a place of love.
All right?

85
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.850
Most of the times it comes from a place of love for right now.

86
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.580
It comes from a place of concern.

87
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.170
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.990
<v 2>Okay.
One of the dumbest fucking things that you can do.
Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.830
Besides buying a fucking God damn fucking speaker wire for I'm,

90
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:39.220
I'm blaming it on China.
Okay.
It's a,
it's always a great guest.

91
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.270
Everything's fucking made over there.
All right.
It's like when,

92
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:44.200
when you get you eating a doughnut,
you're like,
what?

93
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.980
What's the main ingredient gradient in here?
The one guests you have is corn.

94
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

95
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.000
<v 2>Corners in everything.
If you don't believe me,</v>

96
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.040
watch the one documentary I ever watched about and

97
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 1>have now are using that as my Bible.
I saw it years ago,</v>

98
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.360
so I'm probably misquoting it.
All right?
Having said that,

99
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.950
no one I just said was a fact.

100
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.520
One of the dumbest things you could do is the first game of the week bet a bunch

101
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.830
of fucking games.
All right?

102
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.590
And I'm not talking about fantasies shit.

103
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.850
And I'm not talking about all the people,

104
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.560
the sports gambling podcasts that I read a advertising than I told you to to go

105
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.270
out and do that exact fucking thing.

106
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.620
So this is be hypocritical now for me to tell you this,
but I,
you know,

107
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.160
you don't know who the fuck anybody is until about two,
three fucking weeks in.

108
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.003
All right?

109
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.290
I've tried to tell Paul Versey this poverty is the king of betting football,

110
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.380
college or pro.
In fact,

111
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:53.381
when I first became friends with him back when college football wasn't brilliant

112
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.210
enough to realize that they needed to have some good match ups in the first few

113
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.940
weeks to get people into it,
to pull them away from the NFL and this,

114
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.240
this is what's happening.
You know,
even though I haven't looked at the ratings,

115
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.610
okay,
I'm saying it's happening,
therefore it is happening.
Okay?

116
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.690
Now these goddamn feminists and me tours can just say things happen without any

117
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:24.590
evidence.
And God damn it,
I can say this is happening with no evidence,

118
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.820
no research,
no nothing to write fucking college football is,
is,

119
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.990
is getting better ratings right now than the national football league.

120
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.210
Dare I say a presidential address.

121
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.500
Okay.
Now,
if Netflix doesn't have to give out ratings,

122
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.880
then why should I have to look at him?
That's what I say.
Um,

123
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 3>yeah.</v>

124
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.200
<v 1>Anyways,
Po,
uh,
this is like 10 fucking years ago,
12 years ago,</v>

125
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:54.200
and at first knew Paul,
this is back when they had all the cupcake games,

126
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.801
you know,

127
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:58.970
to establish the rankings for whatever reason they would have like Ohio State

128
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.020
Doh play,
uh,
Eleanor Rigby.
He's fucking nursing home,
right?

129
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.110
Nursing School of nursing or some shit,
right?

130
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.770
And then there would be a favored by like fucking 80 points and fucking Versie

131
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:14.060
would go out.
And just the first week of football,
you know,

132
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.180
being a college coach is so much harder than being a pro professionals,

133
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.730
uh,
coach.
Simply because every three,
you know,
three,
four years,

134
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.190
you've got a brand new fucking team.
You're just constantly,

135
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.050
every year is a fucking rebuilding year.
And now all these God damn millennials,

136
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.640
which they're not millennials once again,
1980 to 1995,

137
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.320
there are 23 to 38 years old.

138
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.160
I actually just told a 38 year old woman yesterday that she was a millennial and

139
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.230
she couldn't fucking believe.
I said,
yes,
you are.

140
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.730
According to the one website that I went to and didn't even look at a second one

141
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.680
to even back it up.
You are a millennial.
And she said,

142
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.230
I don't identify as millennial.
And I was like,

143
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.950
are you angling for your own bathroom?
Um,

144
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.180
I don't know.

145
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.130
I'm doing this right now cause I don't even know what the fuck's going on in the

146
00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:01.960
world right now.
I just know it's a fucking,

147
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.070
everybody is in a Goddamn hissy fit about everything.

148
00:09:06.071 --> 00:09:09.460
So I just know,
and I know that you don't need evidence,

149
00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:10.690
you don't need fucking anything.

150
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.130
People just say things and then it's not only the person that did the thing,

151
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:18.010
it's the person that stood next to the guy that did the fucking thing.

152
00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:22.420
So in the future,
God forbid God for fucking bed,

153
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.530
you're standing on a subway platform and somebody jumps in front of a train to

154
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:28.540
commit suicide.
Um,

155
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.890
they're going to blame you for assisted suicide because you stood there and did

156
00:09:32.891 --> 00:09:33.724
nothing.

157
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.040
I'm sorry.
That's probably a slight exaggeration.

158
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:43.900
It's probably bear,
you know,

159
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.240
I probably should have read up on the story a little more.

160
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.310
I probably don't know what I'm talking about.

161
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.520
<v 1>I probably won't even upload this,
but I might.
But if you're listening to it,</v>

163
00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:57.970
you know,
are dead.
So Versie would go out any fucking would just,

164
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.090
just the first week of college football.

165
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:05.890
You have no idea who the fuck anybody anybody is.
And he would just,

166
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.060
he would just do it.
It's a law.
I mean,
it's literally a joke.

167
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.410
Nebraska be given 58 and he'd fucking bed on the favor.
Right?

168
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.330
He's doing it again this year.
All right.

169
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.970
Last week he fucking bets.
Uh,
you know,

170
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.070
he's got that fucking homecoming theory,

171
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.600
a good road team coming off a loss playing the next week,
add home.

172
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.200
He doesn't give a fuck how many fucking points that given.

173
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.880
He can't lay off it.

174
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.210
So we keeps calling the lions,
the hapless lions,
that hapless lines.

175
00:10:43.211 --> 00:10:47.800
It's just like,
dude,
they,
their first game of the year,
they had a shit one.
Okay,

176
00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:49.120
everybody's going to have a shit game.

177
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:52.510
The fucking patriots just had a shit game against the Jag was,

178
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.890
but it was week two.
So nobody's saying that that's who they are.

179
00:10:56.891 --> 00:11:00.940
But last year they had a shit game against Kansas City and all of a sudden the

180
00:11:00.941 --> 00:11:03.940
whole for all the wheels were off.
The Tom Brady era was over.

181
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.290
And what ended up happening,

182
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.250
all Tommy Brady brought us right back to the fucking super bowl.

183
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.280
He threw for 500 yards over 500 yards in the game and he lost it was our defense

184
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:18.380
suck that game,
you know?
Um,

185
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.890
cause they will,
they only held,
nick falls to over 300 yards,

186
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.010
which I guess was a great day.
If the other guy threw for 500 bucks a day,

187
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.590
if we don't come out with victory,
didn't want it to me.

188
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.293
<v 3>MMM.</v>

189
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.340
<v 1>So last week for as he's telling me that the lions,
the hapless lines,</v>

190
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.180
you'd take Jimmy g coming home,
San Francisco,

191
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.440
it's a lock and he's texting me,
the whole game is San Francisco is winning.
Say,

192
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:50.470
what did I say?
I set it all week.
Exclamation points.

193
00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:54.130
He's an absolute euphoria that he said

194
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.200
<v 2>something that now look like it was going to happen.</v>

195
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.550
And he's looking at Matthew Stafford like this fucking guy likes to lose every

196
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.590
week.
Like this guy doesn't have any pride,

197
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.920
<v 1>man.
It can't get out there fucking rock.</v>

198
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.301
<v 2>And next thing you know,</v>

199
00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:11.930
the fucking lines come back in the end and they end up covering the spread.

200
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.100
Now we've all fucking been there.
All right?

201
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.120
So you learn from your past.
Well,
if you don't learn from your past,

202
00:12:20.121 --> 00:12:23.630
you wouldn't keep gambling,
but now you come back for more.

203
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.280
What does versus do again this week?
He's teasing the Patriots.

204
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.670
The play.
I think that,
I don't know.
Somebody is playing.

205
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.730
He keeps calling him the hapless lions because they had one bad fucking week.

206
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.940
So now the lines of playing the Patriots are former fucking coach is coaching

207
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:49.700
the team.
He's been what he went and what Ma fucking Patricia.

208
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:53.210
They're like,
that guy doesn't know some of the shit that we do.

209
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

210
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.820
Now I'm not saying the Patriots won't go in and kick the fucking shit up and I

212
00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.610
send a page is okay?
Yeah.
All right.
See,
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

213
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.473
I'm just saying

214
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:08.180
you just lost betting against this fucking tape and you're still calling them

215
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.100
the hapless fucking lions.

216
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.860
<v 2>They were on the road,
they almost beat the fucking 40 niners</v>

217
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.290
<v 1>they had one bad fucking game.
All right.</v>

218
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.300
And this brings me back to the fucking red sox.

219
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.830
<v 2>Alright.
They sweep</v>

220
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.080
<v 1>the Yankees or the beginning of August and everybody fucking,</v>

221
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:29.990
and all these guys in these fucking sports shows,

222
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.230
they put their tasseled fucking loafers up on the desk,

223
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.263
<v 2>you know,</v>

224
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.790
full their fingers on top of their head and that's fucking over it.
So it's,

225
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.070
it ain't over.
It's not over.

226
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.010
It's not fucking over.
So my prediction,
the Red Sox,
uh,

227
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.150
<v 1>I just don't think we,
we don't have the fucking one two punch.</v>

228
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.370
We don't have a one and two as far as I'm concerned in our starting rotation

229
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:58.360
that you need.

230
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.793
<v 0>You know,</v>

231
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.920
<v 1>we just don't have it.</v>

232
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:06.340
So I think we're going to win a bunch of fucking games and then we are going to

233
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:09.190
lose in the playoffs.
I don't want that to happen.

234
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.030
I didn't want to say that to you.
I don't want to ruin your fucking day.

235
00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:15.380
But you know,

236
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.220
until a price starts fucking winning and Yankee Stadium,

237
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:22.450
I just don't fucking see it.

238
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:25.570
Unless we're going to play for straight fucking gay or I'll,
I'll,
you know,

239
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.840
only have him start at home.
Oh my God,

240
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.531
I love the guy.

241
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.200
He's a fucking amazing pitcher and everything and I really needed him to win

242
00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:38.850
last night.
I needed it.
Okay.
I needed it because,
you know,
I,

243
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.050
I,
you know,
I lived through sports.
That's,
that's how,
that's what I do.
Okay.
There.

244
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.010
Okay.
Does that make you feel better?
It's not enough then.

245
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:50.670
I'm a 50 year old man alone in a room right now talking into a microphone,

246
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:54.140
hoping somebody is listening,
nodding in agreement.

247
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.400
Almost didn't get through that word.
Listening,
listening.
Um,

248
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.960
and we'll have things you'll want to talk about.

249
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.570
I will.

250
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.720
<v 3>Two,
this is like my own Mr. Rogers show.
You know,</v>

251
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.930
<v 1>it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood,
a beautiful day in the neighbor.</v>

252
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.770
Here comes the current through the fucking door.

253
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.140
He has always wanted to be right about something in sports,

254
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.460
even though it has no effect on his life.

255
00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:32.220
So let's all fucking listen to this shit.

256
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.680
Send them some emails and say,
dude,
that was it.
You figured it out.

257
00:15:38.681 --> 00:15:43.600
You're a genius.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You're red con sorry.
Um,

258
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.740
go fuck yourself.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I always have to finish the song.

259
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.570
Please go fuck yourself.

260
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.360
<v 3>You freckled current.
Um,
anyways,</v>

261
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.253
uh,

262
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.800
<v 1>I have not been watching the news and been working on writing a script right
now,</v>

263
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:03.340
so I haven't been watching anything and it's fucking hilarious to not watch the

264
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.820
news to not what's no,
what's going on.

265
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

266
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.960
<v 1>Because all your friends,
it just constantly,
or just sending you texts.
All caps.</v>

267
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:15.770
Are you watching this or they call you up?
Dude,
did you see this?

268
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.310
Did you see that Mark Cuban thing?

269
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.190
<v 0>Okay?</v>

270
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.870
<v 1>Did you see what Trump said?</v>

271
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:22.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

272
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.240
<v 1>Did you hear about the fuck an Albatross?</v>

273
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:26.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

274
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.540
<v 1>The Dj Dj's.
Did you see what happened in Bolivia?</v>

275
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.230
It's fucking hell.
It's never anything good.

276
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.340
<v 3>Never.
Never anything fucking good.
Um,</v>

277
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.160
<v 1>anyways,
so I,
I don't,
I don't know what's going on.</v>

278
00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:48.540
I did watch the Mark Cuban thing for like a minute,
man.
That was fucking a,

279
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.310
that was brutal.
That now that,
that right there,
that that's,
that's one of them.

280
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:58.640
Brutal ones
late.
No,
maybe there's eight.
No,

281
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:01.150
maybe that,
that's just straight up.
That's just fucking

282
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.760
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

283
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.880
<v 1>I don't know.
You know,
I got to tell you here it's this podcast,</v>

284
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.690
like that's not the way we run our business here.
Now.

285
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:16.310
The genius of my podcast is there's,
there's nobody else here.

286
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.930
Therefore I can't get in trouble.

287
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.363
<v 0>Okay.</v>

288
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.120
<v 1>I don't send emails to myself.</v>

289
00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:29.590
At no point will I ever be on the ESPN of podcasting,
sitting there,

290
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.060
shifting,
uncomfortably,

291
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.020
trying to answer questions that I have the answers to.

292
00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:39.090
I just don't want to tell them to you because I know it's,
it's,

293
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.580
I did the wrong thing.
Um,
or maybe,

294
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:47.450
maybe in the future they'll,
there'll be something like that.
You know,

295
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.180
I want to see what

296
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.490
<v 3>is a woman going to be fucking squirming.</v>

297
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.040
What about that woman who fucking date rape?

298
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.870
The 17 year old guy who fucking was talking all that shit about Harvey Weinstein

299
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:03.530
and then she fucking paid the kid off and then blamed it on a dead guy.

300
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.040
<v 1>Where,
why isn't she shifting around?</v>

301
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:11.750
Ask and answer and fucking uncomfortable fucking questions.
You know,

302
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.540
sometimes it's deer season,
sometimes it's elk season.

303
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:17.750
I guess it's still deer season.
I can't,
what?
When,

304
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.130
when is it going to flip up?
When is it going to flip around?

305
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

306
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.620
<v 1>That's why I don't look at this shit.
I saw this woman she wrote on like Twitter.</v>

307
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:33.360
She's just like,
oh,
this one guy,

308
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:37.110
he was able to come out back after fucking six months and it wasn't six months.

309
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:38.010
It was close to a year.

310
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.600
So they already fucking shaved off some months and uh,

311
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.570
Monica Lewinsky wasn't able to come back for 20 years.
It's like,

312
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:49.650
what are you talking about?
And she goes,
and she did nothing wrong.
Well,

313
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:51.610
I think Hillary would probably debate that.

314
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

315
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.740
<v 1>It's like she hosted SNL.
She wrote a fucking book.
She had a line of purses.</v>

316
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:01.020
She had a show.
They tried to get on the air.
If she,

317
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.700
not only she fucking became a cottage industry off of that thing.

318
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.440
It's like,
what are you talking about?

319
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.113
<v 3>MMM.</v>

320
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.090
<v 1>Anyways,
I don't know.
I,
that's,
it's just like at this,</v>

321
00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:19.310
this fucking thing that women are doing that with all,

322
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.750
they just keep peeking over the fence and all this scene is green grass.

323
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.743
<v 3>You know,</v>

324
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.260
<v 1>I,
I don't,
I just don't fucking,
it's like what are you looking?</v>

325
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.900
That's all you see.
You only see green grass.

326
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.690
<v 4>Yeah.
Engages fucking show up and people just given stop.</v>

327
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.830
If a guy did something wrong happens.

328
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.200
If a woman just shut the fuck up,

329
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.330
<v 1>they sound like fucking five.
I'm not saying there aren't double standards,</v>

330
00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:50.631
everything,

331
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:53.840
but like what did you pick one that's actually a double standard so you don't

332
00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:57.860
have to fudge shit that stingy a whole thing is just going to fucking collapsed.

333
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.390
Or maybe you do research.
This woman actually said she's on her fucking stump.

334
00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:06.890
She's saying after the Monica Lewinsky thing that Bill Clinton was those then

335
00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:10.340
reelected.
It's like he wasn't,
it happened in his second term.

336
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.150
Do a little research.
I mean what,
what,
what do you mean

337
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.400
and we'll have things we'll want to yell about.

338
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.400
<v 1>I will</v>

340
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.610
<v 3>to,
um,</v>

341
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.850
<v 4>when a woman brushes your teeth,</v>

342
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.650
she can feel the whole toothpastes community judging her.

343
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.500
When a guy brushes his teeth,
they're like,
oh,

344
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.960
we should run the company.
Okay,

345
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.360
<v 1>next time you're in traffic,
stop and go traffic ladies.
Just,
just look at the,</v>

346
00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:57.110
look on the guy's faces.
Look at the cars they're driving

347
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.221
to.

348
00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:03.480
Any of them look like they're even in remote control remotely in fucking control

349
00:21:03.481 --> 00:21:04.314
of their lives.

350
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.413
<v 0>Okay,</v>

351
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.830
<v 1>ladies,
be honest with yourselves,
okay.</v>

352
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.060
In the average relationship,
boyfriend,
girlfriend,

353
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.850
okay.
Married.

354
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.410
Whatever life partners the end of the day,

355
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.833
<v 0>okay.</v>

356
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.900
<v 1>If she wants to get brunch and the guy doesn't know what the,</v>

357
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.010
what do you think you're going to do?

358
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

359
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.850
<v 1>What is the guy's options?</v>

360
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.870
Does he have any at the end of the day,
who's really calling the shots?

361
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.800
If only one person has life insurance,

362
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.043
<v 0>okay.</v>

363
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.990
<v 1>If there's only one fucking person that's going to benefit from the other</v>

364
00:21:51.991 --> 00:21:55.650
person's death on average,
who is that person?

365
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.410
<v 0>Huh?
Let me come on people.</v>

366
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.710
<v 1>Happy wife.
Happy life.
Where's the cute little rhyme for the guy?</v>

367
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.880
There isn't one.
It's cause we don't matter.

368
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.840
Look how they hype Valentine's Day.

369
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.210
<v 0>Okay?</v>

370
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.130
<v 1>It's all about the woman.
Why?</v>

371
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.480
Because they know that every guy is living the fucking male female dynamic,

372
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:32.160
which is keep it happy.

373
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.790
Maybe it will fuck me keeping happy.

374
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.080
Maybe I can watch the game,
keep it happy.

375
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.100
Maybe I can enjoy 20 minutes of my weekend.

376
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.100
That is what that is the world most men are living in.

377
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.430
But if you go on the Internet and you go on social media,

378
00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.850
most men are blocking a doorway while jizzing on a plant then running a company

379
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.700
telling you when you're in traffic,
just look,
look,
it's,
I'm telling you,

380
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.900
you just look at the side of somebody's head and you know who the fuck they are.

381
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.130
You can see how much hope they have left.
All right.

382
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.710
I challenge you.
Why does that thing doing that shit?
No.
Um,

383
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.970
a challenge.
I challenge you to find a lot of hopeful fucking guys out there.

384
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.500
Did you see that?
Somebody else told me that night.
I actually looked it up.

385
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.260
That fucking that without that woman out there,
uh,
in,

386
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.110
in Hawaii telling men,

387
00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:40.060
did you shut up and do the right thing for once?
It's a fucking,

388
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.020
she's hold political office and it's just talking like that.

389
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.270
<v 2>Just shut up and do the right thing.
All the guys asking for is,
is to,</v>

390
00:23:52.271 --> 00:23:56.300
how to say his side of the story.
She's basically saying,
shut up.

391
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.590
Don't listen to the guys' side of the story.
As this woman says all these things,

392
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.540
it's going to destroy this guy's career.

393
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.500
I'm not saying what the woman is saying is true or isn't true,
but the guy,

394
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.780
he doesn't even have the right to defend himself.

395
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.650
<v 1>Dang.
Dang.
For once.</v>

396
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:14.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

397
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.070
<v 2>All right.
How about we do that when you push away from the buffet table,
Oh,</v>

398
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.660
there's a nice low blow for you and I am proud of doing it.

399
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.000
I'll take the 10 minute misconduct.

400
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.670
That's what it's becoming.
It's becoming literally shut the fuck up.

401
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.650
All guys shut up and listen to one side of the fucking story and then that's the

402
00:24:34.651 --> 00:24:38.610
story.
You know the story is my story.

403
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.450
Your story doesn't count because you have a fucking Dick.

404
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.880
That's the world that we're going into right now.

405
00:24:44.881 --> 00:24:49.050
And evidently it's like progressive.
It's fucking insane.
It's insane.

406
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:50.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.850
<v 1>And right now,
if one of these crazy women listen to this,</v>

408
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.140
they would completely twist what I just said and say that I'm actually against

409
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.530
women who've been abused,
getting some sort of justice,

410
00:25:01.531 --> 00:25:05.140
which is not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that they're there.

411
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.640
You have to listen to both people and then weigh the evidence.

412
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.323
<v 0>You know,</v>

413
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.010
<v 1>even that is a flawed fucking system,</v>

414
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.270
but it's the best system we have.

415
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:20.210
And now you're going to take that system and you're going to throw it out and

416
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:21.110
now you just,
you know,

417
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.100
it's like Frankenstein movie that fucking coming up the hill with torches.

418
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.710
Um,
just shut up.

419
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.050
And as you could tell him a little emotional,
you saw it.

420
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:34.630
Like she had that whole fucking thing planned out.
Like she,
you know,

421
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.880
she thought she was going to get like a bunch of hits,

422
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.610
which I obviously did if I fucking heard about it.
MMM.

423
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.880
Yeah,
I dunno.
It's literally,

424
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:48.881
it's like McCarthyism meets a fucking myspace is what's going on right now.

425
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.030
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

426
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:57.110
<v 1>yeah.
I should show up and everything works out when we show up to it.
Good.</v>

427
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.690
<v 2>Me.
Well,
the average guy is driving some sodas shitbox to work,</v>

428
00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:08.950
working for somebody else

429
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.520
<v 1>in a job that he never really dreamed of having as a kid.</v>

430
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.240
That's most people's fucking reality,
but not on social media.

431
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

432
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.281
<v 1>Social media.</v>

433
00:26:18.281 --> 00:26:22.630
Every guys out there running a company eaten steak and lobster for fucking
lunch,

434
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:27.070
make it as secretary shower is her tits.
Like that's what's happening.

435
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.090
That's what all that and every so every guy out there shut up.

436
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

437
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:37.550
<v 1>How dare you try to defend yourself and everything.
You worked for a shut up,</v>

438
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.400
do the right thing and chat app.
Um,

439
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.590
just a me,
I can't lay off this shit.
It's so fucking funny that like,

440
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.650
you're literally watching women's reaction to abuse of power and now they have

441
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:56.130
power and they instantly start abusing it.
Maybe it's just,

442
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.120
it's just completely going off the fucking rails here.
Um,

443
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.500
and most people,
male and female understand that.

444
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.530
But all of us are too afraid to tweet or say fucking anything because then like,

445
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:12.360
cause then you have to literally apologize.

446
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.460
I watched somebody in my business have to go on an apology tour for literally

447
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:22.190
having an opinion.
He was an innocent man who hadn't done anything fucking wrong.

448
00:27:22.191 --> 00:27:27.191
He just had an opinion and he had to go out and apologize for having pinion.

449
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.140
Yeah.
And I have an opinion.

450
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.140
You person with a penis and we'll have things you'll want to talk about.

451
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.310
All right.
Felix Gray,
everybody.
Yeah.

452
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.100
The average American blast,

453
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.120
their eyes with bright screens for 11 hours every day.
Oh yeah.

454
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:52.480
They get go live in the dream,
right.
Staring at a fucking computer.
Um,

455
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.000
now you can protect your eyes with a pair of Felix gray glasses available with

456
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:58.940
or without a prescription.
I haven't pair of these.

457
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.140
I have a pair of these fucking things and I can tell you they are,
if you,

458
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.710
if you're looking at a computer for a long fucking time and you don't want your

459
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:11.450
eyes to be doing that little jumping around thing,
this is the solution.

460
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.010
Felix gray glasses filter out 90% of high energy,

461
00:28:16.011 --> 00:28:19.910
blue light and eliminate the glare coming off all of those screens.

462
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.860
That means no more tire,
dry eyes,
blurry vision or headaches.

463
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.180
Usually it seems like a hassle to have to protect your eyes and that's why most

464
00:28:29.181 --> 00:28:30.020
of us don't do it.

465
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.760
But Felix gray glasses aren't like those weird computer glasses.

466
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.990
Um,
you've seen before.
There's no yellow Lens Tint.

467
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.480
I don't even know what the other ones look like.

468
00:28:41.481 --> 00:28:46.481
Felix gray glasses are handcrafted from premium Italian acetate,

469
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.290
Acetate Acetate,
so they won't make you look nerdy.

470
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.820
Acetate is the new fucking,
I dunno,
raw material,
whatever that is.

471
00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.300
Is that buried in limestone in shale?
In fact,

472
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.890
throwing on some fee,
Felix Graze is an easy way to look.

473
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.660
Oh,
pretty put together.
Oh,

474
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:09.570
this stylish is what the Saint Felix Gray glasses are available in non

475
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:14.070
prescription prescription and readers with free shipping and free returns.

476
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.460
There's nothing to lose.
Don't go another day.

477
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.690
Looking at screens without the help of Felix Graze.

483
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.660
Hi Felix Gray glasses.com/burb oh,

484
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.480
butcher box stowed.
Fucking get some meat kit.

485
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:50.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

486
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.790
<v 1>Do you see those two fucking Boston guys who claimed that they have the</v>

487
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:58.390
divisional red socks?
Whatever.
A banner.

488
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.000
I Dunno what's,
they either stole that fucking thing or that things fake.

489
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.500
Those things do not just fly off a fucking stadium.
I love how they were like,

490
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:09.334
you know,

491
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.580
then whole thing sounded like they act like they will get these good guys,

492
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:16.300
but the whole thing was like a ransom.
Like they had the fucking Lindbergh baby.

493
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.760
Hey,
if you ever worn a fucking shade is ding again.
Now,

494
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.320
then even ask for regular season tickets.
They asked for playoff fucking tickets.

495
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.330
Um,
all right,
put your box.
Do couple of shady characters,

496
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.110
but your box delivers healthy 100% grass fed,

497
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:36.970
grass finished beef free range,
organic chicken and heritage bread,
pork.
Oh,

498
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:39.340
the greatest fucking fucking animal you'll ever eat

499
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.400
<v 2>is a blue blood.
I don't want to be fucking racist here against other pigs.</v>

500
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.930
I don't want to be in the pigs.
A Ku Klux Klan.
And by the way,

501
00:30:48.931 --> 00:30:52.530
it is cool.
It's not cool.
I always thought was Klu Klux Klan,
Ku Klux Klan.

502
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.870
Um,
I don't want to be like the Grand Dragon.

503
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.890
It starts saying separate but equal when it comes to pigs.

504
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.700
But there really is nothing like a heritage breed pork.
All right.

505
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.330
It also,
it did come from Europe,

506
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.710
so this is sounding more fucking pig racist as I go.

507
00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:17.120
But I mean it's unbelievable.
If you haven't been listening to the podcast,

508
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.900
the heritage bread,
pork,
they can drastically traced the bloodline of a pig.

509
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.370
There's actually people out there that do that.
Okay.
Okay.

510
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.400
<v 5>What if the woman Yay</v>

511
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.640
<v 1>fucking shit on it.
Um,</v>

512
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.140
<v 2>they traced the bloodline
of uh,</v>

513
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.450
these God damn pigs,
purebred pigs,

514
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.460
all the way back to the original pigs.

515
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.390
They came across the fucking Atlantic.

516
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.590
I don't know if they came across with Christopher Columbus.

517
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.740
I Dunno if it was with the Nina,
the Pinta.
And the Santa Maria.
Okay.

518
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.970
It wouldn't surprise me today if some feminist group actually claimed that a

519
00:32:02.971 --> 00:32:04.500
woman's sailed first.

520
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

521
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.600
<v 2>And,
and that nature in wind in general is,</v>

522
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.470
it's much harder for a woman to sail than for a man.

523
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.570
I don't know what happened,

524
00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:20.571
but these fucking pigs came over here and evidently there was so god damn

525
00:32:21.271 --> 00:32:21.900
delicious,

526
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.250
they did not let these pigs breed with the pigs that were already here.

527
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.260
I Dunno what.
So whatever fucking reason,
these things,
these are like,

528
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:36.500
you know,
these are pure bred,
these,
they're like the,

529
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.340
like the royal family of Pigs,
you know what I mean?
So

530
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.310
<v 1>they have this amazing bloodline,
but also there's a lot of</v>

531
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.550
<v 2>breeding,
you know,</v>

532
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.340
<v 1>so that probably a little crazy.
But the thing is,
is when you get the pork chop,</v>

533
00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:51.570
it's dead so it can't get you.

534
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.010
So I recommend eating these pigs do not have them as pets.

535
00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.660
Okay.
Back to the copy.

536
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.990
The incredible quality of butcher box meets stats with a commitment to raising

537
00:33:04.301 --> 00:33:09.301
animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones before they murdered them.

538
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.740
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

539
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.010
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

540
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.440
Unless you're a fat fuck or a competitive eater,

541
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.390
you can choose from five different box types.
All beef,
beef and chicken,

542
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.620
beef and pork mixed box.
All right.

543
00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.820
I wonder if they let the pure bred go in there.
Mixed Ball.

544
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.630
You should not be mixing to make rat.

545
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.870
God made pork and he made B and they're meant to be chef,
right?

546
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.000
Earl,
will you lock the cross?
All right.
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

547
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.470
Personal experience.

548
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:56.471
I already told you it's the best God damn porkchop I ever had ever except for

549
00:33:56.871 --> 00:33:59.900
one restaurant.
And that was like some chef that was on TV,

550
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.330
but I made a pork chop that would actually make,

551
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:05.390
I would say would make that chef raised his eyebrow.
Like,
Hey,

552
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.150
that's not even close to what I made,
but I know you're proud of it.
Oh,

553
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.910
taking my nights and I'm going home for $20 off your first box in two pounds of

554
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:18.690
free ground beef and every box for the life of your subscription.
Um,

555
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.540
that's $20 off your first box and two pounds of free meat a month.
And for P,

556
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.940
that's a lot of fucking meat.

557
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.480
And for people who already are butcher box subscribers,

558
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:32.960
you'll have a special deal on ground beef you can take advantage of by law

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:47.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

564
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:50.660
<v 1>There's nobody on the planet like you.</v>

565
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:58.010
<v 2>You're age 23 to 38.
You're a millennial.</v>

566
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.220
Why should you just have a standard bed like generation y,

567
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.500
generation x baby boomers,
the greatest generation,

568
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.490
the lost generation,
the knickers generation.

569
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:20.300
Um,
I said knickers,
by the way,
as in pants before I get in trouble.

570
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.390
<v 1>Like sleep everybody.
There's nobody on the planet like you.</v>

571
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.860
So why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else?

572
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.280
Please mention the talking points below.
Of course I will.

573
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.810
He likes sleep hallux matches your body to the mattress so you get the best

574
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:43.860
sleep of your life.
It doesn't matter if you have back fat,
if you have man tits,

575
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.580
if you have a crooked nose.
Okay.
I,

576
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:51.840
I'm guessing they pour you into some sort of a mold or the love of the mattress

577
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:56.190
molds to you.
It's like the dental impressions I used to take back in the day,

578
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.380
except it's the mattress version.

579
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.420
They've developed nine different mattresses tailored to specific body types and

580
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:04.380
sleep preferences.

581
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.480
So evidently there's nobody like you till you get to that 10th person,

582
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.660
but it's still pretty cool though.
You know,
just go to the Helix,

583
00:36:18.661 --> 00:36:23.520
sleeping alex.com/bird take their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll match you

584
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:25.080
to them as fucking hilarious,

585
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.490
which ways it hang and bloody and they'll match you to a mattress that's perfect

586
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:29.940
for you,

587
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.650
contouring to your body to provide unprecedented comfort and better sleep.

588
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.790
Do you have cankles?
How would you describe your ass if it was a balloon?

589
00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:43.240
Is it losing air?
Does it not have it?
Did somebody step on it?

590
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.650
36% of Helix sleep customers report better sleep after switching to their

591
00:36:47.651 --> 00:36:49.810
customized mattress from helix sleep.

592
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:54.190
Right now they're offering up to $125 off all mattress orders.

593
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.540
Whether you're aside
a hot sleeper,

594
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.520
Jesus Christ,

595
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.490
whether you're a thrasher,
whether you're trying to kick,

596
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.510
kick smack,
whatever you got,
man,
like a plush toy,

597
00:37:11.511 --> 00:37:13.640
like a plush or affirm bread bed,

598
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.520
they've got the mattress that will fit just right.

599
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.030
If you've got a body buried in the back yard,
you know,
I don't know.

600
00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:23.330
You're fucking thinking.
No.
The tell tale heart,
they got that mattress for you.

601
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:28.340
Get up to $125 off Felix,
sleep.com/bar hallux.
That's helix.

602
00:37:28.341 --> 00:37:32.270
How it's he likes sleep.com/per $425 off your mattress order.

603
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.930
He likes sleep.com/burr hallux.
All right,

604
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.070
I believe that's all I have to read.

605
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.040
Um,

606
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.690
oh,
okay.
I read,
I can't read all the right ones.
Okay,
there you go.

607
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.860
And I want to just tell,

608
00:37:50.861 --> 00:37:54.340
I just want to thank all the brave women out there who are podcasting.

609
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:59.020
I know it's so much more difficult for you to turn on the power button than it

610
00:37:59.021 --> 00:37:59.890
is for a man.

611
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.630
And I'm really looking at myself right now and I'm reflecting on the,

612
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.840
the privilege that I've enjoyed as a podcaster simply because of my genitalia.

613
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:12.400
Um,

614
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.400
today I will go out into the world knowing that and adjusting my behavior

615
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.880
accordingly.
Women,

616
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:25.170
you have no work to do when it comes to how you treat men just can just stay the

617
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:27.870
fucking course and uh,

618
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.070
keep telling everybody how difficult you fucking lives are when there's like,

619
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:36.040
what,
like six holidays a year.
That is specifically people how late they

620
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.840
<v 2>hype mother's Day versus Father's Day.</v>

621
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.750
<v 1>You know,
there's all kinds of flowers canny get and show your much,</v>

622
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.440
am I right?

623
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.750
<v 2>Father's Day,
your dad,
he's going to die first.
You know what I mean?</v>

624
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:53.740
So this should be more of a sense of urgency.
Wouldn't you think that?
No.
Yeah.

625
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:56.960
Get him a fucking tie.
What's,

626
00:38:56.961 --> 00:38:59.570
he can fucking hang himself while he's jerking off in the closet.

627
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.790
<v 1>All right.
That's,
that's the podcast.</v>

628
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.170
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

629
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.580
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

630
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.880
<v 2>got to make sure I said ladies first,
because they have,
it's so much harder.</v>

631
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.330
Everything,
you know,
just,
just them breathing.
You know,

632
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.250
air is more difficult on female lungs.
Um,
and it's been proven.

633
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.340
Um,
please enjoy this music

634
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.680
<v 1>and then we're going to do a little,
uh,
what do you call it?</v>

635
00:39:25.681 --> 00:39:28.680
They're a little fucking,
a little throwback to the,
uh,

636
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.280
to the blow back there to the law.

637
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.200
It's a Thursday afternoon podcast and it will be an extra half an hour of

638
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:38.010
greatest hits Thursday afternoon,
just before Monday,
just for Friday.

639
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.830
Monday morning podcast.
That's what it's all right.
Have a wonderful weekend.

640
00:39:40.831 --> 00:39:45.150
You can't,
and go fuck yourselves and I'll,
uh,
talk to you on Monday.

641
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.190
<v 7>Wait,
he's trying to,
you know,
I know it's going to be a tough weekend for you.</v>

642
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.990
You know,
my weekend's going to be way easier to just,
you know,

643
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.020
try to keep your head,
try to keep your heads up.

644
00:39:55.060 --> 00:40:00.060
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.070
<v 2>right on the bat.
This sounds fucking creepy to me.
Video Doorbell.</v>

646
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.110
Uh,
we'll insert dinging sound.
What does that mean?

647
00:40:56.111 --> 00:41:00.620
I was supposed to fucking insert ding.
Dongs all right,
let's do it again.
Uh,

648
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.800
I can do this.
Here we go.
Doorbell

649
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.920
sound.

650
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:15.290
This is like Donald Trump announcing he's running for president doorbells.

651
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:16.124
Sound effect.

652
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.970
<v 6>Okay.</v>

653
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.400
<v 2>Did you meet doorbell?
All one word.
Of course I did.</v>

654
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.503
<v 6>Okay.</v>

655
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.530
<v 2>Let's see if I can do this correctly.
All right.</v>

656
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.680
<v 1>Hey everybody.
Video Doorbell.
Let's do that again.</v>

657
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.640
Oh,
I'm at an all of layers to the podcast

658
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.320
<v 2>here.
Hang on a second.
It's got a fucking,
uh,
it's got reload here.</v>

659
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.480
Hey everybody.
I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about it.

660
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.870
Video Doorbell.
What is really odd?
I was the shit video doorbell.

661
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.980
This is the sound of a package being delivered or friends coming over for
dinner,

662
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.910
but it's also the sound of summing plant.
Someone planning to rob you,

663
00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:02.650
blind Jesus Christ.
That took a left turn.
Then it over 90,

664
00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:07.651
95% of home break ins happened during the day and I write the way.

665
00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:12.400
Is it?
What's going on here?
Oh,

666
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.570
I think I'm stuck in one of those youtube loops where they just keep playing the

667
00:42:15.571 --> 00:42:18.840
fucking the doorbell.
Well,
I think it works with the copy.

668
00:42:18.841 --> 00:42:20.520
I'm going to keep it anyways.

669
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.600
And burglars always almost always start by ringing the doorbell to see if

670
00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:26.850
someone's home before pillaging your possession.

671
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.540
I guess that's a fancier doorbell.
Oh,

672
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.510
I like this music too with ring video doorbell.

673
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.090
You can see and talk to anyone

674
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.740
from anywhere in the world using your smartphone.
Hi,

675
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.580
I'm bill her.
What's happening?
Is this a DJ party?

676
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.633
<v 6>MMM.</v>

677
00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:00.800
<v 2>Okay.
I think we're having a fire alert here.
Okay.</v>

678
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.210
Back to the copy rings.
Advanced motion detection alerts you,

679
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:11.790
even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell,
it's like a caller id for your home.

680
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:12.811
You know,

681
00:43:12.811 --> 00:43:17.010
millions of people suffer every year and they don't have a video doorbell.

682
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.850
Please share a personal story how this could help you or someone you love.
Hey,

683
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.520
will you share a pocket personal story?
It isn't enough.
I'm reading your copy.

684
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.090
I don't know anybody who has a video fucking doorbell.

685
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:34.080
How does that work for you and your story?
You'll get another one.

686
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.893
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:43.410
It's sealing ring takes minutes and it works with either your current wiring or

688
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.410
built in rechargeable battery.

689
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.640
Put your mind at ease and protect your home and your Perry keyed with the video

690
00:43:53.341 --> 00:43:58.341
doorbell Time magazine named one of the top 10 gadgets of 2014 Sharon and

691
00:44:00.031 --> 00:44:04.290
Kilmore porpoises cause eventually you'd have to throw out the wires and they

692
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:05.400
will end up in the ocean.

693
00:44:05.401 --> 00:44:10.401
But right now my listeners get the ring video doorbell for only $174.

694
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.280
That's $25 off the normal price.
Still kind of expensive though.
You know

695
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.930
your fucking house comes with the doorbell already attached.

696
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.870
He's still making payments.
Anyways,

697
00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:30.170
go to ring.com/burnout protect your home and@peaceofmindwithgotoring.com slash

698
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:37.020
square for $25 off.
Once again,

699
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:40.900
it's [inaudible] dot com slash book

700
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.410
<v 6>okay.</v>

701
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.740
<v 2>Oh and he fades off the music.
Jesus Christ.
That could be a DJ,</v>

702
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.020
but a fucking mouse had on me and see what happens.

703
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.430
I'll tell you what will happen,
Huh?
Bunch of drugs will be taken.
Um,

704
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.600
how much can I freak out people that one of those Raves,

705
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.730
if you just had the DJ and he's clean,
all this mellow shit,

706
00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:01.564
then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

707
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.710
I just started coming out with a mouse head screaming cunt over and over again.

708
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:07.310
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

709
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.530
<v 2>I would love to have an overhead shot of that.
You know,</v>

710
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.770
maybe use one of those drones and just watching him all scatter like fucking

711
00:45:12.771 --> 00:45:16.860
roaches all across the desert.
Stepping on sidewinders

712
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:23.190
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

713
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.910
<v 9>going on.
It's Belper,
right?
It is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

714
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:56.460
September 20th,

715
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.190
2010 and I am doing this really late.
I apologize everybody a head,

716
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:04.740
a Baru till day.
I had a brutal Dan.

717
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.440
It had nothing to do with my patriots getting their fucking asses.

718
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:10.770
Hand a tool by the Goddamn jets.
Congratulations.

719
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:15.210
All you green countries out there in the metal lands.
Stick your chest out.

720
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:18.930
I'm sure you're happy.
I'm sure you're proud.
You know,

721
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.820
you know what sucks about it is the jets game the week before the one that I

722
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:28.821
predicted that I was fucking dead on right about that the ravens were going to

723
00:46:28.981 --> 00:46:31.500
win,
happened on a Monday night.

724
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.840
I had already recorded my podcast so I didn't get to talk Shit and pat myself on

725
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:38.940
the fucking back about it.

726
00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:43.941
By the time I did the jets bounce back and a kick the shit out of the Patriots

727
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.110
and a,
I will say this about it.

728
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:50.280
I actually recorded a podcast yesterday before the jets game cause I wanted to

729
00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:54.960
talk shit about it and give my prediction.
But um,

730
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.520
I actually ended up being dead on in my own way,

731
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:01.560
but I didn't think anybody was really going to believe it.

732
00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:04.130
But then some of them reminded me that I actually did call.

733
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.240
I said take the jets and the points.
I did a thing on the versus network,
uh,

734
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:13.740
this past week and I trashed the jets as I always do because uh,

735
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:17.130
I'm from Boston and I fucking hate the New York teams.
I respect your city.

736
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.350
It's lovely,
especially in the fall,

737
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.350
walking through central park with the leaves crunching under your shoes.

738
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:27.480
Who doesn't like to do that?
Wonderful,
wonderful museums.
You know,

739
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.370
a rare good slice of pizza.

740
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.960
I will tell you that only because New York is known for its pizza that uh,

741
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:40.020
so many fucking assholes who can't make pizza have sprung up and they all say

742
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:44.260
that they're famous.
I've said this shit before.
Just start to,
you know,

743
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.870
any New Yorkers want to tell the tourists where to go.

744
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:51.250
Cause I got no huge argument about some fucking brought Eaton cunt from Chicago

745
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:56.080
who said New York pizza sucks.
I mean granted he enjoys their Lasagna,

746
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.600
whatever the fuck they call their pizza out there.
And if you're from Chicago,

747
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:05.080
tell me where to get the good deep dish because the shit I get out there,

748
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.070
it's like even if you get the personal sized one,

749
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:13.570
it's like you feel like you ate a birthday cake made out of spaghetti sauce,

750
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:15.490
but by the time you're done with it,

751
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.380
it's that level of full where you want to kill yourself and it doesn't really

752
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:21.430
taste that good.

753
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.540
But I know there's no way that there's not a great spot in Chicago.

754
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:30.490
So Chicago and New York have your pizza war.
Tell me where to go.
But anyways,

755
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.860
um,
this is what I felt about the game was basically my heart.

756
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:37.060
I have to go with the Patriots,

757
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:41.920
but I just had that bad failing cause I have this theory on divisional rivalries

758
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:44.230
is that they never go the way they go.

759
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:46.630
If I could remember the name of the God damn show I was on,

760
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.400
on the versus network,

761
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.730
that's really bad too because I had a great time and they will like,
yeah,

762
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:52.870
come back anytime.

763
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:55.660
I can't remember the name of the fucking show cause that's how I operate.

764
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:01.290
I go in there totally in just go in and fucking kill mode.

765
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.810
That,
so to the point that I don't even fucking,

766
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.330
I remembered the channel that's new for me.

767
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:11.500
I just did a fuck load of media and it had something had something me the line

768
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:15.670
in it.
I can't remember what the fourth at Nightline.

769
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.280
I know it wasn't that,
but uh,

770
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:22.840
I was actually right two fucking weeks in a row.
That's what's killing me now.

771
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:25.360
This is not me break down the game.
This is what,
uh,

772
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.450
this is what I didn't like was the,
uh,

773
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:32.260
the Patriots' defense took a big step backwards and they look like the hapless

774
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.790
crew from last fucking year.

775
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:39.090
But I'm also smart enough to realize that week two does not define a fucking

776
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:44.050
season.
But,
uh,
I gotta be honest.
Uh,
I don't know.
I was like it Hernandez,

777
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:44.950
that guy look great.

778
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.060
And I think Tom Brady was being really generous when he said that,
uh,

779
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.340
we couldn't do anything right in the second half.
It's like,
dude,

780
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:54.670
how about after the first quarter?
I mean,

781
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:57.370
I guess we went down and we went up 14 fucking seven,

782
00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:00.700
but then they march right back down the field.
But anyways,

783
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.360
hopefully I am,

784
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:07.780
I am converting some people to my way of looking at sports,

785
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.190
which is last week doesn't mean shit.

786
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:13.361
I mean,

787
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:18.361
you gotta you gotta like do like whatever the jets did either being anemic or

788
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:21.910
kicking the shit out of somebody.
You gotta do it like three,

789
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:25.660
four weeks in a row before you can get excited.
You know,

790
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.260
but I mean you just watched these analysts on TV and it's like whatever somebody

791
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:33.860
just did is who the fuck they are.
And uh,

792
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:37.670
did I say it last week on the podcast,
how the paths that led up 350 yards,

793
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:42.170
150 fucking yards to old say I didn't like those numbers.

794
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.390
I did not like those numbers,
but I still,

795
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.710
I thought it was going to be one of those cunty 19 to 17 games.

796
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:52.850
And I thought in the end I was praying that we were going to come out and get a

797
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:56.090
victory,
but I did not,
I did not think that we were going to get,

798
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.170
we were going to get pounded and we got,

799
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:03.020
we got pounded in a very light way.

800
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.830
I don't remember any sort of big hit other than the big hit in the end for the

801
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:09.140
fumble.
But it was just sort of,

802
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:12.890
I just felt like we were in a prevent defense from the second quarter.
Ron,

803
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:18.830
you know,
ah,
just,
you know,
you deal with that zone.
Let people go.

804
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.950
And I have to admit that fucking Revus guy really pissed me off when he got

805
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:29.990
burned for a touchdown and then grabs his Hami.
Can I do that from now on?

806
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.550
When I fuck up in life,

807
00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.410
I'm sitting there talking all kinds of shit and I'm killing for 20 minutes with

808
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:40.310
jokes.
And then I tell one that bombs and then I just,

809
00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:42.830
I started grabbing my hamstring and I fucking,
you know,

810
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:44.930
lay down and have somebody stretch it out.

811
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.730
That was a really fucking bitch move.
And I don't buy it.

812
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.070
I don't buy the whole goddamn story.

813
00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.130
I don't like how before the game even started,

814
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.720
Reavis already had a fucking excuse.
I think he was scared from the week before.

815
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.730
Not that he's bad,
the guy's the shit.

816
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:06.731
But I think he was out of shape and he was worried that a Randy Moss was going

817
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:10.760
to run all over his island.
That's so fucking gave Reavis island,

818
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.810
you know,
who would ever go there.

819
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.500
But you're fucking guys standing around squatting down

820
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:24.020
and that quarterback fucking position,
you know,

821
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.790
I dunno.
Speaking of that,
speaking a gay,

822
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.640
here's an email I got recently from a gay guy,
a,
believe it or not,

823
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.040
I have,
I have all kinds of fans on this.

824
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:41.210
You wouldn't know this from some of those fucking assholes up in Seattle who

825
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:45.140
branded me a homophobe because they listened to the first half of the way you

826
00:52:45.141 --> 00:52:50.141
were fig bit and stomped off like the fucking pansies that they were.

827
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:56.330
Here's a guy right here.
All right.
Said bill watched.

828
00:52:56.331 --> 00:53:01.280
Let it go last night.
Uh,
and it was fantastic.
Congratulations.

829
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.980
Uh,
that's hilarious.
Um,
no,

830
00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:07.830
you know what's hilarious was I was thinking let it go as my last special and

831
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.060
why the hell did in my head,
I immediately pictured my,
uh,

832
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.630
why do I do this anyway?
So I'm an idiot.
Let me start over.
Watch,

833
00:53:14.631 --> 00:53:17.330
let it go last night.
It was fantastic.
Congratulations.

834
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.180
It was kind of cool to hear some of the things you had talked about in the

835
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:22.610
podcast turns into developed bits.

836
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:26.790
I was wondering if you brought stuff from the stage to podcast or is it vice

837
00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:29.070
versa?
Do you use the podcast to develop bits?

838
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.340
I was also wondering how much input,
uh,

839
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.380
you are other comics have on editing on the editing of your specials.

840
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.310
I've noticed that your recent special is lit differently.

841
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.790
Better in my opinion than many comedy central specials.

842
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:48.960
The audience is dark and there is a nice spotlight on you instead of the whole

843
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:52.200
stage being lit.
How did you get that deal?
Also,

844
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:55.530
the commercial breaks seem to come at strange places.

845
00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:00.150
Did you get to decide where they went?
Sorry for all the questions.

846
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:02.940
Bottom line is the special.
It was amazing.

847
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:07.500
The podcast is great and I'm a huge fan.
Well thank you very much.
Then he said,

848
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.560
ps,
you look great and better and better as you age.

849
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.420
Does that seem gay for one man to say to another?
Well guess what bill?
I am gay.

850
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:20.400
Deal with it.
Ah,
that's fucking awesome.
All right,

851
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.990
great questions.
They are twinkle toes.
All right.

852
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.800
What do we got here?
The first one he asked,
he said a watch,
let it go.

853
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:30.660
Less than it was fitted into the,
Oh,

854
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:35.690
you're wondering if do I take stuff from the podcasts and take it to the stage

855
00:54:36.271 --> 00:54:38.850
and vice versa?
Uh,
there's a little bit of both,

856
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:42.210
but definitely more podcasts to the stage.

857
00:54:42.211 --> 00:54:47.211
I try not to burn bits on the podcast where it's like if I actually did a bit

858
00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:53.130
from my act,
then you come and see me.
It's already kind of a finished thing,

859
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:54.990
then I would feel like I was fucking you over.

860
00:54:55.170 --> 00:55:00.170
But there's definitely times when I riff on stuff that a little light goes off

861
00:55:00.391 --> 00:55:03.000
on my head and I'm like,
you know what,
that's really funny.

862
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.390
And I think that I could take that somewhere.
But even then,

863
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:09.300
even if you heard it on the podcast,
it,
it,

864
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.840
I don't say it the way it's set on the podcast,
it like continues,

865
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:14.303
you know what I mean?

866
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:20.050
Kind of like when Stevie Ray Vaughn did his cover of a say what Jimmy Hendricks,

867
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:24.270
which was,
wasn't that like two things,
splice tape together?

868
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.830
I can't remember.
What does that rainy day?
I can't remember.
He did,

869
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:32.250
he did a cover up and he just sort of took the beginning riff.

870
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.740
That's right.
Yeah.

871
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:38.280
He took the beginning ref for that and then he just sort of fleshed out the

872
00:55:38.281 --> 00:55:42.360
middle and added his whole type of shit to it.
So I tried to do that with like,

873
00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:45.420
did I just bring up Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimmy Hendricks?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

874
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.810
My fucking Egos really pumped up with all the great emails you guys sent me

875
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:54.090
about my special last night.
But yes,
to answer your question,
um,

876
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.240
occasionally shit like that does go to the stage,

877
00:55:57.241 --> 00:55:59.670
but I'm really sensitive about that because I don't like people,

878
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.580
I wouldn't want someone to come to me and be like,
dude,
it was,

879
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.490
it was everything he said on the,
as I,
you know,

880
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.730
I don't mind if somebody comes up and says like,
yeah,

881
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:10.720
that was something I heard in the podcast and then you,

882
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.040
you took it in this other area.
Like,
listen,

883
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:17.120
I'm just fucking meandering right now.
You can't do that on a standup states.

884
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:21.600
People will be throwing like fucking potato skins at me.
So,
um,

885
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.750
that's the deal.
And if I ever do an old debt from my act,
I actually just say it.

886
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:30.010
This is a bit I used to do and I usually do an abridged version.
So there we go.

887
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.960
All right,
next one.
Uh,
I was also wondering how much input you had,
uh,

888
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.930
on the editing of your specials.
Um,

889
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.960
that's a huge thing that I have input on and from why do I do this and let it go

890
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.840
is there is a specific look that I want and as specific vibe that I am looking

891
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.600
for and that,

892
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:57.601
and it's very important to me and I think it's even more important than the

893
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:02.620
fucking material if you can believe it just because I have seen some

894
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:07.621
unbelievable comedians with shitty production and it knocks down the level of

895
00:57:11.201 --> 00:57:15.400
your performance and that sucks because it's not your fault.

896
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.060
So you really have to like,

897
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:23.140
I've learned that just through like the,
the few TV movie things that I've done,

898
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.910
like as far as editing,
lighting,
all those fucking guys,
the sound,

899
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.730
all of those guys,
director,
all of those guys,

900
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.200
it's like they can take a mediocre performance and make it look fucking

901
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:37.210
unbelievable and they can take an,
um,

902
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.740
an amazing performance and make it look like cannonball run part two if they

903
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:45.700
don't know what the fuck they're doing.
So,
uh,
so there you go.

904
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:51.060
There's my big shout out to art and industry who's done my last two specials and

905
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:55.440
we'll continue doing my specials cause they do a great fucking job.
Uh,

906
00:57:55.450 --> 00:58:00.450
I basically tell them exactly what I'm looking for and I always come at him with

907
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:04.540
shit that has nothing to do with comedy.
They'll just be like,

908
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:05.950
what do you want it to look like?
I'm like,

909
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:10.540
you ever see the magnificent seven when they're fucking sitting there eating

910
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:15.040
those Rancharrah Huevos whatever the fuck you say it.
Um,

911
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:19.930
I come at them like that.
Um,
so there you go.
Great.

912
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:24.550
Kept great question right out of the God damn gate.
Um,
but anyways,

913
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:28.960
let's continue on.
Uh,
talking a little football here.

914
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.160
Um,
how about those fucking bears?
Huh?

915
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:37.300
I didn't know that Mike Martz is,
uh,

916
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:39.640
is their offensive coordinator.

917
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:43.900
They all of a sudden overnight got a little scary and like I said,

918
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.360
I'm not judging them on two weeks.

919
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:49.300
I mean they basically lost to the fucking lines and then we're given that

920
00:58:49.301 --> 00:58:53.980
victory.
My apology to lions fans last week cause I was going like,

921
00:58:53.981 --> 00:58:55.510
look at you guys,
you're playing competitive.

922
00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:59.380
I had not seen the highlight of how you got fucked out of that game.
Um,

923
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.310
but like that is a devastating combination cause Mike Martz is,

924
00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:09.220
is like right in his fucking wheel wheel house.
You know what I mean?

925
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.590
It's like how Deniro was doing comedy and meet the parents and all that shit.

926
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:19.000
But all of a sudden if,
if they go back to doing the good fellas shit,
he's right.

927
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:21.870
He's debts.
He's fucking in it.

928
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.913
<v 1>So,</v>

929
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.370
<v 3>okay.</v>

930
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:26.740
<v 9>I Dunno man.
That's,
that's,
that's the big thing.</v>

931
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.430
You got to have all the fucking pieces you get out of the ownership.

932
00:59:30.431 --> 00:59:33.700
You have to have the coaches and you have to have the players.
It's like,

933
00:59:33.701 --> 00:59:37.960
what that fucking Matt Cassel I remember by my buddy of mine was giving me Shit

934
00:59:37.961 --> 00:59:41.320
when we traded him for a first round fucking draft pick or whatever to the

935
00:59:41.321 --> 00:59:43.690
chiefs and he was like,
dude,
I mean the guy looked at him.

936
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.990
He went 11 and five and then all those fucking pieces,

937
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:50.950
all those people who are trying to give Brady Shit because Brady was hurting

938
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:56.060
<v 1>yet the Patriots win 11 and five typical fantasy football,</v>

939
00:59:56.231 --> 00:59:57.490
fucking morons.

940
00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:02.200
They don't realize that Mac castle was driving a Lamborghini that year.

941
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.360
He was driving a team throughout the regular season that went 16 and older when

942
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.220
every fucking game and what did he,

943
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.360
he managed the fucking game and gave us five less fucking victories,

944
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.210
but then people's heads and like 11 and five man,

945
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.610
<v 3>okay,</v>

946
01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:22.380
<v 1>that's fucking nuts.
If he goes to Kansas City and does what it does,
what</v>

947
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:29.190
drives that fucking 1972 eco liner that is the Kansas City chiefs.

948
01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:34.120
Now all of a sudden,
right?
You're fucking need a fuel pump.

949
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.910
That timing belt snaps and right there,

950
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.550
Matt Cassel looks like he should be holding a fucking clipboard again.

951
01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:43.480
Is it his fault?
I don't fucking think so.
But you got to have everybody.

952
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:48.490
So that's my point.
Dot.
The fucking Chicago bears haven't,

953
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.740
what's his face,
Mike?
March.
Whenever the hell his God damn name is.

954
01:00:53.741 --> 01:00:54.910
I can't even think at this point.

955
01:00:54.911 --> 01:00:59.110
I'm so sick of fucking talking after a week of press last week.
Um,

956
01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:00.370
<v 3>okay.</v>

957
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:04.060
<v 9>Having those two guys is huge,
is fucking huge.</v>

958
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:07.510
And all of a sudden Jay Cutler looks like a good Goddamn quarterback,
doesn't he?

959
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:08.883
Doesn't he?

960
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:13.180
<v 1>So with that,
how about some predictions?
I got to talk shit early.</v>

961
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.710
Paths are playing again next Sunday.
Which Patriot team is going to show up,

962
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.730
you know,
according to him,
according to my stats,

963
01:01:21.731 --> 01:01:24.820
the exact same fucking defense showed up both fucking weeks.

964
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.200
God dammit.
Our defense stinks.

965
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:33.130
We're not going to win shit without,
you know,
something that's actually a

966
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.390
<v 9>great,
uh,
uh,</v>

967
01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.400
I think it because I never felt like the patriots players ever got their fucking

968
01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:41.130
do when we were winning those championships.
Dad,

969
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.860
you're a mediocre team with no superstars.
Now all of a sudden I have to,
I don't.

970
01:01:44.861 --> 01:01:48.220
You look at Teddy Bruschi and [inaudible] and all those guys in a different

971
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:49.054
light.

972
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:50.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

973
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.650
<v 9>Maybe you don't,
I don't fucking know.
What do we got?
Let me talk one thing.</v>

974
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.210
New Orleans at San Francisco,
there's another divisional rivalry game.

975
01:01:58.211 --> 01:02:01.120
I don't like it.
Everybody's saying New Orleans is going to run all over them.

976
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.463
I don't like it.

977
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.790
I think it's going to be closer than that just because they were in the same

978
01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:09.970
fucking division.
Those games are always cunty.
All right.

979
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:16.230
<v 1>Week three buffalo at New England.
Ah,</v>

980
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.350
oh gee.
I want to say we're going to bounce back,

981
01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:23.380
<v 9>but I mean I don't,
fuck,
I don't fucking know it.
That defense.</v>

982
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.630
You know what it is about the pets.
We have no pass rush.
All right.

983
01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:33.860
Jet Fans before we get all excited about Sanchez sitting back at a fucking lazy

984
01:02:33.861 --> 01:02:36.950
boy in the pocket.
That son of a bitch can scramble though.
I will give you that.

985
01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:41.900
But who did the jet tab next week?
Who Do they get?
Who they get?

986
01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:46.620
Are you guys talking shit again?
Oh,
Jetson Miami.
Miami's gonna beat Ya man.

987
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:51.410
He's got a fucking insane defense.
You're going to go on the road.
All right.

988
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.250
I think.
What's his face?
Rex?
Ryan's going to poke his head out of the shelf.

989
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.950
He's gonna Start Talking Shit.
It's going to look at,

990
01:02:57.951 --> 01:03:01.070
get a little drunk and get sunburned.
Fall Asleep on the fucking beach.

991
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:06.500
He's going,
he's going to be miserable down there.
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

992
01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:07.640
But I'm telling you right now,

993
01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:11.870
they are fucking jet fans before your hoist a fireman up on your shoulder like

994
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:16.040
you're doing the village people fucking act,
uh,
don't sleep on Miami.

995
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.190
You don't like about Miami.

996
01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:22.550
Their coach looks like he's in the fucking witness protection program.

997
01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.040
The fuck is with that guy.

998
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.570
I watched that game and they kept cutting to him on the sidelines and I have no

999
01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:31.160
fucking idea what he looks like.

1000
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:36.190
He's got a baseball hat yanked down to his huge fucking Tony Curtis sunglasses.

1001
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:41.540
He's got that big,
uh,
who's that guy from the big Lebowski?

1002
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.800
Oh,
does the narration.
Whenever the guy from mask,
he's got one of those fucking,

1003
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:49.490
I own a Harley musty.
I have no fucking idea what he looks like.

1004
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.330
And then green bay in Chicago.
That's a great Monday.
And I came.
All right,

1005
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.330
I have to get back to the podcast here because I know a lot of people are,

1006
01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:01.130
are uh,
not sports fans.
So let me tell you about my week.

1007
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.500
Everybody.
Um,

1008
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:09.020
leading up to my special was I went to New York City and I did the open Anthony

1009
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.040
Program.
Wonderful Program.

1010
01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:15.070
If for some reason you live in a cave and you've never heard of it,
it's a,

1011
01:04:15.071 --> 01:04:20.030
a sort of a political show.
Um,
a lot of topics are discussed.
I'm actually,

1012
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.700
I obviously I'm fucking around.
It's over the top and I got to tell you,

1013
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:27.730
Jim Norton had the funniest God damn joke that I don't even think got the laugh

1014
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:30.590
it deserved.
It was so funny.

1015
01:04:30.591 --> 01:04:34.790
It actually made me a better person and I'm going to tell you why I was fucking

1016
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:41.050
opiate mentioned he was trying to sign something and he said that they wouldn't

1017
01:04:41.931 --> 01:04:43.970
let him sign it with like a pen to paper.

1018
01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:47.360
He had to do this virtual signing or whatever.
That's computer thing.

1019
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:52.570
So me being the shithead than I am immediately jump into a connecting the dots

1020
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:58.340
that this is this big conspiracy that they want to have this computer.
Um,

1021
01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.930
I dunno,
something like I can't see,
I'm so stupid.
I can't even see,

1022
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.260
I can't even say how the fuck am I trying to say here.
They basically,

1023
01:05:06.261 --> 01:05:09.920
then they have it,
they have basically your signature like on a stamp,

1024
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:13.430
but it's in like computer form and they go and that's for the Illuminati.

1025
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.000
And then later on five years,
if you don't like what they're doing,

1026
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.230
they'll just take out the Amaa

1027
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.000
<v 2>Nazi document and it just puts your computer signature right underneath it.</v>

1028
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.820
That's what they're going to do.
And then Jim just goes,

1029
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:27.490
or the Illuminati could just forge your signature.

1030
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.430
Uh,
I butchered it.
It was fucking great.
And it really just made me feel like,

1031
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:39.340
exactly,
Bill.
Exactly.
You know,

1032
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.550
why don't you just fucking relax if they're really that powerful,

1033
01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:46.600
do they really need to create schemes to that fucking level?

1034
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.530
And a,
I have to tell you,
I,

1035
01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:53.531
I must've thought about that line maybe 50 fucking times.

1036
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.840
I've just been walking around thinking my crazy thoughts and then that joke,

1037
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.390
his voice keeps popping in my head going,
oh,

1038
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.250
the Illuminati could just forge your signature.

1039
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:07.360
And it just makes me laugh at what a fucking ridiculous human being I am.
Um,

1040
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.730
so there you go.
Shout out out to

1041
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:12.010
<v 9>Jimmy Norton there.
Um,
but anyways,
so this is my week.</v>

1042
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:15.640
So I did the opening of the program.
I did,
uh,

1043
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:19.120
I did the versus network,
had a great time on that.

1044
01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:21.400
And hopefully we'll be doing more shit on that.

1045
01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:26.401
I also did a Nesson where I talked all kinds of shit about the jets.

1046
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:32.170
I had fun on that one cause that was just in Boston.
So I was able to,

1047
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.650
I didn't have to bleed the diplomatic on that one.
And a,

1048
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:41.530
when I left I did Pete Dominick show,
I did a Jim Breuer show.

1049
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.580
All those guys just Warren's thank say thank you to everybody who let me run my

1050
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:50.581
mouth and a hype my special and thanks to everybody who watched it and uh,

1051
01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.910
sent me all the great emails and everything.
And uh,
and with that,

1052
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.890
if you'd like to buy it,
go to amazon.com you can actually,
the presale I think,

1053
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:03.850
is it still the presale price?
I don't know.
It was like 13,
26.

1054
01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:08.740
Uh,
if you want to buy it for that cheap amount and then bring it to one of my

1055
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.190
shows,
I'll fucking sign it for you.
I don't give a shit.
Just go ahead and buy it.

1056
01:07:12.191 --> 01:07:16.900
And I would really appreciate it if you guys would go out and buy it because

1057
01:07:16.901 --> 01:07:17.860
believe it or not,

1058
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:22.810
it really does help me as a performer if you do things like that.

1059
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:23.320
And uh,

1060
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.030
one of the things I've noticed being a huge music fan is I go on,

1061
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.540
um,
I go on youtube and I'm always watching,

1062
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.890
you know,
like clips of bands and shit like that.

1063
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:39.580
And one of the things that people keep asking is they say,

1064
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:43.120
where is all the talent?
You know what I mean?

1065
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:46.300
Like where are the Beatles were the stones where,
where are the,
uh,

1066
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:49.150
the Marvin Gaye's where all these fucking people,

1067
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.910
and I have this theory,

1068
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:57.090
granted Jim Norton might take the fucking piss out of this one too with one of

1069
01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.170
his fucking life,
great lines,

1070
01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:04.171
but it's this same people asking these questions of the people not paying for

1071
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:09.490
music and a decade of trying to have your cake and eat it.

1072
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.400
Basically the music industry doesn't exist anymore.

1073
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:16.130
And for his dirty and filthy as those sons of bitches were,

1074
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:19.370
<v 2>there were just like,
there's good and bad comics.</v>

1075
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:22.580
Their word genius guys in that industry.

1076
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:27.581
And they knew they could spot talent and they knew how to develop it and nurture

1077
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:30.560
it before they put it out there and that type of stuff.

1078
01:08:30.561 --> 01:08:33.590
And then of course then they would steal from him.
Um,

1079
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.200
but like that system doesn't fucking exist anymore.
And,

1080
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:44.060
uh,
my business,
it's going the same route where TV,
film,

1081
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:48.530
Dvds and all those are not being paid for and,
uh,

1082
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.550
people are losing their jobs and that type of shit.

1083
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:56.450
So I dunno if you like comedy,
if you like good television,

1084
01:08:56.990 --> 01:09:00.200
I suggest trying to not saying don't watch reality shows.

1085
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:05.090
I would be fucking hypocrite right now cause I love the Jersey shore.

1086
01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:05.960
I really haven't watched season

1087
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:08.880
<v 9>into,
but I watched the Jersey shore,
but like,</v>

1088
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:14.310
I still try to watch scripted shows.
I pay for movies,
I don't steal movies.

1089
01:09:14.311 --> 01:09:18.900
I pay for all my fucking music.
And uh,
I dunno,

1090
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.280
if you don't give a fuck,
then just by all means go ahead and steal it.
But if,

1091
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:24.330
if you're one of those people

1092
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.690
<v 2>wondering where all the great bands are,
where the great writers are,</v>

1093
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.290
and they don't have have

1094
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:31.250
<v 9>jobs right now,</v>

1095
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.730
they don't because you can sit on a toilet and take a shit.

1096
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.890
Don't sit in on a toilet sitting on a toilet,

1097
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.990
sitting on the toilet.

1098
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:46.190
You can do that and you'll get for some reason a zillion fucking hits.
And,
uh,

1099
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.950
I dunno,
I don't even know what my fucking point is.
Just for the love of God.

1100
01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:52.160
Can you buy the Goddamn DVD?
All right.

1101
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.900
$13 26 cents so he can pick it up.
Fucking 20 bucks at one of my shows.

1102
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:59.840
I'll sign it for you.
Take a picture,
give you a Goddamn hug,

1103
01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.600
whatever the fuck you need.
But for Christ's sake,
can,

1104
01:10:02.601 --> 01:10:07.010
can you support my God damn career?
That's all I'm asking you.
All right,

1105
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:13.340
look,
I go on youtube too.
All right.
I'm just,
I'm not saying,
you know,

1106
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.630
I mean,
I go there,
I look at Shit and I'm looking at Shit for free.

1107
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.750
I realize that.
But the shit that I really like,
I do pay for it,

1108
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:24.410
but I pay for all my fucking music.
All right.

1109
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:25.933
God dammit.

1110
01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.170
You know what's funny is most of you are probably going to go out and buy my DVD

1111
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:33.560
and I just basically did what the fuck and Catholic priests would do when I was

1112
01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:37.040
growing up when they would basically yell at the people who showed up for
church.

1113
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.941
So with that,

1114
01:10:37.941 --> 01:10:40.940
let's give you some funny youtube clips and you can watch all of these right in

1115
01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:44.090
a row.
Conveniently on the uh,

1116
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.120
the EMM podcast.com the official fan page of the Monday morning podcast.

1117
01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:52.500
And I want to thank all the listeners,
uh,

1118
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:56.540
who go onto that and left all those great messages about them going out there

1119
01:10:56.541 --> 01:11:01.340
trying to get the word out.
I'm telling you,
even though you know it,

1120
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.120
it helps out.

1121
01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.120
You have no fucking idea how much that helps me out due to the fact that there's

1122
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:11.390
500 channels.
Now there's the internet,
there's video games,

1123
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:16.050
there's people with cameras making videos for fucking youtube.

1124
01:11:16.051 --> 01:11:18.600
There's just so much shit out there.

1125
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:22.080
There's Tivo and all that like you guys doing that really,
really helped me.

1126
01:11:22.081 --> 01:11:25.470
So I just want to say thank you.
Okay.
This is really a feel good podcast.

1127
01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:28.920
You would never know that my team got trounced by the team that I've been

1128
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:33.020
trashing.
Oh,
by the way,
all the jets and apology.
Um,

1129
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.990
I'm not the part where I say they're not going to win the Superbowl and I,

1130
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.710
I won't apologize for that.
After week two,
um,

1131
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.300
but the fact that I actually suggested that they still play a giant stadium and

1132
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:50.220
that they sub leaded their stadium from,
uh,
from the giants,

1133
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.330
they don't now,
now they co own it with the giants.

1134
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.350
So the jet's got a little more credibility in the giants became a little more

1135
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:59.430
pathetic,

1136
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:03.180
but they can spin it and just say that what they're doing is a very green thing

1137
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:07.650
to do.
It's great for the environment.
But,
but considering,
uh,
the jets,

1138
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.560
their colors are green,
I still think that they come out on top.

1139
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:13.770
So a what do you going to say about that?
Um,

1140
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.130
I miss the game last night where Peyton beat the shit out of his little brother.

1141
01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:21.280
Like all big brothers should do.
I haven't tell you that.

1142
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:25.630
If you have a younger brother,
at no point in your life,

1143
01:12:25.631 --> 01:12:28.690
can you ever lose to him in anything ever.

1144
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:30.740
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1145
01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.510
<v 9>No.
I mean know he can get a better fucking job,
Marissa,</v>

1146
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:35.180
hotter woman that can fucking happen.

1147
01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:40.181
But I'm talking about shit that really counts like sports wrestling and are in a

1148
01:12:41.901 --> 01:12:46.310
real fight.
You can never fucking loose.
And if they,

1149
01:12:46.311 --> 01:12:47.720
even if he beats you in a fight,

1150
01:12:47.721 --> 01:12:51.770
what you do is you just turn that into a round and as you collect yourself,

1151
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:56.030
you grabbed something to beat them over the head with and then you win round
two.

1152
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.540
I know the ladies out there probably don't understand that,

1153
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.490
but anybody with a younger brother,
I'm telling you,

1154
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.180
I never lost to any of my younger brothers.

1155
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.650
I am undefeated in fights undefeated.

1156
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.880
And if I said that right now,
considering we're all about the same size,

1157
01:13:14.881 --> 01:13:18.540
I would have a couple of fights on my card,
but,
uh,

1158
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:23.400
hopefully no one in my family listens to this.
All right,

1159
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:27.630
let's get out to the youtube videos for the week.
All right.
Your sons a bitches.

1160
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:32.040
Um,
all of these are available on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1161
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.600
You can watch them right in a row.
All right.

1162
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.740
This is one of my favorite videos I've seen in a while.
It's called Macho Salad,

1163
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.950
m a,
c h o o Macho Salad.

1164
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.820
And this is just a great piece of acting from a,

1165
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:48.270
I don't know what movie this is.
I believe that they speaking German,

1166
01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:49.260
I can't fucking remember.

1167
01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:53.460
But this guy wants to get laid and is his girl tells him,
you know,

1168
01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:54.420
she's not in the mood.

1169
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.020
This is what I'm guessing from the dialogue and tells him to go make a salad.

1170
01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:02.550
And this son of a bitch makes a fucking salad and a,
it's awesome.

1171
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.511
It's just like,

1172
01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:06.270
it's just one of those things where I don't know how many takes this guy had to

1173
01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:08.640
do,
but uh,
it's,

1174
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:12.700
it's the shit and I aspire to someday be to do something like that.
Acting.

1175
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:17.620
All right.
Um,
the next thing we got here,
uh,

1176
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:23.050
this,
this video actually made me so upset.
You have a watch,

1177
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:28.051
a youtube video and you wished that you could just somehow step into your screen

1178
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.500
and fucking go into the video and just basically inflict your view of what the

1179
01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:39.880
justice should have been.
No.
Well,
okay.

1180
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:44.230
The watch this video,
it's actually a clip from the doctor Phil Show.

1181
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:48.880
You know that crooked cop looking dude who pretends he's a psychologist but he's

1182
01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:52.210
really just a fucking therapist who wanted to have groupies so we can get some

1183
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:55.960
more pussy on the side and realize that he wasn't going to get it in a fucking

1184
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.510
therapy room.
So he was like,

1185
01:14:58.511 --> 01:15:03.511
I know I'll do a TV show and say Avi is shit slowly.

1186
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.830
Uh,
anyways,
let's continue.

1187
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.390
Uh,
he has a clip on there.

1188
01:15:13.391 --> 01:15:17.920
It's the name of this video is called fat kid slaps mum.

1189
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:22.210
Mum.
All right.
And just to set this one up,

1190
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:26.440
this is basically obviously a mother who can't control her kid.

1191
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.240
He's a fat kid.

1192
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:33.270
He's about 11 or 12 his voice hasn't changed yet and he's sitting there sitting

1193
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:40.540
down across from his mother who is also sitting down and nose to nose.

1194
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:44.740
They are having discussion and this kid is taking his mother to task,

1195
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:50.260
interrupting her and then when she gives him shit for interrupting her,

1196
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:54.280
he goes,
well how does that feel?
How does that,
how do you like it?

1197
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:58.300
Like completely out of fucking control and this kid's got this temper and he's

1198
01:15:58.301 --> 01:16:02.920
so fucking out of line in and she starts giving him shit and out of nowhere he

1199
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:07.921
just hauls off and fucking slaps her like a God damn pimp.

1200
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:10.570
You only need the one.

1201
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.050
The only reason why it wasn't a pimp slap it cause it wasn't a backhand but it

1202
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:15.490
had the same fucking,

1203
01:16:15.491 --> 01:16:19.060
it sounded like a flare chop right to her fucking cheek.

1204
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.270
And there's this pause and I'm like,
oh my God,

1205
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:24.910
she is going to be on him like a mountain lion.

1206
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.430
And I'm going to see the boom mic guide jumping in,

1207
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.580
trying to pull her off from clogging the eyes out of this kids fucking head.

1208
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.960
There's that pause and then the kid just goes,
how does that feel?

1209
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:42.730
How do you like it?
And the mother does absolutely nothing.

1210
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.340
And I swear to God,
I was just like,

1211
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:51.250
I had to like stand up and like walk around and do like little circles.

1212
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:53.620
You know when you want to walk away from the video,

1213
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:55.090
but you have to watch it again.

1214
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:58.630
So you just do those little fucking figure eights.
I was like,

1215
01:16:58.631 --> 01:17:00.340
you gotta you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1216
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.810
Why aren't you fucking chilling that Shit right now?
Right.

1217
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.890
And I,
you know what I would've done if I was that,
if I was at,

1218
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 1>I just wanted to answer.
I just really,
I was scaring my dog over there.
Sorry,</v>

1219
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:17.090
Dude.
Sorry about that.
All right.
We're just acting over here.
Everything's good,

1220
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:18.680
man.
Everything's good.
Yeah.

1221
01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.440
<v 10>Cleo,
dod.
Oh,</v>

1222
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.580
<v 1>sorry.
Um,</v>

1223
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:27.560
what does it take to make a dog's fucking wag its tail?

1224
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:30.680
It takes literally two seconds.
Um,
anyways,

1225
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:36.230
I just looked at that video and I was,

1226
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.620
I immediately just imagine being married to that woman.

1227
01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.020
And then that was my son and I was

1228
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:44.720
<v 0>okay.</v>

1229
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.830
<v 1>I gotta tell you right now,</v>

1230
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:47.990
<v 0>if,
you know,</v>

1231
01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:52.110
<v 1>when I married mia and we have kids and do all that shit,</v>

1232
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:57.540
if one of our kids ever slaps her in the face,
I will.

1233
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.290
I would've,
yeah,
I would've fucking throat.

1234
01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:06.540
I want to choke slam that kid through the fucking coffee table with any luck.

1235
01:18:06.541 --> 01:18:10.620
It would be one of those old school and tea coffee tables,
you know,

1236
01:18:10.621 --> 01:18:14.220
that were made out of the really good wood from deepen the fucking forest,

1237
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.710
not that Ikea Shit that explodes like a fucking stunt table,
you know?

1238
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:23.970
And I would just put that mother fucker right through it and then I would pull

1239
01:18:23.971 --> 01:18:27.840
him up by his goddamn larynx and then right through the fucking dry wall.

1240
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.310
All right.
My hand would be disappearing into the wall.

1241
01:18:32.311 --> 01:18:34.440
Like I just fist it a fucking horse.

1242
01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.730
And you would be wondering where that kid was.

1243
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And then I pull them out and he'd have all that fucking plaster in his hair and

1244
01:18:47.551 --> 01:18:52.410
he'd start to cry and then I would just fucking take away like three quarters of

1245
01:18:52.411 --> 01:18:55.860
his oxygen and I would whisper in his ear really calmly,

1246
01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:01.830
like one of those bad guys in those great eighties movies with Mel Gibson.
Well,

1247
01:19:01.831 --> 01:19:06.600
once they get them tied up
or a fucking Stallone or whatever,

1248
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:11.010
all the fucking,
the goons would get in tied up.
And then the,
the,
the real,
the,

1249
01:19:11.011 --> 01:19:14.490
the head bad guy who's running shit would just come in all relaxed with his

1250
01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:18.990
fucking dress shoes and suit and we just come up and just sort of put his face

1251
01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:22.160
like parallel to the other dude's face.
You know,
you just come in,

1252
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.140
you just whisper and right in the guy's ear.
Nice and calmly.

1253
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:28.350
That's what I would do to him has this kid was struggling to breathe.

1254
01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.780
I just put my fucking head right next to his ear and I would just be like,

1255
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.770
if you ever slap your mother in the face again,

1256
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.570
I will fucking kill you.
If you want to stay in me,

1257
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:44.723
do you understand me?

1258
01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:52.360
The only reason why you're not dead right now is because I haven't figured out

1259
01:19:52.361 --> 01:19:55.570
how to get away with it yet.
I'd be saying shit like that,

1260
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.360
and then you go upstairs and you go to your fucking room.

1261
01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:00.910
If you even look at her over the next month,
I swear to God,

1262
01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:06.060
I will grab you by your fucking baby fat and the top of your fucking head.

1263
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:10.140
I will throw you upside down through the fucking bay window.

1264
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.070
Do you understand that?
As you sit out there in the rain,

1265
01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.000
picking the glass in the woods,
shards out of your body?

1266
01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:23.260
I'm going to take a tray,
a hot macaroni and throw it right on your fucking face.

1267
01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:25.540
That's what I'm going to do.
If you ever fucking touch your mother again,

1268
01:20:25.541 --> 01:20:30.460
was that a little too violent?
Was it?
Well,
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

1269
01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:34.600
That's how I came up.
You know,
I grew up,
if I,
if I actually,

1270
01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:38.380
the reason why I expected that woman to claw their kid's eyes out,

1271
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:43.000
cause that's where my mom would have done.
My mom did not need a father figure

1272
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.210
hanging around the Goddamn House.

1273
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.670
<v 9>Basically.
If,
if that woman was my mother,</v>

1274
01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:57.570
the only role the dad would have would be at some point to pull the mom off that

1275
01:20:57.731 --> 01:21:02.170
kid in order to fucking say,
my mother would have just grabbed the nearest,

1276
01:21:02.171 --> 01:21:05.920
she would have fucked it off.
Remember old school moms,
they've drew blood,

1277
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:11.110
they will like cats and they just fucking disease dug their nails into you and

1278
01:21:11.111 --> 01:21:13.150
they grabbed you and really weird places.

1279
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:18.100
They would just grab like a handful of neck somehow have your judge

1280
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.590
<v 1>killer in there and
they do that.</v>

1281
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:25.700
And then the other hand,
like the thumb would somehow get into this party.

1282
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:29.370
Your armpit you didn't even know existed and they would just take a chunk of

1283
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:33.660
flesh out of that somehow there'd be no holes in your fucking tee shirt and they

1284
01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:35.400
would just stay with it was unbelievable.

1285
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:40.300
So like a fucking Scifi movie.
When you were done and you,

1286
01:21:40.301 --> 01:21:45.070
you fucked a went upstairs and your skin was just burning from wherever the fuck

1287
01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:48.550
they had.
Claude you when you took it looked like,
yeah,
like he got a by a bobcat.

1288
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:51.563
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1289
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.780
<v 1>right.
To do those moms exist anymore?</v>

1290
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:57.420
<v 9>We,
I dunno,
date,</v>

1291
01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.940
I think there's been an overcorrection and one time one of my brothers said that

1292
01:22:00.941 --> 01:22:05.110
I kicked him in the face,
which was bullshit.
I kicked him in the stomach,

1293
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.790
which was considered legal and working it out amongst yourselves.

1294
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.810
<v 1>My mother was brushing her hair.
She was late for work.
She had to,</v>

1295
01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:16.740
she had to go with frontier justice.

1296
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:19.200
She didn't have time for my side of the story.

1297
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.040
She just turned around and she went to smash this thing over my head,

1298
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:27.030
like a fucking gavel.
So I did.
Basically,

1299
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.990
I did this defensive move where I ducked,
but not like a man.

1300
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.700
I didn't do like the boxing,

1301
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.090
like fucking come up and under and then fucking with the right hook.

1302
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:37.080
I didn't do that shit.

1303
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.200
What I basically did was I immediately did a fucking 180 so now I wasn't facing

1304
01:22:44.341 --> 01:22:47.400
my mother.
I put my shoulders up to my ears,

1305
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.700
I bent over slightly at a 45 degree angle and then for some reason I made my

1306
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:56.450
arms go a little,
my elbows go a little past my back and I,

1307
01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:01.560
I I squinted eye look like Pau Gasol before right before he decides to go to the

1308
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:06.190
rack,
anticipating the foul.
And Luckily I enough,
she missed

1309
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.340
<v 9>my head and just hit me right in the back.</v>

1310
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.540
Like I took one of those folding chairs and rustling from Pat Patterson right to

1311
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:18.541
my fucking back and I went down and a God damn heap in landed on that Kmart

1312
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.540
fucking bath mat is the shards of the plastic brush just landed all around me.

1313
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:31.480
You know what my mother's big concern was,
was that she broke her brush,
you know,

1314
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:37.210
and it was old school back then when you didn't have flat screen TVs and when

1315
01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:41.860
you're broke a brush,
if,
if the rubber part with the bristles still existed,

1316
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:45.610
she just continue using it.
And she did for years.
She just,

1317
01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:48.790
she just hit rather than having a handle and fucking combing it,

1318
01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.350
like brushing it like Barbie,

1319
01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:53.620
she just held it in her hand now like you know those brushes black guys use when

1320
01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:56.200
they try to get waves in their hair.
That's what it looked like.

1321
01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.640
And she just kept using that and every time I saw it I was reminded of that.

1322
01:24:00.641 --> 01:24:03.070
And it was like a week later that the two of us,

1323
01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:06.280
we just started laughing about it like,
mom,

1324
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:07.870
when are you going to buy a new brush?
And she said,
well,

1325
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:10.870
there's nothing wrong with this one.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1326
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.870
It doesn't fucking three quarters of it doesn't even exist anymore.

1327
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:18.220
And isn't it a fucking reminder that you smash the rest of it over it over one

1328
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.070
of your kids' backs?
No,

1329
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:26.050
she didn't give a fuck and she shouldn't have.
She was right.
She was right.

1330
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:29.350
That was my thing about that shit.
[inaudible] I know.

1331
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.850
That's the way parenting used to be.

1332
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.510
The mom used to kick the shit out of you and the dad didn't have to kick the

1333
01:24:34.511 --> 01:24:35.260
shit out of you.

1334
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:39.400
All he had to do is go and you fucking peed yourself a little bit.

1335
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:43.950
And that was it.
So that's when I got out of that clip,
man,

1336
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:47.980
that's just bad parenting.
That kid should have never gotten it.
That was my kid.

1337
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:52.360
That kid would have been stuffed upside down in a fucking hamper and slid down a

1338
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:55.960
flight of fucking stairs.
Huh?
How about that?

1339
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.920
How about your point now?
How does that feel?
All right.

1340
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.990
Give him a little ass.
Kickings where you,
you only end up with one shoe on.

1341
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.570
You know,
I used to do a bit about that on stage.

1342
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:14.170
I don't know if I ever fucking,
uh,
I might have to bring that one back.

1343
01:25:14.171 --> 01:25:16.330
Speaking of that first question that I had,
I used to do a bit of,

1344
01:25:16.331 --> 01:25:20.710
but anytime you get beat up by five or more people,
you always lose a shoe,

1345
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:24.550
you know,
to help.
It was that like,
you know,

1346
01:25:24.551 --> 01:25:28.930
you get your ass kicking your ass kicked when there's like debris of you

1347
01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:33.070
afterwards and you have to like collect your personal belongings.

1348
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:36.430
Oh fuck.
I remember what the,
how did the hell did it go?

1349
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:40.950
Somehow the tag was something about having a deck of cards.
I had a deck of KBC,

1350
01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.760
the jacket diamonds,
like just your shit was just that him,

1351
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.740
I can't remember how the fuck it went.
But anyways,
um,

1352
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:51.000
so if you want to see what old school parenting looks like it,

1353
01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:54.970
but in a funnier way,
there is another youtube clip.
Watch this.
This clip.

1354
01:25:54.971 --> 01:25:59.500
It's called spoiled kid gets yelled at and uh,

1355
01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.770
yeah,
the guy yelling in.
This is basically my dad.

1356
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:06.290
All right.
This is the funny version of it,

1357
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.760
of what he really had to do and was totally in the right.

1358
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:16.580
Um,
when he did it,
like I don't have any,
uh,
that's my thing.
You know what?

1359
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:19.940
The old school parenting,
you know,
it bothered me as a kid,

1360
01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:21.440
but when I look back on it now,

1361
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:24.950
it's like I deserved so many ass.

1362
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:28.400
Kickings so many fucking ass kick.
I deserved him.

1363
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:32.310
I fucking deserve to
ever.

1364
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.440
One time one of my brother's Piss me off and I took out a garden hose and I

1365
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:40.760
started spraying it through the fucking,
uh,
I was so mad cause I had a water,

1366
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.680
the plants and he was making fun of me and I just took this thing and I fucking,

1367
01:26:45.681 --> 01:26:48.830
I just,
I just,
I,
you know,
I had a temper,
I just sprayed it right at him,

1368
01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.810
right into the house.
And uh,
you know,

1369
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.220
and that was the day I learned what dark tastes like.

1370
01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:05.230
My mother,
we had me was on my back just pushing my face into the mud.

1371
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.680
Oh yeah that was,
those were the days.

1372
01:27:08.681 --> 01:27:12.730
And then all your other siblings would stand around laughing cause your mother

1373
01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:14.320
couldn't hear the laughter over the rage.

1374
01:27:14.321 --> 01:27:18.700
She always focus on the one part is we're just laughing and then you come in

1375
01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:23.560
with your mud covered face crying and everybody just laughs.

1376
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:28.810
Just Ah,
Shit.
I used to see you.
I remember back in the day,

1377
01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:33.640
I remember seeing one of my,
one of my friends mouthed off to his mother,

1378
01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.720
I went over to his house to get some lunch and he mouthed off to his mom

1379
01:27:39.610 --> 01:27:42.760
and he wanted to see when a dessert or something and she was just like,
no,

1380
01:27:42.761 --> 01:27:46.300
it's lunchtime.
You don't get any dessert.
And he can just go.
So mom,
I hate you.

1381
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.360
Like we were little kids and the kids' Dad did not even look up from his

1382
01:27:52.121 --> 01:27:55.760
sandwich.
Just took a whole glee kids,

1383
01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.580
whole glass of milk and just threw it face.

1384
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.890
So my friend just starts crying,
right?

1385
01:28:04.891 --> 01:28:09.891
The dad goes back to eat sandwich and then the mother just got up right on cue,

1386
01:28:09.991 --> 01:28:13.620
went over and just cleaned it up.
And that was it.

1387
01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:17.790
And I can guarantee you that kid never said,
oh mom,
I hate you again.

1388
01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:20.640
This whole fucking time out shit.
I know that's a hacky bit,

1389
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:23.850
but I really believe it.
I really believe that.
You know,

1390
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:28.980
you got to slap him around.
You gotta you gotta you know gotta hit,

1391
01:28:28.981 --> 01:28:31.260
you know I had a really hard,
I'm not talking about literally abusing them,

1392
01:28:31.261 --> 01:28:34.920
but yeah,
you've got to throw a glass of milk in their face.
You got to grow,

1393
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:38.370
you got gotta basically ruined one of their shirts.

1394
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:42.780
And by that I mean grab them by the front of it and lift them up by it to the

1395
01:28:42.781 --> 01:28:47.490
point where all their body weight is on the neck of the shirt and it rips a

1396
01:28:47.491 --> 01:28:52.491
little bit and leaves that red mark that goes past your fucking collar bone down

1397
01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:57.590
to your sternum.
There's a whole generation of kids,
listen to this day,

1398
01:28:57.591 --> 01:28:59.250
have no idea what I'm talking about.

1399
01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:03.540
But anybody remotely my age is punching the dashboard right now.
Laughing,

1400
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.880
remembering all of this shit.
I don't know.

1401
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:09.870
Did it make us better people?
I don't fucking know,

1402
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:13.590
but we shut the fuck up at dinner.
All right,
let's continue.
Um,

1403
01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.810
question,
uh,
Bill,
would you ever consider a hosting a late night talk show?

1404
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.950
I would.
I think I would love to do that.
Um,

1405
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.300
I would love to do that.
Provided I could do my monologue,

1406
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:32.330
like my standup and I could really just sort of a do what I do in a cleaner,

1407
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.740
cleaner way.
I guess.
I would love to do that.
And,
uh,

1408
01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:41.910
I think I could actually ask some really interesting questions.

1409
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.880
Um,
you know,
and I'm not going to give away what the fucking questions.

1410
01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:50.160
So I'm talking a little shit.
Go a little rex Ryan on you here.

1411
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:53.310
Go to the Little Rex Ryan on you here.
Um,
yeah,
I would love,

1412
01:29:53.311 --> 01:29:57.960
I would love doing that,
but,
um,
I,
my career has not gone down that direction.

1413
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:02.550
So that's like a whole thing where I think you have to decide you want to be a

1414
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:05.270
broadcaster.
Um,

1415
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.520
like Jon Stewart,
like early on,

1416
01:30:08.521 --> 01:30:13.521
like I remember hearing like he just was this phenomenal comedian and then he

1417
01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:19.791
just really early on started going down that road of being a broadcaster and you

1418
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:25.680
get seen as that.
So,
uh,
I don't know.
Who knows?

1419
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:26.761
Never say never.

1420
01:30:26.761 --> 01:30:29.340
If they gave me the opportunity now with fucking take it in a second,

1421
01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:33.270
I would take it in a fucking second.
Um,
all right,

1422
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:38.310
here's some advice.
All right.
Uh,
but,
but,
but,
but uh,
all right.
Pill.

1423
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:41.880
Let me paint you this picture for a moment.
I used to be terrible with girls.

1424
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:45.570
I was always a nice guy,
but that gets you nowhere.
Oh,
Jesus.
Exactly.

1425
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.740
Girls always said I was really nice,
but uh,
they were never interested.

1426
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.750
This was because I lacked confidence and wasn't sure of myself.
There you go.

1427
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.010
Get this guy taking responsibility for himself.

1428
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.470
It's exactly yet so as time went on,

1429
01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:03.620
I got a few practice girls in my conference inevitably grow and I started doing

1430
01:31:03.871 --> 01:31:08.610
well.
There you go right there.
All you youngsters,
young guys out there.

1431
01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:12.990
Nice guys trying to get fucking laid.
There it is.
That's page one right there.

1432
01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:16.770
You're a nice guy.
You're fucking boring them.
All right.

1433
01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:19.620
You gotta be a little bit of a Dick,
right?
Nia is,

1434
01:31:19.621 --> 01:31:21.750
you walk in and try to have respect for the podcast.

1435
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:26.400
How much look at you.
I can see it on your face right now.
These,

1436
01:31:26.401 --> 01:31:30.000
she's doing that classic girl thing where she's trying not to smile and she's

1437
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:31.650
rolling her fucking eyes and you know it.

1438
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:36.540
You gotta be a little bit of a cocky ass hole.
You got to come up.

1439
01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:40.890
You got an insult them a little bit.
Yeah,
you do.
Like if I saw you right now,

1440
01:31:40.891 --> 01:31:43.110
even though I like your outfit,
I would walk up to you and be like,

1441
01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:46.170
what did you come straight from?
Work.
That's how you dress when you come out.

1442
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.420
And you'd be like,
what?
I'm just fucking with you.

1443
01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:52.830
What are you drinking right Outta the gate.
Come right out.

1444
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:57.330
Put your balls right on the fucking table.
Take a look at him,
sweetie.

1445
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:03.130
I'm just trying to grow she out now.
Whenever you got to Charmin,

1446
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:06.790
do what she gotta do.
I don't like your fucking sandals.

1447
01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.960
I don't like him.
I've been meaning to tell you.
Oh,
that was a good one.

1448
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:14.040
Right in the fucking leg.

1449
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:17.223
<v 0>Beat it.</v>

1450
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:21.450
<v 9>See that?
She just gave me the finger and she walked out.
See right there.</v>

1451
01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:24.210
That's the little ebb and flow you have to have in your relationship.

1452
01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:26.640
See if you're always complimenting them.
You know what?

1453
01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:29.430
Women are like the leg dogs,
right?

1454
01:32:32.190 --> 01:32:36.540
This is a record for me.
I've gone 46 minutes without trashing women.
Um,
yeah,

1455
01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:40.680
they like dogs.
They really are.
As much as they try to say we like dogs,
people,

1456
01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:41.790
I've just like fucking dog.

1457
01:32:41.791 --> 01:32:46.010
She can't reward them all the God damn time stroke in the back of that Goddamn

1458
01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.180
head.
Next thing you know,
there's shitting on the rug.

1459
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.750
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1460
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.470
<v 9>If he wants to know why,
I got to give him a little discipline.</v>

1461
01:32:51.471 --> 01:32:56.060
Tell him you don't like what they're wearing.
Um,
anyways,
so he was a guy.

1462
01:32:56.061 --> 01:32:59.600
He fee figured it out.
Why am I not getting laid?
I don't have confidence.

1463
01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:02.360
So what do I need to do?
I need to go out there and get some at bats.

1464
01:33:02.361 --> 01:33:03.200
That's what you do.

1465
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:08.390
You go out there and you start talking some shit and you're going to bomb and

1466
01:33:08.391 --> 01:33:09.590
you're going to embarrass yourself,

1467
01:33:09.591 --> 01:33:12.540
but eventually you're going to push through and all those times you embarrass

1468
01:33:12.541 --> 01:33:14.690
yourself.
They're just,
they're just going to become,
they're just going to,

1469
01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:18.840
they're just going to be funny stories to tell.
Um,

1470
01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:21.980
no,
she's,
do I have a funny one?

1471
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.230
I remember when I used to try to go to dance clubs,

1472
01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:25.880
which were totally weren't my saint,

1473
01:33:25.881 --> 01:33:28.490
cause not only was I not good looking enough to be in there,

1474
01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.630
I didn't know how to dance and couldn't dance and I would just walk up to girls

1475
01:33:32.631 --> 01:33:35.210
and my opening line was I would yell,
Hey,

1476
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.620
do you want to dance?
And then they would go,
no.

1477
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:43.040
And then I walk away.

1478
01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:44.733
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:33:45.090 --> 01:33:45.580
<v 9>Oh.</v>

1480
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:50.580
And it would take me at least another 40 minutes if I did to get the courage to

1481
01:33:50.651 --> 01:33:54.100
approach another one.
And that's the thing you broads.
Don't fucking appreciate.

1482
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:56.230
You know,
what are you going to do?

1483
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.680
Well you got to sit there and pluck Yahoo has and pick the right fucking colored

1484
01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:04.270
dog,
make sure it matches your bra.
You get to do all of that.
And private.

1485
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:07.440
We got to sit there and basically it's like doing standup.

1486
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.210
The only way to learn how to do is you have to go on stage and just eat your

1487
01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:13.900
balls.
You've got to bomb.
Um,
I dunno,

1488
01:34:13.901 --> 01:34:16.870
I guess it all gets made up because they get pregnant and they got to deal with

1489
01:34:16.871 --> 01:34:20.170
that fucking Shit,
you know?
And if forget about the pain of pregnancy,

1490
01:34:20.171 --> 01:34:24.760
can you imagine another thing growing inside of you?
Jesus.

1491
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.460
I would go to the doctor and be like,
get this out of me.
This,
this virus.
It can,

1492
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.550
it's,
it's eating my guts.
No,
no,
no.

1493
01:34:33.551 --> 01:34:37.210
That's what's supposed to happen.
Get it out.
Get it out.

1494
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:41.380
Um,
all right.
Anyways,
let's continue here.

1495
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:46.090
So a time went on and I realize how ignorant all that.
That was.
All right ladies,

1496
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:48.610
ladies,
it's ladies night today.

1497
01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:52.360
It's ladies day morning on the Monday morning podcast.

1498
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.190
I should have a lady's morning.
Shouldn't I?

1499
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.700
A ladies night on the Monday morning podcast,
you know,
then I'll play clips.

1500
01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.760
I should do that and just be honoring you while I fucking just trash you in my

1501
01:35:05.251 --> 01:35:08.250
own roundabout Canty way.
That's what I'll do.
I'll just play,

1502
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:17.480
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.

1503
01:35:17.481 --> 01:35:21.360
I'm back.
I just ran out of battery power.
God Damn.

1504
01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:25.640
And I was on a nice roll there.
That always makes the editing difficult.

1505
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:29.700
I apologize.
Everybody the fuck happened.
Um,

1506
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:33.730
you know what's funny too is I went and I bought a whole bunch of these two

1507
01:35:34.210 --> 01:35:37.820
double a batteries.
You know,
my girl was like,

1508
01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.860
we need more Jabil aid batteries.
He by AA battery.
So I'm always using them.

1509
01:35:41.861 --> 01:35:45.910
Right.
So I go down to the God damn cvs and I buy like this big fucking yeah,

1510
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.090
12 pack of them.
12 AA batteries.

1511
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:56.400
I go up to the package just like one left fucking Goddamn fucking women.

1512
01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:04.290
No matter what you buy,
it's not enough.
It's never a fun.

1513
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.090
I just go take a battery out of some God damn thing that she owns.
No,

1514
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.520
not a vibrator.
Yes.
Fucking filthy ass holes.

1515
01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.720
It's actually this baby monitor so we can watch the dog in here.

1516
01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.990
Which crate training the motherfucker.
Um,

1517
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.290
so we sit here and watch this.
Why we couldn't,

1518
01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:24.540
we just use our laptops and skyped it,
you know,

1519
01:36:24.541 --> 01:36:27.780
sent the signal up to the fucking satellite,
whatever.

1520
01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:31.710
Let's get back on track here.
I swear to God if I bought the 24 pack,

1521
01:36:31.711 --> 01:36:34.060
they would still only be one left.
Okay,

1522
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:37.670
well I just replaced the batteries and everything just in case.

1523
01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:43.080
Why is it illegal to slap you?
Okay,
let's plot.

1524
01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.260
That's so me.
I would never do that.
Okay ladies,

1525
01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.530
let's relax.
All right,
so let's,
let's plow ahead here.
Let me,

1526
01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.960
let me get through the advice here so I can watch the Monday night football,

1527
01:36:54.961 --> 01:36:58.920
what you guys are probably already doing.
Um,
so anyways,
so this guy here,

1528
01:36:58.921 --> 01:37:01.500
so as time went on,
it got my confidence.
I started doing well,

1529
01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:05.340
I reserve the right,
uh,
oh.
Anyways,
you know,
I didn't become cocky.

1530
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:09.210
Start acting like I'm God's gift to women because I know,
um,
I,
you know,

1531
01:37:09.211 --> 01:37:13.350
I'm not that mentality and it's for dickheads.
Uh,
so anyways,

1532
01:37:13.351 --> 01:37:15.360
this guy has been through a considerable amount of women.

1533
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.300
I'm trying to paraphrase here cause this is a really long email.

1534
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:22.560
He ends up meet meeting this girl,
everything's going great.

1535
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:28.170
Um,
he's having a good time with her.
After some time,
this guys from Ireland,

1536
01:37:28.171 --> 01:37:30.530
he says after some time,
uh,

1537
01:37:30.570 --> 01:37:35.570
the blow jobs in sex altogether had started to diminish.

1538
01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:38.500
I had a pair of phrase because he wrote a ton of information there.
Basically,

1539
01:37:38.501 --> 01:37:42.520
he meets this girl,
everything's going great that basically drinking and fucking,

1540
01:37:42.521 --> 01:37:47.200
and everything's often,
and then,
you know,
it starts tapering off.
So,
uh,

1541
01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:53.040
so it starts tapering off and she started to use sex as a weapon.

1542
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:56.930
Uh,
she play mental games with me and it,

1543
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.830
and I'd end up feeling like a bastard when she'd shoot me down for sex.
I'd say,

1544
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:04.260
that's cool.
I don't mind that I excuse myself.

1545
01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:09.120
Go to the bathroom and crank one out.
There you go sir.
That's what you do.

1546
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.130
You know when,
when you get to that fucking Kevin Spacey,
Beautiful Mind Level,

1547
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.840
your rub one out right in front of her.
Never.

1548
01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:23.820
I've never done that,
but I think that,
that's awesome.
Um,
anyways,
he goes,
um,

1549
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:27.660
so anyways,
I still got to empty the barrel,
but she wasn't involved.

1550
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:31.140
And when I tried to talk to her calmly about what she was,

1551
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:35.640
see what she was thinking and how she was feeling,
it would never go well.

1552
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:38.010
She returned on the waterworks and play the victim,

1553
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:41.220
even though she was the one who instigated the mind fucking,

1554
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.260
I'm not sure what her reject objective was because the concept of emotional

1555
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:49.200
blackmail is a foreign concept to me.
Um,

1556
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:53.040
I had always tried to approach everything with a rational under understanding

1557
01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:57.380
basis so that she wouldn't feel targeted or threatened.
Um,

1558
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:01.410
I should also add that it took a lot for me to sit down calmly and talk while

1559
01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:06.770
accepting criticism from her as I'm a very direct and often angry fella.

1560
01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:09.090
Well,
that's the only red flag there.
Other than that,

1561
01:39:09.091 --> 01:39:12.690
you seem like you'd take your shit and you give it as well.

1562
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:17.040
Now you got to watch the younger dude.
Trust me.
I can speak volumes of that.
Uh,

1563
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:18.330
I'm not the best guy in the world,

1564
01:39:18.331 --> 01:39:23.010
so you can imagine how difficult it was not to punch her in her cunt face.
Okay.

1565
01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:26.400
This is getting a little uglier.
Uh,
as soon as she started crying,

1566
01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.780
as I see crying as a school yard scape goat for girls to get what they want

1567
01:39:30.781 --> 01:39:34.410
because they know men don't know how to handle it.
All right,

1568
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.840
I'm with you with everything right up to there.

1569
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:39.420
Sometimes women do cry because they're upset.

1570
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:43.950
They do have access to that emotion more than we do.

1571
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:48.360
And I know,
but I know that angry feeling you have where you're like,

1572
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.160
this is how you have to gauge that is basically if they cry every time then you

1573
01:39:56.011 --> 01:39:57.030
can call bullshit.

1574
01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.260
But if they only cry once in a fucking Blue Moon,

1575
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:06.240
then you have to realize that you've really upset them and yeah,

1576
01:40:06.241 --> 01:40:07.710
and then you just got to deal with that.

1577
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:11.880
That fucking awkwardness of not knowing what to do and then also feeling like a

1578
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.530
bully but there's nothing worse.

1579
01:40:13.531 --> 01:40:17.730
I will agree with you that if your right and you haven't done anything wrong and

1580
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:21.270
then they start crying and then you know,

1581
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:24.930
you can't be a dick in that moment,
but you don't,

1582
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.600
that doesn't mean you have just cause they're crying doesn't mean you have to

1583
01:40:27.601 --> 01:40:32.490
apologize if you're fucking right.
You don't have to apologize.
Uh,

1584
01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:35.310
but there is that thing where if you make a female cry,
I mean,

1585
01:40:35.311 --> 01:40:38.850
if you're any sort of a guy,
it's very difficult to just stand there and be like,

1586
01:40:38.851 --> 01:40:43.250
what?
I don't give a fuck.
You cried,
cried,
cried some more.
Huh?

1587
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:47.190
Like you're the dead guy and a the great Santini he's going to shed a few start

1588
01:40:47.191 --> 01:40:49.980
bouncing a basketball off the back of their head.
You can't be that guy.

1589
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.510
All right,
so let's plow ahead here.
Um,
and anyways,
females,

1590
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.160
if you want to chime in there a lady's,
um,

1591
01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.890
what's the deal with the crew?

1592
01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:03.580
Like what percentage of it is bullshit?

1593
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.470
Can I get an honest fucking woman out there?
I mean,

1594
01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:11.760
God knows guys,
we have our techniques to get out of Shit,
man.

1595
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:12.880
They're fucking pathetic.

1596
01:41:12.881 --> 01:41:16.330
And you see right through them and I know right now you like,

1597
01:41:16.331 --> 01:41:19.090
why are you just rubbing their fucking muffs right now?

1598
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:21.090
Because that's a strategy to win arguments.

1599
01:41:21.091 --> 01:41:22.750
You just keep feeding their fucking ego.

1600
01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:26.200
There's a lot of women out there who really believe that guys are so fucking

1601
01:41:26.201 --> 01:41:30.910
dumb that they can't get anything past him and that's a great place for them to

1602
01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:34.830
continue existing as far as I'm concerned.
Um,
oh yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.330
No one can get anything by you.
You're just fucking,
yeah,

1604
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.190
you're the fucking goddamn world police with,
you know,
you have vagina.

1605
01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:44.500
You fucking know everything.
Yeah.
I can't get anything by you.

1606
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:50.170
You are all powerful.
I bow down in front of the,

1607
01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.790
um,
you know,
and it was funny about that.

1608
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:57.400
Yet any magazine out there can just,
you know,

1609
01:41:57.401 --> 01:42:02.401
fashion magazine can just tap into their fucking insecurities and get them to

1610
01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:04.210
buy the dumbest,

1611
01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:09.070
stupidest fucking war paint to put on their fucking face because some amazing

1612
01:42:09.071 --> 01:42:11.950
created,
I don't know,

1613
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:16.980
nee knocked pitch and towed fucking drugged up Twat is wearing it,

1614
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:21.010
but you can't get it out.
You can't get anything past them yet.
That's great.

1615
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:24.740
My voice just cracked right there.
Can't get a lake past.
Um,

1616
01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:30.070
um,
I'm sorry.
I'm actually getting over a cold if you haven't,
if you can't tell,

1617
01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:31.420
how did you get the cold bill?

1618
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.260
Was it from traveling the country and doing all that press notice and it's cause

1619
01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:38.170
they played a game of football and the fucking rain in street clothes before

1620
01:42:38.171 --> 01:42:43.120
Monday night football last week.
I'm sorry,
I was amped up.
Um,
anyways,

1621
01:42:43.121 --> 01:42:46.360
let's plow ahead.
So,
uh,

1622
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:50.620
basically this guy deals with her for the next two fucking months and he finally

1623
01:42:50.621 --> 01:42:54.790
ends up just saying he woke up one day and said,
gets you a shape out of my flat.

1624
01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.000
This,
this is over.
I can't deal with these mind games.

1625
01:42:58.001 --> 01:43:00.700
So what do I get to his question here?

1626
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:04.150
Um,
anyways,

1627
01:43:04.151 --> 01:43:07.240
I don't have much of an ego.

1628
01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.640
I like to accept my faults.
You know what,
dude?

1629
01:43:09.641 --> 01:43:13.330
You've said that one too many times where I'm starting to think maybe you do and

1630
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:18.190
maybe this woman is buried in a new fucking turnip garden in your backyard.

1631
01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.840
I like to accept my faults and admit what I have done is wrong and learn from it

1632
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:26.890
so as not to make the same mistakes over and over again.
My question is,
Bill,

1633
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:32.070
how do I get them to fuck up and stop testing my patients and how do I meet

1634
01:43:34.151 --> 01:43:38.470
someone who doesn't want to control me with their bullshit games?
Um,

1635
01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.270
I dunno dude.
I,
half of this,

1636
01:43:43.271 --> 01:43:46.450
I'm really going with you when you seem like an introspective person and the

1637
01:43:46.451 --> 01:43:49.000
other half you've worded this kind of like a psycho.

1638
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:53.090
How do you get them to fuck up and stop testing your pain?

1639
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.300
Like testing your patients?
That's kind of like a,

1640
01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.520
I pictured Dick Cheney type guy saying something like that.

1641
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:01.550
What the fuck do I know?
Basically,

1642
01:44:01.551 --> 01:44:04.670
I don't know what your problem is in this email.
Okay.
You dated a girl,

1643
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.750
she started playing mind games with you and all it was was after two months you

1644
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:13.100
were like,
fuck this,
pack up your shit and get out of my life.
Um,

1645
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:17.090
so be one thing.
If he was still in the relationship,

1646
01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:21.680
then I would say that you have problems.
But you don't,
you,
uh,
you met a psycho.

1647
01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:26.450
So what I would say is,
uh,
I dunno,
just stay single,

1648
01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:31.230
stay single right now and wait until you find someone who doesn't,
uh,

1649
01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.530
try to mind.
Fuck you.

1650
01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:37.580
The problem is you sound like a younger guy and the problem is,

1651
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:41.730
is what you're learning is that the crazy girls,
they,

1652
01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:45.650
they're really down for anything when it comes to sex and uh,

1653
01:44:45.651 --> 01:44:50.180
that's really hard to resist in your 20s.
So,
uh,

1654
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:54.500
what I would say is in the future is when you meet a girl like that is not to

1655
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:58.610
get involved in a fucking relationship,
but,
uh,
you know,

1656
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:01.670
Bang them and you know,

1657
01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:04.880
get your stories out because it'll prevent you from having a midlife crisis

1658
01:45:04.881 --> 01:45:08.270
later on in life.
Am I helping you out?
I don't know.
I mean,

1659
01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:11.720
I'm kind of giving you shit here,
but I'm also a,
I'm trying,
you know,

1660
01:45:11.721 --> 01:45:15.020
what I'm really doing right here is you're basically bearing the brunt of the

1661
01:45:15.021 --> 01:45:17.450
fact that I've trashed women so much in the last 10 minutes.

1662
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:21.590
I have to try to seem like I'm balanced here and then I don't understand exactly

1663
01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:26.570
what the fuck you're saying.
Um,
but I think,
I think you're fine.

1664
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.860
She tried to play that mind game with you.
You didn't lose your shit.
You said,

1665
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:33.860
according to you anyways,
you said I'm fine.
You went in your rub one out,

1666
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:37.310
you banged her for two fucking months and one day you're like,
what am I doing?

1667
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:41.600
And you just said,
yeah,
pack up.
He shouldn't get outta here.
So,
uh,

1668
01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:42.590
I would not,

1669
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:47.750
this woman is not a good example of a,

1670
01:45:47.751 --> 01:45:52.190
of a good woman.
All right?
So don't try to act like all women are like this.

1671
01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:56.960
Like I have for a long time and like I do every week on my podcast just for

1672
01:45:56.961 --> 01:45:59.540
comedic purposes.
I like trash in them.

1673
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:04.640
It's fun and it's childish,
but they're not all like that.

1674
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:09.350
If you're young,
there's still great girls out there.
Go out and go find them.
And,

1675
01:46:09.351 --> 01:46:11.450
uh,
I dunno.

1676
01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:16.010
Make a list of what you're looking for.
And then you also have to realize,
dude,

1677
01:46:16.011 --> 01:46:16.431
that you know,

1678
01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:21.050
everybody's going to come with their faults like you with your temper.
Um,

1679
01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:24.470
you know,
you got your faults,
so there you go.
Did I help you out?

1680
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:26.420
I probably didn't.
It probably didn't help that.

1681
01:46:26.421 --> 01:46:30.410
I fucking paraphrased your fucking email.
And then I also,
uh,

1682
01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:33.920
lost the batteries here in my,
um,

1683
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:38.870
my God damn recorder.
Uh,
am I going to end with that with a whimper?

1684
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:44.060
You guys want to do a quick revenge story?
Sure.
We all do a,
hey bill.

1685
01:46:44.061 --> 01:46:45.260
I'm not much for shit jokes,

1686
01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:48.350
but I thought you might be interested in one of my revenge stories when I was in

1687
01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:52.140
high school,
there was this kid who was always giving me and my friend Shit.

1688
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:55.740
So we decided,
uh,
no wait,
I just read that wrong.
When I was in high school,

1689
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:59.700
there was a kid who was always giving my friend and I shit.

1690
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.510
So we decided we'd give him some look at that.

1691
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:08.370
What a well worded shit joke.
It's got a little foreshadowing going on there.

1692
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:11.760
Perfect amount of words.
If the reader was a little bit better,

1693
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.430
that would have got a left.
So anyways,
he goes,
uh,

1694
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:18.690
he was the guy who would knock people's lunch trays out of their hands in high

1695
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:20.790
school and high five his buddies and laugh.

1696
01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.050
So he's basically like that kid who was in the Cobra Kai in the karate kid,

1697
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.770
whatever that actor's name is,
who played that dude all the time.

1698
01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:33.690
He was in back to school.
He was the Goto Dick and all those movies.
Anyways,

1699
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:36.920
he was the guy who would knock a live [inaudible].

1700
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:40.350
My friend and I were known as the punk or skater kids.

1701
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:43.950
What's I always thought was funny since we were just normal kids who happen to

1702
01:47:43.951 --> 01:47:48.390
play music and would occasionally skateboard for transportation.
Yeah.

1703
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:53.040
Punk skater kids.
You think that that kid was just a football player?

1704
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:58.290
I'm sure he,
maybe he liked cooking also.
You didn't watch the breakfast club.

1705
01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:02.100
We stereotype at that age.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
which,
uh,

1706
01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:07.230
kids that are the,
sorry,
I keep losing my place here on anyways,

1707
01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:12.231
this asshole who will call Kent would try and start fight what fights with us in

1708
01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:16.950
halls and would have his minions come up and push us from behind and runaway.

1709
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.250
Nice to see.
Nothing has changed in high school.
Um,

1710
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.910
we honestly didn't give a shit about those kids,
so we ignored,

1711
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:26.610
ignored them most of the time.
Um,
subutex,

1712
01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.150
they were bigger than us and we didn't feel like getting our asses kicked.
Um,

1713
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:34.590
but finally the day came,
Ken came up,
this is where they can't take it no more.

1714
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.290
I like this.
Finally,
the day came up,

1715
01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.780
Ken came up to my friend in the parking lot,

1716
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.210
grabbed his skateboard out of his hand,

1717
01:48:42.211 --> 01:48:46.410
throw it on the ground and stuck his chin out saying,
hit me.
Come on,

1718
01:48:46.411 --> 01:48:48.300
you fucking faggot.
Hit me.

1719
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:56.250
Was this kid,
was he reading from a bed coming of age script?
Mind you,

1720
01:48:56.251 --> 01:49:00.750
my friend has never said a fucking word to this prick.
So I go,
yeah,
go ahead.

1721
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:04.740
Fuck an Adam.
Kent then says to me,
uh,

1722
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:09.750
you don't even want to fucking try.
I'll fucking kick your punk ass.

1723
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.430
Jesus.
This is right out of the bully handbook.
Uh,
but me being a,

1724
01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.460
but my friend being a smart ass said my punk ass or my sky ass in purse

1725
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:23.070
proceeded to sky dance around Kent.

1726
01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:26.340
It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

1727
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:29.850
I don't know what sky dancing is.

1728
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:33.290
Is that the move in that moment and is,
if,

1729
01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:36.780
are you two going to reinvent the personal computer?
Is this one?

1730
01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:40.820
This is what I see in your future.
Anyways,
let's continue on with this.
Here.
I,

1731
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:45.270
that night we went to Taco bell to get some food and decided to take revenge.

1732
01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:48.970
We each took our to go bags into the bathroom and looked,

1733
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:52.960
it took one of the most satisfying shits of our lives.

1734
01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:57.700
So you guys sitting in different stalls snickering at the son of your own shit,

1735
01:49:57.701 --> 01:50:01.900
hitting a plastic bag.
There's a lot of layers to this.
Uh,

1736
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:06.640
this movie here.
It's got the classic bully.
It's got the two nerds.

1737
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:07.750
They're bonding,

1738
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:12.010
sort of got a scat theme to it with a little Scott dancing.

1739
01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.010
You know,
if you,
if you write a treatment,

1740
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:18.070
you could probably get it made in this weird economy out here and now in

1741
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:19.500
Hollywood.
All right,

1742
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:23.440
let's plow to plow ahead here where we put the bags of shit in the trunk of my

1743
01:50:23.441 --> 01:50:27.760
car.
Please tell me you double bagged and drove over to,
and at this point,

1744
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:31.540
this kid,
so into the story,
he actually writes this kid's real name,

1745
01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:36.070
but we'll still call him Kent.
Uh,
we emptied a,

1746
01:50:36.071 --> 01:50:40.270
emptied the bags of shit into his mailbox while trying not to throw up from the

1747
01:50:40.271 --> 01:50:41.080
smell.

1748
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:46.080
The combination of our shit almost made a slurry and it was leaking out of the

1749
01:50:46.451 --> 01:50:49.480
sides of the mailbox.
Jesus Christ.

1750
01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.960
We spent out of the neighborhood but didn't get too far because we were both

1751
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:55.840
laughing so fucking hard.
I could barely keep the vehicle on the road.

1752
01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:57.220
The next week at school,

1753
01:50:57.221 --> 01:51:00.790
I heard some kids talking about what happened to Kent's mailbox.

1754
01:51:00.791 --> 01:51:03.730
I couldn't help but smile every time someone mentioned it.

1755
01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:08.690
And from then on Kent's new nickname at school was shitbox.

1756
01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:13.730
Uh,
my hope you enjoyed my disgusting story.
But uh,

1757
01:51:13.731 --> 01:51:17.540
I'm not usually one for revenge or shit jokes,
but this asshole deserved it.

1758
01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:20.120
I love the podcasts.
All right,
well there you go.

1759
01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:23.930
That's one way of what's he supposed to do?
We can't kick the shit out of him.

1760
01:51:23.931 --> 01:51:28.790
So he shits in a bag with his friend and they dump it into his mailbox.

1761
01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.610
There you go.
People were going to end on that.

1762
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:38.960
We're going to end on that.
The dungeons and dragons

1763
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:43.580
<v 2>venge story.
Um,
I mean,
well,
what happened?</v>

1764
01:51:43.581 --> 01:51:46.130
Did you ever find out why that is unsatisfying to me?

1765
01:51:46.131 --> 01:51:51.131
Did can't go out there and reaching for his bully magazine and got a handful of

1766
01:51:51.951 --> 01:51:55.970
a combined shit from the two of you or did his poor mom,

1767
01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.990
you know,
we had to carry that bully around in is in her,

1768
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.520
in her womb for nine months.

1769
01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:05.560
<v 9>I don't know.
I don't know what to do with it.</v>

1770
01:52:05.561 --> 01:52:07.330
I got all thrown off with my fucking,

1771
01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:13.310
the whole thing out of the goddamn
tape recorded crapping out on me.
Anyways,

1772
01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:17.270
that's the podcast for this week.
Ended on a whimper rather than a roar.
