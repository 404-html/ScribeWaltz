1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.793
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.590
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:08.110
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.230
Just checking in on you.
I'm just checking on you.
I hope this isn't too loud.

5
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:19.580
Hope it doesn't make too much noise.
I'm on the road.
Um,

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.920
so you get even even more of the bootleg experience Echo.

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.290
For some reason I am in a hotel room that has,
I would say,
Oh,

8
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.650
if I had to guess a 18 foot ceilings and no,

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.290
this is not some super swanky frigging place.

10
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:39.290
I think it's just an old building and uh,

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.830
and people were shorter back then walking around and wool suits all,

12
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:47.450
you know what it was,
they wore hats,
they wore big hats back then.

13
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:48.800
That was it.
That was the deal.

14
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.110
It was like probably no one guys is probably know whoever had the biggest fancy

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.130
<v 0>his hat</v>

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 1>that the women back then with the hoop skirts for probably all like,
oh,</v>

17
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.170
he probably got,
he's probably got all the money.

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.900
He's probably got all kinds of money.
Right.
Um,
of course,

19
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.260
you know,
psychologists would probably say that.
It was,

20
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.860
that was all about Dick size.
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.540
I don't think any guy really thinks about dick size unless he has a little Dick.

22
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.650
Other than that,
if you fucking,
you know,
it's like I'm an average runner.

23
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:25.360
I never think of,
no,
I actually wasn't.

24
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.730
I was slow and I never even thought about that.

25
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.243
<v 0>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.170
<v 1>You know what the reality comes down to,</v>

27
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.520
<v 0>okay.</v>

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.270
<v 1>It's not about Dick size.
It's about how much fucking money you make.</v>

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.720
<v 2>You know what I mean?
You meet some broad none bar.
What does she say?</v>

31
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:44.830
How big is your Dick?

32
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.550
<v 1>She doesn't.
She says,
what do you do?</v>

33
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.100
<v 2>All right.
Are you worth my time tonight?
You know,</v>

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.950
and even when she's out there just trolling for some cock,
you know what I mean?

35
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.030
And she's doing a little fucking checking your feet and your hands maybe taking

36
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.910
a glance down to see how you're hanging.
Right.

37
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.100
If he was some dockers and he was sitting down,

38
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.270
I don't know how the fuck they would tell fright.
Um,

39
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.610
she showed up in the barn sweatpants

40
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480
at some point,
even if she's out there just to get bank,

41
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.050
she is going to ask you what you fucking do.
They can't help.

42
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.120
And then I guess part of it is,

43
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.160
<v 1>you know,
you want to get past the awkward conversation and that is,
you know,</v>

44
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.130
what do you do is also like,
you know,
hey,
can you believe this weather?
Yeah.

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.910
<v 2>Hey,
can you believe this weather?
What do you do?
How big is your Dick?
You know,</v>

46
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.860
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.
And they go right down the thing.

47
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.040
And then that's when they determine if there's going to be a white one night

48
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:50.480
stand.
If they're going to pretend

49
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.810
<v 1>you know,
that they're not just some size queen and that,
that,
you know,</v>

50
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.370
maybe they go and they'll start talking about their family.
You know what I mean?

51
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:04.270
That's when you know you're fucked.
They started talking about their family.

52
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.070
It's like,
Oh God,
not this.

53
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.240
I always hope when you were just going to treat me like a piece of meat,

54
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.110
now you won't have a fucking relationship.
Fuck,
I should've lied about my job.
Um,

55
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.500
I don't know what I'm talking about.
As always.

56
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.850
I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.
Am I contractually obligated,

57
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.920
even though there's no contract on this podcast,

58
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.230
it's a verbal contract and I honor it.

59
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.850
Unlike what happened to Jakey Lee and a bunch of other musicians when they

60
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.610
played with for a certain somebody that everybody thinks is cute.

61
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.633
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.940
<v 1>Oh,
Sharon Sharon,</v>

63
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.850
how can Pharma we glad you remember all that shit.

64
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.590
I went down and fucking Jakey Lee,
Randy Rhoads.

65
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.590
Um,
I dunno what you call Brown down a rabbit hole.

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.570
And then that led me to bring up,

67
00:03:53.571 --> 00:03:57.440
I always read up on that fucking case where the original drummer and bass player

68
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.300
never got played on,
uh,
you know,

69
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.110
was it blizzard of Oz and diary of a madman as well?

70
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.520
The two albums,
I don't fucking know.

71
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.870
And they actually asked for the money for paying on those things.

72
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:16.340
So they fucking,
oh wait.
They ended up buying the rights to the album.

73
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.060
It was fucking enclosed.
It was,
I got the second,
it was a mini series.

74
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:22.460
It was like the Oj trial,
except with like recording.

75
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.640
So then are the Izea camp rerecorded the drums and the bass on it.

76
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.550
It's fucking unreal.
I mean,
let me look that shit up.

77
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.810
Let me look that up here as I'm just sitting here battling.
Um,

78
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.590
but anyways,
Jakey Lee,
what a fucking player.

79
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:44.000
I know Randy Rhodes is just unreal but shaky Lee never,
he never gets his,

80
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:47.960
he never gets a fucking shout out.
It goes,

81
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.250
it goes from fucking,
you know,
obviously Hendrix,
you know,

82
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.870
and then they'll throw some Clapton in there,

83
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:58.100
then they go to Jimmy page and then boom.
Then it's like Eddie van Halen.

84
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.590
There's like before Eddie and after a,

85
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.570
when it comes to white guys shredders and then they always go to Randy Rhoads

86
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.520
and then they skip right past

87
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.150
it seems they skip right past Jakey Lee and then they go right to that guy from

88
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.750
white lion.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what it is.
No,
cause I've done,

89
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.600
I think they get into the gut.
The fucking speed metal guys.
I have no idea.

90
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.170
All right,
let's see.
Drummer for

91
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930
blizzard of Oz.
Blizzard of all.
See?

92
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.370
Uh,
yeah,
we Kerslake new by the way,

93
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.770
just let himself go to health.
Christ Almighty.

94
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:40.330
He looks like he sold tires his whole fucking life.
That's how much stress,

95
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:45.070
this whole thing case,
um,
took on the guy.

96
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

97
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.440
<v 1>All right.
After being fired,
wait a minute.
Where are we?
Where are we?</v>

98
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.410
List of Osborne,
Osborne band members.

99
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.610
He doesn't even have his own fucking Wikipedia page.

100
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.050
Jesus Christ at Ozzy.
He has some fucking guitarist or what?

101
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.960
<v 1>Randy Rhoads.
Jakey Lee,
Zack Wylde,</v>

103
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:09.070
Steve Vai.

104
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.770
I don't know any of these other fucking guys.
Broody Syrah,

105
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.400
Sasso on base.
Come on,
man.

106
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.920
Isn't that crazy?
He had both fucking,
uh,

107
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.260
bass players surviving based players from Metallica.
Roberta Hilo.

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.160
He came in and rerecorded the basis basis.
You record the bass,
I guess.

109
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.630
Jason Newstead,
Tommy Aldridge.

110
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.400
I ran into him and fucking Belgium freaked him out because I was freaking out.

111
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.080
And then I didn't ask for a picture.
He looked relieved.
It's just like,
sorry,
man.

112
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.240
Thank you for all the great music you've,
you've given me.
I really appreciate it.

113
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.610
He goes,
all right,
cool.
And that was it.
All right.

114
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:01.960
I'm going to get off this fucking subject.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,

115
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.380
I am in Saint Petersburg,
Florida.
Tomorrow night.
However,

116
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.290
tonight I am in Tampa to say bump,
bump,
bump.
Bob,

117
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.390
good to do.
Yeah.
Um,
I'm going to see the Patriots play at,
uh,

118
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.820
at Joe Robbie Stadium.
Whatever the fuck they call it up here.
Um,
Donovan Smith.

119
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.720
Fucking memorial stadium.
I don't want you to call it Tampa.
The fucking,

120
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.040
<v 0>okay.</v>

121
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.340
<v 1>Pirates of the Caribbean stadium.
What the fuck is the name of it?</v>

122
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.960
It actually has a regular name.

123
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.400
The fuck is Tampa Goddamn fucking Tampa football stadium.

124
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.180
I know it.
I know this fucking name.
But anyways,

125
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:48.040
this is the last one I have to go to
here.
We got football stadium.

126
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.940
Come on,
come on.
What's it?
Raymond James Raymond James Stadium.

127
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.883
Um,

128
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.470
this is the last of the 32 professional football teams that I need to see a home

129
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.360
game of.
Uh,

130
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:04.970
this will be the 34th one that I've been to cause I went to Saint Louis Rams and

131
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.470
also the San Diego chargers.

132
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.710
And then they both moved to La and I went to those games because I guess I have

133
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:14.090
a problem.
Um,
so I'm looking for,
this is going to be fucking awesome.

134
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:15.290
Thursday night football,

135
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.560
they're going to get out there and they're under roos wearing all the same

136
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:23.540
colored fucking clothes.
Ultra patriots go with blue rather than read.

137
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.510
MMM.
The Red on red,
Jesus Christ.
It's just,
I don't know,

138
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.410
somebody is going to have to wear it because I think that,
uh,

139
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.560
but maybe Tampa would go with the gray.
I don't know guys.

140
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.170
I think that they should have a fashion runway to start it.
Um,

141
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.210
so of course the big,
the big question you gotta ask,
I'm,
you know,

142
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.060
I'm always into fucking a,
I'm a cunt.
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:46.010
So I don't give a fuck about the wide receivers.

144
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.230
I don't give a shit about your quarterback.
She run it back.

145
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:52.440
What's going on at the offensive line?
Christ's sake.

146
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.470
If he can't defend your fucking quarterback and you can't fucking blow up and

147
00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:00.960
some God damn holes,
you're not going to make any passes of running again.

148
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.020
I'll tell you right now,
you're not going to buy any yard in this fucking week.

149
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.740
I gotta be quiet because this thing is everyone's so loud here.
Um,

150
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.050
so what does it come down to?
The the fucking diva.
The offensive line.

151
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.420
All right.
They'll rock star the one that makes all the fucking money.

152
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.920
Nobody cares about the fucking guards.
Nobody gives a shit about the center.

153
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.620
Nobody gives a fuck about the right tackle.

154
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.340
It's all about the left tackle in the NFL,
protecting the blind side.

155
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:32.790
Unless she have a lefty.
Unless you have a lefty,

156
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.070
how many left the NFL fucking quarterbacks are there and how pissed as the left

157
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:41.730
tackle on that fucking line.
You know,

158
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.200
he finally gets his name.
Shout it out.
The next soldier,
right.
Does that,

159
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.760
he say's themes.
Naked soldier.
He's only been with us for fucking ever.

160
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.370
They just never say his name because he rarely fucks up.
Donovan Smith.

161
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.770
Let's give me my new thing.
No one,

162
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:03.600
the left tackles no one who's making the money up there on the offensive line.

163
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:07.770
So according to the scouting report,
Donovan Smith,
a Penn State guy,

164
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.600
Penn state guys,
always,
always solid football players.

165
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.460
Just a great program up there when they're not up there touching kids,

166
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.970
they just do wonderful things.
Wonderful God damn things you know,

167
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.810
and then not snap and towels and unsuspecting eight year olds.
Sorry Penn State,

168
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.260
you fucking earned it.
All right.
And you know good and God damn well,

169
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.670
despite what happened up there,

170
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:29.460
you still want to see the Joe Pa statute come back.
And what does that,

171
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.520
what does that say about you?
Um,

172
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.580
what does that say about statues?
What is,
you know,
what I do love about,
you know,

173
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.500
Penn state and it's not the molestation of children.
What I love,

174
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.390
you're going to get it.
This,
I'm going to give the Catholic Church Shit.

175
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:51.060
I got to give it to you too.
You know what I mean?

176
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:56.390
Penn state football program was like the Catholic Church fucking slide.

177
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.763
You know what I mean?

178
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.370
Like the Catholic church is like the Big Burger with the bacon on it when it

179
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:06.240
comes to fucking rape and kids and uh,
but you know,

180
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.500
just sheer number,
you know,
if you looked at,
at,
at,

181
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.100
at molested kids,
like you were counting calories,

182
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.640
all right?
They're definitely that Wendy's triple cheeseburger,

183
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.170
the Catholic churches where Penn state is just,
it's,
you know,

184
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:26.790
little sliders.
I'm just going to have,
I'm just going to nibble.
I told my thumb,

185
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:29.820
I've been doing so great at the gym.
I could cheat tonight,
but I'm,

186
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:34.380
Chet is gonna fucking nimble.
Um,
but I do love about the Penn state.

187
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.180
I realized it wasn't everybody up there who was raping children.

188
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.400
Okay.
Now that's when you know,
you've,

189
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.670
I know that's when you know your program is in trouble.

190
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.630
When in order to defend it,
you have to say,
hey,

191
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.180
not everybody was up there.
Rape and kids bump,
Blah Blah.

192
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.090
Doodoo dude.
All right.

193
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.420
I just liked that they have the basic simple fucking uniforms.
Okay.

194
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.530
Cause I gotta be honest with you,
the first time I saw those Oregon ducks,

195
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130
those crazy uniforms,
I was like,
what the fuck is that?

196
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.950
And then after a while I kind of liked them like,
Eh,
you know,
it's kind of cool,

197
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:15.250
whatever.
But now it's just become a fucking fashion show.

198
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.880
And there's a bunch of Shitty fucking football programs out there.

199
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:21.340
You know what I'm talking about?
University of Illinois,

200
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.760
where the fuck do you get off with that disco ball in your head?

201
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:28.630
Like you've ever been sniffed a big 10 championship since we were even in

202
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.240
fucking Vietnam.
Let's look that up right now.

203
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.220
Let's look that up right fucking now.

204
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.940
When was the last time that basketball school,
when a big time.

205
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.230
Big 10 champs t championship.
I can't fucking talk.
All right.

206
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:43.630
University of,

207
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

208
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.860
<v 1>Indiana tech.
Was I saying Illinois?
Sorry,
Indiana.
Um,</v>

209
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.400
<v 0>okay.</v>

210
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.540
<v 1>Last big 10 football.</v>

211
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.500
I guarantee you we were in covered covered wagons here.
Football Championship.

212
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.480
I guarantee you the starting 11 were all white guys.
Indiana.

213
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:10.560
Hoosier football.
Here we go.
They thought it'd be a quick Wikipedia page.

214
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.200
All right.
Um,
why am I picking on these guys are location,

215
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:20.820
conference,
bowl,
record three and eight conference titles too.

216
00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:24.510
They won one in 1945.
Bob At OPA.

217
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.310
[inaudible] we won the war.

218
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.170
Let's all make kids.
Let's all cure diseases.

219
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.220
Then we'll have a bunch of hurricanes cause with their own wind,

220
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.980
plastic in the ocean.
Um,
1967,
because

221
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.440
I will not seek,

222
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.470
nor will I accept a second term as your prayer.

223
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.200
Who the fuck does Lbj singing?
Sunshiny Your Life,
Huh?

224
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.130
Who should be is more importantly probably the question.

225
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.720
Um,
so anyways,
I'm going to the fucking game tonight.
Uh,

226
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.890
look for Jamison Winston to have a career day because our defense is like the

227
00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:14.050
make a wish foundation opposing quarterback.
What is your dream?
Gee,

228
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.000
I've always wanted to throw for 400 yards.
No problem.

229
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.800
Not only are we going to make that happen,

230
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:21.480
we're going to do it in the first half.

231
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.120
[inaudible] Gudu Gudu Gudu alright,
go fuck yourself now.

232
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:31.170
I just trashed my own team before you guys all get all butthurt no fucking pun

233
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:35.430
intended.
All right about me.
Making Fun of your God damn team.

234
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.920
Donovan Smith is the left tackle.

235
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.310
<v 0>Okay</v>

236
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.920
<v 1>for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He is from Penn state.</v>

237
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.610
He is evidently according to the one scouting report that I looked up,

238
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.940
has yet to live up to his potential

239
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:55.150
quick footed,
very athletic for his size,
has great hands,

240
00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.340
but has yet to live up to his potential.
I don't know if that's true or not,

241
00:15:00.341 --> 00:15:05.200
but if he is,
then I am going to,
I want to nominate him for the delight.
Howard,

242
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:10.120
not Dwight.
Dwight white people.
Dwight Howard,
not white.

243
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:14.380
Dwight Black Dwight Dwight.
All right,
Howard.

244
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.380
Given the Dwight Howard award,

245
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.140
every time you look at Dwight Howard,
you gotta be thinking,

246
00:15:22.141 --> 00:15:25.290
what the fuck is wrong with that guy?

247
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.160
That guy is like,
he's like a fucking superhero.

248
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.040
He's so God damn big.
It's so strong.
It's like,

249
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.960
why don't you just steal one move from Kevin Mchale to from a Kima Lodge one and

250
00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:39.910
just dominate the fucking league.

251
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.250
I don't know what he does all day.

252
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.530
He looks like he does curls and goes to the barber shop.

253
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.020
Tear is always perfect.
He's always fucking shredded,
but he just stick.

254
00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.090
There's no fire in the man's game.

255
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.060
<v 1>You know,
you know when you go and you play pickup hoop,
right?</v>

257
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.470
Like I've done that and this decade I have,

258
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.740
I can't remember last time you play pickup,
who put the fucking worst was,
well,

259
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.920
if you got that little fella garden,
you on defense.
You know what I mean?

260
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.470
And you'd fuck the fucking guy was just all over you.

261
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.193
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

262
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.190
<v 1>Is fucking junk was right on your leg.
It's like I get it.
I get it.</v>

263
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.350
You're taking this seriously.

264
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:28.190
When you get the fuck off me just d and you're up full court fucking press.

265
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:32.060
It's like,
buddy,
we're just out here to fucking burn off some calories.

266
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

267
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.410
<v 1>You know,
we all ate a Caesar Salad then just figure it out.
The dressing.</v>

268
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.080
It was like eating a fucking burger.
Can you just,

269
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.840
can you let me just run to the fucking half court line?

270
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.593
<v 0>MMM.</v>

271
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.860
<v 1>Anyways,
so,
uh,
yeah,</v>

272
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.880
I don't know what the fuck is going on with our defense.
Um,

273
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.770
I have no idea.
As I mentioned,

274
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.910
as I mentioned on our last podcast are safeties and,

275
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.980
and in our corner,
one of our corners,

276
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.320
they've all played with each other for fucking years and the only,
yeah,

277
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.270
no guys is Stefan Gilmore and I,

278
00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:16.720
I can't imagine that the entire defense is going to shit because of one fucking

279
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.550
quarterback.
I'll have to watch tonight sitting up high.

280
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.240
What does he play?
Does he play on the right side of the defense?
I don't know.

281
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.080
All I know is Tampa doesn't have any fucking sacks for the sheer,

282
00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:32.410
I kept looking up.
There's no fucking way.
They have no sex went into October.

283
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.650
They have no sex.
Are they protesting?
Um,

284
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.290
I dunno what violence against fucking white quarterbacks.

285
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.670
You never know what the NFL,

286
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:45.090
it's always about a co because they finally got rid of the pink.

287
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:50.270
Now it's domestic violence awareness month as if nobody aware that there was

288
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.670
domestic violence.
You know,

289
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.860
I'll tell you what's fucked up is anytime professional football player beats his

290
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:01.980
wife,
it becomes national fucking news.
Okay.

291
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:06.750
Yet a plumber can slap his wife around through a fucking 25 30 year marriage.

292
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:11.340
And you're never going to hear about it on ESPN or you know,

293
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.020
you are not.
And what are they going to do?

294
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.170
They're going to create this false fucking image that athletes are the only ones

295
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:23.421
out there who occasionally flip out when there's ranch dressing rather than blue

296
00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:27.560
cheese for their buffalo wings.
Right?

297
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

298
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.960
<v 1>God forbid if an athlete does something,
it's all over the fucking news.</v>

299
00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:39.920
But if an account accountant fucking starts shaking his wife a little bit too

300
00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:44.270
much in an Applebee's,
you know,
does ESPN,
do they cover that?

301
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:50.150
Does the NFL suspend that account?
No,
they do not.

302
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.450
So I want to ask you,
how much does ESPN,

303
00:18:53.451 --> 00:18:57.750
how much does he end up felt truly care until they start covering the domestic

304
00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:58.584
violence?

305
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

306
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.710
<v 1>Done by all men comedians too.
I'll tell you right now,</v>

307
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.330
I put my wife in a triangle right before I went on the road.
Okay.
I said,

308
00:19:08.331 --> 00:19:11.360
this house is going to be quick when I get home.
Um,

309
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.970
this isn't a funny topic that should not be joked about.

310
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.620
I'm now going to fucking grandstand about it as I wear clothes that were made in

311
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:26.160
a sweatshop.
Cause I care.

312
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.860
I got my wife with a good one yesterday.
Um,

313
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.260
I text her,
uh,
I texted her,
hey,

314
00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:39.650
when I get back to town,
I'm going to take you to Barney's,
you know,

315
00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:41.360
it's his fancy clothing place,
right?

316
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.810
That I never heard about it until there was a woman in my life.
And that is,

317
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:46.490
that is a 100% truth.

318
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.300
And then they turn around and they wonder why every once in a while they catch

319
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:53.820
it back camp.
We're taking callers.
Um,

320
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.410
<v 0>I uh,</v>

321
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.570
<v 1>yeah,
it's a fancy place.
This clothing store called Barneys.
So I text her,</v>

322
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:06.070
you know,
cause now that I have the little one,
my little bull bear,

323
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.080
um,
the level of guilt that I have when I go on the fucking road.

324
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.480
I mean,
I got to ask other parents,
like,

325
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.360
when do you hit the ceiling of the love that you feel for your kid?

326
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.040
It's like every day.
It just,
it just keeps,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
uh,

327
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.130
it's like Wah,
you know,
I don't watch game of Thrones,

328
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:28.880
but like every year when the new season comes out,

329
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:32.390
like the fucking excitement gets higher.
And I always think,
well,

330
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:36.800
at some point it's got to level off and it's not happening.

331
00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:41.801
So like you've never had a kid coming home to your kid is the same level of

332
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:46.310
excitement of these nerds on Twitter when a new season of game of Thrones comes

333
00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:50.710
up.
Okay.
The same falsetto excitement goes into your voice.

334
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.600
It's unbelievable.
Um,
so I have a tremendous amount of guilt when I leave now,

335
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:59.320
but I mean,
everybody's got to eat.
So I gotta you know,
I mean,

336
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:04.180
a plumber keeps plumbing is sinks,
right?
Um,
so,

337
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.014
um,

338
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.613
<v 0>okay,</v>

339
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.140
<v 1>what the fuck was my point
coming home?
Oh yeah.</v>

340
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.410
So I have all this guilt.
So,
um,
I texted me,
I said,

341
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.260
Hey Neil,
when I get home,
when I get back,
I'm taking it to Barney's.

342
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.500
And she goes,
she's like,
oh my God.
Exclamation at some point.
She goes,
yeah,

343
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.910
<v 0>really?
And then I text back.
Beanery</v>

344
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.960
<v 1>the good one.
She's such a hot shit.
She fucking laughed her off.</v>

345
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.310
Barney's beanery by the way,
is a a isn't,

346
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:47.311
it isn't a an La eatery out here where they give you a completely irresponsible

347
00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.930
level of food when you go in there irresponsible.

348
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.700
If you care about human life,

349
00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:00.290
I'll heroic portion of food if you're truly informed and concerned about the

350
00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:04.440
environmental issues that are about to hit us.

351
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.550
Last week I was writing for hurricane monthly

352
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.810
and if you look up that article recently,
I want a doctorate at uh,

353
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.860
at Massasoit community college and now I feel,
I know.
Thanks.

354
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.890
So of course now I am going to have people refer to me as a doctor for the rest

355
00:22:28.531 --> 00:22:31.320
of my life.
Like bill Cosby.

356
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:35.100
Didn't bill Cosby always do that doctor bill Cosby.
It's like,
dude,

357
00:22:35.101 --> 00:22:37.590
you got an honorary degree.
Unless I'm out of my fucking mind,

358
00:22:37.591 --> 00:22:42.420
I shouldn't have said his name.
Speaking of Penn State,
uh Oh Geez.

359
00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:46.380
It's spelled Jesus.
Jesus.
She,
everybody's just getting trashed on this one.
Well,

360
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:50.580
you know what,
I'm a little grumpy.
Okay.
I took a fucking red on.
You know,

361
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:52.050
it's funny,
I'm sitting there saying I miss my kid.

362
00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:55.440
But I'm still a selfish and came out here a day early to go to a football game

363
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.470
to,
to fucking,
well,
you know what?
I still have doubt my hobbies.

364
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.170
I'm a big believer in that.
You gotta be a little selfish still as a dead.

365
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.510
All right bill,
Talk Yourself off the guilt ledge.

366
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.340
Give yourself the free fucking pass here.
No,

367
00:23:08.341 --> 00:23:11.100
you still have to have you fucking hobby.
Um,

368
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.450
you know something to look forward to when the,
when your kid,

369
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.990
you're fucking bundle of joy finally falls asleep.
You know what I mean?

370
00:23:18.991 --> 00:23:22.440
Everybody goes,
Hey,
when your kid sleeps you sleep.
You know what I say?

371
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:25.500
I say fuck that.
You go out in the garage,
you play a couple of pair of doodles.

372
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.520
All right?
You go on the Internet and you learn how to play crazy train.

373
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.030
That's what you do,
okay?

374
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:38.930
You don't sleep is for sleep is for liberals that care about other air quote

375
00:23:39.811 --> 00:23:43.620
care about other people.
Okay.
If you look at conservative people,

376
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.370
those people never sleep,
okay?

377
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.580
Cause they don't like anybody and they just sit there staring out their fucking

378
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:53.000
window.
Even if they have a conservative next door neighbor,

379
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:57.290
they do not trust them.
Okay.
Cause they,
they are,

380
00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:59.480
they are type a can you be a type a liberal?

381
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

382
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.820
<v 1>I don't know what type B is.
Type A is fucking annoying.
You know what I mean?</v>

383
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:06.110
That's basically what it is.

384
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.900
Tape is the kind of person that needs a fucking entourage,
right?

385
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.380
Type A's,
the kind of person that goes through the security line at the airport.

386
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.840
Right.
And when he gets to the other side,

387
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.620
takes all his fucking shit out and doesn't fucking get his been out of the

388
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.020
fucking way.
He doesn't give a shit.
It's all about him.

389
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.933
<v 3>You know,</v>

390
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.070
<v 1>if you broke,
if you did like a fucking,
uh,</v>

391
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.260
an airport security combine,
okay.

392
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.460
And you watched me go through,
rather than running the 40 yard deaths,

393
00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:40.001
it's you getting,

394
00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:44.740
you're getting ready to get your all your shit off and you're fucking laptop

395
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.630
out.
Okay.
I would test off the fucking charts.

396
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:52.450
Of course.
I'll always be the slow fucking white dude that I am,

397
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:54.370
but when I get to the other fucking side,

398
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.633
<v 3>all right.</v>

399
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.660
<v 1>When I get to the underside after I've been fucking slowly cooked in that little</v>

400
00:25:01.661 --> 00:25:05.080
microwave that they sticky and what she know something I've actually just given

401
00:25:05.081 --> 00:25:08.830
it to at this point,
if they want to slowly kill me,
I say good.

402
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.650
I say good for them.
You know,
why?

403
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.670
Because we're overpopulated and who am I to say that I should still be here?

404
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Led the lizard people fucking kill everybody and start over again with the

405
00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:23.770
robots were taken costs.
Um,

406
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.980
so I get through when I get on the other side,

407
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.150
that's when Bill Bella checks going to draft me when everybody else looks past

408
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:33.100
me.
Okay.

409
00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:36.250
With my Bunker Hill community college educational background,

410
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.930
just given all kinds of community colleges shouts out from Massachusetts shout

411
00:25:40.931 --> 00:25:45.550
outs this week.
Um,
this Thursday,
um,
this is when

412
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.250
bill Bellacheck would finally smiled.

413
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.080
Like the Grinch at the end of the Grinch stole Christmas is when he saw me

414
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.370
fucking not only get my fucking bins,

415
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.620
I grab everybody else's bins

416
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.490
and Mumble,
come on people loud enough for people to hear,

417
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:09.590
but not loud enough for anyone to address me.

418
00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.523
<v 3>Right.</v>

419
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.130
<v 1>And he sees that I lead by example.</v>

420
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

421
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.740
<v 1>The,</v>

422
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.320
the level of judging that I do when I go to the fucking airport security line,

423
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.710
and when you fucking take your shit out of the Bin and you just fucking leave it

424
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:31.600
there,
I'm like,
you are a selfish fucking cunt.
You get,
you're a terrible mother.

425
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:36.250
You're a terrible father.
You're a terrible fucking person.
Okay.

426
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.260
And if I was as blessed is that fat fuck in North Korea to be running everything

427
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.730
in stealing all the ham,
keeping it all for myself,
right?

428
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.600
He gets a haircut every day.
That's selfish.
Fuck.

429
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

430
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.340
<v 1>Is All these people are fucking starving probably because of the economic stank</v>

431
00:26:56.341 --> 00:27:00.930
shanks sanctions that the free world has placed upon him.
And he's like,

432
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.900
fuck that.
I'm the leader.
I get all the pork chops.

433
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.080
I need to stay clear between my big butcher block fucking head.

434
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:16.320
All right?
I need to stay clear to know when it is,
when it's time,

435
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.170
because we're dealing with the Lord.
I want to how scared they are of Trump.

436
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.350
It's just kind of fun.

437
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.240
This is like we're matching crazy homeless guy to crazy homeless guy.

438
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.990
Remember they had those things.
Bum fights.

439
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.730
That's what's going on at the fucking political level.
This is a bum fight.

440
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.410
All right.
Don't let the uniform in the fucking suit,

441
00:27:36.411 --> 00:27:38.690
which a lot of people will say is a uniform.

442
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.040
<v 0>Okay?</v>

443
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.390
<v 1>A lot of people in the liberal arts major of a college will say that it is,</v>

444
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.360
that it is a uniform,
that it is a boys' club,

445
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.510
that it is a system that needs to be shut down and they'll say this as they

446
00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:54.770
don't wear a fucking Bra.

447
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.000
What the tits swinging too and fucking fro as if they're making a statement.

448
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.490
I love that thing that women want to do,
like the people,

449
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.500
the women that are rejecting bras.

450
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.650
It's just this is some sort of restricted thing.
It's like,
Hey,

451
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.830
we were doing you a favor.
We already stare your Teddy's enough.

452
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.010
If you want to walk around with your nipple sticking out of your fucking shirt,

453
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.270
if you ever think that that's going to get fucking old on our side of the fence,

454
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.740
I say you remove your bronze and your room,
you remove them.
Now,
um,

455
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.060
you know,
I should do more podcasts with 50 foot ceilings.
I think my ego,

456
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.230
just that there's finally enough space in a room for my fucking head.

457
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.140
I'm excited.
I'm going to a football game tonight.

458
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.760
My last one,

459
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.370
my last one that I have to go to and I've been to all the baseball,

460
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.090
all of the football.
Who the fuck can say that?
You think I'm going to stop there?

461
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.140
I'm not.
I'm going to see all the hockey and all the basketball.

462
00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.330
You think I'm going to stop there?
I'm not.

463
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:54.800
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

464
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.850
<v 1>I went to the Daytona 500 I'm going to Talladega next year.</v>

465
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.090
I've been to the Kentucky Derby.
I don't give it this.
I'm doing the fucking road.

466
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.120
I'm going to every bread and circus puts your fucking thoughts on hold sporting

467
00:29:08.271 --> 00:29:12.050
event that this great nation has.
And when I'm done here,

468
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.400
I'm going overseas.

469
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

470
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.980
<v 1>Can you think I'm eating?</v>

471
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.690
You do think I'm fucking above going to a cricket match?

472
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.660
Arguably the greatest drinking game ever,
ever created.

473
00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:28.360
If you go to a traditional one,
it takes a fucking a week to play.

474
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.190
You can literally go on a week long fucking bender and your wife can't say

475
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:36.430
anything.
It's like what honey?
I told you I was going to the game.

476
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.100
Am Am I allowed to have a little bit of fun life?
Um,

477
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.300
NHL starts tonight.
Bump up.

478
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.103
Um,

479
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:51.610
<v 0>yeah,</v>

480
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.600
<v 1>and I believe I heard through the grapevine that ESPN guts the Formula One</v>

481
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:58.960
contract for next year.
So Espn,
could you do me a favor?

482
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.200
Can you please not apply?

483
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.130
You're progressive formula,
whatever the fuck it is that you're doing.

484
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.180
I know you're taking on water over there because everybody's watching sports on

485
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:17.050
the APP,
but can you please,
can you please keep Formula One,

486
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.900
the international gem that it is.

487
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:24.901
Can you please not replace everybody and get a bunch of Americans in there,

488
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.283
right.

489
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.790
One from each race like they do on the MTV real world.

490
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.390
And then you have a woman running it,
whatever it is.
And then in the end,

491
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:37.900
you feel good about yourselves before you go back to your white,

492
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.910
your whites only gated community.

493
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.460
I'm fucking with you.
I don't give a shit.
Just,

494
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:47.080
I don't give a fuck if it's all women.

495
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.340
I don't give a fuck if everybody's sweat healing helion.
However you said,

496
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.840
can you just get somebody out there that knows what the fuck they're talking

497
00:30:55.841 --> 00:31:00.490
about and can deliver their points without screaming movie quotes?

498
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.630
Okay.
Can you do that?

499
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

500
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.520
<v 1>Can you do that without going around the horn and having some fucking goddamn</v>

501
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.830
air raid siren going off for fucking every 20 minutes,

502
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.830
that fucking shelf?

503
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.320
Anybody can explain to me how points are earned in lost on that show.

504
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.840
I swear to God,
you should be running this nation.

505
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

506
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.270
<v 1>All right.
Um,
do you think why you guys,
listen,</v>

507
00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:30.000
this is just the ramblings of a crabby old man.
I'll tell you,

508
00:31:30.001 --> 00:31:31.260
you know something that I don't understand.

509
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.800
I don't understand why the Internet every fucking day has to tell me that this

510
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:37.440
is the greatest fucking thing that I'm ever going to see.

511
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.830
And I also don't understand why I'm so fucking stupid.

512
00:31:40.831 --> 00:31:44.700
Like a moth flying towards a fucking bright light in the middle of the night.

513
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.700
I always click on it and it,
oh,
it always underwhelms me

514
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.330
like the Shannon Sharpe thing this week.

515
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.300
What the fuck was so fucking amazing about that?

516
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.913
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

517
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.010
<v 1>I'm on that.
And mild in that hand dog and everybody,</v>

518
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.370
like the one that I clicked on,
was it,

519
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.380
it was at this moment that Shannon Sharpe became the president of the United

520
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.000
States.
He's putting a cheap cigar in his mouth,

521
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:15.160
making a reference to the boozy lakes.

522
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:16.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

523
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:20.330
<v 1>That's the greatest thing that ever happened.
I mean,
I,
I guess,
I don't know.</v>

524
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.560
You're telling me,
you telling me like that that's better than then

525
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.950
when Ossie played live
on that fucking TV show,

526
00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:38.951
looks like a basic cable show and he came out with a tracksuit that said Ozzie

527
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
it in case he forgot what his fucking name was and he had Rudy Sarillo on base.

528
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.740
Randy Rhodes on guitar and fucking Tommy Aldridge on drums.

529
00:32:51.091 --> 00:32:51.750
And you see,

530
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.920
you see like Ozzy literally turning around in awe of his own fucking band.

531
00:32:55.921 --> 00:32:56.810
Get telling me,

532
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.283
<v 0>yeah,</v>

533
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.280
<v 1>dead.
A guy taking a Dutch master and he would be one thing if he had the fucking</v>

534
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:08.270
bottle of booze right there.
You know what it is,
Bill.

535
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.250
It's just young people having fun and you're taking it literally and you know

536
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:15.920
what you're doing.
You're doing,
when you said you always weren't going to do,

537
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.570
which is you,
you were,
you were not going to hang around young people.
You,

538
00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:22.790
you knew that your time had come and gone and you were going to let them have

539
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:27.110
their fucking fun.
You know what?
So I apologize.
You guys are absolutely right.

540
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:29.990
That was the greatest thing that ever happened.
And he should be the next wall.

541
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:33.740
I mean,
the next leader.
That'd be actually a great fucking thing.

542
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:38.741
If you had him as leader and then he was communicating with that guy in North

543
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.240
Korea,

544
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.920
then the guy in North Korea could not get mad because he could not understand

545
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:47.600
what the fuck Shan is sharps talking about.

546
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:52.620
Do you remember in World War II when we had like native Americans speaking and

547
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.540
uh,
communicate and shit and the Japanese couldn't crack it?
Yeah.

548
00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.620
Shannon Sharpe is the modern day version of that.
I'll never understand it.

549
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:01.941
I don't know why.

550
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:04.910
Just because I could understand every fucking word that he said is a pro.

551
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:09.020
He was fucking hilarious,
you know,
sending the Patriot missiles and all that.

552
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:13.470
The second he became a commentator,
I dunno what happened.
Um,
all right,

553
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.910
Luke Craig.
So he stuck his tongue in a fucking beehive.
All right,

554
00:34:17.911 --> 00:34:20.370

558
00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:35.190
What I can't even fucking read out loud.

589
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.490
they could literally write that in Spanish and I would fucking understand it

590
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:27.180
just as much as what I just said.
Their thought fee.
Everybody.

how everyone at some point has wished they could have have beer,

wine or liquor delivered.
Oh,

And I love the John Wade vibe of this copy.

595
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.373
<v 3>MMM.</v>

596

Well just write them and I'll read them.
Introducing thought fee.

598

599
00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:00.000
beer and liquor,
right to your door on demand.
You know,

600
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:01.920
I watched this fucking twilight zone.

601
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.973
<v 3>MMM.</v>

602
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.030
<v 1>The twilight zone of,
what's it called?
16 millimeter prison or whatever.</v>

603
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.210
And it was about this aging ingenue.

604
00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:17.420
She used to be this big star in the 1930s and she couldn't handle the fact that

605
00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:19.120
she wasn't young anymore.
So she just,

606
00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:24.121
she just sat in her mansion in this dark room watching all of her old movies,

607
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:29.330
drinking booze.
And as I watched it,
I was like,
I would love to fucking do that.

608
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:31.670
What'd you just love to take a decade off from your life?

609
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.680
They can just watch old home movies of back when you were sober.
You know,

610
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.610
it could get out of bed without making noises and shit.
Right.

611
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.300
And just sit there and you know,

612
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.570
there is something to be said about drinking yourself to death.

613
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

614
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.860
<v 1>You know,</v>

615
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.950

616
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:50.784

Five four club also understands that your time is extremely valuable.

638
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.840
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around stores when he can sit at home and

Five four club partners.

644

645
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.800
the fo five o with two fucking safeties is that the cover to um,

So you'll get the same quality as top designer clothes for way less.

648
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:50.590
They've been helping men with fashion for over 15 years and shipped a 100,000

649
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:51.520

652
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.930

653
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:08.140
speaks about themselves in the third person.
This is fucking ridiculous.

654
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.030
There's still another half a paragraph.

655
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.760
Let's count how many times they say that their name again.

They know what they're doing.

It's a fact of life.
It's also a cliche.

659
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:29.500
You don't need to say that you get $120 worth of clothes for just $60 a month.

You know,

675
00:41:29.241 --> 00:41:34.241
there's a fine line between being that person that has in their life and then

676
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.570
like you have way too many fucking photos on your fucking wall and it's like,

677
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:42.170
is this person stalking somebody?
You know what I mean?

678

So when you use frame bridge,

679
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:46.790
make sure there's enough up there of your dog and you know,

we'll share it with the rest of the Internet and it'll become a meme and you'll

688

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.030
All right.
Uh,
hang on a second.
My fault.

714
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.870
I thought the game was at seven.

715
00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

716
00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:01.020
<v 1>All right.
Now I got him all fucking nervous.
All right,
that's it.
Oh good.</v>

717
00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:04.320
I've got time to do my first elliptical.
Now that I fucking,
oh,

718
00:44:04.321 --> 00:44:06.300
did I tell you guys,
I got my first Mri,

719
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.890
I got one on my shoulder and then I got one on my calf to make sure I don't have

720
00:44:10.891 --> 00:44:15.120
any blood clots from whatever the fuck I did to my leg.
You know what I mean?

721
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:20.760
They didn't want to stroke out while I was doing fucking jumping jacks.
Um,

722
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.280
so anyways,
Jesus Christ,
it's fucking hilarious.

723
00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:27.270
She go in there and sometimes they let you use headphones from what I've heard.

724
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:30.600
But my place that I went to,
which by the way was fucking hilarious.

725
00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:34.380
I walk and the chick behind the desk is all tatted up and I'm like,

726
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.010
like to the point,
it's like,
do you play in a band?
If you don't,
you should.

727
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.910
She look like a rock star,
but she's wearing scrubs.
You know,

728
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.040
that should have been my first red flag.

729
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:47.430
Like what kind of fucking medical places this,
I mean,
she was cool as shit,

730
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:48.300
but I'm just saying,
you know,

731
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.110
so then I go down there and when I get out it's cash only.

732
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.950
The second business is cash only,

733
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:58.410
and there's not a bunch of of Italians running it.
I'm like,
all right,

734
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:01.980
what the fuck is going on here?
There's something about Italians cash only.

735
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:04.110
You know what I mean?
It's just,
it's like,
oh,

736
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.700
that piece of America that's now gone.
It's actually quite,
but everybody else,

737
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:12.900
I'm like,
what kind of fucking kind of shit is going on here?
Um,

738
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.450
all right,
so that's the podcast here.
Oh,

739
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:20.330
look at that and give you 45 minutes on a Thursday.
Um,
that's it.
Oh,
Billy.

740
00:45:20.331 --> 00:45:24.990
No Fun.
49 days.
No booze,
no fucking Busan.

741
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:26.703
<v 4>MMM.</v>

742
00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.770
<v 1>Oh Geez.
I gotta take this call.
All right,
I'll have a great weekend and I'll,
uh,</v>

743
00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:32.860
I'll talk to you on Monday then.

744
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:52.180
<v 5>She
was</v>

745
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.310
with dominion,
Indiana boys on in Indiana.

746
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
The way was more than I was damn close.

747
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.930
Dot.
You said a big baby,

748
00:46:19.931 --> 00:46:23.400
but got to keep moving on.

749
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:37.763
<v 6>Yes.</v>

750
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.310
<v 7>Um,
wife's family.
The secret upstairs.
All right.
Hey,</v>

751
00:47:04.311 --> 00:47:06.410
bill loved the podcast and all the bullshit.

752
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.970
So I've been dating this lady who I completely love,
can't get enough for her.

753
00:47:10.971 --> 00:47:13.880
We've been going out for a solid two years now.
Good for you.

754
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.600
There is always been a rule at her house.

755
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.770
She lives with their parents because she's in a program in order to become a vet

756
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:26.060
tech.
So money's tight for her that I am not allowed to go upstairs ever.

757
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.970
All right.
Being a guy,
I have no with this.
Uh,

758
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:35.300
I'll bender over the pool table and her,
Jesus Christ,
dude,
where this,

759
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.080
this took a left turn.
I'll bend her over the pool table.

760
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:39.910
Her father built because fuck it.

761
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.780
If you try to stop me from banging her in the bed,
I'll just find another way.

762
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.680
All right.
To what?
What did that have to do with what you're talking about?

763
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.240
You got me all interested in.
Why can't you go upstairs?

764
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.230
Like there's this big mystery.
Now all of a sudden you're like,
well fine,

765
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:03.710
I'll vendor over the fucking hot water heater downstairs.
He can't stop me.

766
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.250
All right.
Hi.
I'm hoping you're going to get back on track here.

767
00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:10.730
That was like a weird beat,
a B story.
Um,
he goes,

768
00:48:10.731 --> 00:48:15.731
so I finally get annoyed at this whole no upstairs policy and decide to do a

769
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.490
little investigating.
Well,
aren't you just a nosy little cunt?

770
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.240
Did you finally get annoyed of the rules of a house that isn't yours?

771
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.320
You know what,
sir?
So this far into your email,
I don't like you.

772
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.110
I don't like that whole shit.
We deal.
You haven't.

773
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.990
You're disrespecting her father and Santa.

774
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.230
I'm going to fuck your daughter over the pool table that you built.
All right.

775
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.410
That's supposed to be internal monologue.

776
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.390
You're not supposed to share that with others

777
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.110
anyways.
No one in the house at this point,
by the way.

778
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:56.310
Oh,
there's no one in the house.
Why can't you guys help me out?

779
00:48:56.311 --> 00:49:01.200
You know I suck at reading.
He,
okay.
There's no one in the house at this point,

780
00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:03.090
by the way.
I work third shift,

781
00:49:03.091 --> 00:49:06.450
so they leave me the fuck alone between 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

782
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:11.820
I went upstage upstairs and I find a garbage in the hallway.

783
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:16.500
Every room is filled with junk and there's only one way to enter it.

784
00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.840
This is every room,
her parent's room,
hers,
the office.

785
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.160
It's all a complete nightmare just waiting for Tlc to show up.

786
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.820
I'm now giving you that.

787
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.130
How can I approach this ordeal with her?

788
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.400
I love her to death and she may be moving in with me sometime between the next

789
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.540
few months.
This shit is not gonna fly with me,

790
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:43.620
but I know that if a resident gets that bad,

791
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.570
that there is something wrong with them.
Mentally.
She has always been messy.

792
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:52.290
But then again,
I'm a fucking cop who doesn't have time to clean up my place.

793
00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:56.550
So maybe this is the calm before the storm with this chick.

794
00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.820
Um,
yeah,
that's really fucked up now.

795
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.373
<v 0>Okay.</v>

796
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.010
<v 7>All right.
Well,
you know something,
you're already broke the seal.</v>

797
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.370
This is what I would do.
This is so fucking creepy

798
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.570
if you,
if you really want to make a go with this girl,
I guess.

799
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.230
I guess.
I guess I would go back up there again

800
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:31.430
and I go into her room and just have a look around and look like if that's some

801
00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:36.420
parents shit or if that's her shit.
You know what I mean?

802
00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:42.160
Um,
and if it's her shit,
I would be,
uh,

803
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.700
at Jesus is fucking brutal.
The things you don't,
what the big thing is,

804
00:50:45.701 --> 00:50:47.950
is the fact that the downstairs is immaculate.

805
00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:52.840
So they're there.
They're only halfway down the rabbit hole.

806
00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:58.500
Um,
I dunno dude.
You know what?
This is your tree.
You're fucking sitting in it.

807
00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.750
I don't that there's no way to bring up that you went upstairs without just

808
00:51:01.751 --> 00:51:06.200
saying I went upstairs.
What are you going to say?

809
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.420
Well,
the bath the eyes is what year is what you do.
This is what you do.

810
00:51:11.421 --> 00:51:14.840
You're clog up the bathroom downstairs.
All right.

811
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

812
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.240
<v 7>Just clog up the fucking toilet downstairs.</v>

813
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.440
I don't know how you'd do it,
but just clog that fucker up.

814
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:29.210
Okay.
And then just say I had to take a shit.

815
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.680
I,
it was nowhere else to go.
I had to do it right.

816
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.970
And then you just say you went upstairs,
saw what the fuck it was,

817
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:41.540
and then you went back downstairs.
All right.
So that's what you do,

818
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:44.840
clog up the toilet and just blame it on the fact that you had to take your shit.

819
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.890
Why am I helping you with this lie?
And it was funny to me.
Who gives a fuck?

820
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:50.683
There you go.

821
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:55.470
And that's what you do and then address it all right.

822
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.700
Or You just man up and just say,
listen,
all right,

823
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.790
the curiosity,
this is,
this is,
this is the man's way of doing it.
That's,

824
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:06.760
that's the bitch way of doing it.
So of course I know how to do that way.

825
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:10.360
The man just sits down and says,
listen,
I

826
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.060
was fucking weird me out that I could never go upstairs.

827
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:19.410
I just wanted to top of stairs and I looked to see what the fucking big deal
was,

828
00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:23.190
you know,
like was it made out of gold that you got a sex slave up there?

829
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.390
You know,
there's some dead body.
What the fuck's going on up there?
And uh,
yeah,

830
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.540
that type of shit.
You know,
that's your world.
That's your life.
But uh,

831
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.950
that's not going to happen.
If we have a move in together,
all right,

832
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.453
then she's going to give it,

833
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:42.490
I can't believe that she went upstairs way and I told you not to,

834
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:45.920
you just broken the trust.
And,
and they'd be like,
all right,

835
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:48.460
and let her just do it.
Let her get all of that out.
And then you go,

836
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.090
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
What about you?
Okay,
so I just broke the trust.

837
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:56.960
But you know,
you're the one,
you're kind of,
you had this giant secret,

838
00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:03.080
so you got secrets.
So you kind of fuck with the trust first,
you know,

839
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.210
do you know there's a dead cat up there?
Do you understand that?

840
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.010
Does it fucking dead cat up there?

841
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.260
So I dunno dude,
do one thing or another.

842
00:53:13.261 --> 00:53:15.690
You can do the pussy thing and do the toilet clogged up thing.

843
00:53:15.691 --> 00:53:19.890
I gave you two options there,
sir.
The pussy bitch way or just be a fucking man.

844
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.810
Just take her out,
set it down and just say,
listen,
I got,

845
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.630
I gotta tell you something.
All right.
Uh,

846
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.310
I'm feel ashamed that I did this,

847
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:35.420
but my curiosity got the best of me and I went to the top of stairs and I just

848
00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.790
peeked to see what the big deal was with the upstairs.

849
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.503
<v 3>Uh,</v>

850
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.600
<v 7>and you know,
then she'll probably start running away.
But you know,
women,</v>

851
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.510
they don't know how to run.
Most of them.

852
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:50.230
Women can either run like a fucking track star or they just rent.

853
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.440
They run like it's,
they run like toddlers.

854
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.193
<v 3>Okay.</v>

855
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.990
<v 7>You know,
so many of them,
I swear to God,
I'm not saying you don't see the,</v>

856
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.820
an uncoordinated guide jog and every once in a while,
but we,
you know,

857
00:54:05.821 --> 00:54:09.210
we play sports.
We know how to run you guys.
I don't know what you'd do.

858
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:13.950
You sit around plotting hmm.
Making fucking rumors about each other.
Jesus bill.

859
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:18.080
Well,
you know why it took a while this week,
didn't it?
43 minutes in before I,

860
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.430
they said some ignorant shit about women.
I'm getting better.

861
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.720
I had to get a nice clean half hour there.
Um,

862
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.640
so when she runs away from you like a,
you know,
somebody blew out her knee.
Yeah.

863
00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.670
You'll just sort of jog behind her until she gets tired.
Um,

864
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:37.020
or just wait til she's wearing high heels until you tell her that,

865
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:40.290
that gives you an even better chance,
you know?
And she's screaming,

866
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.620
screaming and boohooing and crying and all that.
You know,

867
00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:45.480
you just walked behind it with the hands out,
you know,

868
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:47.940
looking at other people like you know,
you,
you know,
you,
you,

869
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.180
you'd do that classic,
you know,

870
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:53.640
this isn't my fault shit that that body language to other people,

871
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:56.700
which is basically you put your hands,
you know,

872
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:00.870
basically parallel to your shoulders straight out like that,
you know,

873
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:04.350
like you're going to shrug like uh,
you know,
I dunno,
you haven't liked that.

874
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.130
And then after you do that,
then you bring them together in front of you,

875
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:13.010
motioning at her,
you know,
like a,
it,
you bring it back out again having it Dan,

876
00:55:13.011 --> 00:55:17.210
we just,
she's,
she's just,
and I dunno.
Yeah,
right.

877
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.240
Just back and forth

878
00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.230
and then you just say,
well we know something.
And as much as she gives you shit,

879
00:55:26.231 --> 00:55:29.590
just be like,
you know what?
I'm glad I looked.
I'm glad I looked who was up.

880
00:55:29.591 --> 00:55:32.620
I didn't look,
I wouldn't,
you know,
we got to talk about this.

881
00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:34.210
I'm willing to help you through this and everything,

882
00:55:34.211 --> 00:55:35.080
but I can tell you right now,

883
00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:37.810
if you think you're going to move in with me and start doing that stuff,

884
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.900
there's going to be a mountain of shit getting thrown out every fucking week.

885
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.060
All right?
So there you go,
sir.
That is my advice.

886
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:50.230
That is my advice to your fucking ass.
Good luck to Ya.

887
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.313
<v 5>All right.</v>

888
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:58.160
Never slowed down.

889
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.150
Jot is grueling from Todd going down.
Tired of math,
John,

890
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.840
this town.
Oh my man.

891
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.750
That body dress.

892
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:15.590
Same as cop.
Cause the case.

893
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.433
<v 6>Okay.</v>

894
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.200
<v 7>Fuck.
Was I going to talk about the sea?
Oh,
guess what I did this week.
Oh,</v>

895
00:56:54.201 --> 00:56:56.300
freckled face bill.
Guess what I did,
you know,

896
00:56:56.301 --> 00:56:59.810
a year ago I wrote a fucking motorcycle or whatever.
I went dirt bike riding.

897
00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:03.830
I actually took a motorcycle safety course.
It was a,

898
00:57:03.831 --> 00:57:06.740
it was a day and a half and I gotta tell you,
man,

899
00:57:06.741 --> 00:57:11.690
it was fucking a exhilarating and terrifying.
So I actually,

900
00:57:11.691 --> 00:57:14.690
I passed the class somehow.
I don't think I should have.

901
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.230
I was doing my little ute turns.
They had to put my little foot down there.

902
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.500
Uh,
um,
no,
it was a great fucking time.

903
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.360
So basically how it worked was you rode for like four hours and then you had a

904
00:57:29.361 --> 00:57:30.194
class.

905
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:31.943
<v 3>MMM.</v>

906
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:36.520
<v 7>And I realized how spoiled I am as a fucking human being,
you know,</v>

907
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.413
just having this,

908
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.170
the life that I have where I don't have a boss and I basically do whatever the

909
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:43.210
fuck I want.
I have not been in a classroom.

910
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.453
<v 3>MMM.</v>

911
00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.140
<v 7>I just immediately,</v>

912
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:51.520
I just takes me back to why I chose the route I chose.

913
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:54.550
I just never liked the classroom situation,
but this,
this was a,

914
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.660
was actually a great time,

915
00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.490
but it just immediately had anxiety and I'm like half paying attention and then,

916
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:02.980
and then in the end they're like,
okay,
now we're going to do the test.

917
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.530
I went right back to when I was like in eighth grade and I got got,

918
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.450
I'm going to fail this.
The guy's like,
no one has ever failed this.

919
00:58:10.451 --> 00:58:13.060
And you're like,
oh,
good pressure pressure.
I'm a moron.

920
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.160
Was sitting there at the table and everybody's fucking finishing.

921
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.890
Before I was like,
there was like,
I dunno,
40 people in the class.

922
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.940
I think I finished 37th as far as completing the test.

923
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:26.683
<v 3>MMM.</v>

924
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.450
<v 7>I know.
It's just 50 questions I got for rob.
It's something like that.</v>

925
00:58:31.451 --> 00:58:34.190
I don't fucking know.
But somehow I passed and um,

926
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:35.630
<v 3>okay.</v>

927
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:39.110
<v 7>That was funny.
I've never flipped flopped so much in my life on a decision.</v>

928
00:58:39.111 --> 00:58:41.870
I was thinking,
am I going to get a bike?
You should I just get a dark bike?

929
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.050
Should I just know how to do this?
And then,
you know,

930
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:50.420
I just wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle.
You know,
I grew up in the 80s.

931
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.823
All right.

932
00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:55.340
I watched a lot of action movies and one of the things that I always was envious

933
00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:00.400
of the Action Heroes Aside from their oiled up fucking eighties lifting weights,

934
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:03.320
no squats ever bodies,
was,

935
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.273
<v 3>uh,</v>

936
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.630
<v 7>the fact that no matter what vehicle they approached,</v>

937
00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:12.050
not only with the keys always in it,
they knew how to drive.

938
00:59:12.051 --> 00:59:17.051
It knew how to drive everything from a dump truck to a fucking helicopter

939
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.820
airplane.
They could sail.
They could fuck it.
Do So,
you know,

940
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.150
it's coming up where you know,
we got to raise the debt ceiling again.

941
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.950
Eventually the wave's going to hit the beach and there's going to be a period

942
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:36.530
where you could quite possibly be getting chased down the street by an angry

943
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:41.420
fucking mob is,
is this,
everything goes to shit,
you know?

944
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:47.000
So at that point it would be nice if you had the ability to,

945
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:50.180
whatever escape vehicle you meet you ran into,

946
00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:53.570
you could actually just jump in and just be all right with it.
Right.

947
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.160
So Vestus alone fucking uh,

948
00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.420
Arnold Schwartzenegger,
Steven Seagal,
Chuck Norris,

949
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.710
they never,

950
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.150
and I challenge you to find anything that they fucking ran up to when any of

951
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:12.530
those movies that dated,
not a Jetski fucking motor boat,

952
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.360
sailboat,
submarine,

953
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:17.860
combine helicopter fucking plane with,

954
01:00:17.861 --> 01:00:19.850
with only can land on water.

955
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.450
Those skis or the tires doesn't make a difference.

956
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.500
They could instrument rated they everything,
everything.

957
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.250
They could be on a fucking plane,
a commercial airline,

958
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.410
and somehow kill the person next to him,

959
01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:36.900
put a hat over their face without anybody noticing,

960
01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.920
crawl down into where the luggages and then jump off the landing gear and do a

961
01:00:40.921 --> 01:00:45.270
fucking mash at the end of the,
the,
the,
the runway.

962
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.810
They were unstoppable.
So I've added motorcycle.

963
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.100
All right.

964
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.870
I could drive a car stick or regular and now I can drive a motorcycle.

965
01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:57.400
I'm just checking off the list.

966
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.350
I have a day and a half of experience now.

967
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.640
It was actually really fascinating and it made me a better driver and I actually

968
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:10.630
have a much more appreciation of,
uh,

969
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:15.320
of this skill it takes to ride a motorcycle.
It's not like a car.
Yeah,

970
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:20.230
no shit bill now,
but just shit that you wouldn't think like I didn't,

971
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:23.980
I didn't understand all that went into just going around a turn on a motorcycle

972
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:28.000
and out.
Not only do you hit the,
do not hit the break,
but if you hit the brake,

973
01:01:28.001 --> 01:01:32.940
you're actually gonna.
You know,
you're going to crash.
You got to judge,

974
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.500
look through the whole turn,
judge.

975
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:38.910
You speed and then fucking power your way through it.
Um,

976
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.470
pretty intense.
I got not going to lie to you.
I'm not gonna act like I was,
hey,

977
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.640
I got this,
this is easy.
Then we go into the class and like,
has anybody seen it?

978
01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:50.280
And I'm getting excited like wow.
Then I just wrote a bike for four hours.

979
01:01:50.281 --> 01:01:53.610
I've got it up to third gear down shift and this is fucking great.

980
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.090
And then I went into the class and one of the things,
you know,

981
01:01:57.091 --> 01:02:00.150
the group discussion there was like anybody ever see a motorcycle accident or

982
01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:03.270
been in a motorcycle accident?
It's like fucking almost everybody,

983
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:07.350
or at least half the class puts their hands up and they start telling stories.

984
01:02:07.351 --> 01:02:11.820
And this one guys was like a paramedic and he's going like,
Yay.
You know,

985
01:02:11.821 --> 01:02:16.380
I saw this guy was going like 90 [inaudible] hit a car head on and his heart

986
01:02:16.381 --> 01:02:17.610
came out of his chest.

987
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.500
He had like all these stories and I was sitting there,
I'm like,
okay,

988
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.940
<v 0>okay.</v>

989
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.150
<v 7>Like laughing at myself going,
what the fuck am I signing up for here?</v>

990
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.940
This is insane.
Um,

991
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.200
and then like the guy who was teaching the class who looked like he was born on

992
01:02:35.201 --> 01:02:39.300
a motorcycle and was fucking,
you know,
wrote the same way it was,
you know,

993
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:42.010
obviously he's the instructor.
He's fucking great riding bikes.

994
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.650
He even had a story of a couple of months ago.
Yeah.
You know,

995
01:02:44.651 --> 01:02:46.450
I hit some sand and I was like saying,
you know,

996
01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:49.750
I'm going over the fucking handle bars and I'm like,
keep my body relax.

997
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:54.490
And all I'm thinking in my head is just like,
dude,
you went down,
you went down.

998
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:55.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

999
01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:57.680
<v 7>All right.
This guy,
I'm telling you,</v>

1000
01:02:57.681 --> 01:02:59.750
it just look like he was just made the ride a fucking,

1001
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.450
we just had that I ride a motorcycle look,
as opposed to me,

1002
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.640
it looks like some do.

1003
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:07.100
She goes to take a safety course and I'm just thinking this guy went down,

1004
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:10.400
this guy's an EMT talking about people's hearts coming out of their chest.

1005
01:03:10.401 --> 01:03:15.180
I'm just like,
what?
This is fucking stupid,
you know?
So,

1006
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.043
uh,

1007
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:17.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

1008
01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.970
<v 7>I on,
I don't know where I'm at.
I think I'm just going to maybe just</v>

1009
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.920
right on dark is what I'll do.
You can't,

1010
01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:27.620
you can't fucking ride a bike out here in la.
You know what it is?

1011
01:03:27.621 --> 01:03:31.520
I'm old enough to know it's fucking stupid.
So,
uh,
I think I'm going to,

1012
01:03:31.521 --> 01:03:32.420
if I'm going to do it,

1013
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.300
I just get like a dirt bike and I put it in the back of my truck,

1014
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:39.870
drive out of the city and all the people texting,

1015
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.910
get to where the trail is and then just ride around on dirt and I know all you

1016
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:47.440
going to be like actually moves feet.
Jld Japi north road people,
not piggy Ted,

1017
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.680
you need to,
I know I just stand,
there's risk with everything,
but uh,

1018
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:52.680
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1019
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.513
<v 7>You know,
I dunno.</v>

1020
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.020
I think it's a good thing that I waited till I was 45 to learn how to ride a

1021
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:03.280
motorcycle because if I was thinking if I was 21

1022
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:04.540
<v 0>okay.</v>

1023
01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.470
<v 7>And that I would just,
I wouldn't give a shit ass.</v>

1024
01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:10.000
I can happen to me and that's not going to happen to me.

1025
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:13.000
Like you get older and by the time you're,
my age,

1026
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.120
shit has happened to you or some close friends.
So you kind of like,
yeah,

1027
01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:17.110
you know,
that could happen to me.

1028
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:22.030
Kind of like my heart in my chest on this side of my rib cage.
Uh,

1029
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.760
but I got to tell you though,
I definitely got the bug and

1030
01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.200
<v 0>okay.</v>

1031
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.940
<v 7>It's the most fucking fun.</v>

1032
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:29.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1033
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.570
<v 7>I even by the second day I was actually getting frustrated</v>

1034
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.880
because I was thinking like,
I just want to take this out on the street.

1035
01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.700
I'm sick of speeding up and slowing down.

1036
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.800
I just want to drive this fucking thing.
And uh,

1037
01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:44.710
<v 0>okay.</v>

1038
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:47.920
<v 7>I Dunno.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to go out and do that.</v>

1039
01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:49.030
I'm not going to do that dumb shit.

1040
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.930
This is exactly what a lot of people do when they,

1041
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.360
when they finally get to where they want to be in life,

1042
01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:58.330
which is what I feel I am,
you know,
sell tickets as a comic.

1043
01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.590
Get some acting gigs every once in a while.
You know,
you got a little free time.

1044
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.900
What do you do?
You pull a John Denver,

1045
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:09.070
you go out and get a pilot's license yet out you fly some experimental aircraft

1046
01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:13.740
and next thing you know they're the news today.
Singer Song Writer.

1047
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:18.610
All right.
So that's definitely the back of my head.
But um,

1048
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.500
<v 3>okay.</v>

1049
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:20.800
<v 7>I Dunno,</v>

1050
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.080
I don't think knee is going to let me get one anyways to be honest with you.

1051
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:26.560
That's probably a good thing.
But you know what she did when she was saying no,

1052
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.670
she did the classic thing like why do you want to like,
you know,

1053
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:35.650
have all these toys.
What is it with guys and have you know,
you,
you have your,

1054
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.690
and like what do I have?
I go,
I got my truck,
she goes,

1055
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:41.950
you get your guitars and it's like you're upset with me cause I'm enjoying life.

1056
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:46.660
And she's like,
no,
you know,
I think she just doesn't want me to get one.

1057
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:50.860
So she tried to do that stupid argument that the motorcycle was this extension.

1058
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.720
Like it's like your Dick,

1059
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.560
like you guys like kids between their legs and they have ride this thing down

1060
01:05:56.561 --> 01:06:00.010
the street.
It's a psych.
I don't know what the fuck that is about.

1061
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:01.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1062
01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.000
<v 7>When I was riding for the last two days,</v>

1063
01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:07.110
at no point was I thinking about my deck other than thinking like I hope I don't

1064
01:06:07.111 --> 01:06:09.250
fall off and uh,

1065
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:12.390
when I'm going fast enough that I get road rash on my Dick,

1066
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.520
that would be the only thing.
Other than that,
I,
you know what,
I wish,

1067
01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:22.080
I wish she took the class with me.
You know?
That's what I was actually thinking.

1068
01:06:22.081 --> 01:06:24.840
It'd be great if she took the fucking class with me and she would just see how

1069
01:06:24.841 --> 01:06:26.760
much fun it is.
It's fun.

1070
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1071
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.520
<v 7>You know,
I don't know.
Fucking know.
So,
uh,
I got the bug now.</v>

1072
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:35.980
I got the bug and I was looking at motorcycles all last night.

1073
01:06:35.981 --> 01:06:37.650
So I was telling her,
I said,
look,
all I want to do,

1074
01:06:37.651 --> 01:06:40.530
I'm just going to get like the Honda rebel.
It's a fucking two 50.

1075
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.980
It's exactly what I should get when I start out.
If I get something else,

1076
01:06:43.981 --> 01:06:47.820
I'll kill myself.
And she starts,
you know,
looking up those stupid Ducati's,

1077
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.370
which were cool about up until six months ago.
Now,

1078
01:06:50.371 --> 01:06:52.020
every Douche bag out there has him.

1079
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.320
Like everybody seems to have one of those fucking things.
So,

1080
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.013
<v 3>you know,
I don't know.</v>

1081
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.000
<v 7>I looked at the new Harley's and I don't like them.
I think they're ugly.</v>

1082
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:05.780
They kind of lost their way.
They at used to look meaner.
So I'm just going to,

1083
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.000
if I'm going to get one,

1084
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.450
I'm either going to get dark bike or I'm going to get this little fucking two
50.

1085
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:13.120
I think the speedometer only goes up to like 70 or 80.

1086
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1087
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.120
<v 7>I Dunno.
Tell me,
what do you,
what do you guys think?
And this is,</v>

1088
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:20.250
and this is going to be one of those extreme,

1089
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:22.270
<v 3>uh,</v>

1090
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.510
<v 7>conversations.
And believe me,
I've heard all the things get a motorcycle.</v>

1091
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:29.020
You might as well buy the coffin to go with it.
It's not a helmet,

1092
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:31.270
it's a brain bucket.
I've heard all of that shit.

1093
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.570
<v 3>Um,
I dunno,</v>

1094
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:38.770
<v 7>it does seem like a lot of fun,</v>

1095
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.833
<v 3>right?</v>

1096
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.890
<v 7>Uh,
you know,
if I,
if I get one,</v>

1097
01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:45.830
I'm going to be one of those douchebags who gets like a little two 50 and I'll

1098
01:07:45.831 --> 01:07:49.730
have like all the gear on and be dressed like all Samuelson.

1099
01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:51.950
If he ever rode a motorcycle,
flipped completely over,

1100
01:07:51.951 --> 01:07:56.951
protected fucking robocop suit on it and I just ride around my neighborhood,

1101
01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.580
never,
never get out of second gear.
Um,
anyway,

1102
01:08:01.581 --> 01:08:04.310
so that's what the fuck I did with my week.
But you know,

1103
01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.150
it's good to know though,

1104
01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.140
if I ever get chased by a bunch of people with hatchets down the street and I

1105
01:08:09.141 --> 01:08:12.950
happened upon a fucking motorcycle and there's a little key there provided it's

1106
01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:16.010
not an old one with the throttles on the other side

1107
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.950
<v 2>or the shift or whatever the fuck it is.
Uh,
I'll be able to,</v>

1108
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:21.260
I'll be able to escape,
you know.

1109
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.413
<v 4>All right,</v>

1110
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:35.740
<v 5>this bitch on market square,
she's staying in</v>

1111
01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.330
a hotel room

1112
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:43.400
will be coming soon.

1113
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:49.940
Got to pull it was to go cry when he woke up alone and hit the last number.

1114
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.033
<v 6>Yay.</v>

1115
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:14.650
<v 2>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

1116
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:18.240
It is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday,

1117
01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:23.190
October 5th,
2009.
How the hell are you?
Well that's good.

1118
01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:26.940
I'm actually fighting off disease this week.

1119
01:09:26.941 --> 01:09:31.941
I'm back here on the east coast and everybody is getting sick and I did a smart

1120
01:09:32.641 --> 01:09:35.940
thing.
I actually fucking came home and I felt myself getting sick.

1121
01:09:35.941 --> 01:09:39.840
I took some vitamins and I just slept for like fucking 10 hours.

1122
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:44.880
Um,
hence the podcast is a little bit late,
I apologize is always,

1123
01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.940
but um,
yeah man,
I had a great weekend.

1124
01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:52.470
I was out of [inaudible] Stress Factory in New Jersey and I'm starting to feel

1125
01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:56.850
it,
man.
I'm starting to get on top of my game.
Um,
regular listeners,
you know,

1126
01:09:56.851 --> 01:09:59.280
I'm getting ready to do another special and um,

1127
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.870
I've really put my time in with this one.
I did Sweden than I did Boston.

1128
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.650
Then I did Philly,
then I did Dallas and now I just did New Brunswick,

1129
01:10:07.651 --> 01:10:12.090
New Jersey five weeks in a row.
No,
I had one week off between Sweden and uh,

1130
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.600
and Boston.
And uh,
I got to tell you,
man,

1131
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:19.920
there's no substitute for that.
There really isn't.
I don't give a fuck.

1132
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.610
You have to go out on the road.
You got to do the shows,

1133
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:27.600
you got to do six shows a weekend and you really have to be like,

1134
01:10:27.601 --> 01:10:32.070
I'm really working on this one.
Making sure the set order is right.
And uh,

1135
01:10:32.071 --> 01:10:35.430
you know,
cause that's,
that's how you got to do it.

1136
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.410
You want to have a memorable,
you don't just want to,
you know,

1137
01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:44.850
that's the worst fucking thing you can do,
I think in any,
any party of life.

1138
01:10:44.851 --> 01:10:47.800
Work your ass off on something and then just get your reaction of black.

1139
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:52.920
And I mean,
it was good.
I mean,
he went up there,
there was a microphone,

1140
01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:56.370
he was talking into it.
You could understand what he was saying.

1141
01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:00.450
Um,
he seemed to be having a good time.

1142
01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.050
What was he talking about?
Yeah,
I,
you know,
I,
I can't,
you know,

1143
01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:08.280
that's the thing I can't really remember,
but it was definitely English.

1144
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:13.050
I know that because at no point I,
I wasn't not comprehending what he was saying.

1145
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.400
So I'm,
whatever,
I'm putting a little bit of pressure on myself.
I just,

1146
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:21.240
you know the fuck you got to keep trying to top yourself and a,

1147
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:24.400
when you have a limited amount of skills that mentally,
you know,

1148
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.830
and I know it's a weird thing,
try and turn to beat yourself.

1149
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.960
How do you fake out yourself?
You know,

1150
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.310
am I making any God damn sense right now or is this fucking theraflu still a

1151
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:39.610
kicking in here?
I'm actually fighting this shit off duty.
You want to talk?

1152
01:11:39.611 --> 01:11:42.610
I do this overrated underrated thing here on the podcast.
You don't,

1153
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:44.590
you want to talk a underrated,

1154
01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:48.010
underrated taking vitamins every God damn day,

1155
01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:51.280
which is what I've been doing lately.
You know,
I take a,

1156
01:11:51.281 --> 01:11:55.390
I take a men's multivitamin.
I don't even know what it is.

1157
01:11:55.391 --> 01:12:00.391
I just know it's a brown with little black freckles of shit on it.

1158
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.680
I have no idea what it is I've been taking that is vitamin B supplements.

1159
01:12:04.681 --> 01:12:06.970
So I don't get Alzheimer's because evidently,
uh,

1160
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.930
I took a physical and they were telling me not even gonna say that cause I'm

1161
01:12:10.931 --> 01:12:14.140
trying to get health insurance right now.
That's the preexisting condition.

1162
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.290
Now we brought that up.
Well,
maybe it's the all timers.

1163
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.580
Maybe that's why you don't remember it.

1164
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.033
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1165
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:26.250
<v 2>Yeah.
That's the how kind of health insurance I have right now.</v>

1166
01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:27.720
And I want to get some other health insurance.

1167
01:12:27.721 --> 01:12:31.050
The health insurance I have right now basically covers everything except what I

1168
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:34.320
go,
you know,
to the dentist for,
you know,

1169
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.830
I want to get a fucking cleaning and they didn't cover it.

1170
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.180
I mean that's ground zero.
And they're saying because the lady use that,

1171
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.980
that electronic pick,

1172
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.930
which a lot of them use just because they're lazy,
not they lazy.
They did,

1173
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:53.720
you know,
you know,
back in the old days whether you suggest use the scraper,
the,

1174
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:58.170
the manual scraper for your teeth.
Now they just,
they use the,
uh,
the other one,

1175
01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.780
I mean,
I hadn't gone in in a little bit.

1176
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:03.270
So the first time I went in I understood that she used it,

1177
01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:08.070
but now I've been going in there like every fucking four months,
you know,

1178
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.030
four months.
You don't need to use that electronic one.
You fucking lazy.

1179
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:14.040
But for some reason my health insurance,
oh,
we only,

1180
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:18.960
we only just cover if they just use with use it with their hands.
Yeah.

1181
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.800
By the way,
you owe us another 350 bucks for this quarter.

1182
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:27.120
I'll go fuck yourselves.
Um,
so anyways,
um,

1183
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:31.980
I am on tour like a maniac right now.
Um,
not like a maniac,

1184
01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:33.270
like someone's getting ready to do a special.

1185
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:38.271
So I am actually in New York City right now sitting in my old apartment and uh,

1186
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.080
it's bringing back memories of when I used to fucking live here and I would get

1187
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:50.370
shit faced and bang a whore.

1188
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.273
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1189
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.150
<v 2>I like this place.
I'm going to try and keep it,
you know,</v>

1190
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:01.080
this is my just in case I get divorced place someday,
you know,

1191
01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:05.700
cause I'll go out and buy a house and God knows my girl will get that,
you know?

1192
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.590
And then Phil,
our kids up with her version of who am,

1193
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.800
you know,

1194
01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.870
then I come by on Saturdays to pick them up and then they got that look on their

1195
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:19.990
face,
you know,
like they just had some horrific story told to them.

1196
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.790
Wow,
man.
I'm really in a bad mood right now.
Just not even a bad mood.

1197
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:26.110
I'm just fucking negative.
You know what?

1198
01:14:26.111 --> 01:14:28.630
Why don't we try and turn this around by me giving you guys,

1199
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.690
I'll do a little ass bill hill bill here.

1200
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:34.390
I didn't know what.
Fuck that.

1201
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:37.330
Why don't I hype what I have coming up this weekend?
I have,

1202
01:14:37.331 --> 01:14:41.950
I'm going to be at the Improv in a,
I think it's homestead,
Pennsylvania,

1203
01:14:41.951 --> 01:14:45.460
right outside of Pittsburgh.
It's called the the stacks,

1204
01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:47.780
I believe it's that mall right it right up,

1205
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:51.070
right over the bridge that goes over the river.
Get Out.

1206
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.020
It's basically one of those things.
It's classic America right now.

1207
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:57.040
It's basically,

1208
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.520
it's a place where Americans used to have union jobs and they made steel for

1209
01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:07.711
fucking American cars in American buildings and now it's a mall and you go in

1210
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:13.150
there and you buy shit that was made from people in other countries,

1211
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:17.800
probably by their children for one 90th of what they were paying an American,

1212
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:22.120
but as a tribute to those Americans are used to have jobs.
They kept it.

1213
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:26.590
They kept the smokestacks from the old steel factory steel mill factory.

1214
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:28.480
Actually the last time I was fucking there,

1215
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.990
I actually kind of researched that area cause I was kind of fascinated by it.

1216
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:34.360
And I found out that there was some big,

1217
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:39.990
big battle between the workers and they called in police and the and some

1218
01:15:41.231 --> 01:15:46.231
militia to beat down these Americans who wanted to get a fair wage and people

1219
01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:51.220
got their heads split open.
They fucking died right there on those riverbanks,

1220
01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:54.310
you know,
so people could make money and I don't know what happened.

1221
01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.210
My generation,

1222
01:15:55.211 --> 01:15:58.450
we just sat around eating double cheeseburgers and an all fucking left.

1223
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:04.090
But anyways,
I'll be down there telling my jokes,
hey and look Uzbek,

1224
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.430
look who's back,
ladies and gentlemen,
Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa and Joe,

1225
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:12.370
you know I'm gonna love about Joe is Joe's actually going to come in,

1226
01:16:12.371 --> 01:16:16.670
he's going to join the podcast and at no point is he ever going to address that.

1227
01:16:16.671 --> 01:16:21.320
We actually already did this podcast for 45 minutes before I realized that I

1228
01:16:21.321 --> 01:16:25.130
didn't have any batteries in my recorder and he's going to sit down like a God

1229
01:16:25.131 --> 01:16:29.710
damn pro
this and this is the deal.
People always ask me,
you know,

1230
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:31.270
what in the hell are you ever going to have a guest?

1231
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:33.190
Every once in a while he should switch it up.

1232
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:37.060
You should get a guest like got a guest,
a disgruntled,

1233
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.960
I already did this for free for 45 minutes.
Joe,
let me tell you something,
man,

1234
01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:45.961
you was so funny this past hour on this podcast that didn't get recorded.

1235
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:50.380
Thank you.
And I have belief in you that there's a lot more funny in that.
Well,

1236
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:57.100
Joe is actually a,
if you're new to the podcast,
I'm,
Joe is a,

1237
01:16:57.101 --> 01:17:00.100
this is the worst joke cause I've already done this and it's fucking Monday.

1238
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.710
I'm sorry sir.
All Right Joe,
right?
Still worse.

1239
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.480
We gave that guy great advice and now right now we're going to have to read it

1240
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:11.480
again and pretend like we already didn't fucking do it or it will be fine.

1241
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:12.350
We'll get through it.

1242
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:15.500
We'll get through it when we tell you an inspirational story,
Joe,

1243
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:17.420
so we can get through this the second time.

1244
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.860
Brian Johnson of ACDC fame,
all right.

1245
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:25.340
One time told the story about Phil Rudd,
the drummer,
their band.

1246
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:30.170
And he said basically they had some unbelievable take us some song and for some

1247
01:17:30.171 --> 01:17:31.880
reason they ran out of tape right in the moment,

1248
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.040
right in the middle of the greatest part of the song ever.

1249
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:37.520
And it had been built to like this emotional apex,
you know,

1250
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.840
so the guy goes,
either guide the fucking guy behind the,
uh,

1251
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.530
the mixing board is all devastated and he's apologetic and he's like,

1252
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:48.530
I can't believe in some out,
whatever.
They have to somehow get,

1253
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.480
they lost Phil Rudd Shit,
right?
All right.
And the guy's like,
oh my God,

1254
01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:56.180
we're never going to get it today.
Fucked up.
I'm so sorry.

1255
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.510
And then Phil Rub was just like,
just play the tape again,
mate.

1256
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.980
I'm going to jump right in.
And he goes,
there's no way you can do it.
He goes,

1257
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:08.840
just roll the fucking tape.
And they roll it to it and he jumps in seamlessly.

1258
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.960
Like he went back in time and he fucking totally nails the take plays it even

1259
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:16.880
fucking better than they did the first time they hit,

1260
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:19.350
they stopped the thing and the fucking guy behind the board,

1261
01:18:19.351 --> 01:18:22.270
he's just completely flabbergasted cause cause I was on blue,

1262
01:18:22.271 --> 01:18:25.640
I'd never seen anybody do anything like that.
You're,
you're fucking unbelievable.

1263
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.210
And Phil was sitting there with that cigarette Dang dangling from his lips and

1264
01:18:29.211 --> 01:18:30.710
he just goes,
I know

1265
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.820
Brian Johnson tells it better,
but that's your inspirational story.
They had Joe.

1266
01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:40.160
So anyways,
Joe Derosa,
me and Joe do this.

1267
01:18:40.161 --> 01:18:43.220
There's wonderful radio show that used to be on Xm.

1268
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:48.400
He used to be on Xm Sirius.
Yeah,
sometimes it is.
But you know what?
I Dunno.

1269
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.010
There was a merger and just like you guys out there going through this tough

1270
01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:55.310
economy,
I guess we were the odd man out there was a merger.

1271
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:58.970
They took our money away,
they left us with nothing.

1272
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.040
You know what they really did?

1273
01:19:00.041 --> 01:19:04.340
And we just decided we would tire to wait nine months for a fucking $35 check.

1274
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:08.110
Isn't that what basically I'll be honest here.
Oddly enough we,
we,

1275
01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:12.000
we see more disappointed than Xm does.
Yeah.
About the show.

1276
01:19:12.001 --> 01:19:15.520
And we keep reading the trade magazines waiting for that Xm Sirius,

1277
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:18.010
Sirius Xm X.
I was there.

1278
01:19:18.011 --> 01:19:22.310
It was called to say what happened where whatever you're saying that their stock

1279
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.990
plummeted another two fucking is it points at dollars.

1280
01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:31.010
We don't know what the points.
So tell us,
let's go with points anyways,

1281
01:19:31.011 --> 01:19:34.760
the name of the show,
we do what's called uninformed,
uh,
no reading,
no research,

1282
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:37.280
just strong opinions.
And if you haven't picked it up yet,

1283
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:41.840
me and Joe were a couple of fucking morons and at no point should you ever

1284
01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:45.700
really listened to anything that we say and you know,
why do we do,
we don't.

1285
01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.740
We really do our show for other than to Horace sells out so we can make more

1286
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:53.030
money and not have to go on the road shaking hands of people who have fevers

1287
01:19:53.031 --> 01:19:56.450
that are then going to pass it on to you as you can get to wash your hands and

1288
01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:59.930
eat a fucking order of Mozzarella sticks between the first and second shelf like

1289
01:19:59.931 --> 01:20:04.370
I did.
Um,
who,
who do we,
who else do we do it for?

1290
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:07.280
You should you know who is what?
We do it for the first,
sorry,
I'm sorry.

1291
01:20:07.281 --> 01:20:10.680
I have no train of thought.
We fucking,
we do it for you.

1292
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:15.480
For you of my 15 fucking listeners so you guys can feel better about your life.

1293
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.860
Yeah,
no,
not even advice.
Just when you hear a fucking stupid we are,

1294
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.300
you can actually and mean like,

1295
01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:24.860
well these guys actually have some sort of hat fast radio show.
You know.

1296
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.800
I can make it too.
Yeah,
I agree.
It's good.

1297
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.560
It makes people feel like they can achieve out there.
Yeah,

1298
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.930
they made it makes people feel like they can get to our level cause you

1299
01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:38.820
certainly can.
This is an attainable level in life.
Absolutely.

1300
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.090
We are not,
well,
I'm speaking for myself.
Yeah.
You know,

1301
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.110
but you too can be on the internet making no money whatsoever and not have a

1302
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:48.090
boss is something freeing about it.
Joe.

1303
01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:52.480
John Tell you all we need is a windmill and our own garden in the back and what?

1304
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.360
We'll be fucking good.
Well just go veggie.

1305
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.600
What would you plant in the garden bill?
Oh,
do you like a cup of Cherry tomatoes?

1306
01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.460
Tomatoes.
Let me tell you something.

1307
01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.930
Do you know how bad I want to buy a fucking house so I can have a garden?

1308
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:06.840
I love having gardens.
I want to,
I want to have a garden and be,

1309
01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:10.440
that guy was slowly loses his mind out there talking to the plants because he's

1310
01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:15.090
breathing into pesticides.
You know?
That's who I want to be.
Just,
Oh look at that.

1311
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:18.710
Zucchini shaped like a girl.
I used to know

1312
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:25.410
my,
uh,
my dad had a pet,
an astounding garden when I was growing up.

1313
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.410
I think that that's one of the coolest things ever to be able to walk in your

1314
01:21:28.411 --> 01:21:33.090
backyard.
Okay.
Like and have your own food supply.

1315
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.280
I think there's something really like,

1316
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.790
I think that we've kind of got everybody living in a culdesac.

1317
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.550
I really think that,
you know what I would love to do,
you know,

1318
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.880
you would get wet by the fucking powers that be,

1319
01:21:44.881 --> 01:21:48.240
but if you could just somehow teach people how to build windmills and if they

1320
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:51.210
somehow just couldn't stop it,
you know,

1321
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:55.800
the same way like fucking that debt auto,
auto tron,
what the fuck?

1322
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.750
What kind of music is that took over,

1323
01:21:57.751 --> 01:22:01.410
you know that music Jay z's rather tune auto tune the same way that that just

1324
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:04.500
took over and the government couldn't do anything about it.
Like what if,

1325
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:07.800
what if people just started windmills?
You can build a windmill.

1326
01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:11.730
That's not illegal now you can't,
sure you can and you can't.
Why?

1327
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.200
Because um,

1328
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.950
general electric is worried that you're not going to make one that's safe.

1329
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.460
So they still need to go out there and inspect it to make sure now they did a

1330
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:23.130
whole fucking thing out in California where they,
once again,

1331
01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.800
they squeezed out the little guy and this is what they're doing.
Joe,

1332
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:29.370
as we move into a greener ways,

1333
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:33.000
as we're moving into the reason why it's taking so fucking long for us to move

1334
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:36.180
into greener things is because first of all there's still a lot more money to be

1335
01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:39.240
made with the old things and then also the guide,

1336
01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:41.100
the the fuck and there will be blood guys.

1337
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.460
Got To make sure that they're still in control of it.
You know?

1338
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.680
That's my fucking solution to the Middle East.

1339
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.690
You want to beat those cock suckers over there.

1340
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.280
Just fucking make cars run on fruit loops or water or whatever the fuck we can't

1341
01:22:52.281 --> 01:22:55.800
all be and people can do it.
Stand mayor came up with something on a long island.

1342
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:57.930
How to make you make it run on water.
Okay.

1343
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.140
How do these fucking terrorists get their money?
As far as I know,

1344
01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:02.730
Joe and I don't know a lot.

1345
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.880
I believe that the money that we on all their fucking oil goes to the,

1346
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:10.730
did the,
had a rab over there,
the head,
the,
the,

1347
01:23:10.731 --> 01:23:13.510
the fucking Shah or whatever the fuck he's called.

1348
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.310
And then he sits there and acts like he's down with America while he subtly is

1349
01:23:18.311 --> 01:23:21.850
sending money off to the Hamas and the al Qaeda and all that.

1350
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:25.300
So we stopped fucking using that.
That God damn energy,

1351
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.410
they'd go bankrupt over there.
You ain't got no money,
Joe Yank got no boots.

1352
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.620
You ain't got no poo.
She ain't got no guns.
What does that for?
Uh,

1353
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.460
we ain't got no boobs,
but we had kind of woods.

1354
01:23:35.461 --> 01:23:40.420
Was that from Kelly's heroes or sarcoid?
Telly Savalas or is it from dirty?

1355
01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:43.510
That was telly Savalas yelling at fucking,
uh,
Don Rickles.

1356
01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:47.140
You never saw Kelly's heroes.
Oh,
Kelly's heroes is a fucking great movie.

1357
01:23:47.141 --> 01:23:52.141
And it's hilarious because it doesn't make sense because it's about World War

1358
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:55.450
II,
but it has the hippie Vietnam vibe.

1359
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:59.500
It's right during that time with the directors took over in Hollywood.

1360
01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.350
You're like,
fuck it.
We're going to do it our way.
Yeah.

1361
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.240
Did you know up until like that,

1362
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:08.500
like for the longest time that the director's job was basically only to make

1363
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:09.940
sure that the actors were on there,

1364
01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:13.870
mark and that everything was in frame.

1365
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.200
I don't even think they were responsible to make sure about the lines.

1366
01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.410
Now there was the studio's operated like factories,
dude.
Yeah.

1367
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:22.390
And the second you said,
and that's a wrap.

1368
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:27.040
You left and the studio took the picture and they cut it up.
It's amazing.
Right?

1369
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.510
That's why guys like Billy Wilder were so renowned in the,
uh,

1370
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.490
cause he did that in the 50s right?
Yeah.

1371
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:37.260
He was being a real director in the 50s you know what I mean?
That was it Craig.

1372
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:39.610
So basic,
what happens?
So at the Kelly's heroes thing,

1373
01:24:39.611 --> 01:24:43.990
by then what you had was you had that young generation that was taking over and

1374
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:46.210
they will making a World War II movie.

1375
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:49.990
And they had Kiefer Sutherland played down southern,
sorry,

1376
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:54.110
Donald Sutherland was playing this hippie a this sorta,
you know,

1377
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:58.180
they had like their own,
like,
uh,
they had their own way of doing things,
man.

1378
01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.720
But it was funny.
It was before hippies became like played out and annoying.

1379
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:05.170
You know who's like head guy?
Gavin Macleod,
isn't it?

1380
01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:08.890
Who's the head guy that Clint Eastwood,
Clint Eastwood Dude.

1381
01:25:08.891 --> 01:25:13.600
They got all the guys,
guys,
guys,
Clint Eastwood,
Telly Savalas,
Don Rickles,

1382
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.840
Donald Sutherland.
Uh,

1383
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.190
I think that guy who played angel on the Rockford files is in it.

1384
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.870
I can't remember.
Gavin Macleod who used to be on May.
Hey,

1385
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:29.170
they may used to play Mary Tyler Moore here from the love boat,
right?
Yeah,

1386
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.570
he's from Mary Tyler Moore,
the love boat that was,
that was saying,

1387
01:25:31.571 --> 01:25:35.680
he's the captain of the love boat and that was his cash grab.
He's like,
I'm old.

1388
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.130
I can't believe I keep getting work.
But that little fucking mustaches,

1389
01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.550
a little pair of shorts being all tanned up,

1390
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:47.590
little white shorts to the greatest exit in non flame out from drugs ever was

1391
01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:53.500
the guy who played gopher on the love boat.
Dude,
you're on a show.

1392
01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:54.850
It's called the love boat.

1393
01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:59.680
Your character's name is gopher and you're wearing shorts like you're on a

1394
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:03.860
cruise ship with those white sox yanked up to your fucking knees or the Aba.

1395
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.750
Right.
Okay.
Your career is over.
Okay.
You're going to take all anybody else,

1396
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:13.250
any less of a fucking man would've taken all that money.
Okay.

1397
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.090
You would have found Donnie most and you would've sent it up your fucking nose.

1398
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.670
I shouldn't have sent him.
He didn't do that.
Trucks,
whatever you find out.

1399
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:23.180
Lawrence McCutcheon or whatever her name is Kenzie fit.

1400
01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:27.470
Yet Lawrence McCutcheon is an old running back from fucking the Baltimore Colts.

1401
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.040
But anyways,
that's what you would do.

1402
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.600
He had the fucking wherewithal to be like,
I'm Gofer.

1403
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:38.810
I'm on the love boat.
This is it.
What else do I want to do?
I'm into politics.

1404
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:42.620
He went on,
he became a fucking state senator.
Which one was go for the black guy?

1405
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.290
No,
that was Isaac Hayes.
W I know it wasn't.
It was Isaac Curtis.

1406
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:53.230
That's another fight.
You,
Isaac Curtis was the fucking wide receiver for the no,

1407
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.340
no,

Or seismic?
No,

Who the fuck that was?
Oh,

1408
01:26:58.341 --> 01:27:00.770
you mean,
you know what's funny about which were when we went and got a great,

1409
01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:05.720
which one was go for the hold on,
go for was the guy with the glasses.

1410
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:09.710
Now the doctor who got all the pussy for no fucking reason,
that made no sense.

1411
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.890
He had him.
Then you had Gavin Macleod,
then you had,

1412
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:16.100
you had the bartender who did the double point.

1413
01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:21.350
That was the black guy now like a half the def jam headshots of the late

1414
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:24.290
eighties I'm getting confused.
I'm getting day.
I mean he was he,

1415
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:26.900
Gavin Macleod was the ball guy.
I would say mustache.

1416
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:31.220
I was getting Barney Miller confused with Gavin Macleod.
Oh yeah.

1417
01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.070
Dude and I,
he was probably on that fucking show.
The point is,

1418
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:39.180
there was a guy on that show,
he was a series regular.
His name was,
go for it.

1419
01:27:39.181 --> 01:27:43.700
The dark hair.
Yes.
Okay.
I remember now let's,
let's go through,

1420
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.590
let's go through some sitcoms.
Joe,

1421
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.700
let's name awful character names where you know you're not Urkel Dun,

1422
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.640
Dun Schneider.
Schneider done like when?
When?

1423
01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.610
When you don't skippy Outta here.

1424
01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.140
Skippy family ties stopped doing Carmody now.
Yeah.
Joe.

1425
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:05.390
Yeah.
Yes he is.
Squealer when it was,

1426
01:28:05.391 --> 01:28:08.690
what was that kid on fucking saved by the bell screech.

1427
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:13.550
Screech sweetly.
I'm still dumbfounded that I,

1428
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:17.680
when you said Lawrence,
what did you call as Mccutcheon?
Cause it's so good.

1429
01:28:17.681 --> 01:28:20.190
I knew it was mackenzie.
That's so close though.

1430
01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.800
It was like some sort of pig Latin.
Wait a minute,
they're all done.

1431
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:29.240
Potsy pots and done Ralph mouth done.

1432
01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.840
Every actor in Hollywood and Fonzie even Fonzie's done.

1433
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:39.680
This is the thing.
Oh,
squigy squigy out of here.
Out of there.

1434
01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:42.950
This is the thing as,
as a fucking,
as an actor,

1435
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:48.070
you have to instinctively know that if your character does not have a first and

1436
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:52.360
a fucking last name,
it's already be doing this please.
It's,

1437
01:28:52.361 --> 01:28:54.140
it's already going to be.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1438
01:28:54.141 --> 01:28:57.290
Joe will melt this as much as we can and it's still actually recording.
Dude,

1439
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.130
if you don't have like a real fuck and a name that you could walk out in public.

1440
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.810
Alex p Keaton.
Okay.
He kept going.

1441
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:07.140
He just had the unfortunate of getting sick and he was even sick and he was able

1442
01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.360
to do a west wing spin city.

1443
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:15.480
They both about the same shit,
dude.
I watch sports.
I don't watch that.

1444
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.960
The West Wing is about the White House.
Vincent,

1445
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:22.350
he was about him working for a governor.
It's politics.
You just be happy.

1446
01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:26.300
I didn't say Benson again.
I it,
there you go Ben.

1447
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:30.570
There's one God.
Ooh Benson.
The fuck is that guy died.

1448
01:29:30.571 --> 01:29:33.870
What does Robert Gom done since Benson?
Yeah,
but he was,

1449
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:36.460
he was like 70 when he finally got that and I'll do it.
I'm talking.
Good.

1450
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.680
Sit here.
Pence is not a bad name.
I guess somebody came in and the guy said,

1451
01:29:39.690 --> 01:29:43.280
my name is Benson,
but you're saying on one name character gone.
Dude,

1452
01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.930
I'm more talking about like you need your name is fucking zippy.

1453
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.460
Big Ragu gone.
See you later.
The Big Ragu gone.

1454
01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:53.340
<v 7>Uh,

uh,</v>

1455
01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.100
<v 2>that a on family ties?
Nick.
Nick,
his name wasn't Mousse.</v>

1456
01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.120
No,
it was nick.
His name was nick on the show.

1457
01:30:01.121 --> 01:30:04.380
Is Moose Moose from that fucking show.

1458
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:07.940
With those duckets show would they would step out of the locker television.
Yeah.

1459
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:11.760
That was moose.
But hey to her,
hey Jerry.
Yeah.
Moose.

1460
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:15.270
She didn't even look like a most,
yeah,
it was just such a mean nickname.

1461
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.440
It really wasn't mic.
Yeah.

1462
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:19.140
I love that show that there was a great show these to torture kids.

1463
01:30:19.141 --> 01:30:22.890
Remember they did the firing squad,
they'd shoot the kids and shit.

1464
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:26.970
That was a great show.
Red Now.
Yeah.
They did these to do a sketch.

1465
01:30:26.971 --> 01:30:31.230
It was on Nickelodeon and they used to do a sketch where they had that one guy

1466
01:30:31.231 --> 01:30:35.400
that played all the grownups on the show.
He was the one actor and he would fish.

1467
01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.280
He did like,
he would do like a Nazi character.

1468
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:40.590
And he was like Eddie last verse.

1469
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.430
And the kid would say something and he'd make a one liner and they'd shoot the

1470
01:30:44.431 --> 01:30:46.210
kid.
And then they,

1471
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:50.010
he did another character called barf where he ran a restaurant and he was

1472
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:53.250
disgusting.
It would always pick his nose and the kids eat.

1473
01:30:53.251 --> 01:30:56.580
And there would be like,
you know,
they would go,
uh,
they'd say something like,

1474
01:30:56.730 --> 01:31:01.110
you know,
I saw dead squirrel in the street when I was on my way in here.

1475
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:04.740
And then barf would pop up and you go,
uh,
what do you think's in the Burger?

1476
01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.240
That was his catchphrase that he's putting nasty shit number.
So needless to say,

1477
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:11.790
he never worked again.
What was his character's name?

1478
01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:16.110
He was the guy that played all the male grown up care.
He played every,

1479
01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:20.520
<v 7>can I tell you when I was in a,
when I was working in Denver,
um,</v>

1480
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:21.780
I'm doing,

1481
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.780
I made a reference to family ties and at the end of the show,

1482
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.730
this guy comes up to me tatted out,

1483
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:34.710
tattoos all over him and he's fucking twitching a little bit.
And he goes,
Hey,
uh,

1484
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.610
and his buddy comes up going,
hey,
you like family ties,
right?
He's like,
yeah,

1485
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:40.470
this kid was one of the guys on it.
And I'm looking at him,

1486
01:31:40.471 --> 01:31:42.660
he didn't like in his twenties.
And I'm like,
what the fuck was he?

1487
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:47.120
He played the little kid.
Why was he twitching?
Uh,

1488
01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.610
he said you probably saw me on TV getting arrested for drugs and drinking and

1489
01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:51.091
driving.

1490
01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:56.091
I've been sober for six months and so his buddy who's hanging out with them when

1491
01:31:57.331 --> 01:32:00.010
to take one at a picture with me.
So we go to take

1492
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.060

1493
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:06.960

1494
01:32:06.961 --> 01:32:09.790

1495
01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:10.601

1497
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:16.960

Like he shouldn't be saying that.
If that's a true friend,

1498
01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:19.840
who the fuck would be saying that this kid is trying to be sober and he's making

1499
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:20.081
funny.

1500
01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:23.170
Your fucking hands twitching and he's just a total cunt and he's just trying to

1501
01:32:23.171 --> 01:32:24.430

He's like half a star fucker.
Yeah.

1504
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:37.000
I just remember that stuck on it really annoyed me and I felt bad for that kid.

1505
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:40.530
You could just,
you know,
you know something to do.

1506
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:41.910
Do you know why it take some of those stuff?

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.980
Those the child star kids flame out is because what kind of a fucking kid wants

1508
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:51.670
to have to memorize lines?

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:25.870
Debbie tell you have a problem with white guy.

1535
01:34:25.871 --> 01:34:29.020
Shit Dj and they opened a Vegan restaurant and he was like,

1536
01:34:29.021 --> 01:34:32.050
this is what I do is my life.
I live a very pure healthy life.

1537
01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:35.790
Like he just had it.
He was just so collected.
There was not an,
he was again,

1538
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.500
maybe one day I'll go back and hang.
I don't know,
whatever man.

1539
01:34:38.501 --> 01:34:41.170
Like he just didn't care.
He wasn't one of these fucking,

1540
01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:44.890
you know Dana Platos which guy was it?
Cause I've got to tell you something.

1541
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.490
Those kids,
I don't know if they would take an HGH,

1542
01:34:48.491 --> 01:34:51.160
but something happened to the skulls of the kids on that show.

1543
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:55.420
What show that home improvement and then nothing happened in luck.

1544
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:57.710
And they looked like they weren't fun house mirrors by the end of it.

1545
01:34:57.711 --> 01:34:59.290
They were going through puberty and they did.

1546
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.300
They have fucking foreheads would jut now they've did.

1547
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:06.350
They were adorable kids when they first got,
that's the thing about,

1548
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:10.200
about like you get those kids is the puppies.
This,

1549
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.520
you're very hard pressed to find a puppy that isn't cute,

1550
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:16.880
but you know you can have an ugly dog.
And that's what I'm saying.

1551
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:19.730
A lot of those kids were ugly dogs.
Yeah.

1552
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:23.960
They kind of turned like yet like I think at least two of the three kids on home

1553
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:26.960
improvement.
We're on roids thank Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

1554
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:30.020
you're still a pretty decent looking kid.
He was,
he had the pianist,

1555
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:33.980
he looked like,
yeah,
that composer hair.

1556
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.980
He looked like it was in bugs bunny.
Like he was going to

1557
01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:45.170
like,
I can't get tails on go.
You should always be wearing tales.
You know,

1558
01:35:45.171 --> 01:35:47.000
you don't know where to actually tapping into right now.

1559
01:35:47.001 --> 01:35:49.070
Joe Is my fucking memory problem.

1560
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:52.610
Like I can't remember people's names and I can't remember the names of places.

1561
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:55.510
Like there's a breakfast place.
Me and Nia love out now,

1562
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.770
the west coast and they have like these big,

1563
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.040
huge biggest pancakes you ever saw in your life.

1564
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:04.050
Biggest French toast and always putting like whipped cream and all this shit and

1565
01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.060
it's fucking ridiculous.
May Hump Right,
but you eat it,
huh?

1566
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:10.580
Here's your always against eaten shit.
Like yeah I am,

1567
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:13.610
but there's their French toast dude is ridiculous and I don't do like the

1568
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:14.061
whipped bite.

1569
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:19.061
I just see people going by and they got like a whole stick of butter on it and

1570
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.630
we've been at 200 times.

1571
01:36:20.631 --> 01:36:24.610
I can't remember the fucking name of the place you remember right now?
No.

1572
01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.330
I finally remembered it's called the griddle,

1573
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.660
but for the longest time I was called,
I was calling it a pancake circus.

1574
01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.190
I liked the griddle.
I'd been there.
Oh,
I do.

1575
01:36:34.191 --> 01:36:37.340
This is what I'm trying to explain you why I say the composer because what I,

1576
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.380
I can,
I remember certain details.

1577
01:36:39.381 --> 01:36:43.040
I remember he had that long fucking Beethoven haircut.

1578
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:48.020
So then it becomes that.
That's really fun.

1579
01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:51.860
And then what it does is then I throw it out there and then you go,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1580
01:36:51.861 --> 01:36:53.980
And then you say the name and I kind of,

1581
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.870
I'm able to joke my way through the fact that I can't remember shit.

1582
01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.110
I'm with you.
I'm with you pal.
Yeah,
Deb,
buddy.

1583
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.990
I want to help you get through this.
Get through this bill.

1584
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.190
I just realized I am fucking star Dude.
I know.
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

1585
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.460
No offense,
but how much longer?
How much longer do I have to do free?

1586
01:37:10.461 --> 01:37:13.580
She was free.
So technically I can fucking cut it off whenever I can,

1587
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.000
whenever I want to.
Why don't we what Joe,
when,

1588
01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:17.630
when are we actually going to be able to start?

1589
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:20.180
Me and Joe Derosa as you've noticed,

1590
01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:25.390
have just a tremendous chemistry when we get on the microphones and shit.
Yeah.

1591
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:29.700
You know what I'm saying?
On the one and two,
um,
yeah,

1592
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:33.310
that's where we do that podcast.
So,
so listen,
so we're,

1593
01:37:33.311 --> 01:37:35.000
we're going to start doing these on a show.

1594
01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:38.880
Why can't we upload these fucking things onto the internet?
Look,
here's the,

1595
01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.320
we had this show called uninformed and then we started to do it as a podcast and

1596
01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:46.630
we're going to sell it for a buck and episode on the web.
I mean,
on iTunes.
Yeah,

1597
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.640
because we're actually going,
I can't get the guidance things to upload.
Let me,

1598
01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:50.750
let me,
let me jump in here.

1599
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.900
And the reason why we're charging a dollar an episode people is because we're

1600
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:56.100
actually going to have guests.
We're going to have interviews,

1601
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.420
we're going to be doing things.

1602
01:37:57.421 --> 01:38:00.870
I mean it's a fucking radio show and I know you people on the Internet don't

1603
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:04.500
like to pay for Shit.
It's a dollar an episode for the love of God.

1604
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:07.380
You know it was up there.
Was that the fucking worst way ever to try?

1605
01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:11.090
I love how just nowadays as an artist you have to justify that,

1606
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.810
that you know that your time is valuable.
Even if we don't have guests,

1607
01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:18.540
which we will have episodes where we don't,
you know,

1608
01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:21.870
we used to get paid to do the show.
It's work to do the show.
We have to,

1609
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.740
we have to book gigs on the road to go to that bar and I want to find that guy

1610
01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:30.030
who came up with that cheeseburger and talked to him and just talk to him just

1611
01:38:30.031 --> 01:38:31.320
about food in general.

1612
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.990
There's a government agent tried to take that guy out right now.
No,

1613
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:37.280
he isn't loving works for them.
Look,
Joe,
your weight,

1614
01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:39.210
we talked about that cheeseburger and the last one.

1615
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.830
I don't think you got it on this.
Did I not talk about it in this one?
Oh,

1616
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:47.460
I didn't know came member.
All right.
This is,
this is,
this is a fucking,
okay.

1617
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:49.140
Just to fucking go back.

1618
01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:53.970
I talked about that fried butter a week ago and how like did this just insane

1619
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:58.380
levels of like why,
okay.
I was in,

1620
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:00.570
I was watching the Patriots game yesterday.
Joe.
Uh,
Shit.

1621
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:03.450
I know you're a big sports fan.
You know that they one bill.

1622
01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:07.260
Then another day one that we got lucky against the ravens again,

1623
01:39:07.261 --> 01:39:10.320
the ravens have beaten us the last two times we played them and somehow,

1624
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:13.410
I don't know what happens.
They fucking,
they make a bonehead play.

1625
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:18.190
They played and they pull it out of pocket.
I would say that patriots,
they could,

1626
01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.250
they pull it out in the pocket.
I'll tell you.

1627
01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:23.700
No one can talk sports like Joe Joe.
Why did the Patriots beat the Ravens?

1628
01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.890
Because their Gi bill overall,

1629
01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:28.500
I just think they're a better team and when they're put under the gun,

1630
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:29.363
they deliver.

1631
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:35.210
You can actually get away with that on a,
on a sports talk show.
Yeah.

1632
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.530
It's another one.
You have to incorporate it.
This is another thing.

1633
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:40.410
If somebody asks you what's wrong with the Patriots?
All you've got to start,

1634
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:43.320
as I got to tell you,
if I'm the Patriots right now,

1635
01:39:43.321 --> 01:39:46.200
I gotta be thinking and then just you don't have that.

1636
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.660
All you gotta do is just throw anything in there and you'll be fine.

1637
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.540
I'll tell you two things that,
two things I've been right about.

1638
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.430
Two things that I called this season,

1639
01:39:53.431 --> 01:39:57.780
Joe was everyone was fucking jumping all over Sanchez,
the jets quarterback,

1640
01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:01.170
you know him?
Yeah.
Well Sanchez is heat on that guy for no reason.
And uh,

1641
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:04.500
you know,
I think he's a good player.
I mean deserves a little leeway.

1642
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.560
I like how you just said two things that,
no,

1643
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:08.730
I said in the beginning of the season,

1644
01:40:08.731 --> 01:40:11.370
I mean they called the guy a star up there.
He beat the Texans.
I mean,

1645
01:40:11.371 --> 01:40:14.520
he's going to be a star.
It's not a star yet.
And I called it with my buddy.

1646
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:18.840
I said,
dude,
he is going to have that horrific pick six.
I'm a fucking rookie.

1647
01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:22.770
And he had it yesterday and I also called Matt Cassel when they sent them over

1648
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:25.300
to Kansas City.
And everyone's like,
how the fuck are the Patriots?
Get rid of him.

1649
01:40:25.301 --> 01:40:28.050
I said he was driving a Ferrari last season.

1650
01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:31.950
That's all he had to do was keep it on the fucking road and he went 11 and five

1651
01:40:31.951 --> 01:40:33.480
right now you're going to Kansas City.

1652
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.740
All of a sudden you're not driving a Ferrari anymore.
No,

1653
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.330
you don't even drive it to z 28 you've got to Camaro rally sport.

1654
01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:42.480
That's what you got with the v six and your chicks drive in it.

1655
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:44.300
What I like about Matt Cassel,
this Matt,

1656
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:47.920
Karen's real players player and all right,
let's,
let's end that.

1657
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.590
Let's do a new segment.
Just sports [inaudible] sports talk with shoulder rose.

1658
01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:56.220
We'll just fake sports talk for as long as I can.
I'll just be you.

1659
01:40:56.230 --> 01:41:00.130
You talk real sports and I'll,
I'll just fake through it.
I think we got it.
Joe.

1660
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:03.400
I think me and the listeners understood the premise while you were doing it.

1661
01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:10.060
Joe,
what may Tony Dorsett the running back that he was Tony Doors set,
you know,

1662
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.010
you know he had the legs of a champion.

1663
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:16.930
He's just a guy who could run no matter what he could run.

1664
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:19.450
And that's the most important thing when a running back is that they run.

1665
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:22.420
These guys are out here talking about his style.
John,
talk about his style.

1666
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:25.750
Is it running back?
Like who,
who would you compare him to?
His style look.
Uh,

1667
01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.060
you know,
when running backs,
I'm looking for a Mike Quick,

1668
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:29.523
<v 3>uh,</v>

1669
01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:35.510
<v 2>I'm looking for a guy that drills and runs that guy head down,
shoulders up.</v>

1670
01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:38.330
He knew how to plow through it.
And that's what you need.

1671
01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:43.460
Delivery to the end zone.
No,
it's amazing.

1672
01:41:43.461 --> 01:41:45.650
It's how you will almost fucking,
you're almost,

1673
01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:50.450
you're saying it's fucked up enough where people would still be looking at each

1674
01:41:50.451 --> 01:41:53.090
other like,
dude,
this guy doesn't watch sports.
But then you right.

1675
01:41:53.091 --> 01:41:57.170
As you think that,
then you're like,
oh,
maybe he does head down.
That makes sense.

1676
01:41:57.171 --> 01:42:01.010
Shoulders up.
How do you have a head down and you say,
how do you have,

1677
01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:03.890
all right,
yeah,
let's,

1678
01:42:03.891 --> 01:42:06.570
let's get back to the sandwich before this whole thing goes off the rail.

1679
01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:09.300
So I'm sending it this fucking Bar,
right?
Cause that's what I do.

1680
01:42:09.301 --> 01:42:10.990
Do I drink during the day?
Let's let's,
you know,

1681
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:14.310
I don't have anything to live for.
It's all about killing the silence,

1682
01:42:14.610 --> 01:42:17.670
what the road is.
I will say it's just waiting for the next meal.

1683
01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:19.800
Just waiting for the next week for the next meal.

1684
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:22.980
Please share the clank of the silverware.
That's all you want to do.

1685
01:42:22.981 --> 01:42:26.580
Joe Killed The loneliness.
All right,
so let's plow ahead here.

1686
01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.840
So I'm sitting at this bar,
right?

1687
01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:30.900
And I'm watching the game with this guy and this guy calls the bartender order

1688
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.260
over to order some food and he goes,
yeah,
listen,
I want to order you.
Sure.

1689
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:38.760
I didn't tell it on this one.
I'm not positive,
but I'm pretty sure tell it again.

1690
01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:43.170
Yeah,
it gives a shit.
Such a great,
yeah,
cause we were talking about,
remember it,

1691
01:42:43.171 --> 01:42:46.170
let us on that a KFC shit and everything.
We didn't play it today.
Right?

1692
01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:48.830
That shit.
All right.
So anyway,
so the guy calls a bartender over and he goes,

1693
01:42:48.831 --> 01:42:53.420
yeah.
I goes,
yeah,
listen,
I want to order a custom burger.
And I'm like,

1694
01:42:53.421 --> 01:42:55.880
who the fuck does that?
Who the fuck is accustomed bird?
Well,

1695
01:42:55.881 --> 01:42:59.270
evidently this guy had this burger at this bar in New Jersey.

1696
01:42:59.271 --> 01:43:02.720
It's called a duck buster.
D.
U C K.
Buster.

1697
01:43:02.721 --> 01:43:05.510
I gotta give these guys credit because they really went above and beyond.

1698
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:09.020
So evidently this dude ate it and he loved it so much.

1699
01:43:09.021 --> 01:43:11.870
He goes to this bar and he goes to order at some listening to him order and the

1700
01:43:11.871 --> 01:43:14.140
guy goes,
all right,
what do you want?
He goes,
all right,

1701
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:17.030
this is what I want you to do.
It's like that Jack Nicholson thing.

1702
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:20.270
I want you to hold it between your knees.
It's like that fucking thing.
He,

1703
01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:21.290
he basically goes,

1704
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.500
I want you to make two grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato and bacon in them

1705
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:30.680
because to grow yet to grilled cheese sounds just with tomato and Bacon and,

1706
01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:35.480
and then I want you to you to use those two grilled cheese sandwiches as the

1707
01:43:35.481 --> 01:43:37.280
bread for the cheeseburger.

1708
01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:41.900
So the two sandwiches where the bun and then he see,

1709
01:43:41.901 --> 01:43:44.030
you were totally blown away the first time,
but you already heard it.

1710
01:43:44.031 --> 01:43:48.030
So it's just gets through the,
and then he,
then he had another fucking,

1711
01:43:48.031 --> 01:43:51.860
and then he had like a half pound of beef in there with cheese on of that.

1712
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.930
And I will say it again.
That sounds amazing.
And if I could get it right now,

1713
01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:00.350
I'd go get it.
The problem is we're getting that.

1714
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:05.240
The problem is the product cost them $20 because you know,
yeah,

1715
01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:07.850
that's like two,
two words of a grill.
This is what,
you know what y'all,

1716
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.290
I would eat that I really gel.
Yeah.
I like,

1717
01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:15.540
I didn't fucking know that I would eat it.
You know what I,

1718
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.250
one time I was sitting in shooting the shit with Joe and I didn't realize until

1719
01:44:19.251 --> 01:44:23.120
he got to his second donut that he was actually just sitting across from me

1720
01:44:23.121 --> 01:44:27.740
eating a bag of donuts,
donuts.
It was like two in the afternoon.
Joe,

1721
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:32.741
what I've seen you on many occasions eat pancakes with chocolate chips and shit.

1722
01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.070
No,
you have a banana.
Bananas.
That's good for you.

1723
01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:40.430
But that's for two pancakes.
No worse than the God damn doughnut dude.

1724
01:44:40.431 --> 01:44:43.700
It's front and not at her.
Joe,
what?

1725
01:44:44.150 --> 01:44:48.440
I don't have the knowledge to fucking actually backup that.
I know I'm right.

1726
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:52.670
Pancakes are not as bad as donuts.
Donuts,
you're trying to get fat.

1727
01:44:52.671 --> 01:44:54.500
You're trying to get for take a stack of pancakes.

1728
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:56.600
You put butter and syrup on them.
You think that's that?

1729
01:44:56.630 --> 01:45:01.040
Any the stack beginning works.
It's fucking pure sugar.

1730
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:04.920
Having an orgy with butter.
What's it a pancake?
Pure center.

1731
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.240
It's not pure sugar.
Doughnuts are better there than not.
John,

1732
01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:13.130
let me tell you something now,
but don't you know,
don't you don't you fuck you.

1733
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:16.760
Don't.
You don't how to make one Joe.
You've,
you've made a donut bill.

1734
01:45:16.761 --> 01:45:21.380
It's better that you deep fry it.
Sugar coagulating with butter.

1735
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:24.990
That's all it is.
Bill.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong.
You're making this up.

1736
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.910
I'm gonna kick you off this fucking show.
I got wrong on my own podcast.
Rip a no,

1737
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:32.420
but it's,
it's bred.
Do they know what is your content?

1738
01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:36.970
It's not as bad as a pancake.
Doe Not healthy,
but it's not as bad as the pain.

1739
01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.360
First of all,
fuck.
Shut up one doughnut at 2:00 PM.
It's the same thing.

1740
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:44.810
Fucking face.
You're wrong,
Joe.
First of all,

1741
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.640
a fucking does nothing.

1742
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:51.650
Don't you don't disrespect pancake.
No,
I don't ever.

1743
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:55.680
I have a fucking Pankey,
you know pancakes.
Pancakes.

1744
01:45:55.681 --> 01:45:58.460
I like that buddy of yours who you don't want anybody to talk shit about.

1745
01:45:58.461 --> 01:46:01.130
But you know this slightly retarded.
That's what pancakes off from me.

1746
01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.950
That's how I used to fucking,
no,
you don't understand the rules.

1747
01:46:03.951 --> 01:46:06.200
You like to go to your little fucking pen.
No,
that's not a,

1748
01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:09.680
that's how I used to make money on the road when I was on the road and I wasn't

1749
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:10.514
making shit.

1750
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.770
And I'm out there by my fucking self not talking to anybody back the fly.

1751
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:16.440
Even had a fucking cell phone.
Joe.

1752
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.160
A lot of people didn't have cell phones in the late nineties I was one of them.

1753
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:22.960
Okay.
And I fucking why be out there in the middle of goddamn nowhere.
No,

1754
01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.640
actually by then I got a cell phone,
but I've been so in the middle of nowhere.

1755
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.290
It was like on that roaming thing,

1756
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.290
and this is how I would make money cause I wasn't making any fucking money

1757
01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:33.310
because what I would do is I would either go to Denny's or I would go to the I

1758
01:46:33.311 --> 01:46:37.550
hop and I would get their large stack of five and dude,

1759
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:40.340
it is not sugar.
It's like fucking cement.

1760
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.750
And you would just pour that in and it would mold to the shape of your stomach

1761
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.300
and it would sit there and do,
do you eat that at fucking eight,

1762
01:46:47.301 --> 01:46:52.301
nine in the morning and then go do nooner and then drive to Colorado schools are

1763
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:58.320
the mines or some fucking Rhinelander Wisconsin fucking Gig.

1764
01:46:58.470 --> 01:47:00.870
And you would not be hungry for 12 hours.

1765
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:03.660
And that way I was able to skip meals and,
and I,

1766
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:06.900
and I could cut down on my food costs.
Okay,

1767
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:10.650
you tell me you eat a sack of fucking donuts in the morning and you can go 12

1768
01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:12.420
hours without eating.
You can't.
First of all,

1769
01:47:12.421 --> 01:47:16.080
you'd pass out behind the fucking wheel because of all that sugar.
And you know,

1770
01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:20.940
that's fucking true.
Joe,
I want you to retract your statements.
Pop pancakes.

1771
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:24.600
I will know you will deal with the ramifications of this Joe,

1772
01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.040
because I have podcasts listeners and they are very vocal.
They email.

1773
01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.980
I uh,
it's not as bad as a fucking doughnut.
This is what you're,

1774
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.280
you're not listening to what I'm saying.

1775
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:40.550
I'm saying a statue annoy makes is banded one donut and let's say in a pile of

1776
01:47:41.581 --> 01:47:43.470
donuts is equal to a pile of pinkish.
Okay.

1777
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:45.960
Wait a minute now I need a stack of pancakes.
No,

1778
01:47:46.290 --> 01:47:48.570
that's as bad as eating one doughnut.
I disagree.

1779
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:50.940
Let's look it up on the Goddamn Internet.
Raul.
Look Joe.

1780
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:53.830
Cause cause what you're doing is you're equating quality,
uh,

1781
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:58.830
calories to being equally bad.
Okay.
Look Gel.

1782
01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:02.970
Shush.
Shush you.
I did Joe.
I can eat.

1783
01:48:03.090 --> 01:48:08.090
I can eat fucking 400 calories of apples and you can eat 400 calories of

1784
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:12.510
doughnuts.
What the fuck is worse built pancakes or not?
There's up.

1785
01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:14.430
You're going to shit yourself,
Joe.

1786
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:17.640
There's just nothing about pancakes that are good for you though.
All right,
shit.

1787
01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:18.370
They got you can,

1788
01:48:18.370 --> 01:48:22.170
do they ever put fucking bananas or any sort of fruit on the side when you get a

1789
01:48:22.171 --> 01:48:26.790
donut they don't.
You put fruit to put blue.
Would a delicious,

1790
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:28.430
delicious fruit.

1791
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.620
Do you know what that time to make the donuts guide Jesus and to him,

1792
01:48:31.621 --> 01:48:33.810
that's what the fucking fill out,
whatever is.

1793
01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:35.880
Every once in a while I'd like to be a first grader bill.

1794
01:48:35.881 --> 01:48:38.520
I like a little donut here and there.
You know there's nothing wrong with it.

1795
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:41.160
I think a lot of like how you're saying it like you're like a finger in your
ass.

1796
01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.640
Well I like that too.
All right,
let's move on here.
Okay.

1797
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.720
All right,
let's go to the advice thing.
We have to actually do some.

1798
01:48:48.721 --> 01:48:52.200
So we've got 40 minutes here,
Joe and we,
we got,
we got to read this one again,

1799
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:54.780
Joe.
Like it's the,
it's the first time we want,
I want to move beyond,

1800
01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:57.060
I have to do this because this guy wants to,
let's do this and then,

1801
01:48:57.061 --> 01:48:58.470
and then we got to eat something.
Dude,

1802
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:00.110
I'm going to pass the fuck out of there now.
Joe,

1803
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.850
why don't you just go shave your legs and get it done with you.

1804
01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:05.310
Fucking don't eat and pussy.
All right.

1805
01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:08.731
If you wanted this is,
yeah.

1806
01:49:08.731 --> 01:49:10.670
This will give them them a little taste of uninformed.
Yeah.

1807
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.200
Just imagine if we were talking about global warming.

1808
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:14.670
It was sounded this ignorant.

1809
01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:18.060
That is the uninformed show that's worth a fucking dollar,
isn't it?
It is.

1810
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:21.920
God damn cheese.
It's hard to sell.
It's hard to sound this.

1811
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:25.050
Never watched the Beatles.
They used to get chased down the street by their fans.

1812
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:29.340
Now it's gone full circle when chasing fans.
Yeah.
Pleading with them to,

1813
01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:33.540
to give us a fucking measly dollar for our art.
I like how we're actually,

1814
01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:36.740
I'm actually acting like they refuse to do it without them even saying it.

1815
01:49:37.290 --> 01:49:39.990
I'm okay.
Bill.
First off,
I'm a huge fan of love.
The podcast.

1816
01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:42.180
I have a bit of a dilemma.
I'm 35 years old.

1817
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.230
I have a 30 year old sister and I'm very protective of her.

1818
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.650
She has a boyfriend that I used to be very tight with.
Um,

1819
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.860
a few weeks ago,
we were coming back back from the cubs game,

1820
01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:57.880
even though the cock suckers lost the three of us.
We had a blast at that game,

1821
01:49:58.210 --> 01:50:01.810
but we were all kind of lit.
How many fucking nights have started this way?

1822
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:05.850
Everybody's having a good time,
but you get a little drunk Joe.
Well,
let's try it.

1823
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:09.580
Nice.
Nice fucking game.
Just fucking gets fucking the fucking game.
All right.

1824
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:12.160
We're all kind of lit and on the way back,

1825
01:50:12.161 --> 01:50:15.940
I was sitting in the backseat of his car while he was driving.
Um,

1826
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:19.630
I was doing that flick the ear thing and he was starting to get pissed.

1827
01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:23.380
So he's flicking this kid in the back of his ear as he's trying to drunk drive

1828
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:25.690
down the street after their home team lost.
Okay.

1829
01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:30.010
That's how this story is beginning.
He goes,
I should have quit,
but I was buzzed.

1830
01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.600
Long story short,

1831
01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.640
we were at a light and I flicked him and then this can sucker.

1832
01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:39.910
He invented a curse word.
This can sucker punched me in the face,

1833
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.800
knocked my tooth loose,
and I had to pull it out later.
All right.
First of all,

1834
01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.170
how hard did he flick them in the,
that's one of those things we,

1835
01:50:47.171 --> 01:50:50.560
you would trying to flick the year and then you cut the whole fucking year and

1836
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:54.550
his ear was probably ringing.
So anyways,
he had to pull his tooth out later.

1837
01:50:54.551 --> 01:50:55.960
So he says,
after he cracked me,

1838
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.530
I got out of the car and tried to pull him through his window in the middle of

1839
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:03.310
traffic.
Um,
he locked the doors and rolled up his window.

1840
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.690
My sister was started going nuts on me to get back in the car.
I didn't,

1841
01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:11.020
I don't claim to be a hard ass,
but I got to get my do,

1842
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:13.360
I'm fucking losing sleep over this shit.

1843
01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:18.520
How do I explain to my sis that this shit has to be done without sounding like a

1844
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:21.880
cave man?
He's been ducking me,
sent to census,
shit happen.

1845
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:25.030
He's got to catch a beating and uh,
he will,

1846
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:29.230
I just need to explain to my sis why this shit had to be done.

1847
01:51:29.231 --> 01:51:30.640
So basically his,
his,

1848
01:51:30.641 --> 01:51:35.110
his question is he stating that because even though he's flicking this kid in

1849
01:51:35.111 --> 01:51:39.730
the year,
the dude knocked his teeth out.
Okay.
He did it in front of his sister.

1850
01:51:39.731 --> 01:51:40.151
He's like,

1851
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:45.151
this kid has to catch a beating is just some guy on guy guys understand this

1852
01:51:45.881 --> 01:51:46.270
shit.

1853
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:50.530
How do I explain it to my sister so she doesn't think she can move beyond your

1854
01:51:50.531 --> 01:51:53.560
beating the shit out of my boyfriend.
Well,
I'm going to say this dude,

1855
01:51:53.561 --> 01:51:54.394
you're fucking,

1856
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:58.630
we actually talked about why don't we just get catched cut to the chase.

1857
01:51:58.631 --> 01:52:02.500
You're five years older that your youngest sister,
you're protective over.

1858
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.513
You know,

1859
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:07.000
you don't like the fact that you wanted her to remain a virgin hair entire

1860
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:07.601
fucking life.

1861
01:52:07.601 --> 01:52:10.090
But you knew in the back of your head that eventually a guy was going to be

1862
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:12.370
coming along and as nice as this guy is,

1863
01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:15.370
and even though you get along with them in the back of your head,

1864
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:19.510
you can't get past the fact that this guy's fucking your sister.
You know,

1865
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:22.750
he's fucking your sister and there's nothing you can do about it.

1866
01:52:22.751 --> 01:52:24.730
So every once in a while when you get drunk,

1867
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:30.010
that fucking hatred comes out in you and you start to be a little bit of a cunt

1868
01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:34.240
and you took it a little too far.
He was drunk,
you know,
Joe,

1869
01:52:34.241 --> 01:52:36.670
is there anything more annoying than somebody whacking you in the back of the

1870
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:41.440
head is you're driving.
Okay.
He lost his shit.
He blasted you in the face.
You,

1871
01:52:41.670 --> 01:52:44.920
you fucking,
you deserve to do exactly.

1872
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:47.210
What would you do if he was doing it to you?
Yeah.

1873
01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:50.180
You'd clock him in his fucking face and you deal with it.

1874
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:54.920
That losing your tooth is payment for becoming an adult.
That's what that is.

1875
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:57.650
You're not losing sleep because you want to get this guy back,

1876
01:52:57.651 --> 01:53:00.800
you losing sleep because you know you act like a fucking asshole and you got

1877
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:04.390
Josie go easy.
Got You.
Got You.
But it's it just because it's,

1878
01:53:04.391 --> 01:53:06.410
it's cause I also understand dude,
if some,

1879
01:53:06.411 --> 01:53:09.140
if I was looking somebody in the year and I lost my fucking two,
two,

1880
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:10.370
I would want to kill the guy.

1881
01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.360
Don't put your hands on somebody now you don't put your hands on somebody,
man.

1882
01:53:14.361 --> 01:53:16.790
You just don't do that.
You put your hands on somebody,

1883
01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:20.240
you'd get what you deserve.
That's it.
You don't touch.
All right,
chill.

1884
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:23.330
What if for some reason you were doing something that you were flicking me in

1885
01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:24.141
the back or whatever.

1886
01:53:24.141 --> 01:53:26.660
I don't know what the fuck and I turned around and I punched you in the face.

1887
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:30.710
This guy gave him mornings.
Tell him stop.
You should stop doing it,
dude.

1888
01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.220
I would have stopped.
All right Joe.
Well,
let's see.
Let's,
let's do something here.

1889
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:36.230
Okay,
I'm just being devil's are devil's advocate.

1890
01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:41.030
What would you rather have somebody flick your air 17 times or lose a tooth?

1891
01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:45.980
Be Honest.
Be Honest.
Of course.
Flick my hair.
Of course.
Right?

1892
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:49.250
So what happened was,
what was his kid supposed to do?

1893
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:51.740
They'll turn around and try to flick his ear back.
You know he did.

1894
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:56.240
He did the right thing.
You,
he goes,
stop the kids not stopping.
He clocks him.

1895
01:53:56.241 --> 01:53:59.500
Finally,
Dude.
So what does he do?
So what,
what does he do?
What does what?

1896
01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:03.110
What is his,
how does nothing?
He acts like a,
this guy can't sleep Joe.

1897
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:06.680
He gotta help them out.
Tell you,
I'll tell you how you get sleep again.
Grow Up.

1898
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.280
Be a man.
Go to the guy.
Why did I invite you on this?

1899
01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:13.880
Go to the guy because you agree with dental and you know what?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1900
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:16.610
This is the thing,
Joe.
You don't,
you don't.
You know what?

1901
01:54:16.611 --> 01:54:18.950
You're a guest on the show.
I know my listeners look at this guy.

1902
01:54:18.951 --> 01:54:21.470
This guy is trying to justify beating the shit out of it.
Let me tell you,

1903
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:22.610
this is what you gotta do,
Dude.

1904
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:26.390
This is how you got to get him back in a silly way.
I hate to say this,

1905
01:54:26.391 --> 01:54:28.640
but what you're doing here dude,

1906
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:31.790
is you're going to beat the shit out of that guy.
Okay?

1907
01:54:31.791 --> 01:54:36.791
And it's going to get ugly because you already feel like you have to do as much

1908
01:54:37.341 --> 01:54:38.870
damn equal damage.
Who's what?

1909
01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:42.860
You have to knock a fucking tooth of his out and that only that you're,

1910
01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.120
you're laying there awake stewing about this shit.
It's going to get,

1911
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:48.200
it's going to be brutal.

1912
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:52.010
You're going to beat the shit out of him and she's going to be screaming like

1913
01:54:52.011 --> 01:54:56.990
Sharon Stone in fucking casino when James Woods is getting the shit kicked out

1914
01:54:56.991 --> 01:54:57.890
of him.
It's,
it's,
you know,

1915
01:54:57.891 --> 01:55:02.120
it's going to fuck up the holidays for years and if she ends up marrying,

1916
01:55:02.121 --> 01:55:06.080
this guy is going to be questions about whether you're going to be invited to

1917
01:55:06.081 --> 01:55:09.560
the,
to the,
to the wedding.
I totally understand why you've,

1918
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:13.880
you're envisioning giving this guy an uppercut where all of his teeth climbing

1919
01:55:13.881 --> 01:55:16.760
together and they just crack like in a fucking cartoon.

1920
01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.560
You are not wrong for wanting to do that,
but you can't,
you cannot do that.

1921
01:55:21.561 --> 01:55:24.550
So,
um,
you got it.

1922
01:55:24.551 --> 01:55:26.870
You got to think of some sort of practical joke.

1923
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:31.370
Like you got to say like,
look,
you got to be a man and be like,
look,

1924
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.240
I got out of line.

1925
01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:35.300
You knocked my tooth out and then this is what you could just decide a logical

1926
01:55:35.301 --> 01:55:38.390
towards.
You just say,
I'm not going to beat the shit out of you,
but no,

1927
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.890
I am going to get you back.

1928
01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.920
So the years you're going to take off of his life while he's waiting for you to

1929
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:48.330
do whatever the fuck you're going to do and don't damage his property.

1930
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.330
I'm trying to think of something like,
I saw a guy on the Internet,

1931
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.720
I saw a guy on the internet.
What?
It's bad advice.
I'm telling you,
dude,

1932
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.810
well first of all,
this is all bad advice.
They shouldn't take any more advice.

1933
01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.310
What can I just show you something?

1934
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:03.030
What he should do is demand thing to do here is go up to the guy and go,
look,

1935
01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:06.540
dude,
I'm a little pissed that you say it like you're missing a tooth.

1936
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:08.760
And I have a speech impediment to say it that way.

1937
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:13.120
Look through with a man.
I lost my tooth,

1938
01:56:13.121 --> 01:56:17.770
but I was looking in the ear,
look or Bari,

1939
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:20.290
we're both anger upset because dude,
you gotta understand too.

1940
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:23.500
The guy drive and he says at the beginning of the letter,
they were all drunk.

1941
01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:25.390
This guy is drunk driving.
He's,

1942
01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.330
he's trying to get this guy's flicking him in the fucking head.

1943
01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:31.630
That's all I got to go out this year,
right?
You know what,
dude?

1944
01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:35.440
You're being an asshole and you lost a tooth and you fucking embarrassed.

1945
01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.570
You got to look inward.
You're right,
Joe.
You know what?

1946
01:56:37.571 --> 01:56:40.540
You're right and fucking right.
He's,
he's got it.
He's got to like,
dude,

1947
01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.630
you know you got to,
you're not learning the lesson here.

1948
01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:46.690
You're not learning the lesson.
What you're doing is you're,
you're,
you're,
you're,

1949
01:56:46.691 --> 01:56:48.520
you're escalating.
You're absolutely right.
But listen,

1950
01:56:48.521 --> 01:56:49.960
I got to tell this because people say,
you know,

1951
01:56:49.961 --> 01:56:52.270
you've got to watch out when you give a advice because you got to know that

1952
01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:55.690
we're both a couple of fucking morons.
You know,
neither one of us has any,

1953
01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:57.550
we have no business giving out advice,

1954
01:56:57.850 --> 01:57:00.820
but you guys don't have the money during this economy to actually go to someone

1955
01:57:00.821 --> 01:57:03.820
who is smart too.
So I understand why you're asking me this,

1956
01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:07.870
but don't take my advice ever on this podcast.
All right,

1957
01:57:07.871 --> 01:57:10.210
this is how I do it and I'm doing this for free.

1958
01:57:10.211 --> 01:57:14.200
What are you going to sue me for?
My fucking Mexico.
You're not mentioning names,

1959
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:19.230
you're not mentioning names.
So there's anonymity here and you're,
you're,

1960
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:22.080
what you're telling the guy to do is nothing.
This is great Joe.
First of all,

1961
01:57:22.081 --> 01:57:23.460
you do you understand what just happened here?

1962
01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:27.150
We went from being complete non psychologists,
non therapist,

1963
01:57:27.151 --> 01:57:32.151
non fucking educated people here giving advice to then now Joe seamlessly.

1964
01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:36.870
You went from that to then giving me legal advice.

1965
01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:42.480
Do you realize you just did that?
Nope,
of course you did.
That's right.

1966
01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:44.340
I just talk.
I say what?
I need this right.

1967
01:57:44.341 --> 01:57:46.440
And you'd deliver with confidence and people believe it.
You know,

1968
01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:48.780
I realize what this advice,
people don't even want advice.

1969
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:52.140
You know what they want.
They want to be encouraged because you know why Joe?

1970
01:57:52.230 --> 01:57:55.770
Because they're surrounded by a bunch of fucking cons.
I'm telling you,

1971
01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.770
it's not the al Qaeda,
it's not global warming.

1972
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.710
It's the overwhelming amount of constant.
I tell you that I can't,

1973
01:58:01.711 --> 01:58:04.800
I can't tell this story.
I can't tell it,
but when I brought it up,

1974
01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:07.900
I got to change the city.
I got a chain.
Okay.

1975
01:58:07.901 --> 01:58:12.390
Let's say this happened fucking nine and a half weeks ago.
Yeah,

1976
01:58:12.391 --> 01:58:15.880
I know.
I got you.
I will.
I'll blow up.

1977
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:18.030
But this is not fair to bring up a story and leave these fucking people.

1978
01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:20.670
Hang in here.
I'll just,
I'll give you the gist of it.
I'm fucking,

1979
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:23.490
I got into a political debate with somebody.
Okay.

1980
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.320
Who clearly I can.
I do.
You know,

1981
01:58:28.321 --> 01:58:30.450
I don't mind debating with people and I can be swayed.
Look,

1982
01:58:30.451 --> 01:58:33.570
I got swayed in that fucking argument.
Made a great God damn point.
I was a moron.

1983
01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:37.320
And you know,
sometimes I stick to my guns with the pancake thing.
You know,

1984
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:41.950
I'm not a perfect person Joe.
Is that the beginning of an awful song?

1985
01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:46.480
I'm not a perfect person.
Yeah.

1986
01:58:46.481 --> 01:58:50.820
So why don't you just stop that and it's something that just,

1987
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:53.410
just one of those sizes makes you want to punch every girl in the bar in the

1988
01:58:53.411 --> 01:58:58.060
face.
Cause they all start singing it sub types.
I stick to my guns.

1989
01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:02.350
I mean what he's singing,
but wait a minute,
this is what happened.

1990
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:06.070
Somebody we got in this political debate and this person was making

1991
01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:11.110
moronic points just like I was,
but I was,

1992
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:16.140
but I was delivering my moronic points in a car and a courtesy way and a

1993
01:59:16.721 --> 01:59:20.030
respectful way.
Right?
I'd be like,
you know,
we talk about,
you know,
I rack,

1994
01:59:20.031 --> 01:59:22.960
how the fuck do I go?
The only successful,
you know,

1995
01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:25.240
occupation I've ever seen has been this country.

1996
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:28.180
And it's because we weren't leaving and we committed genocide.

1997
01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.400
So how do,
how do you win over there?
And I don't get it.
Did we just,

1998
01:59:33.401 --> 01:59:36.580
you know,
guys who just getting picked off over there and it's pissing me off,

1999
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:40.930
right?
So she would make points on how we could win over there and then she,

2000
01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:45.400
and when after she was done making a point should go,
uh,
Duh.
Right?

2001
01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:50.830
Do you realize the arrogant level of that?
Like I do,
she's acting like,

2002
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:56.010
for some reason the fucking super genius generals of our own fucking army of

2003
01:59:56.381 --> 01:59:59.170
this country.
They can't seem how to fucking finish it yet.

2004
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:01.870
But this girl knows how to do it in the middle of nowhere.

2005
02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.500
And having never fought a war and to,
she kept sticking her head out going,
uh,

2006
02:00:05.501 --> 02:00:09.760
Duh.
Yeah,
she's doing,
she's doing the,
uh,
you know,
the,
the couch coach,

2007
02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:11.080
you know,
no,

2008
02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:15.620
she wasn't even what this and nothing to this is somebody who clearly,
you know,

2009
02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:16.120
just,

2010
02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:20.820
you can tell somebody they reek of not traveling that fucking their worldview

2011
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:24.460
from their culdesac is fucking,
you know,
and if the and well,
who gives a shit?

2012
02:00:24.461 --> 02:00:27.160
I mean,
I'm acting like I'm a fucking genius.
I'm not,
but,

2013
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:31.180
but at least I have the presence of mind to know that I'm a fucking moron,

2014
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:33.340
so I will,
you know,
mate,
hey,

2015
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.770
who I was arguing that pancake shit I knew in the back of the head,

2016
02:00:35.771 --> 02:00:40.090
I was probably wrong on stuff,
which is why I made a funny,
I would never be like,

2017
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:44.990
Joe,
there's no sprinkles on pancakes.
A De stick.

2018
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.490
Do you know what,
are you able to punch me in the face and I'd lose a tooth,

2019
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.070
right.
Look at me and bringing it to false and that's our out.

2020
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.310
That's how I for that.
That's how it happens though.
Don't you do that?

2021
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:59.620
Don't you mock how I just got out of that?
No,
was no,
no.
I was saying,

2022
02:00:59.621 --> 02:01:04.430
there you go.
I'm,
I'll excited to get a sandwich.
I'm starving,
Joe.
Yeah.
Wait,

2023
02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:07.990
where did you get your basketball shorts?
I don't know.
Somebody gave them to me.

2024
02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:11.020
I know you don't play this.
I don't like how shiny they are.

2025
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.440
Like you were an all star one year.
Like you're chewing gum.
I don't like him.

2026
02:01:14.441 --> 02:01:16.900
I just put them on because I don't care if I shut him up while I'm doing the

2027
02:01:16.901 --> 02:01:21.760
laundry.
Doing the work,
the laundry.
Laundry.
All right,
listen,

2028
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:24.790
that's a,
there you go.
There's our first,
our first fucking guest ever.

2029
02:01:24.791 --> 02:01:29.500
Joe De Rosa and Joe Derosa in classic spirit of our wonderful radio show.

2030
02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:34.501
The uninformed show has now informed me that there's no difference between

2031
02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:40.160
pancakes and donuts.
He gave me legal advice,

2032
02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.730
anonymity.
We talk sports.
It was a good day.
Thanks for having me on,
man.

2033
02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:48.560
It was fun.
Okay.
Well I tell you Joe,

2034
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:51.530
I really enjoy doing shows of deal and I really hope that people,

2035
02:01:51.531 --> 02:01:55.250
when we finally get these fucking episodes up,
which I will let you know on the,

2036
02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.110
uh,
on the,
on the podcast here,

2037
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.140
cause this thing I just do as a goof or whatever as opposed to the uninformed

2038
02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:02.570
thing,
which is so fucking serious.
Um,

2039
02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.600
I'll let you know when it's up cause we really,
seriously,
man,

2040
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:07.480
that's something that,
you know,
as much as my standup,

2041
02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.250
I want to build that radio show because I got to admit,
man,

2042
02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:13.340
I think it's just as good as anything else that's out there.
Yeah,
it's a got,

2043
02:02:13.341 --> 02:02:16.490
damn it,
it's worth a dollar to take a risk.
And if like usual,

2044
02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.380
I don't have any information of when it's going to be up,

2045
02:02:18.381 --> 02:02:22.200
but hopefully by next week,
Joe,
can you find some fucking tech nerd truck there?

2046
02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:26.360
I'm trying.
Trying a dude.
That's not what your outfits says.
You're off.

2047
02:02:26.361 --> 02:02:29.940
It says I quit a see.
Right.
Let's go get some pancakes.
You'll get a donut.

2048
02:02:29.970 --> 02:02:32.690
All right.
Thanks for listening to the uninformed,
I mean not on the form.

2049
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.710
I'm sorry to the,
to the Monday morning podcast.
Why saw your cute face?

2050
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:39.980
I thought that's what we were doing.
You guys all have a good week.
Hey,

2051
02:02:39.981 --> 02:02:43.520
I'm going to be at the uh,
the Improv in Pittsburgh this weekend.

2052
02:02:43.521 --> 02:02:45.420
I'm at the top of my game.
Motherfuckers,

2053
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:48.830
I've been on the road for the last five weeks.
Okay,
so you,

2054
02:02:48.831 --> 02:02:53.831
you fucking strap in and put on your comedy hats and take that whistle between

2055
02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:57.410
your fucking toes.
Cause I'm bringing the comedy,
one of my hyping

2056
02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:02.990
Joe.
This is my podcast.
You're selfish cunt.
All right,

2057
02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:03.824
when are you going to be there?

2058
02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.270
But we get of October 23rd on the 23rd and 24th.

2059
02:03:08.271 --> 02:03:12.230
I'll be recording my CD at the stress factory for comedy central records,

2060
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:15.440
stress factor,
New Brunswick,
New Jersey,
Jersey.
Please come out please.

2061
02:03:15.441 --> 02:03:18.170
23rd and 24th of October.
And I'll tell you this,
Joe,

2062
02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:23.000
I will argue they have the best Mozzarella sticks of any comedy club.
Dude,

2063
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:24.800
it's the perfect combination where,
where the,

2064
02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:28.190
the outer layer is nice and crunchy.
And you know,

2065
02:03:28.191 --> 02:03:29.610
I hate the ones that had just all mush.
It's,

2066
02:03:29.611 --> 02:03:32.990
it's like you're reading like garlic bread that somebody dropped in a fry later.

2067
02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.090
So even if you don't like Joe's act,
you can sit there now.
Go check them out.
I,

2068
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.410
I,
uh,
I backed Joe.
Joe To roses is a funny motherfucker,
right?
You guys,
ah,

2069
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:44.340
it wasn't that sweet.
All right,
