00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.130
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.840
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.190
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
You cubicle dwell in cons.
Um,
you know something.

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.450
I'd feel bad for you if you're sitting in a cubicle right now,

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:23.040
but I'm just so full of myself that I just don't have time to have empathy.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.030
I'm just going to sit here and a big hot tub of my own white privilege.

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.760
And speaking of other white males.
Yes.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.020
Why would you have another white male on your podcast?
You know why?

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:38.550
Because I'm not woke.
Um,
th 200% wrong today,
Bill.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.960
200% wrong.
That's right.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.180
Just when you thought the percentage couldn't go any higher.

13
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.090
I have the wonderful,
they always classy.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060
One of the few gentlemen my wife loves you.

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.870
Like she'd get like that one night we all hung up.
Sorry.
Let me it Nate,

16
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.730
Craig and Nate is here.
Not because he loves me,

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.170
not because he actually tried to pass the puck to me in the slot and I still

18
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:00.030
shot it right into the goalies fucking glove.

19
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:02.060
Remember that fucker went around like defense man,

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.660
he's here because he has a new album comedy album that's available on iTunes and

21
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.470
Amazon and all over the Internet called preferred customers.
Uh,

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
one of my favorite people,
one of my favorite comics,
Nate Craig,
welcome bill.

23
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.870
Thanks for having,
first of all I want to say I love,

24
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.990
we all love Nia as well and a man,

25
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.400
the gentlemen introduction.
I'll take it run and buddy.
Thank you.

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.520
We talking about,
yeah,
the amount of times that you've sent flowers.

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.930
You've sent cards because you know we had a kid and all of that shit.
You're,

28
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.720
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're a class act.
You're a Midwest guy.

29
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.380
What does it feel to be living out here in Hollywood and just referred to as a,

30
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.320
do they treat you like a flyover comic?
Ah,
yeah.
Some one.
The response

31
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.760
there is fine.

32
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.510
<v 2>This is that I get from,
uh,
from being from the Midwest.</v>

33
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.490
There are pretty hilarious.
People just don't,

34
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.270
they think you're a Trump supporter who just say Wisconsin and people laugh

35
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 1>in your face.
Now.</v>

36
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.160
Do you think that's cause the badgers lost three fucking rose bowls on a rough.

37
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.540
<v 2>Well that's got something to do with it.
Yeah.
How could it not?</v>

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.190
<v 1>You gotta you gotta they gotta do something.
Math whiskey like bat way.</v>

39
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.400
If you had to bet money who's taken the next title?

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.870
And it's hard with a college cause everybody fucking leaves but basket you got a

41
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:15.780
better chance in basketball or football.
It's Wisconsin.

42
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.260
Wisconsin meant we're not leaving that state.
You'd fucking cheesy.

43
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.040
Eaton motherfucker football for sure.
Football.
Yeah.
I don't know if I'm not,

44
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.210
your passport team was all right.

45
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.200
<v 2>They weren't so they lost their hall of fame head coach.</v>

46
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.780
<v 1>Um,
because uh,</v>

47
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.440
<v 0>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.120
<v 1>because what happened?
What happened?</v>

49
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.620
Cause outside fees is side piece went public.
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.260
Why does that get you fired?
Uh,
you know,
I don't know.

51
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.680
I think it was really a [inaudible] your wife just fire you and take your

52
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.170
fucking house.
You can't be a basketball coach.

53
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.170
And then where does he go from there?
Like some,
like some fucking a,
you know,

54
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.730
community college,
like a Delta risk behaviors.
Okay.
Oh Man.

55
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.480
<v 2>I think he was ready to retire.
Obviously he wanted him to get his guy the job.</v>

56
00:02:58.481 --> 00:02:59.860
So he got his,
the job,

57
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 1>he was like a serial killer that wanted to get caught,</v>

58
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.500
fucking banged or right down there to Hooters.

59
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.970
I want to bring it back to one of the America that I remembered where your side

60
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:14.020
piece didn't make you lose your job.
It was,
it was handled in house.

61
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.400
You white fucking slapped you.

62
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.540
She took you for everything that you had and then you just slowly drank herself

63
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.250
to death.
But it was none of my business.

64
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.570
Like why should I know that that guy was banging his Wa Bank fucking around on

65
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.370
his wife.
Yeah.
I didn't need to know any of that.
And uh,
definitely not a few.

66
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.850
It's going to keep going to final fours.
Yeah.
Just out of curiosity,

67
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.230
do you think if you have a side piece,

68
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:40.231
you no longer can explain the triangle offense to a incoming freshmen?

69
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.580
Like what does that have so many successful people,
they are college kids.

70
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.540
You gotta be real focused,
but some listen,
so many successful fucking people.

71
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:54.541
The reason why this is successful is because they have laser focus on their

72
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.000
career,
but everything else in their life is a mess.

73
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.030
Their personal life's a mess.
You sit down to talk to him,

74
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.100
they got a million things on their fucking mind.
So,

75
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.620
because this guy basically doesn't have a perfect life,

76
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.360
Nate Kraig can no longer get excited about the fucking final four.
Thank you.

77
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.220
Over a side piece.
I can't say it out loud,
but I'm glad you did bill.

78
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.470
I mean,
I don't know.
I,
uh,
I just don't like knowing that shit.

79
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.890
I don't,
I,
I honestly,
that's none of my fucking business.

80
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.310
And I think I actually thinks it brings more pain to his wife now.
Um,
no,
I just,

81
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.450
it's just,
it's none of my fucking business.
Yeah.

82
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.750
And I don't expect anybody that they're going to be perfect,

83
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.740
but if you get in a fucking team to the final four,

84
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.180
okay.

85
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.840
And you're not banging kids in the shower like they were doing at Penn state.

86
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.010
I mean,
that I get,
you're not be,
didn't beat up his wife.

87
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260
This isn't what you wanted to talk about.
I mean,

88
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:58.240
I'm just saying he fucked around.
I loved them.
Bo Ryan,
Paul Ryan,

89
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:02.020
Hall of fame.
Bobo had a little Ho Ho on the side.
Huh?

90
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.030
And that was the best thing that ever happened in Wisconsin basketball.
And uh,

91
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.200
you know what,
um,
if you had to build a defense for both,

92
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.260
how would I know I would do it.
I say like,
listen,
your honor,
I,

93
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:18.340
I'd make sure I had a male judge and it'd be like,
you know,

94
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.140
we don't get to choose the Jasper.
This is Wisconsin.
There's a fly over state.

95
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:24.640
You know,
you guys came in,
read out there,

96
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.460
you guys can't even fucking read out there fucking cheese.

97
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.740
I'm sure you in Wisconsin going to go to pick your judge.

98
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.790
I'm going to pick a judge.
Just let me live this far.
Do you meet your judges

99
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.500
and Hazard County?
So I pick a fucking,
that's a dukes of hazard,
uh,

100
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.630
reference for you younger people.
So I picked a male judge,
right?

101
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.820
And I would just be like,
look,
your honor,

102
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:48.460
can I approach the bench is too many brides and hey,

103
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.360
I don't want them to hear this,
right.
This is my fantasy court.

104
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.500
So he come walking up and say,
listen,
you're a successful guy.
Right?
Okay.

105
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.010
Now hasn't your wife always made sure that you fucking,
you know,

106
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.390
she always knocked shut down a little bit,

107
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.670
just so you feel like you don't get too big for your Britches,

108
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.080
no matter what you achieve.

109
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.050
She's always kind of just knocking you down a little bit just to make sure,

110
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.820
you know,
judge nobody knows better than you.
Uh,
the effort,
these Yak,

111
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.610
that successes,
I wasn't going that route.

112
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.370
I was going the route that she's just fucking,
you know,

113
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.950
she's still running the shit.
Like the more successful you get,

114
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:23.210
the more they're going to knock you down.

115
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.270
So there's still running shit around the house.
So then what happens is,

116
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.700
is you don't feel he does,
it's,
he bows over their case.

117
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.060
Guys go on to the final four,
like three fucking years in a row.
Okay?

118
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.820
I don't need to tell you that you're living in this state that you going to,

119
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.790
you got to fucking Badger Pin.
Right and you'll roll.
Okay.

120
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.010
Probably shouldn't have worried that during the trial might get a mistrial,

121
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.140
but this guy,
he's,
I am a big badger fan.
Bill.
You make a good point.

122
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.540
The Guy,

123
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.540
he needs a blow job every once in a while and it makes them relax.

124
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.720
It makes him here as team.
Okay.
We're so close right now.

125
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.690
We are so close to getting a fucking title.

126
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

127
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.500
<v 1>You're saying this is for the kids.
It's for the kids.
It's a fucking Cyprus.</v>

128
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.620
Okay.
This is,
this is between him and his wife.
That's all I'm saying.

129
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.630
All right.
Let them settle it.
Okay.
It then say it.

130
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.800
I'm not saying she shouldn't take the house and everything he's got and go fuck

131
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.480
one of his friends.
I'm not saying that,

132
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.020
I'm just saying we are so close to a fucking championship and I,

133
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.700
I think I speak for the state of Wisconsin when I say you let this man keep

134
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:32.950
coaching at your university.
They have been playing good defense lately.

135
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.000
They have been playing down daddy fence,
lockdown defense.

136
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.353
<v 3>Come on.</v>

137
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.910
<v 1>It'd be nice.
In a perfect world,
you could,</v>

138
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.980
you could pick your judges and your side piece.
Litigation.
Yeah.
No,
this is just,

139
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:52.490
yeah,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a,
uh,
it's,
Joe Rogan says this strange times.

140
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.850
It is strange.
It's a strange time.
Strange Times.
What does being a,

141
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.910
I saw two people on the Internet talking about how they're sick of being asked

142
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:03.820
about this thing that they were both talking to each other about on Twitter.

143
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.290
I just want him to tweet.

144
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:07.840
Did you two ever consider exchanging cell phone numbers?

145
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.810
What are you doing anyways?
You're a big baseball fan.

146
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.470
I'm a moderate,
moderate baseball fan.
Yeah.

147
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:20.740
I remember when that the brewers won the first game and you texted me.
He said,

148
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.790
you said Bill,
ladies and gentlemen,
your Milwaukee brewers.
They brought,

149
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.160
they brought the fucking lumber out.
That game.
I was going to happen.

150
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:29.610
I thought they were going to make it to the series.
I thought I was going to,

151
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.830
that we're going to have a little Boston,
Milwaukee.

152
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.190
If you could see the way nature down rubbing his fucking face.
Right.

153
00:08:36.191 --> 00:08:39.820
And I just think that his aims are soft.
They're just soft.
I'm not,
there's no,

154
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.800
there's only a couple of guys on that team I'm scared of.

155
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:44.430
I'm pissed that we couldn't beat him.
Like it's gotta be well sin,

156
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.570
no guy with a red face.
It's Justin Turner.

157
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.770
Manny Machado's get the best fucking and that should be,

158
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:54.790
it should have been Ballenger and then the ace to start her.
And I also like,

159
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:59.010
by way I don't,
as I was saying you,
I don't think Manny Machado was dirty.
Okay.

160
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:03.870
Ty Cobb did all of that shit and he's all over the fucking hall of fame.
Right.

161
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.800
Because there wasn't slow mo high def replay to show you when he kicked of,

162
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.260
I thought because it was white on white crime back then because it wasn't all

163
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.220
white league that it was okay if,
if ty Cobb,

164
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.100
uh,
you know,
spiked to Ulysses,

165
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.970
whoever the fuck was playing second base back then,
right.
Aberdeen,

166
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:25.560
whatever the hell his fucking name was.
Right.

167
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.180
I don't think ty Cobb discriminated.
Oh,
that's what I've heard.

168
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.760
You know what it was is probably a white guy who had the audacity to have a

169
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:39.550
little bit of a Tan that is really fucking weird about like,
you know you,

170
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.510
there's like straight up racist in the hall of fame.
Do you know there was,

171
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.820
there was a fucking guy,
and I don't know if this is true or not,

172
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.740
if this is just some scuttlebutt,

173
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.070
but there's literally like a guy in the hall of fame who used to carry a piece

174
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.450
from a rope from a lynching is good luck.
Can that be true?
Ooh,

175
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.120
that's a tough one.
That is worse than a side.

176
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:03.840
Pete and Pete rose can't get into the hall of fame because he bet on the fucking

177
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:08.610
dogs.
It comes to the chief.
I liked this,

178
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.060
the scuttle butt potential Scuttlebutt disclaimer,

179
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.760
all because everything,
cause all I do,

180
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.710
the only research I do is I talk to somebody in a bar or I search it on the

181
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:23.910
Internet and I click on the first thing and whatever it says like I was making,

182
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:26.970
you know,
sort of in a way,
like a,
what was it?
Kate Upton,

183
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.660
she was chime in and on the Houston red sox series.
So I'm sitting there going,

184
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:34.950
oh,
according to Kate Upton,
which was funny to me.
And then I was like,
wow,

185
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:35.431
isn't that cool?

186
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.130
She's that beautiful and she's done into baseball and so many fine brothers,

187
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:41.790
hey fuck head.
She's married to Justin Verlander.

188
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.820
She's carrying his kid right now.
It's like,
now it makes sense now.

189
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:48.540
It makes sense.
Okay,
got it.
But why does it need to make sense to me?
Yeah.
Why?

190
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.760
Why am I mansplaining?
Yeah.

191
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.870
The only thing on my own plot can only thing wrong with that was the research.

192
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.780
Yeah,
it was the discovery.
Well,

193
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:01.560
I feel like I'm a victim of like the intellect that I was blessed with.

194
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.450
So I'm the victim.

195
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.920
I can't help it if people are going to lie and then I'm going to read or maybe

196
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.490
they tell the truth and I don't read it.
And I think somewhere in there,

197
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.630
in this current climate,
I could somehow become a victim there.

198
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.140
It's the only true victim hood is not taking responsibility for your own fucking

199
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.990
actions,
correct?
Yes.
Yeah.
Just uh,

200
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.670
just being expected to research what it is you're having an opinion on.

201
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.320
I have a Wisconsin question for you.
You grew up there,
right?
Madison,
Wisconsin,

202
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:38.850
Madison,
smack Dab,
and you could not escape Wisconsin if you want it to.

203
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.050
Like if you were walking on foot,

204
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:44.490
how long would it take you to get to a great lake or Minnesota?
Couple of days.

205
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.170
It would take me a full,
it would take me,
yeah,

206
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.810
I'd say one,
one 24 hour period.
One 24 hour period.
All right.

207
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.850
In the summer of course.
Um,
okay,
so I want to know here in the winter,

208
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.650
I want to know how you got out of there,

209
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.060
out of the great state of Wisconsin without becoming a serial killer,

210
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.790
because that is kind of on the low that if you guys weren't so good at making

211
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.590
cheese right then he didn't have the packers.
Yeah,
there'd be a lot.

212
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.980
If you remove those two.
No,
no knives in,
it'd be more,

213
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:20.590
I'm just saying like that really would be,

214
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.500
you'd have to steer into that and that would have to be your calling card to

215
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.670
basically visit all of these people's houses.
He had Jeffrey Dahmer.

216
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.650
You had the fucking,

217
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.760
the guy who basically they've made like nine different serial killer movies just

218
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.540
based off of everything that he did.
They couldn't fit it all into one script.

219
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.280
Talking about Ed [inaudible],
ed [inaudible],
ed gain.
He was Hannibal Lecter.

220
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.370
He was the Texas chainsaw massacre guys too.
Maybe.

221
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.100
I Dunno what Texas might get mad at that.
Hey,

222
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.590
don't be taken our fucking serial killers there.
Yeah.

223
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.560
<v 2>Liberal fucking snowflake.</v>

224
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.830
Fucking and scooter drive and freckled.
I'm the only guy I know.
Defense,

225
00:12:58.831 --> 00:13:00.960
serial killers.
I'm the only guy I know

226
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.180
<v 1>ever been asked.</v>

227
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.760
Remember that we were on the road and we just thought that was the funniest

228
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:08.840
thing ever.
So redneck shit talking.
I'll start with that.
Yep.

229
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.590
<v 2>I'm the only one word.
Caver I think I heard some guy on the,</v>

230
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.670
on the plane or something.
Say it.
It's just such a ridiculous way to,

231
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.970
to brag about yourself.
I'm the only guy I ever know.
I'm only guy I know I have.

232
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:22.530
No,
I'm the only guy I've ever met.
I'm only guy I ever met with a pan bathrobe.

233
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.140
<v 1>Yeah,
Dude.
We did that for hours.</v>

234
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.260
Where will we drive was at that time we did that Gig in Winnipeg and we drove

235
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:32.160
all the way up to fucking Sasquatch.

236
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.160
<v 2>Ooh.
That was a different time I think,</v>

237
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:36.830
but we still had a southern accent on that for some reason.

238
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.270
I don't know why we didn't go Canadian.

239
00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:40.730
It's just so fun to do the southern accent.
Oh,

240
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:44.900
you do with the good Canadian this so sorry.
Oh,
sorry.
Oh,
oh,
sorry.
I said,
oh,

241
00:13:44.901 --> 00:13:48.500
we're going up to Saskatoon.
We,
that was a fun drive that was so flat.

242
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.480
That's the flattest earth I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah,

243
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.260
well that's what they farm out that way.
And I mean dude,

244
00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:59.261
it was so flat that you could see the earth rounding down now and you could

245
00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:05.141
actually see the northern lights disappear over the flat horizon up there man.

246
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.100
Well that

247
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.933
<v 1>they farmed there as,</v>

248
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.660
as I read Bonnie Mcfarlane's book and her dad for some reason went to like

249
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:11.494
Alberta,

250
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.620
which is all rocky and you want to either have like cattle or drill for oil and

251
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.710
for whatever reason he was like,
fuck this,
I'm going to try to farm here.

252
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:25.240
And just made their life,
I guess a much more difficult than it needed to be,

253
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.580
which is why she's now a comedian.
I imagine that was your line in Winnipeg.

254
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.400
It was just cause flying into that city.

255
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:37.720
I mean it's just nothing with Oh yeah.
Nothing around it.
And you were like,

256
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:41.590
I've never felt so safe landing kind of landed anyway.

257
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.430
You were a lot of options.
Shut your eyes and just auto rotate to you,

258
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:48.940
felt your skids,
touch the ground.
It's going to be level still running,
landing.

259
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.060
Um,
so anyways,
let's talk about your album.
Where,
uh,

260
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.660
where did you tape this soon to be deemed a masterpiece.

261
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.250
<v 2>Oh,
the masterpiece happened at dynasty typewriter.
It's a new spot.</v>

262
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:02.750
It's at the,
the,
hey,
we're,

263
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.380
I'm the only guy I ever met recorded an album of the dynasty tap rider couldn't

264
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:11.270
tap.
We'll say Sandler did it.
Uh,
his part of his special there,
his new,
a special,

265
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.880
oh,
I got to see that.
That just came out on the 23rd.
It's great.

266
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.630
There's some of some of that is shot there.
Um,
but I am,

267
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.410
I am the only guy I ever met did album at the dynasty typewriter.

268
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.470
And you made a say day.
Uh,
yeah.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
No I didn't.

269
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.810
I mean it's a,
it's a great place.

270
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.700
<v 1>I'm putting my next one out on laser disk,
laser disk.</v>

271
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.800
I just want the true fans to fucking get it.

272
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.780
Is My phone on making all that noise.
Um,
oh,
what did I do now?

273
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.640
Oh,
my headphones.
We're working perfect.

274
00:15:38.641 --> 00:15:41.610
And then I had the audacity to touch something.
Can you still hear me Nate?

275
00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:45.630
Cause I can't hear myself.
I can hear yourself loud and clear.

276
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

Go to game.</v>

282
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.370
<v 1>Oh,

283
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

284
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.040
<v 1>Oh my God.
That's awesome.
That is awesome.</v>

285
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.330
Oh k bellies in the game.
You're gonna sit in the bleachers.

286
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.030
I'm sitting up top with the real people and even be down.

287
00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:27.600
Swing me downstairs talking to Jane Fonda.
Jane,
honestly,

288
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.980
how many games did you watch this year?

289
00:16:28.981 --> 00:16:33.981
Hanging out with Paula Abdul and in the dugout club here were cold hearted

290
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:37.590
snake.
Is that what she's saying?
I had the biggest fucking crush on her.

291
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.040
There were so many fucking hot chicks and the late fucking eight,
uh,

292
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.680
there was a chick,
uh,
uh,
what was her name?
Can't remember any of them.

293
00:16:46.681 --> 00:16:47.910
Samantha Fox.

294
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

295
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.890
<v 1>Fucking,
uh,
uh,
the one you just said,
Paula Abdul</v>

296
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.930
<v 2>who was the one and I'm a cadre from labyrinth and she was in requiem for a</v>

297
00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:05.970
dream.
The,
she's got brown hair.
Got and going to weaver.
No,
no,

298
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.040
not Sigourney weaver,
but that was Tyler.

299
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

300
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.270
<v 2>Jane Fonda.
I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
Yeah.</v>

301
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.010
Paula Abdul met her at the dugout club.

302
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.320
<v 1>You dead still good looking,
right?
Yeah,
she's Paula Abdul.</v>

303
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.800
She's great.
Didn't not visible,

304
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.630
but you guys are judge her work and not the way she looks.

305
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.090
Opposites attract.
Uh Huh.
Could you stop being a track to get the cars up?

306
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.380
Oh yes.
Attract.
That's right.
Oh yeah.
Oh,

307
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.320
but you take two steps back.
You know when you know when the album was over,

308
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.250
when does that,

309
00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:48.640
that's what we should be talking about was was the stupid video she made with

310
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:52.290
the cat and they had the animated cat which was supposed to be like,
uh,

311
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.430
that's when I was being like,
all right.

312
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.650
I think they're trying to get too many hits off this album.

313
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.280
That was opposites attract.
I think that was the video for that.
Oh was it?

314
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.170
I think so.
So easy to write a fucking hit song back then,
right?

315
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.280
Bump,
bump,
bump wardrobe.
Bob Bobo.
Bobo.

316
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.830
I don't think it's going any harder.
It's more comfortable.
Bodo boat boat,
boat.

317
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:17.220
Obu back to my album bell.
Yeah.
Dynasty type.

318
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:22.221
I can cracked bumper of of God an album on the enter.

319
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.510
Nahin
Tammy,
Nate,
how did you come up?

320
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.500
Sorry.
I feel like I'm driving across country with you right now.

321
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.140
You're just giddy cause you got tickets to the world series.

322
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.910
I'm also guilty cause I had that operation men over 50 have and I find out I'm

323
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:41.970
not going to fucking die ass cancer.
I fucking did that yesterday.

324
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.560
What did you get put in your butt hole?
I had,
I,
as I kept saying to Nia,
she,

325
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.240
I go two days down,
I go,
Jacques Cousteau up the ass.
Ho.

326
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.470
It's what I kept calling it.
I had you get a colonoscopy.
Yeah.

327
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.310
So it's,
it's just a procedure.
It's a procedure.

328
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.760
They just sneak that camera up in.
Yeah.
It's the easiest thing.

329
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.410
They meet the neighbors.

330
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.070
Like you know what the hardest fucking thing is just for everybody out there.

331
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:09.900
Right.
The hardest fucking thing is first of all,

332
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:14.130
as a guy to actually go to the doctor,
you know,
I'm a typical guy.
He should guys,

333
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.800
right.
So,
um,
they just scare the shit out of you,

334
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:21.270
if no pun intended about this thing,

335
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:25.020
because I think the colonoscopy is a bit of a scam because it used to be,

336
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:26.790
you got to get it when you're over 50.

337
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.480
Then it became 45 now it's 40 and it's like every 10 years now.

338
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:33.650
The sand to be five now the Santa Fe,
three to five I think they got everything,

339
00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:36.750
but now that every guy feels like it's okay to go in there,

340
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:38.910
it doesn't mean that you're a little fucking on the fence.

341
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.090
You know guys are so fucking homophobic.
I ain't get it yet.
Fucking procedure.

342
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.370
Hicham guy would just fucking fake.
You'll age.
Right?

343
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.760
Then you did die like Vincent Party.
That's why he died.
He was like,

344
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:49.050
they ain't putting that fucking thing up.
Me.

345
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.260
Granted it was also the late 1960s they just would have stuck their head in

346
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.750
there and be like,
Yup.
It's like you're going to die.

347
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.710
Camera was way bigger back then,
but way bigger.
It's one of those old fucking,

348
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.940
what are the silent film thing?
Yeah.

349
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.490
It was a crank con with a crank literally inside your body,

350
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.580
and so he took a picture.
It was that explosion with the fucking Chink,
Chink,

351
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:09.450
Chink,
Chink,
Chink,
Chink.

352
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.120
Then when they took the picture and there was that explosion for the flash,

353
00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:15.420
they had a stick that in your two we got to talk couch.
Yeah.

354
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.950
So anyways,
the hardest thing was,
uh,

355
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.990
the stuff you have to drink is just kind of,

356
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.140
it's like the best tasting medicine.
It still tastes medicine.

357
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.870
And then you just sort of like,
you know,
you can't eat for a day,

358
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.500
but then when you go there,
it's just,
they go,
okay,
here we go.

359
00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:38.160
Here's the fucking anesthesia.
And they put it on yet.
And then two,

360
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.440
you're out,
you're out,
you're out,
you're out for this,
you're out.
Ooh,
wait,

361
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.590
I didn't know it was like that.
Yeah.
A lot of trust.
There's a lot of trust.

362
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.990
You're,
and then all of a sudden,
like a second later,
somebody goes,
all right,

363
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:51.820
you're good.
You're like,
that's it.
That's,

364
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.410
it sounds like a UFO abduction now because that's,

365
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.150
you know,
I will fully went there.

366
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.870
I wasn't walking out into a field of corn pass Ed Gains House.

367
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.720
So if there's anybody out there of a certain age,
like,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's easy.

368
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.930
I'm only guy.
I ever met senior Ufo it target.

369
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.700
And how do you only got a sheet?
Um,
yeah,

370
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.040
so I'm also giddy about that cause I'm on the other side of it.

371
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.490
Next month I'm getting my heart checked out.
This is all being an old debt,

372
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.160
getting the heart checked out during the stress test.

373
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.740
And then I'm actually for the first time I life going to have like a fucking

374
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.620
doctor where I'll go to get a physical every year.
Hold up now are you,

375
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:34.270
where are you walking on your tiptoes today?
I have a few on there,
buddy.
Oh,

376
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:37.660
I have no idea that a group of men were looking at my ass yesterday.

377
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.430
No clue whatsoever.
I,
you know what I mean?

378
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.460
It was sort of probably the same feeling like if you got abducted by aliens,

379
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.670
but the next day you kind of know something went down,

380
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:49.870
but you don't really remember it.

381
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.510
And it's difficult to relate to other human beings

382
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.310
that only lasts for a couple of hours.
Such your doctor.

383
00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:01.180
Essentially the world series tickets fell.
Yeah.
Like,
hey fill this.

384
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:04.170
Never happened.
This never happened.
No,
I am.
I'm,

385
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.670
I'm thrilled so I don't have to go back.

386
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:10.630
They said for another three to five years and it's just like,
all right,
so then,

387
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.250
but then what's good dude?
It's like back in the day,
man,

388
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.650
when he got the fucking AIDS test,
right.

389
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:16.540
And it was just like the first time you got it,

390
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.870
this was every fucking check you would ever fucking Ben width.

391
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.350
And then it's nervous.
Yeah.
And then the next time he got tests,
I,

392
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:25.480
it's just the last three years,
you know,

393
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.070
so it's going to be the same way at the high.
You know,

394
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:28.720
I went to Mcdonald's a couple of times.

395
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.090
I've been eating plenty of men,

396
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.560
eaten plenty of fucking Bali or whatever the hell you supposed to be doing.

397
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.730
I've been doing all right though.
But you know,
so I'm,

398
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.790
you know what's funny though is it's still nerve wracking anytime you go to,

399
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:47.350
I mean,
you know,
that's the,
I'm engaged in.
Awesome.
Good to go.

400
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:50.560
But to go in and get tested this screenings even.
Oh yeah.

401
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.120
I can't remember the first.
You remember the first yes.
Test you ever.
Yes.

402
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.030
And I hate the coolest.

403
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.740
I have the coolest fucking doctor ever to look on your face.

404
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.660
I was sitting there and he knew I was fine.

405
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.910
He came walking out and he was just going to come on back.
You find you find,

406
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:04.721
don't worry.
Come on back.
I was like,

407
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:07.910
thank God he didn't do the scared straight fucking thing where he had me walk

408
00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:12.460
all the way back.
Okay,
we got your results and you know,

409
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.000
look behind door number two.
He just saw it.
He was like,
dude,
you're fine.

410
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:20.750
You find it's like,
all right,
thanks.
Let me know that you came out the gate.
Yeah,

411
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.410
buddy.
Yeah.
And uh,
uh,

412
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.810
so that was so now that I got that out of the way,

413
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:29.330
so I'm going to bill burr got after it.
I'm going to,
uh,

414
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.670
I didn't really get after it,

415
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:35.200
but I went after I went in the wrong areas of society and fucking,
uh,
you know,

416
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.030
I was at guy,
you know,
you know,
I was standing up during battle.

417
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:41.170
I shouldn't have done that.
You know,

418
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.340
I should have protected myself a little better,
but that was young me.
Yeah.

419
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.000
That was meat.
Like I grew up in the 80 [inaudible] so I didn't,

420
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.290
I didn't know what it jumped a fence at that point.
You know,

421
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.530
there wasn't a lot of information out there.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

422
00:23:53.531 --> 00:23:56.380
It all,
you're a kid from the 90s,
right?
Yeah,
I gotcha.

423
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.920
I grew up with like fucking insane.

424
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:01.800
Your jumped the fence is a interesting saying that I haven't used [inaudible]

425
00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:05.900
and backstreet boys.
Oh,
the beginning.
They were like,
if as long as you,

426
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:10.430
if it was initially considered a gay disease and people who were shooting
heroin,

427
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.253
I remember that.

428
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.220
So there was all these homophobic jokes about it and all of this stuff about

429
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:20.020
junkies of that type of stuff.
And then who was I?

430
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.720
It was probably Magic Johnson.
And then he's like,
oh,

431
00:24:22.721 --> 00:24:26.480
well he kissed fucking Isaiah and the Gi guy,
old fucking know about that.

432
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:28.700
It's like,
well,
they do that in France all the fucking time.

433
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.280
Nobody's bagging more women than those guys.
So,
uh,
that,
that was a thing.

434
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.190
Then all of a sudden it had gone into the whole,
you know,
I,
I dunno,
I dunno.

435
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.730
I don't pay attention to stuff.
That's when you,
uh,

436
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.790
you got tested the week after Magic's a press conference.
I got tested,

437
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.260
uh,
mid nineties,

438
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.690
mid nineties.
I did.
And I,
I was in a relationship and she's like,
yeah,

439
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:58.460
we should both get tested.
I was just like,
yeah,
yeah,
let's do that all the time.

440
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:02.390
All the time.
No,
but I remember too,
I came out,
I was,
I was,
you know,

441
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.300
had nothing clean bill of health and I was just,

442
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.960
I was site was fucking psyched.
You know,
you got lucky.

443
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.510
Yeah.
You got lucky.

444
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:17.240
Got Dark Jordan three peat,
Boom Paul.
Oh,

445
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.320
sorry.
That was loverboy.
Um,
that's funny.
Like they should guess,

446
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:27.500
like,
we know when you get tests for that,
it would be like,
all right.

447
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.450
What bands were you listening to when the high school?

448
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.080
I was listening to loverboy all right,
dude,
you might want to sit out for this.

449
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.180
But anyway,
so I'm a,
I'm so I,

450
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:38.660
this is some weird way that I'm promoting your album and also I listened to
rush,

451
00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:42.680
so I was pretty clear that was in the clear,
you know,

452
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:45.310
I heard a rush song the other day that I actually,
uh,

453
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.680
I hadn't heard in a long time.
I really find that man,
it's a great song.

454
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:49.880
I work in man.
Yeah.

455
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.790
<v 4>Oh
No,
no,
no.</v>

456
00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.970
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
Sorry.
All I can hear his lover.
Boy,
I'm damaged some.</v>

457
00:26:00.971 --> 00:26:02.130
That's one hell of a mash up.

458
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.170
Do you know how many times I heard pour some sugar on me in the summer of

459
00:26:05.171 --> 00:26:08.470
[inaudible] 88.
I listened to it a lot.

460
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.460
That was the hot video that summer MTV showed music.

461
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.470
I remember as a kid,
I was a little kid.
Look,
mommy,

462
00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:20.950
he's playing the drums with one hand.
I thought it was cool.

463
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.170
I think it's really cool that they didn't fire that guy.
They stood by him.
Yeah.

464
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.840
There's people,
all they do is meth and they're out of the fucking bed.

465
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.470
That guy lost an arm and they're still like,
ah.
All right mate.

466
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.010
Learn how to play with your feet too.
I mean,
they just like,

467
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:40.990
I mean talk about friends.
I mean you got to thank,
if you lose a F,

468
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.030
I mean if a guitarist lost the armies out,
he's out.

469
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.410
<v 2>Yeah,
that,
yeah,
you can,
he can,
he can stand on the stage,
but he's,</v>

470
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:51.120
they're not going to trust them with any solos.

471
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.140
<v 1>It's a rough one arm grip guy with no arms.
Who plays a mean guitar.</v>

472
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.700
I've seen that somewhere.
I make heat pain.

473
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.160
He has a c as he was use those slide for his big toe.
He uses a spoon.

474
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.750
There was somebody I saw,
I had like a fucking spoon in his mouth or something.

475
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.200
There's like,
whenever I see those fucking things like,
uh,

476
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.720
I'm always amazed by it.
And then also I feel like,
um,

477
00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.440
I'm at Coney Island without paying the fee.

478
00:27:17.441 --> 00:27:19.810
There's always like an element of guilt to this.
Like,

479
00:27:19.811 --> 00:27:24.550
why am I watching this fucking person?
You know,
like,
this is,
uh,
you know,

480
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.260
spoon man,
his phone man playing a strong without my hands,

481
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.820
my feet

482
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.310
make me feel guilty for watching yo bone,

483
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.100
man.
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.863
You know we're going to wait.
Wait.

485
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.670
What we're basically doing is we're just recreating what we do when we're in the

486
00:27:48.671 --> 00:27:49.504
fucking car

487
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.690
as we're driving up to Saskatoon.
Remember when we were in Winnipeg and we are,

488
00:27:55.691 --> 00:27:58.710
we thought they were both Boeing us cause we said we're going to the saxes this

489
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.820
tune they catch kept people in the upper deck just kept going through food,
food.

490
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.950
I thought they were boring me.
I was just like good people up there.

491
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.700
They are good people.
You will,
you were sold man.
I was ready to move.

492
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.360
You ready to move?
Find your wife settled down.
Tune tune tonight.

493
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.800
Get yourself a little farm.

494
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.560
All those creepy serial killer fucking tools that you have.

495
00:28:17.561 --> 00:28:21.460
No one would question and ship.
There you go.
That's right.

496
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:26.590
One side on the,
is Trump going to make it better?
One side and the uh,

497
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.580
I dunno.
Whatever.
Whatever the fuck it is.
Free ice.
Is that what you get up there?

498
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.230
Just those fucking tons of free ice.
The ice time up there.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah.

499
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.170
<v 2>It's all 14 months a year.</v>

500
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.390
<v 1>Oh No.
And I,
I was in Ottawa.
I was looking,
I go,
what's up at that rank?
They go,</v>

501
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.990
oh,
oh,
if you want to skate around your kid.
Oh sure.
Did you bring your boots?

502
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.460
Yeah,
they just had an outdoor rink.

503
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.700
There was some woman out there figure skating during like lunch hour.

504
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.870
And then I'm seeing this little kid,

505
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:54.360
the mother's like teaching them how to like crossover and shit like that.

506
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:58.590
And I was just like,
this is why we went at the amateur level,
the gold metal,

507
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:02.290
but not the pro level because they're amateurs are already in the pros.

508
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.400
And that's,
I think that's,
that's my theory why we always,
we win the amateur one,

509
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.210
but we don't,
the juniors,
sorry,
we don't win the,
uh,
the pros,

510
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.130
<v 2>it's all that free ice.
We're pretty good despite,</v>

511
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.810
despite the fact that a,
we focus on every other major sport first.

512
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.440
<v 1>I ain't,
you know,
so that's a good point.</v>

513
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.750
Despite the fact that I think that the tipping point was when roller blading was

514
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:31.130
as popular as it was.
I,
and then roller hockey started getting going.

515
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:34.310
I thought then we were going to be able to compete with them and then all of a

516
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:38.480
sudden one homophobic joke,
different game.
One homophobic joke

517
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:45.220
it though where it's the same level of tenacity.
No,
it is not.

518
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.660
It's a slower Craig,

519
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:49.990
if you're going to try to tell me that roller hockey is slower than ice hockey,

520
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.750
I'm going to end this podcast right now.
That's an ease.

521
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.830
If you're going to give me that,
I'm going to,
I'm going to run with that all day.

522
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.300
You played hockey,
right?
Man,
I'm the only guy I ever met.

523
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.530
I'm the only guy I ever met.
You played high school?
Yeah,

524
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:07.850
I played high school hockey.
And uh,
how would,

525
00:30:07.851 --> 00:30:11.560
how would you describe your game average below average?
I started kind of late,

526
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:15.160
but were you,
uh,
was there a mean streak t game?
No,
I,

527
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.230
I definitely like to,
I liked to uh,
play physical,

528
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.450
you know,
physical guy.
I would,
I would,
I would,

529
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.790
I would get the crap knocked out of me,
but I would also,
I would also,

530
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:32.380
well you're not a small guy where you just say your winery back then here,

531
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.140
you know,
I wasn't,
do you have a temper?

532
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.060
Did your ears turned red when somebody checked you?

533
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.650
Definitely wanted to hurt somebody if you know it was full of full contact.

534
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:46.120
Hockey is the best.
I just haven't played in a long time.

535
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.340
What's the warrants shoulder pads in 20 years,

536
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.180
what's the best you have a got somebody.
Oh my God.
I don't know.

537
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.330
Somebody's coming across the middle with their head down.
I mean you can really,

538
00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:01.030
did they have to leave the ice?
Uh,
I don't think I ever heard anybody.

539
00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:06.460
Um,
do you feel bad at all?
No,
I did not ever hurt anybody.
No.
I never felt bad.
No,

540
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:10.900
never ever,
ever.
That was like a legal in hockey.
Like if you actually feel bad,

541
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.900
yeah,
you can't,
it's time for you.
They make you walk out.

542
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:18.460
That's when you put your roller,
you,
it's roller blades

543
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.650
start taking wide turns out there.

544
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.400
He let me tell you something.
I'd like to see somebody set up those cones.

545
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:30.850
The way those kids do in the park and do those little fucking backwards little s

546
00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:34.910
turns go through.
I've got some go get them kids.

547
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.500
Put it on your little booty shorts.
Come back down backwards.
I Dunno.

548
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.200
I we started to,
it was a little more manly to roller blade.

549
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.550
I mean it gets cause it's so acceptable to play ice hockey.
You know what I mean?

550
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:47.020
I thought it took a real man.

551
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:49.690
Somebody who's really comfortable with themselves comfortable just skate

552
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:50.890
backwards in a park.

553
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.610
You know with your short shorts aren't going around in and out of those fucking

554
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.330
orange cones.
Little comes to,
didn't want to come and speak to big no,
no,
no.

555
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.720
You know you get the little cones cause cause otherwise people think,
you know,

556
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.800
maybe think more of you if you have a regular size construction cone cause she

557
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:07.780
got even more difficult.

558
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
You know what it was used for other things that could be confused for real man

559
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:15.490
activities.
I know what it is.

560
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.740
What it is is the cone would be so high and he had a hunch down that your ball

561
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:22.910
bag would be hitting them because you,

562
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.480
your crotch stays right over the fucking coats.
Yeah.

563
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:27.820
Cause you're so comfortable in who you are.
That's right.

564
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.810
That you're the kind of guy with a big low hanging ball sack that you might gag

565
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:35.620
that might nick,
one of those tall regular sized cones.

566
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.470
You got to have low cones and you think it hurts to fall on the ice fall and the

567
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:40.130
asphalt.
Okay.
If

568
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v 2>you're man enough to rollerblade in the park with short cones and Spandex,</v>

569
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.180
then you got a ball bag that hangs low enough for you to maybe protect

570
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.293
<v 1>from what he's saying,</v>

571
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.300
<v 2>from a taller cone.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm assigned sign with the roller blade just here.</v>

572
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.890
I'm agreeing.
I'm just saying I'm,
I'm not,

573
00:32:56.891 --> 00:33:00.340
I'm not arguing with your point that it takes a real man to go out in the park,

574
00:33:00.341 --> 00:33:04.600
set up cones,
be secure enough with yourself.
To me,
I might never be bill.

575
00:33:04.601 --> 00:33:08.470
I'm not go rollerblading.
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna lie.
I have limitations.

576
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:11.890
I have limitations.
Hey,
I have to promote,

577
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.830
<v 1>uh,
something.
Aside from your Alvin preferred customer,</v>

578
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.570
what do you sell on this week bill?
I'm selling efforts first.

579
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.620
Family season three is coming out on Netflix on November 29th next month.

580
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.070
Um,

581
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.630
it will be a joyous occasion and I think this is our strongest season.

582
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:36.920
I'm talking a little shit here man.
All right.
You understand what I'm doing here.

583
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.970
I'm saying that this is the best work we've done and I challenge you to watch

584
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:42.200
all 10 episodes.

585
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.390
So I get credit for the ratings before you decide that I sneak.
Hey,

586
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.120
here's something else.
You're on a,

587
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:55.010
you're on a show maniac also on Netflix.
Buddy by the great Jonah Hill.

588
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.880
Huge fan of Jonah Hill.
You,
I like Jonah Hill when he's,

589
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:00.870
when he promotes something as someone gives him shit,

590
00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:02.540
he tells him to go fuck themselves.

591
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.300
I don't know why more celebrities don't do that.

592
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:09.050
There's always these little nitpick fucking cunty journalists coming at them.

593
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.050
It's just like,
why?
Why don't you just say go fuck yourself?

594
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.880
He does not say he does it all the time.

595
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:18.800
Not trying to like put it out there that he's liked that,

596
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.650
but there was some guy just,
he was harping on him about his fucking wait,

597
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.690
no one that he was sensitive about it.
And you just said,
you know what?

598
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:26.360
Fuck you fucking,
you just,
ah,
I wanted to,

599
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.890
I wanted him to him to the punch that guy so bad,
you know,

600
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.090

Nate,

How much time have we done here?

617
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.530
Your Vision's a little blurry because they crawled up inside you with a,

618
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.060
with a crank.
Wayne,
you know,
I would like to,

619
00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:56.250
I would like to think that you'd have a little more fucking empathy for me.
Oh,

620
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:59.580
Bill,
I'm just trying,
I'm trying to make excuses for your poor vision.

621
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.060
Trying to remind everybody what you've been through.
What I've been through.

622
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:04.530
I'm the victim here.
Yeah.

623
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.100
Told you literally take a nap and you wake up and the guy's like,
all right,

624
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:12.310
you're all good and you will feel nothing.
You were all good.
They,
it's,

625
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.020
they got it.
It's a cameras are getting smaller.

626
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.930
The cameras are getting smaller and smaller every year.
Yeah.

627
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.450
You know something that's actually a good point.
Like why didn't I,
yeah,
it's,

628
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:28.170
it's good that you waited.
I waited till the cameras was small enough.

629
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.090
I'm doing the same thing with hair plugs.

630
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.370
I'm just waiting until they just fucking,

631
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.070
you just throw some fertilizer on your fucking head.

632
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:39.180
I'm not doing this shit vacuum and stuff out and maybe,
or maybe not.

633
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:44.070
I'm waiting for when it's 100%.
What are they vacuum?
Well,

634
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:47.160
they used to take like a slice out of the back.

635
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.550
They'd cut like a fucking like a strip by the way,
dude.
You have,

636
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:52.920
you have the hair I had when I was in like fucking third grade.

637
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.280
He fucking another reason to download preferred customer by Nate Kraig instant

some of the Great Jonah Hill.

640
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.410
Jonah Hill handed Jonah Hill never tells anybody to go fuck themselves unless

641
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:14.430
they deserve it.
It's,
I love Jonah Hill.
Um,

642
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.330
Oscar nominated John Hill.
I heard him on know Howard stern today.

643
00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:21.380
He's got some film coming out too that I'm going to go see.
Yeah,

644
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.750
the eighties or something.
No,
it's about the nineties.
the 90s.
Yeah,

645
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.800

yeah,
I'm going to see that too.
Um,
anyways,

646
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.160
so I got to do what they used to cut a fucking strip out of the back of your

647
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:36.270
head.
Right.
And then they'd,
it was fucking creepy.
Then they take that,

648
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.130
then they'd sell your head back together.

649
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.880
They take like an eighth of an inch out and then somehow strip.
Yeah,

650
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:42.870
just that strip.

651
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.710
They were able to seed your like how you getting there is not enough like dead

652
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:48.540
hair only covered that amount of your head.

653
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.450
This is going to cover the whole top of your head.
I don't know how they did it.

654
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:56.100
It's kind of like when they see the room fat tricking the rest of your scalp and

655
00:37:56.101 --> 00:38:00.150
the growing hair.
Well these,
the ones in the back,
I guess they're good for life.

656
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.790
I don't get it,
but like as far as I look at it,

657
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:08.400
it's like now you stick it into the,
the fucking no man's land.
The DMZ,

658
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:13.320

659
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:13.621

I would love,
I mean imagine being able to call,
you know,

685
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.550
if you got to call your favorite sport.
Yeah.
That's so fun.

686
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.811
No,
and then he also,

687
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:56.770
the fact that that's as far as like having the best guy fight the best guy,

688
00:39:56.771 --> 00:40:01.480
best woman fight the best woman as far as that goes.
That mm.

689
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.493
MMA.

690
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.650
That's what I feel is what killed boxing was just those guys duck and people for

691
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:10.600
years and years and years.
And then it's like,
here's,

692
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.230
this is the IBF heavyweight champion.
This is the WBC,
the WBA.

693
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:16.360
Like back in the day when I was a kid,

694
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:19.870
there was one world champion and you had to beat that fucking guy to win.

695
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.310
They weren't like three of them.

696
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.760
And then somebody is trying to unify the fucking title and they became like

697
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:29.140
those fucking superhero movies.
Like after awhile it's just like I did.

698
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:31.030
These two guys exist at the same time.

699
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.780
How are they driving down the street together?
Who's a good guy?
He's a bad guy,

700
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:36.880
right?
I don't know.
I never really watched the superhero.

701
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:41.510
I'll still watch boxing now.
I don't know why I still,
I love boxing,
but it's,

702
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.420
it is obnoxious that they can some home.
Can you imagine if,

703
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.750
if,

704
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:51.160
if Mayweather and Pacquiao fought when they should've fought and they just had

705
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:54.700
fucking two or three classics,

706
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.040
Mayweather would have knocked them out three times.
Knock.

707
00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:01.390
Do you think he had that power?
Yeah.
Okay.

708
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.670
I don't mean I don't know enough about it.
I don't either,

709
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.690
but I'm out of my wheelhouse

710
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.610
aside from early Tyson and maybe Roy Jones for a year or two.

711
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.180
He's the best boxer I've ever watched.
I mean,
yeah,
you can't hit the guy.

712
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.220
He can't hit the guy and his left that left comes just real heavy.
Yeah.

713
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:24.220
I think he would've knocked out my fanny pack y'all a couple of times for sure.

714
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:26.210
If they had a fight.
Well we ain't.
They should have followed the pot,

715
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.220
the pot shop pot.
How do you think he would have done?
Was he like,

716
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:34.130
was he a middle middleweight?
What was he?
I don't even know.
Well,

717
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.160
if he was in that division with Hagler Hearns,

718
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.200
Leonard and Duran and all of them took a loss because all four of those guys

719
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:45.870
were around at the same time.
Now I don't know enough about boxing.
Like what?

720
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.210
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say there wasn't that level of talent,

721
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.960
his division.
So taking that guy back in time,

722
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.660
because I had his big argument one time with Versie about this,
where he verse,

723
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.800
he said he would've beat all four of those guys.
I'm like,

724
00:41:57.801 --> 00:42:01.160
all four of those guys couldn't even beat each other.

725
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.060
How much weight does he have on this way?
Well,
I wish I knew the way class.
Well,

726
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:06.530
let's just say they were the same way class.

727
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:10.220
The big thing with Tommy Hearns was he was so fucking tall and could make that

728
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:13.330
weight.
He was like six feet tall or something like that.

729
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.510
You want me whether it beats any of those

730
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.520
<v 2>skies because the difference in from now and then is significant in the training</v>

731
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.260
and the Diet.

732
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.640
<v 1>No,
no,
no,
no,
but that's not a fair thing.</v>

733
00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:25.800
I'm saying if every bit they had the same training,
the same die,

734
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.360
they came up in the same era.

735
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.270
<v 2>I don't know.
I didn't watch,
I didn't watch enough any of them,
but I,
but I,</v>

736
00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.470
I think that a Floyd Mayweather definitely could,

737
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.070
could bang and stand a pretty good chance.

738
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.180
<v 1>No,
I didn't think it would be good against any of them.
I just don't know.</v>

739
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.490
Go for no foreign.
Oh yeah.
It's tough.
But they should be fighting all of,
I mean,

740
00:42:44.491 --> 00:42:48.420
yeah,
there should be no cupcake fights,
hair plugs.

741
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.123
I don't,

742
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.690
I still can't wrap my head around how some hair follicles are going to trick the

743
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:58.330
other hair follicles and growing more hair.
No,
no,
no.
These ones that just like,

744
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:02.600
okay,
these ones up here are sensitive.
Right.
That's what

745
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.570
these ones back here with raise.
Right?
Like their parents didn't just,

746
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.120
if they fell down they said rub some dirt on it.
They just,

747
00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:13.690
these ones up here were,
I dunno.
I Dunno what happened.
He just,

748
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:17.320
everything was not there for like the teacher said the kid was a fucking
asshole.

749
00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.350
The parents blame the teacher rather than looking at the kid.
Those,

750
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.120
those are the,
that's that hair on top of you head.

751
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.070
So evidently something that I breezed by quickly on the Internet was claiming

752
00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:30.520
that stem cell is close to whatever you're going to go shoot this shit at the

753
00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:33.370
top and I'll have fucking hair like yours.
Of course.
You know my color though,

754
00:43:33.371 --> 00:43:37.090
right?
So I was joking with my listeners that I am doing this.

755
00:43:37.091 --> 00:43:39.310
I haven't quite announced it yet cause we wouldn't announce all the dates.

756
00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:41.350
I have this east,
east Germany,
east Germany,

757
00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.660
eastern European tour coming up in January.

758
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.610
And I was saying I'm going to find some Transylvanian doctor and they're going

759
00:43:48.611 --> 00:43:50.110
to fucking shoot my head up.
Right.

760
00:43:50.111 --> 00:43:53.800
And I'm going to be over there long enough and I'm going to come back with like,

761
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.570
like a Farrah Fawcett haircut fall,

762
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:02.050
black Transylvania and here with my yellow eyebrows as am I fucking freckles?

763
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.190
Yeah.
I'm going to come back looking like Jaclyn Smith,

764
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.180
but the reddit and male version of that.
But jet black hair,

765
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.010
that sounds going to be,
it's going to be and you know it's an Italianate.

766
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:19.410
It's going to be weird and it's going to affect our friendship,

767
00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:22.920
but I really only think for about three weeks and you're just accepted because

768
00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:26.880
I'll still be meat.
I'll still be me.
I'll still be telling the same jokes.

769
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.070
I'll still smoke a cigar with,
you know,
I could change it.

770
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.990
You're just going to have,
I could change your belt.
In what way?
I don't know.

771
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:38.790
You know,
send me a full beautiful head of flowing black hair.

772
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.640
I was trying to get a convertible.
I get one of those things like those hearse,

773
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.480
you know those old willys jeeps,
right,

774
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:48.600
where you can put the windshield down so I can just have the hair blowing the

775
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:52.620
whole fucking time.
Well,
she see burst hair.

776
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.660
He's not sleeping.
He's driving a hearse.
Now.
I've gotten the vampire route.

777
00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.030
Yeah.
And I'll be fucking,
I'll be all gray.
We that it looked like a lost boy.

778
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.910
I'll be a redheaded fucking loss boy.
I got to learn how to say that in,

779
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.840
in Czechoslovakia.
When I walked into the head doctor

780
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.510
and he asked me,
how can I help you?
Right.
I'm just going to be,
I want to,

781
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:19.770
I want to look like a fucking,
what did I j a redheaded lost boy.

782
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.550
Make me look like I've been here for thousands of years.
No,
I don't want that.

783
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:26.340
Look,
I know what that look dude,

784
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:28.620
if I did that and then I started botox.

785
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:32.120
And do you realize the roles that would open?
I didn't,

786
00:45:32.121 --> 00:45:35.550
I'd have the shiny frozen face.
Right?

787
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.620
You'd have to start working at the casino.

788
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.110
You'd have to sign a contract at a casino.
Oh No,
I don't want to go that route.

789
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.080
Um,
anyways,
so I guess,

790
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:49.740
I guess I'm going to game format fun.
I'm psyched.
Oh by the way,

791
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:53.290
the all things comedy,
uh,
podcast,
uh,

792
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:57.060
festival is this weekend out there in Arizona.
I want to thank everybody.

793
00:45:57.061 --> 00:46:00.240
I think it starts up tonight.
Um,
Paul Versey is out there.

794
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:04.740
I'm going to be there tomorrow doing a live podcast.
Lie Alive.
I do this shit.

795
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:06.480
Talking to myself,
live in front of a crowd.

796
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:10.530
I've only done it one other time and I did it in a,
hey,

797
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:15.090
maybe I'll talk about getting my colonoscopy.
Where are you going to do this?
Um,

798
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.710
and uh,
what's that?
What's that comedy club there and fucking laughs.

799
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.240
What's the,
what's the one there?
Yuk yuks stand up live.
Phoenix knee.

800
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:26.160
Slappers and Phoenix.
What's it called?

801
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.440
Not the Tempe Improv stand up library and that standup live.
There you go.
Yup.

802
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.370
Bella gut busters.
Good plasters.
What's it called?

803
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:39.360
They're a funny bone.
Um,
yeah,

804
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:42.700
I'm going to be doing that and then I be doing a standup show after that.
So,
uh,

805
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.810
analysts,
we'll be doing the goddamn comedy jam.
So I have,

806
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.640
I have to fucking learn how to play a fucking song by then,
man.
God Damn God.

807
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:55.020
Damn I do.
I got to get them changes down,
man.
Everybody knows,
man.

808
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:57.660
When you're the drummer,
you can fuck up as it guitars.

809
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.460
You can fuck up on that fit alone,

810
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.710
but you fuck up as a drummer.
Everybody knows that.

811
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:07.100
Even if they don't know it was you.
They know something hap.

812
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.580
I'm the only guy I haven't met.

813
00:47:09.581 --> 00:47:13.740
Come learn a fucking song on a fucking southwest flight.
Fucking Phoenix,
Arizona.

814
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.500
50 minutes.
I'm only guy I ever met,
took,

815
00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.420
took drum lessons on a pontoon boat.

816
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.500
I'm the only guy I've met may drum sticks out of a platypus.

817
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.040
I'm only guy I've ever met.
He makes his

818
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.750
<v 2>own possum bacon.
You can actually bake,
right?
You can actually cook.
Can you?</v>

819
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.880
I mean I'm,
it's limited my game through down.
You came to the Roosevelt one year.

820
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:41.560
I thought you,
I thought you threw down.
You made something.

821
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.010
Would you send me a picture?
No,

822
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:47.850
I've been to your tailgate twice.
I didn't.
I,

823
00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.670
I freeloaded both times.
Freeloaded my ass off.

824
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:55.630
Where you had had yet here when I fell for like 40 gas.
I was right there.

825
00:47:55.631 --> 00:48:00.400
That was perfect.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.

826
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.830
You wrapped around?
I was losing my balance.
Standing Tent Pole.

827
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.050
You tried to hold on to like,
you tried to hold onto like a foldout tent?

828
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.270
Like it was like a pillar at like a like a shelter.
Oh yeah.
That aluminum thing.

829
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:21.280
They can try to balance on something that was 15 pounds tops.

830
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.300
I said sorry like 19 times in a row before I finally went down.

831
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.690
Somehow the thing stayed in one place and you kind of wrapped around it.

832
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.200
You fell over a cooler and then slept in a folding chair for about two hours

833
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.700
every year.
I do the power nap.
I knew the power nap.

834
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.800
I remember one year of being so hammered that thing,

835
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.210
I was smoking my Cuban cigar before La headed,

836
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:51.130
finished the entree shallows and people would just,
I mean I was a mess.

837
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:54.100
People were taking pictures and they will walk and strangers were taking

838
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:57.820
pictures with you like you were like a,
like a Marlin hanging out.

839
00:48:57.821 --> 00:48:59.910
They didn't want to go near me.
They didn't want to go near me.
I,

840
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.250
I remember looking up at some mothers going by with children.

841
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.060
<v 5>Okay.</v>

842
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.590
<v 1>And I,
and I,
I didn't understand.</v>

843
00:49:06.591 --> 00:49:10.340
I thought they used to be looking at me with disgust,
but now that I am a parent,

844
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.110
I know what that look was.
That was,

845
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.320
that was actually how do I prevent my children from doing that,

846
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.490
from becoming that?
Because whoever their parents are,

847
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.020
they failed completely.
Um,

848
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.930
<v 2>I'm only guy I ever met,
got fans in my sleep.
That's a good one.</v>

849
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:31.050
That's some shit talk.
I'm the only guy I haven't met.
Can't read out loud.

November 29th I'll be at Zane.

857
00:49:59.521 --> 00:50:02.880
He's in Saint Charles.
Oh,

you know,
say,
well,
I remember that run.

858
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.950
<v 1>Is that the world?
Is that when you start,</v>

859
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.530
you start downtown and then you did you do Saint Charles and then Mount Vernon

860
00:50:10.531 --> 00:50:10.920
or something.

861
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.920
<v 2>That one's close,
but the Saint Charles one,
if it's still open,</v>

862
00:50:13.921 --> 00:50:17.880
I'll be there at 29th which was that Illuminati like sort of like first it was

863
00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:20.160
like this sort of the middle of nowhere.

864
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:25.180
Like giant ranch stats.
Pheasant run.
That's the Saint Charles.
Yeah,

865
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.280
it's the resort quarter.
Walk to the venue

866
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.680
<v 6>and you never go outside.
Yeah,
you never go outside.</v>

867
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:35.360
So if it's a real Midwest casino experience,
alright,
hymns,
everybody,
him.

868
00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:39.170
So it wasn't us.
It was hymns.
Here's a problem.
Oh look at this.

869
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.200
66% of men lose their hair by age 35 look at that Nate year in the top fucking

870
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:48.920
34% thing is,
is when you start to notice hair loss,

871
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.000
it's too late.

872
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.660
It's easier to keep the hair you have than to replace the hair you've lost.

873
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.730
Is that hairlines slowly starting to move backwards.
Any bald spots yet?

874
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.080
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

875
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:09.070
Why do guys turn to weird solution or do nothing when they can turn to them?

876
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:15.560
I was getting slightly offended at this and we can turn a medicine and science.

877
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.131
Uh,

878
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:21.131
what hymns does is connect you with real doctors and medical grade solutions to

879

treat hair loss well known generic equivalents.

880

To name brand prescriptions to help you keep your hair.

881
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.770
No snake oil pills or gas station counter supplements.

Prescription solutions backed by science.
No waiting room.

You would probably ask you what is heritage breed pork.

938
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.710
Exactly what I was asking.
You know what the fuck this is?

939
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:00.900
Evidently these are pigs.

947
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:29.320
it was the greatest fucking pork shop other than I went to a gourmet restaurant

948
00:55:29.321 --> 00:55:30.460
and they really knew what they were doing,

949
00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:34.290
but I'm a comedian and I cooked this thing and this thing fucked with that pork

950
00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:37.150

and hormones before they murder them.
All right?

954
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.110
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

955
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.410
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

to guess what the fucking Terminex guy's coming.
I got termites in my house.

978

You got to get a tent put up.
I got it.

979
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:21.460
I got to get a tent that I can slowly fall around for 45 seconds as I say.

980
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:25.030
Sorry and sorry.
So lets,
let's fucking wrap this up here.
Nate,

981
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.600
you one of my favorite people in this fucking business.
You really are buddy.

982
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.250
You really,
yeah.
You were raised right.

983
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.360
You know your dad made you refinish that fucking basement right?

984
00:57:34.361 --> 00:57:36.160
Yet you get on your hands and knees and scrub it.

985
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:40.290
He said the floor wasn't clean enough.
Wire brush,
wire,
fucking brush again.

986
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:44.920
Do it again.
Came downstairs,
scrape the house.
That's right.
Yep.

987
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.350
And you were down there crying and saying how much you hated your dad and he

988
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:49.470
didn't let you back up to your fucking finished it.
Right.

989
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:54.750
He's a beautiful man is,
but I'm just saying real,
real Mister Miyagi treatment.

990
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:59.700
Oh yeah.
Wax On.
Wax Off.
You have a CD out.

991
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:03.150
It is called preferred customer.
It's available on iTunes.

992
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.010
I'm going to download it because I support you and everything that you do and
uh,

993
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.040
and my wife loves you.
You know,
usually she's like,

994
00:58:11.041 --> 00:58:13.650
take those animals out back you.
She actually,

995
00:58:13.651 --> 00:58:18.430
let's in the house here@natecraig.com.
We love the bursts.
All right.
Um,

996
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.720
and with that maniac on Netflix,

997
00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:25.300
I'll be at a go bananas in Cincinnati February 7th,
10th.
You got it.

998
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:29.680
Um,
let's see here.
And then,
um,
before we go to the throwback,

999
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.480
we got,
um,

1000
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:36.640
I called into the sports gambling podcast with Shawn Green home shrine.

1001
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:39.250
Bryan Kramer.
These guys know their shit and I'm just showing green.

1002
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:44.200
I'm just the dope on the show.
Um,
you can listen to my picks for the week.

1003
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.560
I'm getting more and more house wifey like New Orleans first of Vikings.

1004
00:58:47.561 --> 00:58:50.770
Well I love Bourbon Street so,
and I love drew Brees.

1005
00:58:50.771 --> 00:58:51.970
I just think he's a family man.

1006
00:58:51.971 --> 00:58:56.971
I'm taking the saints and then we'll have a bonus half hour of a greatest hits

1007
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:00.310
Thursday afternoon just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

1008
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.210
Have a great weekend.
You can

1009
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:12.910
whoa.

1010
00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:22.200
shooting

1011
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.033
<v 8>again.</v>

1012
00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:32.003
Shot.

1013
00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.640
You know,
I just got us start shooting again.

1014
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.710
You know,
I'm going to shoot

1015
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.930
<v 7>my woman.</v>

1016
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:57.150
<v 8>Oh,
she fooling around with too many meetings.</v>

1017
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.460
<v 9>Bill Burr on the sports gaming podcast is brought to you by my book.</v>

1018
01:00:03.461 --> 01:00:06.880
He died eight g my book is the leader in online sports folks.

1019
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:11.910
He use the Promo Code Bill bets for a 100% deposit bonus play when and get paid

1020
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.820
at my bookie.
Dot.
Agee joining us on the line,
courtesy of my book.

1021
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:20.290
He died Agee Promo Code Bill bets,
the one and only bill burr.
Bill.

1022
01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:24.550
Appreciate you calling in and we got you away from the game.
Currently,

1023
01:00:24.551 --> 01:00:28.240
right now we're taping during a world series game one right now.

1024
01:00:28.241 --> 01:00:30.550
The sacs are up five to three.

1025
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.503
<v 10>How are you feeling?</v>

1026
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.030
I'm the guy who never feels confident about his team.

1027
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:41.890
I feel like the Dodgers in the last couple of years and haven't been able to get

1028
01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:46.030
it done.
So they got a lot of experience and all of that,
but I'm hoping,
you know,

1029
01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:47.950
we can come out with a victory.
You're a night,

1030
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.310
you know the usual stuff they'll Bellacheck.
I've learned you don't talk trash,

1031
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:53.280
no bulletin board material.

1032
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:57.160
<v 9>That was always a,
I love that he,
uh,
who is it?</v>

1033
01:00:57.161 --> 01:01:01.540
The Patriots receiver that made all those Rex Ryan foot swells.
Yeah,

1034
01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:06.190
Wes Welker in that press conference where he just kept calling out the rex Ryan

1035
01:01:06.191 --> 01:01:10.300
foot fetish video and then Bella check had to lay the hammer on him and drop him

1036
01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:12.490
for a,
I think he made them sit the first quarter.

1037
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:15.660
<v 10>Yeah,
we lost that game against the jets.</v>

1038
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.530
<v 9>Plus it makes you wonder what,
uh,</v>

1039
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.620
Malcolm Butler did before the super bowl as far as like,

1040
01:01:22.621 --> 01:01:25.200
what are you gonna do to get sat for the Super Bowl?

1041
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.250
But I guess we'll never know.

1042
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:31.530
<v 10>Find out what you're going to have to do is years later you got to be on a golf</v>

1043
01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:33.580
course with some,
uh,

1044
01:01:33.581 --> 01:01:37.450
old time patriots or whatever and Shumon summer we'll have a couple too many

1045
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:41.560
courts lights and someone will tell you what happened eventually.
Yeah,

1046
01:01:41.561 --> 01:01:43.420
I liked it.
They've kept it in house.
So

1047
01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.890
<v 9>yeah,
he had Bellacheck actually did the intro to the world series.</v>

1048
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.170
I don't know if you caught that up top.

1049
01:01:50.171 --> 01:01:54.850
He did the voiceover for kind of like the hype video leading into guiding voice.

1050
01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.020
But he's a,
he's an amazing coach,
but his,

1051
01:01:58.021 --> 01:02:00.070
his voiceover work kind of monotone there.

1052
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.810
<v 10>I think it's just muscle memory at this point.</v>

1053
01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.200
Who's like on the team says he's actually a funny guy,

1054
01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:11.430
but he's just smart.
Like that's,
that's crap it,

1055
01:02:11.431 --> 01:02:15.720
those guys were doing that guy in the Astros who showed a them lighten up.

1056
01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:20.160
Was it price or something?
I forget who I figured who that was was a price,

1057
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.670
but it was just so,
you know when they went back to back to back against them.

1058
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.250
So just looking at some games,
film,
it's just like,

1059
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.450
why would you do anything to amp up the other pro?

1060
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:33.930
Because the second you get pissed you're not scared anymore.
It's like,

1061
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:37.410
let him sit there in silence and think about,

1062
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:41.820
I hope I don't screw this up.
You know?
Instead you get them all motivated.

1063
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.100
Dumb Dumbo.

1064
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:47.280
<v 9>That's the most obvious.
Like same tactic in sport.
Just don't talk,</v>

1065
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:50.100
just don't speak everyone.
Everyone gives bell check crap up.

1066
01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:54.090
What should he say to the media?
Should he tip his hand as a,
as a fan,

1067
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:56.580
you don't want them giving away any the slightest thing.

1068
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.750
Either motivation or strategy-wise.
Why would you ever say anything?
And Sean,

1069
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.613
you know,

1070
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.270
you know he probably got into it when he was a younger man because for Lawrence

1071
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:06.961
Taylor to respect bill,

1072
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:10.230
it's bill a check on the level that Lawrence Taylor respects bill Bellacheck.

1073
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:14.880
He's seen some shit,
right?
Lt got after a pretty hard there.

1074
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.440
<v 10>Yeah.
I think,
I think,
uh,
you know,</v>

1075
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:23.080
I have to reason the media hates us is because we,

1076
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.690
we always win and the other half is because bill Belicheck makes him so

1077
01:03:26.691 --> 01:03:31.010
difficult to do their job.
Like they loved Rex Ryan.

1078
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.750
Rex Ryan was a quote machine and it's just like he just gave him easy days.

1079
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:39.170
He just,
Hey,
I'm not going up dad and kisses rings,
you know,

1080
01:03:39.171 --> 01:03:41.800
we're going to win the super bowl.
He was like in Breck shrine.

1081
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:44.150
It was like interview when a wrestler during a Promo or

1082
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.640
<v 9>oh,
he was the heel Trump.
They,
rex Ryan is the football equivalent of Trump.</v>

1083
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.533
Exactly.
Yeah.

1084
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:54.590
<v 10>The article writes itself and Bill Belicheck is just like,
oh man,
I got,</v>

1085
01:03:54.591 --> 01:03:58.220
now I actually have to watch the game and come up with something smart to say,

1086
01:03:58.820 --> 01:03:59.121
you know,

1087
01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:03.020
some sort of analogy rather than just building it around the crazy thing or our

1088
01:04:03.021 --> 01:04:03.854
coach said,

1089
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.670
<v 9>yeah,
Rex Ryan made everyone's job easier.
All right,
bill,</v>

1090
01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:10.910
what's happened to some of these spreads?
Moving over to the NFL,

1091
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:14.690
kicking things off lines,
courtesy again from my book e.
Dot.

1092
01:04:14.691 --> 01:04:19.370
Agee big game here in New Orleans.
Head into Minnesota right now.

1093
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.530
The Minnesota Vikings.
A one point favorite at home.
Which way you lean in here.

1094
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:30.230
<v 10>I love drew Brees and I love New Orleans and I like to drink.</v>

1095
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.790
<v 9>Sound like Tombow.
You can't,
you can't beat that Combo.
Yeah,</v>

1096
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:41.470
<v 10>off the Bourbon Street.
I got some places you can,
your ego where the locals go.</v>

1097
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.660
You don't go to a purpose street.
That's,
that's Times Square of New Orleans.

1098
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:50.520
<v 9>It.
Hey,
hang out with ido and eat some chicken on a stick and a gas station.</v>

1099
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:55.230
Shawn.
Yeah.
This is,
I mean,
there's a huge revenging or here,

1100
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:56.970
right?
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1101
01:04:56.971 --> 01:05:01.290
New Orleans coming in after what happened to knock them out of the playoffs,

1102
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:05.610
that miracle in Minnesota,
the way they lost that game.
I mean,

1103
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:09.210
they were the,
obviously they should have won that game.
Total collapse.

1104
01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:12.930
New Orleans coming in on fire five and own their last five.

1105
01:05:12.931 --> 01:05:16.320
But more importantly for,
and one against the spread.
This New Orleans team,

1106
01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:19.240
I think if they gonna slip up,
it was,

1107
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.010
it was going to be against that ravens seem right,

1108
01:05:21.011 --> 01:05:24.580
but they played well hung in that game.
And this team just seems the,

1109
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:28.360
in the NFC right now,
it's just gotta be the same sort of the rams.
Right.

1110
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:32.260
I mean they,
they seem like they're really firing on all cylinders.
Yeah.

1111
01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.640
I'm going to play the regression angle.

1112
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.970
Everyone's seeing the superego and vikings.
I'm going to go vikings.
Um,
I'm gonna,

1113
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:38.560
I'm not gonna,
I'm gonna they're pros.

1114
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.890
I don't think there were the prevention things real and I think this Minnesota

1115
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:44.620
defense has turned it up of late and uh,
yeah,

1116
01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:47.380
everyone's kind of forgotten about that sick home field advantage and I think

1117
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:50.380
it's coming back so well.
New Orleans normally not good on the road,

1118
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:54.200
but I mean it's another dome team.
I think this is a decent spot for him.
Yeah.

1119
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:55.563
All right.

1120
01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:58.890
<v 10>I don't believe in that</v>

1121
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:04.650
matches anymore unless it happened the same season with the image of three

1122
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.380
agencies and how much everybody hangs out each of with each other at a barbecue,

1123
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.850
which is not the way it used to be.

1124
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.850
<v 9>Yeah.
Everyone's,
you know,
hang it,
tag,</v>

1125
01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:14.670
you're tagging each other on the gram and shouting each other ad,

1126
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.830
especially in the NBA,
the NBA,

1127
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.950
it just feels like one big rec league where there's just,
okay,

1128
01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:23.010
there's one team that's clearly going to dominate and then everyone else,

1129
01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:25.230
he's just kinda having fun hanging out.

1130
01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.301
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1131
01:06:26.301 --> 01:06:29.840
It's like a warehouse playing softball against each other and it's really just

1132
01:06:29.841 --> 01:06:31.890
about going on,
having some beers,
you know?

1133
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:36.570
<v 9>Yeah.
They may as well turn the NBA into a beer league league at this point.
Uh,</v>

1134
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.180
it's got

1135
01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.370
<v 10>crazy.
Nobody,
I mean,
what was,</v>

1136
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.820
I think he's on Instagram video of a dunk where there was anybody.

1137
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:45.310
Seriously challenging.
So first of all,

1138
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:49.000
you're not even allowed to be in the paint and all these kids know,
Oh man,

1139
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:53.290
I'm going to be on the gram.
So Dude,
you should get your head taken off,
but not,

1140
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:55.720
not,
you just keep,
I don't know,
it's just completely,

1141
01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:59.390
everything is completely different game.
Like,

1142
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.800
did I talk to you guys about that Kansas City Patriots game?

1143
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.570
<v 9>No,
I don't.
I don't think we talked about that.
But uh,
yeah,</v>

1144
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.200
<v 10>that like that right there like that is not football.</v>

1145
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:14.940
I like watching two people playing a video game with lives.

1146
01:07:14.941 --> 01:07:18.300
People like the fact that that number 10,
I always forget his name,

1147
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:22.740
whatever else name is on Kansas,
he's killing you the whole game.

1148
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.640
There's a minute or two minutes left,
you know that going into him.

1149
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.940
Not only does he score,
he ran across to sealed,

1150
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.200
he runs up the side that untouched but like 70 yards.

1151
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:39.180
I get the guys fast.
But no,
she just,
she just ran out there like it was,
you know,

1152
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.120
the coach's son and there was something out there.
Hey,

1153
01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.560
nobody touched them on this play.

1154
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.420
It was like a make a wish a moment.

1155
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:54.660
<v 9>Juvenile diabetes come on and he's living out his dream.</v>

1156
01:07:54.661 --> 01:07:57.120
And to the point about how the leagues have gone soft.

1157
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.660
If anyone hasn't listened to Charles Oakley,

1158
01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:05.040
discuss this on the Simmons podcast,
he really just keep calls it.
He's like,
yeah,

1159
01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:07.350
it's a,
you know,
back in my day we just fought.
He's like,

1160
01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:10.170
when we said we were in a fight,
we fought nowadays,
who knows?

1161
01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:13.530
That doesn't mean much,
you know,
like [inaudible] I don't know it.
Well,
and then,

1162
01:08:13.531 --> 01:08:17.450
uh,
and then Tyree got the beer poured on him by,
uh,

1163
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.330
one of the paths fans and that was a disgrace.
That was it.

1164
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.240
That was the whole big thing.
And it,
uh,
my buddy actually,

1165
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:26.390
it kind of reminded me of the malice at the palace and a,

1166
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.650
my buddy actually sent me,

1167
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:30.320
Bill has a great bit about it back in the day when it happened,

1168
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.640
about how awesome it was to just see a professional athlete go up into the

1169
01:08:34.641 --> 01:08:39.270
stands and beat the shit out of a shitty fan.
It's,
it's really as,
listen,

1170
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.850
<v 10>the wrong guy,
that was the only thing that sucked was he got,</v>

1171
01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:45.920
he did get the wrong guy,
but you know,
some I liked everybody was like,
oh,

1172
01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:50.230
real classy creatures fans.
And everybody forgets that the Yankees,
you know,
uh,

1173
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.640
through the,
uh,

1174
01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.390
through there in a relief pitcher this year when they called that home run,
uh,

1175
01:08:56.650 --> 01:09:00.830
uh,
banner to Faron.
So whatever,
whatever the hell happened on that.
Uh,
that play,

1176
01:09:00.831 --> 01:09:01.664
I can't remember.

1177
01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:05.620
The New York capers were trashing the red sox and they made that kid for the

1178
01:09:05.621 --> 01:09:05.951
Yankees,

1179
01:09:05.951 --> 01:09:10.300
played Baltimore way back in the day and he reached over was a basket catch.

1180
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:12.760
I think they made that kid a local hero.

1181
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:16.660
<v 9>Yeah.
Jay Jeffrey Mayer.
Was that his name?
Uh,
and,
and I,</v>

1182
01:09:16.661 --> 01:09:18.630
I would say this as a compliment to,

1183
01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:21.270
to red sox and even eagles fan in Philadelphia fans.

1184
01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.140
There is that element of like,
yeah,
I grew up going to red sox,
Yankees fans,

1185
01:09:25.141 --> 01:09:29.460
and you know,
I saw a dude like fall from the middle deck to the lower deck.
Like,

1186
01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:33.200
dude,
things got thrown.
Like that's part of the game.
Everything's just cha.

1187
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.820
I mean,
I know out here it's about bringing knives to the game,

1188
01:09:35.821 --> 01:09:38.910
but there is a certain,
there's a certain beauty in like the,
the,

1189
01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.550
the flying near bottle,
simple beer toss

1190
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:47.180
<v 10>and the most would be going to gain for the world series this year.
Awesome.</v>

1191
01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:50.480
As a red sox fan and I will be dressed like a undercover cop.

1192
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.950
I will not have any red sox stuff on.
I just,
I don't still need it.

1193
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.830
It's just out here.
It's just not fun.
Made that mistake I made,

1194
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:05.020
<v 9>I made that mistake one time.
Wore a don Mattingly who,
you know,</v>

1195
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:08.140
most people,
most people say even if you hate the Yankees,

1196
01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:11.530
you like Donny baseball.
Where am I?
Don Mattingly,

1197
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.390
a Jersey to the bleachers.
The all you can eat bleeds.

1198
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:19.270
Hears that at dodger stadium.
Bad move,
multiple,

1199
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:21.760
multiple food items thrown at me during the game.

1200
01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:26.650
You're going to a place where they have unlimited ammunition.
Ryan,
it was fun.

1201
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.440
<v 10>My favorite thing is when you're literally getting threatened,</v>

1202
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.160
bodily harm and curse that and the,

1203
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:35.450
and it's by some dude and he's there with like,

1204
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:40.140
he has like three kids under the age of eight.
Yes.

1205
01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.500
Like what are you doing?
What are you teaching these?
These,
these kids.

1206
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.280
You turn them into animals and it's just,

1207
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.240
it's just how it is out here and it's straight across the board.

1208
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.050
Like it isn't like a,
I guess if you sit down in the bleachers,
it's,

1209
01:10:53.051 --> 01:10:57.790
I mean in the box seats it's a little bit nicer,
but it's just like,
I don't care.

1210
01:10:57.791 --> 01:11:02.140
Like,
you know,
black,
white,
Latino,
I don't care.

1211
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.350
It's just straight across the board.
These people out here are just like,
no,

1212
01:11:05.351 --> 01:11:09.400
we're going to kill you.
It's like,
it's like,
all right,
well that was,

1213
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.930
that was a fun first dating.

1214
01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:14.910
I guess I'll go down and get a hot dog and sort of meander around the stadium to

1215
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:17.810
get away from you guys and I put my hat in my back pocket.
But

1216
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.713
<v 9>it's,</v>

1217
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:22.410
it's such a weird dichotomy because you think of La and you don't think of like

1218
01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:24.780
passionate sports fans,
but then,
oh yeah,

1219
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:29.190
we'll randomly murder you over a baseball game.
But what weird,
weird,
weird,

1220
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:32.640
we're building a great stereotype,
I believe.
Sports fans,
right?
They were

1221
01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:33.843
<v 10>casual</v>

1222
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:41.540
escort us out in a San Diego chargers game,
uh,

1223
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.580
almost got killed at a gun,
threatened to be stabbed at an angel's game.
Wow.

1224
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.780
By then I'd learned my lesson.
I'm like,
these people are like out of their minds,

1225
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.140
you know,
and then,
you know,
some Celtics Lakers,
crap.
I,
you know,

1226
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:59.110
a Celtics Jersey,
Paul Pierce Jersey in the upper deck,

1227
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.440
bad move and move you Irish state issue where I wish that chowder Choudhary and

1228
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.950
the whole damn thing.
Uh,

1229
01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:11.050
by the time I went to a Raiders patriots game,
I was just like,

1230
01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:15.790
I'm just going to wear a black tee shirt.
And uh,
in a,
in a ray like a,
I dunno,

1231
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:20.990
a ll bean hat or some big dress like dress like Ellen degenerate or something,

1232
01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.490
I'm going to go to the skate complete politically neutral.

1233
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.480
<v 9>It's a funny,
of course we had our first,</v>

1234
01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:30.540
I never in all my years of going the east coast football games,

1235
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:33.960
never saw someone break a beer bottle with the intent to stab another human

1236
01:12:33.961 --> 01:12:37.670
being.
Yup.
First football game we went to,
it was San Francisco at the old part.

1237
01:12:37.671 --> 01:12:39.780
Yeah,
a Raven's niners game.

1238
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.540
Who's sitting in traffic trying to leave the game and Bam,

1239
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:44.400
we almost witnessed a murder.
It's just,
it's,

1240
01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:48.570
it's much more hardcore and the game was a hilariously bad game.

1241
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:53.430
It was 12 to nine there was no touchdown scored and maybe that's what got them

1242
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:54.264
all work

1243
01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:59.370
<v 10>and would actually doing fans of service because this story is not told at all.</v>

1244
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.350
You know,
is the eagles through batteries.
It's,

1245
01:13:02.351 --> 01:13:03.990
it's Santa Claus and Blah Blah Blah.

1246
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:08.600
Eagles and Chili and Chili and show Austin in New York.
Yeah.
Yes,
but no,
you,

1247
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:09.870
you can get killed out here.

1248
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:14.350
<v 9>We got to cut a PSA.
Hey Listen La,</v>

1249
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:18.090
you think it's a casual sports stamp but you can get murdered over the wrong

1250
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:21.420
jersey.
All right,
speak.
Speaking of La,

1251
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.640
the Los Angeles Rams there at home,

1252
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:27.550
laying nine and a half points to the green bay packers.
Aaron Rodgers

1253
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:36.800
just ram it guys ran that knife into my ribcage.
Cut,

1254
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.890
slice my cheese head up.
Uh,
I dunno,
a quick sidebar Sean,

1255
01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:42.660
but I don't know if you've noticed,
but some of the TV,

1256
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:45.190
the local coverage of the rams.
I think because they

1257
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.170
<v 10>weren't so good in the beginning,
didn't</v>

1258
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.370
<v 9>change anything and some of these guys just don't know football.</v>

1259
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.980
It's pretty hilarious to watch this shit.
It's like,

1260
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.280
this is nothing like a east coast like postgame show.

1261
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.990
These people don't know anything about the game.

1262
01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:01.230
They're not even rooting for the team.
Like what the fuck is this?

1263
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.360
It's a long way off.
But all that being said,

1264
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:07.350
I'll take the rams ln nine and a half.
This team's all fire.
Aaron Rodgers though.

1265
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.250
This is his,
uh,
the biggest underdog he's ever heard.

1266
01:14:11.251 --> 01:14:15.220
Like the biggest underdog spread of his entire career.
Bill House a year.

1267
01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.330
Are you going to get on that

1268
01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:20.020
<v 10>pack?
Aaron Rodgers,</v>

1269
01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.580
he's one of those guys.
He loves his send kids home crying.

1270
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:28.780
And the opposing stadium,
but he gets up for it.
He plays great on the road.

1271
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.320
And uh,
I dunno,
I looked up some numbers on this one.

1272
01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:35.770
Package defense isn't that bad?
I don't think,
you know,
I dunno.

1273
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.190
I that's a tough one.

1274
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.170
Just all of those points and Aaron Rodgers,
I and his competitive ways I would,

1275
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.410
I would,
I'm going with that.
What am I am a standup comedian.
What do I know?

1276
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.550
I'm not trying to get stabbed in la because I,
I picked the packers.
I'm sorry

1277
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.080
<v 9>you liked the packers to cover,
but you said the rams are when now.
Right.</v>

1278
01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:57.900
To clarify if anyone had any uh,
undoing.

1279
01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:02.100
<v 10>They just have too many weapons there and so does the people in the crowd.</v>

1280
01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:02.934
Thank you

1281
01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.750
<v 9>Karima.
Which way you lean in.
I mean it's,</v>

1282
01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.950
it's an awful lot of points for one,
Aaron Rodgers and,

1283
01:15:10.951 --> 01:15:14.900
and no matter the deficiencies they might have on fence.
This is,
this is,

1284
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.480
even if they're down,
this is backdoor city.
Aaron,

1285
01:15:17.481 --> 01:15:19.760
Roger's not going to be giving up and Sean,

1286
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:24.440
75% of the money on the Los Angeles Rams,
they got to lose at some point.
Right?

1287
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:27.470
Maybe this is the week,
hypothetically and yeah,

1288
01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:31.040
you gotta think that Aaron Rodgers and going on a little brother Jared Goff.

1289
01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.010
Imagine Aaron Rodgers like,
I'm not losing to this bitch.

1290
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.600
I am not losing to this little bitch.
Well,
golf is a w wait,

1291
01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:42.200
golf came from what school?
Cow.
Cow.
Also maybe their buddies.
Well,

1292
01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:43.820
that's what I'm saying.
You know,
I think he's,

1293
01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.550
I think Aaron Rodgers wants to prove he's the real cow.
QB.
Oh,

1294
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:50.330
little a little revenge gears Rogers older than McVeigh.

1295
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:54.740
I think he's gotta be cosmic phase like 32 yeah,
that's crazy.

1296
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.930
That's really crazy.
All right,
last game of the slate here.

1297
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:01.400
New England patriots facing heading into Buffalo.

1298
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:04.520
We're right now over at my bookie dot Agee.

1299
01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:09.820
The buffalo bills are a 14 point Monday night home dog d journeymen.

1300
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:14.630
Derek Anderson starting again.
I love that phrase.
And also love.

1301
01:16:14.631 --> 01:16:18.050
They say he signed off the street as if he was just wandering around.

1302
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.930
He's starting at quarterback for the pills.
Lashawn Mccoy.

1303
01:16:20.931 --> 01:16:25.550
It looks like he could be out.
Bill,
do a to the pats.
We're all here or do you,

1304
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:28.970
you think it's close enough that the bills are worth the taking a shot with the

1305
01:16:28.971 --> 01:16:29.804
points?

1306
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:34.730
<v 10>I hate 14 points with the division rivalry and you're on the road.</v>

1307
01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.780
And also the bills are so schizophrenia this year,
this is,

1308
01:16:38.781 --> 01:16:42.710
this is one of these issues.
One of these trap games,
Bill,

1309
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.940
suck right them all day one 27 nothing against the Vikings and the next week

1310
01:16:46.941 --> 01:16:51.210
they get killed or they were up 27.
Nothing gets vikings.
I,
uh,

1311
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:55.520
I'm gonna say,
um,
I would,

1312
01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:00.580
I would take the bills and the point simply watching last week when we played

1313
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:03.890
the damn bears and we had them,
we should've put them away,

1314
01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:07.550
should have driven down the damn on my old bed and kicked a field goal open up

1315
01:17:07.551 --> 01:17:10.820
by,
by,
by three scores.
Instead we ended up,
you know,

1316
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.700
when we came within a half a yard of going into overtime,

1317
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:18.700
<v 9>that was a crazy hail Mary to get to the one yard line.</v>

1318
01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:19.860
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1319
01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:22.270
<v 10>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And that's that whole thing like you stick,</v>

1320
01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:25.420
you stick a wide receiver down there.
He's not going to try to knock it down.

1321
01:17:25.421 --> 01:17:27.430
It's going to try to catch it.
That guy that wasn't Gordon,

1322
01:17:27.431 --> 01:17:31.750
the guy we got from Cleveland and he did not even though,

1323
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:36.560
what did he,
he,
he was,
he was a,
he was out of his element.
Uh,

1324
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.010
they might want to run that play with him a couple of times.

1325
01:17:39.011 --> 01:17:42.040
So I think the Patriots are going to win,
but I don't,

1326
01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.630
I don't numbers too big there.

1327
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:49.000
I will say in the end they go into the prevent and it screws over the gamblers.

1328
01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.460
Who uh,
who checked the Patriot,
which 14

1329
01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:54.180
<v 9>crime or not to mention Sean night.
First of all,</v>

1330
01:17:54.181 --> 01:17:57.120
97% of the money coming into the page.
I'm like,
it's early,

1331
01:17:57.121 --> 01:18:01.050
but it will be Monday night.
This bills,
this bills fan base will have nothing.

1332
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.950
This is the,
this is a super,
super bowl,
right?
There'll be breaking tables.

1333
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.590
The grows will be out there breaking tables with them.
There's,
there's,

1334
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.240
there's no doubt of that.
And Buffalo strength is their past defense.

1335
01:18:12.241 --> 01:18:13.560
So I could see the way they play,

1336
01:18:13.561 --> 01:18:17.010
the way MacDermid sits in kind of that soft coverage that a,

1337
01:18:17.011 --> 01:18:20.250
well Brady might pick them apart.
The receivers are going to take hits.
Sean,
it's,

1338
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.910
it's a low of 38 that night.
So yeah,

1339
01:18:23.911 --> 01:18:28.650
of course you're taking 14 right?
Even with Derek Anderson,
what could go wrong?

1340
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.510
What could go wrong?
There's no way.

1341
01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.060
37 to five certainly there's blowout potential here,
but uh,
I liked the

1342
01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:39.693
<v 10>now</v>

1343
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.460
<v 9>talking sports,
Bob though,
talking sports while watching sports.
Hey,
it's the,</v>

1344
01:18:45.461 --> 01:18:49.240
it's the life of a sports fan,
right?
Last point,
Sean.
Yes,

1345
01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:51.880
because I'm also on the bills.
Guess who the Patriots have on deck?

1346
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:55.330
The packers coming to tell,
oh look at head game apps.
They look ahead spot.

1347
01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:57.640
I don't know.
Packers aren't that good.
Kind of a stretch.

1348
01:18:57.641 --> 01:19:02.380
But pets are pretty disciplined,
but still 1414 point Monday night home dog.

1349
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.720
This is,
this is their Superbowl.
They're going to,

1350
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:07.360
they're going to be fucking going crazy in buffalo.

1351
01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:09.580
So I think he got to take the big number there.

1352
01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.800
<v 10>Okay,
great.
That's a great point.
Yeah,
great point.
I like that.</v>

1353
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:21.120
I went to a game and I had a patriots hat on.
They were playing the judge.

1354
01:19:21.121 --> 01:19:25.560
I was rooting for the bills and I had made the mistake of going into the mental

1355
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.570
narrowing that God just started getting all this crap and they waited til I

1356
01:19:30.571 --> 01:19:33.390
started to take a leak and somebody pushed me from bye.

1357
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.313
<v 9>That's dirty.</v>

1358
01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:40.440
<v 10>That's a low blow,
but they don't try to kill you.
They,
they're just,</v>

1359
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.730
yeah,
they're more like a,
you know,
just like,
I don't know.

1360
01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:47.370
<v 9>They just want you to bathe.
Bathe in your own urine.
Yeah.
They're a class.</v>

1361
01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:48.310
Your fan base,

1362
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:53.020
<v 10>Chic shot artists,
Sarah and Buffalo.
By the end of the year,</v>

1363
01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:56.560
I want to label all sports fans so we're animals or the east coast.

1364
01:19:57.070 --> 01:20:00.730
They're killers on the west coast and that cheap shot artists in buffalo.

1365
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:02.380
<v 9>All right.
How many more markets do we have?</v>

1366
01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:06.700
Bills Mafia to go through it and sold each market.

1367
01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.420
The Midwest is coming?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1368
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.840
I don't know what they tried to bang your wife into the cheese or something?

1369
01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:20.530
Yeah,
we'll figure something out.

1370
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.900
Some tainted beef.
All right,

I appreciate you calling in man.

1381
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:07.363
<v 7>Yes.</v>

1382
01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.130
<v 6>Yeah,
it was fucking raining on this.</v>

1383
01:21:21.131 --> 01:21:25.690
And one thing I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're

1384
01:21:25.691 --> 01:21:27.430
dealing with the elements,

1385
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.560
this is the more of a douchebag you look like the warmer you're going to be.

1386
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:39.820
All right.
I saw the rain and I said fuck this.

1387
01:21:39.821 --> 01:21:43.750
And we went right to Dick's sporting goods and I'm like,
I'm buying that fucking,

1388
01:21:43.751 --> 01:21:47.680
I'm going to buy a raincoat with the matching raincoats slacks.

1389
01:21:47.681 --> 01:21:48.850
I don't give a fuck.

1390
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:53.800
I bought a pair of a wool socks and I was good to go.

1391
01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:59.590
So with [inaudible] and you know they only had like two rank coats left and they

1392
01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:04.120
were the exact same color.
This fucking grapes,

1393
01:22:04.121 --> 01:22:05.620
slush puppy purple.

1394
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:09.610
So we both have matching extra large fucking,

1395
01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.360
we got the jacket and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and what

1396
01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:19.960
green we're bringing in the fucking soul plane,
right?
That was a purple airplane,

1397
01:22:19.961 --> 01:22:23.470
right.
That's what we look like.
So we show up to the game,
right?

1398
01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:28.210
Neither one of us has comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills

1399
01:22:28.211 --> 01:22:32.650
fan.
So we're in enemy territory and a,
it's fucking drizzling and out.

1400
01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:37.300
It's fucking cold.
So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

1401
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:41.470
right?
And right off the bat,
Versie starts punkin outgoing man.
I'm just gonna.

1402
01:22:41.471 --> 01:22:43.540
I'm just gonna wear that.
I'm just going to wear the top.

1403
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:47.080
I'm just going to wear the top,
trying to act like it's not raining out that bad.

1404
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:51.790
The reality is is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to

1405
01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:56.510
if the two of us walked in with our purple on Purple fucking raincoats times

1406
01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:01.270
too,
we would have got a ton of shit and I was prepared to take it.
I had an,

1407
01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:05.110
I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing.
I don't give a fuck.

1408
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.450
So he punked out.
So,
uh,
we ended up walking in and put my head's cold,
right?

1409
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:14.170
All I have is a baseball cap on.
So I'm like,
fuck,
I got to buy a hat.

1410
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:15.700
Can I buy a bills?
Who gives a fuck?

1411
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:17.940
They were in last place mangled by a bill's hat and then I saw this,

1412
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:21.520
this one with the Patriot logo on it.
I said,
fuck it.
I'll get that.

1413
01:23:21.521 --> 01:23:25.900
Once I put that one on,
I'm nice and warm.
We go to,
we'll call,

1414
01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:27.040
we pick up our tickets.

1415
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.420
We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I

1416
01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:34.810
actually love,
looks like an old school football stadium.

1417
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:38.020
You know what I like about that football stadium that's about the size of a

1418
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:42.460
football stadium that holds real fans.
You know what I mean?
All these,

1419
01:23:42.461 --> 01:23:46.360
these new ones that hold like 100,000 fucking pets,
all the bandwagon shit hits.

1420
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:50.020
You know when you're all in for the real fucking fans show up are all in three,

1421
01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:54.970
right?
So he walked into the Goddamn stadium.
We love in life,
right?

1422
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.090
I'm already laughing at Versie cause I know damn well what's going to happen?

1423
01:23:58.210 --> 01:23:59.380
He's going to walk out there.

1424
01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:03.100
There's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered

1425
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.360
in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through

1426
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:10.220
his God damn jeans and his fucking DVDs.

1427
01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:14.500
And then he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up nut sack that's going

1428
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.280
to be getting hypothermia by second quarter.
Why do I know this?

1429
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:22.300
Because I've been there.
So we get a couple of beers.

1430
01:24:22.301 --> 01:24:25.750
We get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it.

1431
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:29.020
We're good to go.
We go in there,
sit down,

1432
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:33.970
he sits basically down in a fucking puddle.
He tried to stick a newspaper down,

1433
01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:37.810
which is very absorbent.
And uh,
I don't know.

1434
01:24:37.811 --> 01:24:41.500
We sat there and I had hope for about eight seconds in that game and the jets

1435
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:45.580
came down and just fucking shit.
They just kicked the shit out of him.

1436
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.680
Christ,
they kicked as shit out of 'em and uh,

1437
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.780
it was just over.
So we,

1438
01:24:53.781 --> 01:24:58.210
so immediately our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the

1439
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:01.060
masters.
We're like,
fuck it,
let's,
let's,
let's get going here.
Right?

1440
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:05.740
So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss,
right?

1441
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:10.660
So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this,

1442
01:25:10.661 --> 01:25:13.420
this fucking six foot,

1443
01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:16.180
five goofy looking jackass,

1444
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:18.610
one of those guys who's like six foot five,

1445
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:21.730
but you still think he can take him cause he's just covered in baby fat.

1446
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:23.103
You know,

1447
01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:27.430
he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks are rosier than Saint

1448
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:31.630
Nick,
right?
And he's got this Jersey on and this big stupid,

1449
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:35.800
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it and stuff.
You know,

1450
01:25:35.801 --> 01:25:40.480
he's the Wacky Guy,
so I'm not even thinking shit.
Right.

1451
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.890
This is bill's jets.
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm not talking any shit.

1452
01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:48.100
I'm fine.
I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat.

1453
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:53.220
And all of a sudden this big goofy jackass starts going,
well,
what's what?
Yeah,

1454
01:25:53.221 --> 01:25:57.940
well you're a patriots fan.
He liked the rats.
We got to Rancho and the rats,

1455
01:25:57.941 --> 01:26:02.740
he likes to fucking rats and the shit,
right?
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

1456
01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:04.340
whatever.
He starts giving me shit.

1457
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:08.780
I start giving him shit back then the weirdest fucking thing happened.
I,

1458
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:12.890
by the time I get in to the actual men's room,

1459
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:17.990
I've talked,
I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually,

1460
01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.950
there's bills and jets fans at a bills and jets game.

1461
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.060
They're playing each other.

1462
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.360
They stop giving each other shit and they teamed up together and started giving

1463
01:26:28.911 --> 01:26:32.750
me shit.
Right.
And then I just said,
I don't know what I was thinking.

1464
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.430
I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd.
I wasn't thinking like,
Hey,

1465
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.210
you know what bill,

1466
01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:42.380
you really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing some

1467
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:46.220
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade.
I didn't give a fuck.

1468
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:50.420
I'm in a God damn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough by the
way.

1469
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.900
And uh,
and then they just started giving up fucking this one dude such going,

1470
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.250
Tom Brady Sucks Dick.
He Sucks Dick.

1471
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:02.000
And he's like miming it like ridiculously wealth.
So I'm like,

1472
01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.380
ain't nobody do that real wealth because I learned it by watching Tom Brady.

1473
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:10.820
Mike.
Oh yeah.
Do you rent that porno?
You fucking fag gets a little uglier,

1474
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.700
gets a little uglier than this other dude.

1475
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.880
What the fuck did I came up with the hell he was saying to me and I just said,

1476
01:27:16.881 --> 01:27:21.170
look,
I'm sorry you guys have never won a super bowl,
you know?

1477
01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:23.360
Then the jets fan pipes in.
I go,

1478
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:25.590
do you realize the last time you guys won a super bowl,

1479
01:27:25.591 --> 01:27:28.550
Charlie Chaplin was still alive?
Do you understand that?

1480
01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:33.530
Do you know what cars look like the last time you won?
You fucking morons.

1481
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:37.490
And then uh,
then this other guy go up until we've won three Superbowls.

1482
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:41.120
I'm sorry.
Right?
And then the guy goes,
well,
you didn't play in the games.
I go,

1483
01:27:41.121 --> 01:27:45.350
neither did you.
Then he's just standing there with this dumb look on his face.

1484
01:27:45.351 --> 01:27:46.980
Like,
oh,
that's right.
I keep staring forward.

1485
01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:51.110
You've got nothing forgetting that I don't know how to fight.

1486
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.640
So all of a sudden it's my turn to pes.
I take my dick out,

1487
01:27:55.790 --> 01:28:00.790
I'm ready to Piss and one of these fucking pussies push me in the back hoping

1488
01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:04.700
that I was pissing at the time.
Fortunately I wasn't.
So I turn around,

1489
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:08.330
I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman.
I said,
I go,

1490
01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:11.590
is that how you guys do it out here?
Really?
I go,
which one?

1491
01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:14.450
You guys pushed me like I'm gonna Fuck,
I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

1492
01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.020
And for some reason,
none of them said anything.

1493
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:23.630
I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

1494
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.520
eye,
but I'm a fucking 42 year old,

1495
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:29.360
balding redhead talking shit in there and none of them said anything.

1496
01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:30.860
So now it's kind of funny to me.

1497
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.440
I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I,

1498
01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:39.020
and I didn't have a hand whatsoever.
So I don't know who the fuck pushed me,

1499
01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:43.340
but that's what I mean.
Come on.
Bitchy is mover the fucking week.

1500
01:28:43.341 --> 01:28:45.740
How'd he do that?
How do you do that?
How do you,

1501
01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:49.170
how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss it

1502
01:28:49.171 --> 01:28:51.470
to a fucking trough?
I mean,
how do you get lower than that?

1503
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:53.870
Do you guys have any ideas?
How do you get lower than that?

1504
01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:58.070
So then after none of them said anything,
I go back and I started taking a piss.

1505
01:28:58.071 --> 01:29:02.010
And then that other dude who was miming somebody's sucking a

1506
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.910
<v 1>dick unbelievably well right next to me.</v>

1507
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:11.730
One of those stupid hats that has the toggles on this side and he's still trying

1508
01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:13.830
to give me shit and I'm going to add,
go fuck yourself.

1509
01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:16.110
And then he just starts screaming over and over again.

1510
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:17.850
Are you looking at my Dick?

1511
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:23.280
You looking at my deck like maniacally,
like five times.

1512
01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:28.920
I just sort of stared at him like,
why do you keep going with this gay angle?

1513
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:32.070
Like why is there always a,
I dunno.

1514
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:37.020
I think he was one of those guys.
He was kind of in the closet and then,
uh,

1515
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.910
so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill

1516
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:44.760
the families there.
I think he liked me.
It's what I'm saying.

1517
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:47.540
So if he's listening to this,
I'm sorry,
uh,
I'm,

1518
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:51.900
I'm spoken for you fucking pants.
You fucking believe that.

1519
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:56.550
First of all,
what's wrong with me?
I really replay it,

1520
01:29:56.551 --> 01:29:59.430
all of that in my head because once I got out of there,
I was like,

1521
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.900
I really started thinking like,
what?

1522
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:03.570
What did you think you were going to do in there?

1523
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.220
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things.
Clint Eastwood would say.
What?

1524
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:09.910
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?

1525
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:12.120
Like I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast,

1526
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:16.890
a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight.

1527
01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:19.740
There is nothing soft.

1528
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:24.920
There's everything is porcelain pipes that concrete floor and then it has a mist

1529
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:30.210
of piss and shit.
It's just a fucking,
it's the worst.
It's the worst place ever.

1530
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:36.240
You know,
not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person as begun,

1531
01:30:36.241 --> 01:30:37.350
the pissing processing.

1532
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.353
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1533
01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:46.370
<v 1>So,
uh,
you know,
older,
little bit wiser.</v>

1534
01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.360
So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's

1535
01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:52.130
what you need after an incident like that.

1536
01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:57.290
And I was just kinda just sitting there thinking like,
all right,

1537
01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:59.210
now how should I have played that?

1538
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.180
It w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started

1539
01:31:05.181 --> 01:31:09.830
giving me shit.
What I should've done was roll with it.
I should,

1540
01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:12.050
you liked the patriots.
I should have been like,
hey,
you know,

1541
01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:15.280
you guys scored 30 on his last week.
Man,
you guys look great man.
I,

1542
01:31:15.281 --> 01:31:18.470
I bet the jets,
I mean,
I bet against the jets.

1543
01:31:18.471 --> 01:31:23.300
I hope you guys should have just ended it with that and did it.
I sh I should.

1544
01:31:23.301 --> 01:31:26.180
Uh,
I should have extended an olive branch.

1545
01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:27.770
That's what I should've done in the future.

1546
01:31:27.771 --> 01:31:31.310
That's what the fuck I'm going to do because,
uh,

1547
01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.530
that was a,
a,
that was a potentially ugly situation.
But fortunately,

1548
01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:41.240
um,
I think the people who were doing it,
you know,

1549
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:46.370
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that

1550
01:31:46.371 --> 01:31:50.060
level.
Uh,
and when I say fortunately,

1551
01:31:50.061 --> 01:31:51.860
I mean for me in my face,

1552
01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:00.460
oh,
do you know how bad that have been to get stomped

1553
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:05.350
<v 6>in that fucking purple on purple rain coat lay in there with my dirty fucking</v>

1554
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:06.610
patriots' hat

1555
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:13.150
and my team wasn't even playing.
I would have lost the lawsuit.

1556
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:16.810
They would have been like,
let me get this straight.
You're a patriots fan,

1557
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:20.530
you're a patriots hat to a bill's jets game and you somehow manage to get the

1558
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:24.190
shit kicked out of you.
What the fuck did you say?
You know,

1559
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.490
that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take

1560
01:32:27.491 --> 01:32:30.640
responsibility for your,
for your actions.
See,
a woman would be like,

1561
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:34.510
there's no excuse.
There's no reason.
I don't care what happened.

1562
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:38.950
You don't hit a girl,
which is true.
You don't need a fucking girl.

1563
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:43.270
But there's no learning in that.
There's no lesson.
You know?

1564
01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:47.810
Even my best friends would have been like,
yeah,
those guys are fucking assholes.

1565
01:32:47.811 --> 01:32:50.110
And the Bun,
you know,
that would've been an awkward pause.
I'm going to be like,

1566
01:32:50.111 --> 01:32:50.321
dude,

1567
01:32:50.321 --> 01:32:55.321
what the fuck he talking shit for by yourself at a game when your team isn't

1568
01:32:55.331 --> 01:32:58.990
even fucking playing.
What's wrong with you?
You're 42 years old.

1569
01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:01.120
Get your shit together.
And they would have been right.

1570
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:08.043
Yeah.

1571
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:19.633
<v 8>Yay.</v>

1572
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:28.083
In bed

1573
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.320
Friday.
They want what?
Shed.

1574
01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.790
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

1575
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:46.930
October 25th,
2010 how you doing?

1576
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:52.590
What's going on?
Um,
I just got back from a,

1577
01:33:52.591 --> 01:33:56.740
a awesome tour,
a quick three,
four day tour,

1578
01:33:56.741 --> 01:34:00.160
three nights of a wonderful theaters.
I feel like a big shot.

1579
01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:04.450
I worked the Wilbur Theater in Boston on Wednesday doing a fund raiser.

1580
01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:09.400
Okay.
And then I did the Pantages theater in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

1581
01:34:09.401 --> 01:34:14.390
One of the most underrated cities I've ever been to.
Minneapolis was the shit.

1582
01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:17.330
And I was bummed that I was only there for a day.

1583
01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:20.910
And then I went to a Chicago and played the Vic theater,

1584
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.360
which evidently Dennis Miller did one of his recent specials that,
you know,

1585
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.010
I loved the Toad Babe.
I love the toad fucking quick.
Wait,
what the fuck?

1586
01:34:30.011 --> 01:34:34.450
And a chip bag,
you know,
one of my favorites of all time.
Um,

1587
01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:38.380
so I got to stand on the same stage.
I guess they did some HBO half hours there.

1588
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:42.340
I heard a talk that Bill Hicks had possibly perform there.

1589
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.080
So it was a,
it was an amazing night tour,
I should say,
not.

1590
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:49.410
And of course I had the wonderful,
uh,

1591
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:52.930
teen idols sensation from the opiate Anthony Program.
Joe Derosa,

1592
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:57.070
Rosa opening for me the entire time.
And,
uh,
believe it or not,

1593
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:02.270
I hung out with Joe to Rosa and did not have a drop of alcohol.

1594
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:06.740
All right.
Now I know a lot of you are familiar with Joe to Rosa.

1595
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:09.800
For those of you who aren't.
Joe Is,
um,

1596
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.540
how do I put this?
Joe is a drunk,
um,

1597
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.260
in every sense of the word.
He literally,
you know,

1598
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.580
the amount of times he can't find his keys and passes out in some sort of fetal

1599
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:28.490
position on the stoop of his building.
It's just,
it's,

1600
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:32.120
it's really just something I'm starting to get nervous about,
you know,

1601
01:35:32.121 --> 01:35:33.410
and I'm sort of codependent.

1602
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:38.410
So when he starts coming around with his fucking half of Egyptian WC fields,

1603
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:43.640
red fucking knows the booze usually starts flowing.

1604
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.630
But I don't know what happened.
I got back into the zone.

1605
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:52.530
I got back into the fucking zone of not Busan.

1606
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.080
I had a had to Heinekens and I know a lot of your beer drinkers will be like,

1607
01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:01.150
well,
that,
that'll do it.
Dude.
It's too fucking better,

1608
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:05.660
too hoppy.
Um,
I had a couple of Heinekens A,
I dunno,

1609
01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:07.790
we could go last Saturday night.
I was like,
you know what?

1610
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.220
I think I'm fucking sick of this.
Yeah.
You know,

1611
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:14.000
I think my head is about big enough.
I think it's,
it's,
I think it's pretty much,

1612
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.890
can't even say waterlogged alcohol log,
you know?
You know,

1613
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:21.650
that's where I really figured out why I don't like boozing is because drinking a

1614
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:26.270
ton of beer is the male equivalent to when females bitch about retaining water

1615
01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.470
and they just feel fucking bloated.
Me,
be honest with yourself.

1616
01:36:30.471 --> 01:36:32.800
It might not happen the day of the tailgate,

1617
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:37.810
but a couple of days after the wings and those fucking Goddamn 16 ounce beers

1618
01:36:39.831 --> 01:36:43.690
you were drinking,
you just wake up in the morning,
stumble into,

1619
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.180
go brush your teeth and you're like,
whoa.
You just look at that fucking,

1620
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.780
and my head is the size of like a fucking industrial like cookie jar.

1621
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:54.710
If they made one,

1622
01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.250
and I was sick of it and I haven't posted in like seven days and I'm noticing,

1623
01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:01.250
uh,
or eight days or nine days,
I'm up to nine days here.
It's kind of,

1624
01:37:01.251 --> 01:37:02.960
it's starting to fucking shrink a little bit.

1625
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:05.890
And I already had a fucking big goddamn head to,

1626
01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:09.710
the last thing I needed to do was to be adding Chins to it.

1627
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.440
You know,
it's not even when you see a guy who was always sort of jolly will say,

1628
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.150
rather than I'm,
I'm in a good mood this week.

1629
01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:25.130
I'm not going to say he's a fat fuck,
we'll just say a jolly guy.
Right.
Um,

1630
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:28.790
you know,
his whole life,
Husky,
you know,

1631
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:32.780
healthy well that dude,
you know,
you see him a five,

1632
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:35.950
10 years later and his head's even bigger year expect it.

1633
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:40.850
But for me it's,
it's when you see that the,
the bean pole guys,

1634
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:44.900
he's a couple of celebrities out there.
I don't name names on the podcast,

1635
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:48.980
but there's just one in particular who back in the day it looked like you could

1636
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:53.450
pick 'em up with two fingers and just walk them over to a table,
you know,

1637
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.000
and,
uh,
saw him the other day and it's just like,
dude,

1638
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.851
you know what it really is?

1639
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:04.110
I think it's because it has to do with not being married,
believe it or not add.

1640
01:38:04.110 --> 01:38:06.550
It's bullshit.
Because what if you're married to the wrong person,

1641
01:38:06.551 --> 01:38:10.410
then it can be depressed,
you'll be eating.
I don't fucking know.

1642
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.820
All I know is I've,
I've,

1643
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:16.910
I've figured something out here is far as where if I'm going to continue boozing

1644
01:38:17.371 --> 01:38:22.371
I'm going to be doing it and it's definitely in the hotel lobby of wherever I'm

1645
01:38:22.471 --> 01:38:27.471
staying at because that is a much more mature place for some of my,

1646
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:29.370
someone of my age to be at.

1647
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:34.590
If you like make and you travel a lot and you keep trying to visit your old

1648
01:38:34.591 --> 01:38:38.400
haunts places that you'd go to when you were in your 20s,

1649
01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:43.350
possibly your early thirties that you just can't do it after a while.
You know,

1650
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:48.330
you walk in and you know,
you just look like the date rape drug guy.

1651
01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.490
I mean why else?
If you're not the club owner,

1652
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.460
how else do you honestly think something's going to happen in there?
Right?

1653
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:58.790
So what you want to do is you go to the hotel lobby and there what you will find

1654
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:02.850
is a unhappily married people

1655
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:09.270
and some call girls.
You know,

1656
01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:13.230
I sat there stone sober with Joe to Rosa.

1657
01:39:13.231 --> 01:39:16.170
We actually hung out one night and did not drink the night of the,
uh,

1658
01:39:16.171 --> 01:39:21.000
the show at the Vic theater,
which was fucking unbelievable by the way.
Um,

1659
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.870
place was sold out and I cannot thank the people,

1660
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.610
the good people of Chicago enough.
That's a great fucking city.

1661
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:34.770
That is a great God damn city.
You know,
fuckers know how to eat,

1662
01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:36.420
they know how to drink,

1663
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:39.960
they know how to grow a mustache and they won a Stanley Cup.

1664
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:43.800
They were in a great fucking mood and I went up there and had an awesome set.

1665
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:47.100
But anyways,
so we hung out at this,
this,
um,

1666
01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:54.060
hung out at the hotel lounge and we were just laughing about how pathetic our

1667
01:39:54.481 --> 01:39:58.590
friendship is when you remove alcohol.
We sat there,

1668
01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.670
this is a fucking dude I've known for seven years and the fact that we weren't

1669
01:40:02.671 --> 01:40:07.350
drinking and breaking balls at that hour of the night,

1670
01:40:07.351 --> 01:40:08.970
it was like an awkward first date

1671
01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:15.780
just sitting there other than just making fun of how we had absolutely nothing

1672
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:18.780
to talk about.
And that's when we just started looking around,

1673
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:22.300
looking at the people look like that movie up in the air someplace.

1674
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:25.110
I Clooney's character would hang out.
And we're just sitting there laughing,

1675
01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.170
trying to guess the jobs that people are doing,
you know?

1676
01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:33.630
And then all of a sudden these two fucking knock outs out of nowhere come

1677
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:36.960
walking by and you know,

1678
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:40.710
so I do what you always do.
You fucking look at them,
you know,

1679
01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.900
look at him right in the eye and this is what gave him away.

1680
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:47.220
They didn't look away.
And I was like,

1681
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:51.810
oh they're professionals.
Wow.
This is a whole,
there's a whole new environment.

1682
01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.570
I got to admit I liked it.
The music wasn't loud.

1683
01:40:55.870 --> 01:41:00.220
It was totally geared for a 42 year old loser like myself.

1684
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:02.080
And I really enjoyed myself.

1685
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:06.700
I didn't had a water and I ate a case of dia and I,
uh,

1686
01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:11.110
I don't know.
I had a great fucking time,
so I'm gonna see how long I can go.

1687
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:14.500
I'm really going to,
I'm going to try to go until the rose bowl cause you know,

1688
01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:15.400
you know my rule,

1689
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:20.410
I got to start the year off right by just making a complete ass of myself at the

1690
01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:24.550
granddaddy of them all.
So if I make it that far,

1691
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.470
that'll be 76 days sober.

1692
01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:31.000
Saw break my old record by one day and I won't,

1693
01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:35.410
I won't put it so fucking far out of reach that when I start drinking again,

1694
01:41:35.411 --> 01:41:39.970
I won't feel like I can't get back to,
you know,
maybe 77 days.
All right.

1695
01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:43.580
Was that boring?
Good.
This is the new sober me.

1696
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:47.290
I got no stories from the road.
I'll,
let's talk about uh,
Minneapolis.

1697
01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:50.550
Why Minneapolis was the shit.
I actually,
uh,

1698
01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.240
I got an a day early and um,
ah,
God damn it.
I don't have my phone on me.

1699
01:41:55.930 --> 01:41:58.450
I did a great radio show.
I forget the name of it of course,

1700
01:41:58.451 --> 01:42:03.180
because I was half asleep.
Phenomenal fucking interview.
And um,

1701
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.560
I'm actually going to start listening to the show online.

1702
01:42:05.561 --> 01:42:07.720
We'll have this information on the [inaudible] podcast.

1703
01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:10.390
I just kind of woke up and did this podcast so I don't have my fucking phone

1704
01:42:10.391 --> 01:42:13.360
with me.
Um,
and then I actually,
I took a tour.

1705
01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:15.850
This is how much of a sports Goddamn nerd I am.

1706
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.580
I took a tour of the twins,

1707
01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:23.200
knew a baseball stadium.
The target,
uh,

1708
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:27.340
target field do target fucking owns Minneapolis.

1709
01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:28.421
All right.

1710
01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:32.410
The way Jp Morgan owned Manhattan back in the day when he used to walk around

1711
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:35.350
with his top hat and his shoes,

1712
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:38.650
what those fucking white things around the ankles to let people know that you're

1713
01:42:38.651 --> 01:42:43.390
fucking rich.
Target owns that Goddamn city.
But uh,

1714
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.590
if you're in Minneapolis,

1715
01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:47.020
you need to kill a couple of fucking hours before a flight.

1716
01:42:47.021 --> 01:42:51.380
I suggest taking a tour of a target field before they close it down for the

1717
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:55.150
winter.
It was awesome.
It was a fucking great ballpark.

1718
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:58.990
I definitely want to come back to Minneapolis and uh,
it's another one.

1719
01:42:58.991 --> 01:43:03.400
They had good food.
They had a,
all of this whole strip of restaurants.

1720
01:43:03.401 --> 01:43:07.090
And then where I played the pantageous,
they had a whole strip of theaters.

1721
01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.960
They had whole little scene going on.
Great bars.
You know,

1722
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:15.550
that I stood in not drinking,
having drunk people from the show coming up to me,

1723
01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.580
you know,
talking to me,
realizing that this is what you look like.

1724
01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:22.180
Bill is a little life lesson,
but I,
I do,

1725
01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:25.410
I do have to criticize Minneapolis about one thing.
Uh,

1726
01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.000
I walked by one of their,
uh,

1727
01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:31.600
their bus stops and I guess it was a major bus stop because it was 40 people

1728
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:32.140
there,

1729
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:37.140
40 of the brokest look and fucking people I've ever seen in my life.

1730
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:40.810
Okay.
White,
black,
Asian.

1731
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:44.230
I don't give a fuck what race I,

1732
01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:46.150
there was no connection to make.

1733
01:43:46.151 --> 01:43:49.990
Like how this level of brokeness happened.

1734
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:53.150
I walked by,
I was actually nervous.
I was like,

1735
01:43:53.151 --> 01:43:55.850
someone's going to slug me in the head and tried to take my fucking wallet

1736
01:43:55.851 --> 01:43:58.250
because if I looked the way these fucking people looked,

1737
01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.410
I would do the exact same thing.
I saw a meth couple.
I don't know what they were.

1738
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:08.860
He's dirty,
uh,
looking people.
The girl looked like a,
I don't know.

1739
01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.250
She was high on something and they had a baby.
She had a baby.
Man,

1740
01:44:13.251 --> 01:44:17.330
she fucking baby sitting there right by the,
uh,
the bus stop.

1741
01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.090
It was just a,
yeah,

1742
01:44:20.091 --> 01:44:24.320
but you have to just want to rescue a baby that like abduct them.
You know,

1743
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:25.820
you just rescue them.

1744
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:30.770
Like you would've got damn dog and one of those Sarah McLaughlin commercials.

1745
01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:32.660
Why don't they have a commercial?
Why can't you do that?

1746
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:38.270
If you see a meth couple drugged out couple,
you know,

1747
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.670
and they're sitting down on the fucking sidewalk,

1748
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.920
like they are laying on a bed with fresh linens with a fucking baby,

1749
01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.260
you know,
I wonder what they would charge you with abduction.

1750
01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:57.920
But I,
I'm how much,
how much of us,
any lawyers listen to this shit?

1751
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:00.710
How much time would you get if you just so like,
look,

1752
01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.340
the fucking baby was being neglected.
So I took it.

1753
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:08.300
He could get away with that shift.
You really couldn't.
They'd be like,
well,

1754
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:11.630
why didn't you call the proper services?
Uh,

1755
01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:14.810
cause I don't know what that would involve looking shit up and trying to find a

1756
01:45:14.811 --> 01:45:19.490
number.
I went with the,
uh,
the immediacy of just fucking taken him.
All right.

1757
01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:21.680
I believe I've meandered enough.
Here's,

1758
01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:26.540
here's a couple of comments from past white,
uh,
white pass,
uh,
podcast.
Uh,

1759
01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:31.190
this one's called the white man,
what I call it.
Uh,
oh,
someone said,

1760
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:33.740
uh,
hey bill,
I'm behind in podcasts.

1761
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:36.320
So you may have already gotten emails about this,

1762
01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:39.620
but Christopher Columbus was actually a redhead.

1763
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:43.740
I was making fun of Christopher Columbus a few weeks ago in Columbus Day.
And,
uh,

1764
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.340
this guy saying Christopher,
oh,
I remember when I said,

1765
01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:49.340
I was saying how Christopher Columbus actually,

1766
01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:53.120
he had blonde hair in my history books.

1767
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.230
So this guy is saying he was actually a redhead.
I think throughout history,

1768
01:45:57.470 --> 01:46:00.410
anyone who decided to walk,
sale,
fly,

1769
01:46:00.411 --> 01:46:05.411
swim toward toward inevitable doom at the end of the world was inevitably a

1770
01:46:06.351 --> 01:46:10.330
psychotic ginger.
That would have been good.
Can I give you some,
uh,

1771
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:15.230
tips on joke writing?
Don't use the same word and the setup and in the punch,

1772
01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.760
you said it inevitable twice.

1773
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:19.370
And of course I'm reading it so that really kills it.

1774
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:21.900
Now this goes back to my theory of,
uh,
when they,

1775
01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.320
they talk about new information throughout history.

1776
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.380
When exactly did they suddenly discover that he was a redhead?

1777
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:32.870
Did you find some 600 year old whore who actually used to bang them

1778
01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:39.470
and she was just,
yeah,
he actually,
yeah,
he had red hair carpets match the drakes.

1779
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:44.930
Um,
that's like the,
that's like the fucking,
uh,
the,
the,
these,

1780
01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:48.060
these black tubes who was standing on the corner of Minneapolis,
uh,
you know,

1781
01:46:48.061 --> 01:46:49.740
all those guys who scream about religion,

1782
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:54.710
do they ever have like the levels of their pa a juxtapose correctly?

1783
01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.710
They always talking way too loud.

1784
01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:02.733
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1785
01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:05.953
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:07.723
<v 3>Have,</v>

1787
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:13.960
<v 6>and you know what's funny is half to white people who walk by,</v>

1788
01:47:13.961 --> 01:47:15.250
they probably think that they're getting,

1789
01:47:15.251 --> 01:47:19.540
making that face like disapproving of the message rather than the level of,

1790
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:24.430
it's just Jody get a new fucking PA.

1791
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:27.700
Yeah.
Get a fucking God damn,
uh,

1792
01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:31.180
whatever the fuck you call the person who knows how to run the board,

1793
01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:32.430
make it a clean sound.

1794
01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:34.710
<v 3>Okay.
And send it,
been like,</v>

1795
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:49.343
yeah.

1796
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:56.150
<v 6>Excuse me sir.
Not trying to interrupt your hate.
Um,
I just,</v>

1797
01:47:56.151 --> 01:48:01.070
it's really difficult to understand what it is I'm supposed to be offended by

1798
01:48:01.071 --> 01:48:05.600
when I can't understand what it is you're saying.
Um,
journal rows,

1799
01:48:05.601 --> 01:48:09.570
it actually said to the Guy Jesus was white and one of his,
his,
uh,
uh,

1800
01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:13.500
terminator x guys actually laughed and then another guy stared at him and then

1801
01:48:13.501 --> 01:48:15.960
he went right back to the,
uh,
fuck white people face.

1802
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:19.771
Once again.

1803
01:48:19.771 --> 01:48:23.420
Another classic example why I stay away from organized religion because it,

1804
01:48:23.421 --> 01:48:27.950
it leads you to that,
you know,
Jesus loves everybody,

1805
01:48:27.951 --> 01:48:32.420
but he's our color and he loves us best,
but he loves everyone.

1806
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:35.000
<v 3>What,</v>

1807
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.150
<v 6>um,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
I'm sure that bothered a lot of your ears.</v>

1808
01:48:39.151 --> 01:48:43.320
I apologize for that,
but that's literally what the fuck it sounded like.

1809
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:48.470
MMM.
Okay.
Okay.
I would like to do that on a street corner.

1810
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.350
Have a really bad pa like that and just be saying a bunch of fucking reverse

1811
01:48:52.351 --> 01:48:54.390
racist shit about white people.

1812
01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.080
I wonder if anybody would get it,
the amount of people who wouldn't,

1813
01:49:02.081 --> 01:49:05.260
that was what would make it really hilarious.
Yeah.
But he's white.

1814
01:49:05.261 --> 01:49:08.140
I don't understand.
Um,
all right,

1815
01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:11.920
here's a quick question that I got this week on Peyton manning a bill.

1816
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:15.730
I am a college student in New York City and I love the podcast and your comedy.

1817
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:20.380
I am a diehard giants fan and the kid down the hall is from Indiana and is a

1818
01:49:20.381 --> 01:49:21.214
colts fan.

1819
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:25.780
For some reason he feels the giants were lucky to beat the 18 and oh patriots

1820
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:30.450
and that they flat out suck.
Um,

1821
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.140
but Peyton was not lucky to win against the rex Grossman led.

1822
01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:39.270
Here's your fucking Superbowl coats.
Chicago bears.

1823
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:44.250
I need you to go on another rant to explain these two super bowls and which one

1824
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:48.340
was more legitimate?
Um,
all right.
First of all,

1825
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:53.370
you're,
you're,
you're playing into his hand.
All right?

1826
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:58.180
He's just deliberately saying,
shit that's going to piss you off and,
and you're,

1827
01:49:58.181 --> 01:50:01.810
you're taking the bait.
All right.
The giants weren't lucky.

1828
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:03.070
The giants are actually,

1829
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:08.071
the 2007 giants are arguably the most underrated Superbowl team of all fucking

1830
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:15.031
time because everyone was so fixated that the patriots lost.

1831
01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.680
That was the story rather than

1832
01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:24.130
the giants had one of the most undeniable championships of all time.

1833
01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:27.130
They were on the road the whole time.
They went down to Tampa Bay,

1834
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.720
they beat Tampa in Tampa.
Then they went to Dallas,

1835
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:34.060
beat the cowboys in Dallas,

1836
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:38.780
then they went to green bay and beat Green Bay in fucking Green Bay.

1837
01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.410
And then they went to to uh,
uh,

1838
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:46.630
the Superbowl and for some reason with 17 point underdogs to a team that they

1839
01:50:46.631 --> 01:50:49.360
scored like 35 points on a month earlier,

1840
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.960
still kicking myself in the ass that I didn't take that bet.
Um,

1841
01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:58.510
and fucking just,
you know,
blasted the Patriots right in the mouth,

1842
01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:01.690
kick their fucking ass.
Didn't really kicked our ass because of the score.

1843
01:51:01.691 --> 01:51:04.840
But as far as like when it really came down to like a,

1844
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:10.480
just the offense,
the defensive line just crushed our offensive line.
I mean,

1845
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.700
I don't know.
I don't think they're underrated at all.

1846
01:51:12.701 --> 01:51:17.701
I actually don't feel that the 2007 giants get the respect that they deserve and

1847
01:51:17.711 --> 01:51:22.120
it's a fucking shame that the patriots hadn't lost just one game.

1848
01:51:22.121 --> 01:51:24.640
So then maybe they could have focused on that.
And He,

1849
01:51:24.650 --> 01:51:28.210
my theory is if the Patriots actually just lost the game during the regular

1850
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:31.030
season,
maybe they could have just,
they could,
uh,
uh,

1851
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:35.050
actually had a weekend to themselves and not at a bunch of cameras up their

1852
01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:39.790
assets.
Um,
anyways,
so I,

1853
01:51:39.791 --> 01:51:42.670
I totally disagree with that,
but I think this guy's just trying to piss you off.

1854
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.900
And as far as the,
uh,
the colts play in the bears,
I mean,

1855
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:49.300
it's not their fault that the bears,
that the,

1856
01:51:49.301 --> 01:51:53.140
all these other NFC teams couldn't beat fucking rex Grossman,

1857
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:59.230
if I remember correctly.
Rex Grossman,
anything beyond 12 yards was a hail Mary.

1858
01:51:59.570 --> 01:52:02.050
Am I crazy thinking that shit?
Am I crazy?

1859
01:52:02.051 --> 01:52:04.570
This whole call be throwing up these motherfuckers,

1860
01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:08.810
these motherfuckers loaded Packard shit.
Can a black quarterback,

1861
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:11.570
what the fuck that,
um,

1862
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:16.120
anyways,
yeah.
So all he's trying to do is just,
uh,

1863
01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:20.080
he's just trying to piss you off and you're allowing that to happen.

1864
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:22.900
And um,
you know,
I don't,

1865
01:52:22.901 --> 01:52:27.370
I'm amazed that you are allowing that to happen because,
uh,
you know,

1866
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.680
say what you want about rex Grossman.

1867
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.500
He didn't throw a pick six to lose the fucking game.

1868
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:36.760
He just kind of threw a bunch of shitty passes for four quarters.

1869
01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:43.130
All right.
Um,
speaking of which,
um,

1870
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.730
I want to talk to San Diego charger fans this week and,
uh,

1871
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.760
I want to know what the fuck you guys did to the football gods.

1872
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.990
Okay.
Now this,
this is a group of people that,
uh,

1873
01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:01.070
evidently we're rivals with something that I wasn't aware of,

1874
01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:05.990
um,
because we usually beat them,
you know,

1875
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.960
which always amazes me why Yankee fans,
you know,

1876
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:12.920
back in the day hated red sox fans.
It's just like,
why would you even bother?

1877
01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:17.180
Why,
why did you even notice I,
he was the difference between us and the fucking,

1878
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:21.050
you know,
the Goddamn twins at this point,
we always lose to you,
you know,

1879
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:25.470
back in the day.
Um,
but anyways,

1880
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:30.490
like the amount of fucking times that the chargers have beaten the fucking

1881
01:53:30.501 --> 01:53:35.030
patriots and still lost the game is just,
it's just,
it's fucking beyond me.

1882
01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:41.270
You remember that one year in the,
uh,
I believe it was the playoffs.
Playoffs.
Um,

1883
01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:46.280
they like stopped us.
We were down,
I don't know how many points we were down,

1884
01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:47.511
but we would down,

1885
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:52.250
it was the end of the game and they stopped us on fourth and short fucking games

1886
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:54.320
over.
All they gotta do is take a knee and run out the clock,

1887
01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:59.321
but some fucking idiot on their defense gets like a,

1888
01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:04.370
a personal foul on the play,
completely unnecessary,

1889
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.660
which gives the Patriots have first down and allows them to continue that drive

1890
01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:12.290
to then go ahead and,
and steal the fucking game.

1891
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:16.730
Now,
yesterday wasn't the same scenario.

1892
01:54:16.731 --> 01:54:19.370
That was a case of the Patriots blowing the fucking game.

1893
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:25.300
But it's like you're right there to tie it and you know,

1894
01:54:25.401 --> 01:54:29.090
if you tied it,
you're going to beat us.
You got a 45 yarder,

1895
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.340
which is totally makeable by this guy.

1896
01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.540
And then someone on your offensive line has of a fucking false start.

1897
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:40.700
Five yard penalty.
Now it's a fucking 50.
Yarder I gotta be honest with you.

1898
01:54:40.701 --> 01:54:44.620
I saw it.
I thought that that guy was going to miss the 45 yarder.
Uh,

1899
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:47.270
he just didn't have that.
I'm going to nail this look on his face.

1900
01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.010
But then I thought once that guy got the five yard penalty in the,

1901
01:54:52.011 --> 01:54:56.400
became a 50 yard kick,
the fact that if he missed it,
it was good.

1902
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:59.330
People were going to be blaming the fucking cunt and the offensive line.

1903
01:54:59.331 --> 01:55:02.690
I figured maybe that took the pressure off it and he was going to hit it and lo

1904
01:55:02.691 --> 01:55:06.230
and behold,
the guy kicks it plenty of fucking leg.

1905
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:11.060
And you know,
and just typical of the torture of that,

1906
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:15.410
these I feel San Diego charger fans do not deserve at this point.

1907
01:55:15.411 --> 01:55:17.330
They have paid their fucking dues.

1908
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:21.770
He didn't even have the decency to just kick it fucking wide.
Right.

1909
01:55:21.771 --> 01:55:25.370
And you knew the second was off his foot.
You could be like,
ah,
what the fuck?

1910
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:30.140
Right.
It's the whole way.

1911
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.350
You will,
you couldn't tell either way.
Is it gonna is it gonna be good?
Is,

1912
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:36.350
is he going to miss it?

1913
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:41.351
It actually hit the upright and does it bounce in somehow miraculously,

1914
01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:45.900
and they tie it up.
Now it just fucking falls to the ground kick is no good.

1915
01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:50.670
And,
um,
San Diego fans.
I want to know what do you think you did?

1916
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:54.210
Cause I remember back in the day when the red sox would blow it and they had the

1917
01:55:54.211 --> 01:55:57.350
curse of the Babe,
you know,
at least we had something to,
to,

1918
01:55:57.351 --> 01:56:01.230
to try to blame it on.
What did you guys do out there?

1919
01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:06.930
Was it because,
uh,
was,
was there a group of Indians,

1920
01:56:06.931 --> 01:56:11.760
they're having a good time and then fucking Mr San Diego came in and fucking

1921
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:15.480
raped and killed all of them.
The name that area after himself.

1922
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:18.620
Is that what happened?
What happened out there?
Oh by the way,
this in,

1923
01:56:18.621 --> 01:56:22.140
in this week's,
this week's,
um,
or this month,

1924
01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:26.310
I don't even know if rolling stones monthly or weekly,
um,
edition,

1925
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:31.350
they have that dead dude from entourage who plays the manager on,
I'm sorry,

1926
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:35.430
it was in sports illustrated and they asked him how he felt when the red sox

1927
01:56:35.431 --> 01:56:39.750
came back in 2004 and beat the Yankees and he's a big time Yankee Fan.

1928
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.060
And he goes,
I was happy.

1929
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:45.270
I was happy that they finally won it cause I was so sick of them.

1930
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:50.100
Listen to them complain.
How fucking hilarious is that really?

1931
01:56:50.130 --> 01:56:54.630
Where you're really happy.
Oh,
I was glad you guys want really,

1932
01:56:54.631 --> 01:56:58.410
we use sick or rubbing our noses.
You fucking lying piece of shit.

1933
01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:02.490
You was sitting at Shannon 1918 with all of them.
Jesus Christ.

1934
01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:06.480
That's like fucking Regis Filburn.
After we,
after we won it,
he was like,
yeah,

1935
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:09.450
you want it.
You want it all right.
Whatever.
Enough already,
you know,
move on.

1936
01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.350
Fucking faggot.
Yankee fans,
this such pussies.

1937
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:16.350
All they can do is talk shit for fucking all this time.

1938
01:57:16.351 --> 01:57:18.300
And then the second it comes around for them to talk and Shit,

1939
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:20.940
they got to act like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
I'm happy for you guys.
Yeah,
I'm happy.

1940
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.730
Stand there and take it.
You fucking midget.

1941
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:28.710
Whatever the fuck you Goddamn name is manager on entourage.

1942
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.750
You weren't happy.
You were fucking pissed.

1943
01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.250
You had your head between your little fucking midget knobby knees.
Oh,

1944
01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:37.680
it was after the happy you guys want when the Yankees win.

1945
01:57:37.710 --> 01:57:41.700
I'm never happy I have the balls to fucking admit that.
All right there.

1946
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:46.290
Fucking little man with a better career than me.
All right then let's plow ahead.

1947
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.190
Um,
it's amazing that we,

1948
01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.280
we still won and his comments still pissed me off.
I wanted misery.

1949
01:57:56.490 --> 01:57:59.220
I wanted misery out of those guys.
Oh,
speaking of which,

1950
01:57:59.250 --> 01:58:01.710
I don't even know what's going on in baseball.
I know the Rangers won.

1951
01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:05.070
Congratulations.
All right.

1952
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:08.850
Which once again makes me wonder what the fuck the people of San Diego did.

1953
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:12.450
Cause here it is,
the people at Dallas are just,
you know,

1954
01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:16.950
now I'm ready to blow my fucking head off that God damn Tony Romo kick fucking

1955
01:58:16.951 --> 01:58:20.100
complete.
If the fucking play calling,
you know,
they're going nuts down there.

1956
01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:25.500
All right.
And here it is.
Baseball,
sports.
They don't even give a shit about,

1957
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:27.391
actually,
wait a minute.

1958
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:31.140
The longhorns are always in fucking the college world series,
aren't they?

1959
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:34.890
But that's way down there and fucking Austin,
but whatever.

1960
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:39.660
It's like the cowboys,
a shit and the God damn bed.
And,
uh,

1961
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.590
then all of a sudden the rage is come on,

1962
01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:45.430
gives them something to fucking share above.
So,

1963
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:50.770
I dunno actually liked the Phillies and I liked the giants at,
uh,

1964
01:58:50.771 --> 01:58:53.830
I guess just because the giants having one in so long,
I'd like,

1965
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:55.630
I'd love to see the rangers first,
the giants,

1966
01:58:55.631 --> 01:58:59.530
and I think I'll actually watch the God damn world series.
I actually,

1967
01:58:59.531 --> 01:59:02.680
when the Rangers started kicking the shit out of the Yankees,
I started,
you know,

1968
01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:07.681
peaking into bars and watching it because I was amazed that a $55 million team

1969
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:09.100
could have such a great lineup.

1970
01:59:09.101 --> 01:59:13.330
And what sucks about baseball is half those guys will end up on the red sox or

1971
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:15.940
the fucking Yankees,
uh,

1972
01:59:15.941 --> 01:59:20.200
which really has to stop or am I completely full or,

1973
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:22.000
or am I completely full of Shit?

1974
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:27.160
Because despite the fact that the fucking red sox spent all that God damn money,

1975
01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.140
did they make the playoffs?
No,
they did not.

1976
01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.130
And could the Yankees beat of $55 million team?
No,
they couldn't.

1977
01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.790
And plus I'm also is finally starting to read all this shit about these other

1978
01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:40.210
fucking cheap bastard known as like the God damned guys with the pirates who

1979
01:59:40.211 --> 01:59:42.400
just make a profit every year and don't even try to make,

1980
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:46.660
put a winner on the field.
I think the whole God damn sport needs to be rehauled.

1981
01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:50.050
That's what the fuck I say.
Rehauled or overhauled.

1982
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:54.340
Do you know I was watching the,
uh,
this is just a completely random podcasts.

1983
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:59.341
I was watching the Jersey shore last night though the final episode and uh,

1984
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.940
I just love how they fuck up sayings.

1985
02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:07.750
Sneaky said.

1986
02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:12.580
She was upset about something and said that her blood pressure was off the roof.

1987
02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.100
My blood pressure's off the roof,
not going through the roof,

1988
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:21.220
not off the charts.
It was off the roof.

1989
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.600
God blessed that big titted fucking you don't,
she's going to be a great mother.

1990
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.870
I don't know what it is about her.
She's going to be a great mother,
but she,

1991
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:36.940
I don't know if she's ever going to get married because so much footage exists

1992
02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:38.620
of a,

1993
02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:42.370
I don't even know if a lot of footage exists cause I didn't really watch it this

1994
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:45.070
year,
this season.
But you know,

1995
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.500
once you do like a fucking whatever that,

1996
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:51.520
that backwards cartwheel that you did and they have to pixelate you pussy lips

1997
02:00:51.521 --> 02:00:54.000
hanging out of your fucking Thong.
I mean that,

1998
02:00:54.001 --> 02:00:57.100
that you're really limiting the amount of people that are going to want to go

1999
02:00:57.101 --> 02:01:00.490
out on a date with you.
Something that she continues to,
to,
uh,
to bitch about.

2000
02:01:01.630 --> 02:01:05.530
You know,
her tits take up her entire torso.

2001
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:10.150
If you notice that they start right under Adam Adam's apple and they go right to

2002
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:13.010
the top of where her pubes grow.
Um,

2003
02:01:13.090 --> 02:01:14.710
which is another thing that's working against there,

2004
02:01:14.711 --> 02:01:16.330
but you got to admit she's got a lot of talent.

2005
02:01:16.930 --> 02:01:19.900
Her ability to do that back flip and not like,

2006
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:23.800
what are those fucking things?
One of those weebles wobble,

2007
02:01:23.801 --> 02:01:25.600
but they don't fall down at some point like that.

2008
02:01:25.601 --> 02:01:30.280
That should be like impossible for her to do.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

2009
02:01:30.281 --> 02:01:33.640
What am I talking about this week?
Um,
yeah,
so the fucking patriots won.

2010
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:37.000
I think we're one of the weakest five and one goddamn teams out there,

2011
02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:41.780
but we're five and one tied with the Goddamn jets.

2012
02:01:41.781 --> 02:01:46.250
What do you think about dead u green,
Bald fucking cunts?
Um,

2013
02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:50.570
anyways,
oh,
this week,
by the way,
let me hype some,
uh,

2014
02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:55.310
some of the shit I got going on.
I have a,
I'm going to be going to,

2015
02:01:55.311 --> 02:01:57.680
um,
Saint Louis this weekend.

2016
02:01:57.681 --> 02:02:02.090
I'm doing a benefit on Friday night and on Saturday night I'm doing two shows.

2017
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.270
One night only at the funny bone is Saint Louis.
I haven't been here.

2018
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:09.680
I haven't been there in a,
put it this way.

2019
02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:13.280
The last time I went there was the first year of new Busch Stadium,

2020
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.980
I believe.
Yeah.
Whenever the fuck that was,
it's,

2021
02:02:18.981 --> 02:02:21.890
it's been a good five,
six years I want to say.
I don't know.

2022
02:02:21.891 --> 02:02:25.340
It's been a long goddamn time.
So please come out to that show.

2023
02:02:25.341 --> 02:02:30.341
I will have my new DVDs for sale and I can't stress how much you're going to be

2024
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:36.350
happy if you buy that God damn thing because comedy central,

2025
02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:41.390
because they actually make their money through advertising,
had not their fault,

2026
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:46.420
had to cut out 16 minutes of that special plus an extra five minutes because the

2027
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:48.710
special is an hour and five minutes long.

2028
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:51.950
So with the 60 minutes of commercials plus the extra five minutes,

2029
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.790
21 minutes of that special you have not seen.

2030
02:02:55.850 --> 02:03:00.850
And the overwhelming response I've gotten from people was like,

2031
02:03:00.921 --> 02:03:03.560
Holy Shit,
I can't believe they cut out all this stuff.
I mean,

2032
02:03:03.561 --> 02:03:04.550
I get why they did it.

2033
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.150
I wish they showed it over 90 minutes and you could see the whole special,

2034
02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:10.610
but um,
you won't be disappointed.

2035
02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.060
And I have extras actually filmed one of my Monday morning podcasts.

2036
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:17.360
If you're ever curious to see what I look like sitting in sweatpants,

2037
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.460
talking into a mic by myself.

2038
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:23.900
We got that footage and some footage of me getting heckled and giving people

2039
02:03:23.901 --> 02:03:25.400
shit back.
All right.

2040
02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:29.900
So that is an anam hanging around to go to the fucking rams game,

2041
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:31.071
the rams game,

2042
02:03:31.071 --> 02:03:36.071
which will be my 101st professional franchise that I have been to,

2043
02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:41.930
uh,
trying to go to all 123.
And this,
this week I actually,

2044
02:03:41.931 --> 02:03:45.170
when I was on the plane,
this is how I'm,
I try to uh,

2045
02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.890
kill time when I'm on the plane is uh,

2046
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:55.520
I dunno,
I,
I try to,
if I write down the,
the teams that I haven't seen,

2047
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.350
this is really psychotic.
I'll do it with my right hand cause I'm a lefty,
right?

2048
02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:03.800
Trying to develop that skill because I feel like my brain's turning to mush

2049
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:08.510
talking on cell phones.
And uh,
this week I actually,

2050
02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:09.680
and I'm,

2051
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:12.770
well I'm going to complete this list and put it up on the [inaudible] podcast.

2052
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.950
I actually,
um,

2053
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:20.270
started to compile a list of the names of all the stadiums that I've been to.

2054
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.060
And a,
I got to admit it's pretty,

2055
02:04:23.061 --> 02:04:25.220
it's getting pretty fucking impressive at this point.

2056
02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.650
Some of the classics that I've been to,

2057
02:04:27.651 --> 02:04:29.780
some of the ones that aren't there anymore,

2058
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:35.900
like Old Tiger Stadium,
old Yankee stadium.
Uh,

2059
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:38.520
and even like the random like county stadium.

2060
02:04:39.130 --> 02:04:42.480
Remember that one with like the brewers back in the day when they used to hit

2061
02:04:42.481 --> 02:04:45.000
home runs,
every time they hit a home run,

2062
02:04:45.001 --> 02:04:50.001
they had this big fucking titted whore would slide down into a slide into what

2063
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:56.760
was supposed to be an old school keg of beer,
you know,
I dunno.

2064
02:04:56.850 --> 02:05:01.320
So good God damn time.
Um,
so I'll have that list up there.
Seriously.

2065
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:03.630
If you ever sports nerd,
if you'd like,
if you don't,
if you're not into it,

2066
02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:06.570
who gives a fuck?
Um,
all right.

2067
02:05:06.571 --> 02:05:10.290
This podcast is grinding to a goddamn halt.
All right,

2068
02:05:10.291 --> 02:05:12.210
let's get to some advice here.
Bill.

2069
02:05:12.211 --> 02:05:15.720
I met a girl on a online dating site and uh,

2070
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:20.790
we hit it off and we both thought each other
as friends.

2071
02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:25.740
Now,
you know,
usually I,
I blame myself when I,
when I don't read these well,

2072
02:05:25.741 --> 02:05:27.930
but this,
this one is really not written well.

2073
02:05:27.931 --> 02:05:32.370
He misses words and he misspells the,
the rest of them.

2074
02:05:32.371 --> 02:05:34.920
So just bear with me.
Alright,
so basically this guy,

2075
02:05:34.921 --> 02:05:37.140
I met this girl on an online dating site.

2076
02:05:37.141 --> 02:05:41.460
They hit it off and they both think of each other as friends while over the last

2077
02:05:41.461 --> 02:05:43.980
nine months,
we became good friends.

2078
02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.700
Even after I moved eight hours,

2079
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:52.620
eight hours days,
you mean eight hours away.
Oh,

2080
02:05:52.621 --> 02:05:55.380
you got a job and you're working eight hour days.
I have no idea.

2081
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:58.230
During the last three months,
um,

2082
02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:02.580
she lost or last 25 pounds,

2083
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:07.740
lost 25 pounds and told me,
uh,
she was bipolar and Oh,

2084
02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:11.670
oh geesh.
Jesus Christ dude.
Okay.

2085
02:06:11.671 --> 02:06:14.460
And over this time she keeps calling

2086
02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:22.080
and started treating me like a boyfriend.
So obviously you're fucking her.

2087
02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.090
Okay.
So you're,

2088
02:06:25.091 --> 02:06:28.560
you're hanging out with this girl for eight months and you're banging her.

2089
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.380
So yeah,
she's going to start treating you like a boyfriend.

2090
02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:36.150
A few weeks ago I was invited to her family's beach house for the weekend and

2091
02:06:36.151 --> 02:06:39.630
met her whole family.
While I was there,

2092
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:44.280
her mother introduced me to their family and friends as the guide Jane has been

2093
02:06:44.281 --> 02:06:47.520
dating for the last four months.
I blew it off.

2094
02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:51.420
Why would you blow that off?
I guess her mother could,
you know,

2095
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.860
it was just trying to save her a daughter's reputation.
Hey,

2096
02:06:55.861 --> 02:07:00.000
this is my daughter's a friend friend with benefits.
Yeah,
he's banging her,

2097
02:07:00.001 --> 02:07:03.630
but there's really nothing going on here.
Oh,
these kids today.

2098
02:07:04.590 --> 02:07:09.220
Um,
I blew it off and enjoyed the weekend,
uh,
three weeks ago.
It's,
uh,

2099
02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:13.320
it's gotten really bad and I'm trying to distance myself.

2100
02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.680
And the other night I asked her if she thought of me more than a friend and she

2101
02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:20.190
said no.

2102
02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:24.060
And it gave me the friend speech and then ask why I felt that she might have

2103
02:07:24.061 --> 02:07:27.600
felt this way and gave me some examples about calling me

2104
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:30.720
on.

2105
02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.680
Then she gave you some examples about calling her all the time and telling a few

2106
02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.450
other personal things.
Well,

2107
02:07:37.451 --> 02:07:40.900
two days later she called me and said that she can't be friends with me anymore

2108
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.110
because every time we talk or hang out together,
uh,

2109
02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:48.940
it gets tougher because she's always going to think that she,
she's giving you,

2110
02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:52.120
she's giving,
oh,
giving you the,

2111
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:56.100
I like you more than a friend vibe.
Um,

2112
02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.140
I feel really bad and that what I said might have caused her to have a major

2113
02:08:02.471 --> 02:08:07.330
episode what like bipolar episode and we talk so much,

2114
02:08:07.331 --> 02:08:12.331
I didn't really realize how much of a part of a life my life she was and I did

2115
02:08:12.581 --> 02:08:15.670
have feelings for what do I do?
All right.

2116
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.620
First things first.

2117
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:21.820
This is why that friends with benefit thing doesn't work for so many people

2118
02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.640
because friends with benefits,

2119
02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:30.130
if you're hanging out with someone of the opposite sex,

2120
02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:32.620
they're going to start getting feelings for you.

2121
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:37.030
So the only way to do the friends with benefit things is you can only,

2122
02:08:38.290 --> 02:08:39.490
you can only bang.
Um,

2123
02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.230
and but what you have to do is there has to be a significant period of time

2124
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:50.890
between you,
you banging that,
you bang them and then you fucking leave.

2125
02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:55.540
But inevitably something like this,
someone's going to get,
get some feelings in.

2126
02:08:55.541 --> 02:08:58.000
It's,
it's an impossible thing to do.

2127
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.810
It's like what you're doing is you had a one night stand and you,

2128
02:09:03.811 --> 02:09:08.811
you are either through being selfish or just lacking the confidence of you being

2129
02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:13.360
able to pull off,
getting laid again.
You try to keep,

2130
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:15.760
I can only speak of this from the male side,

2131
02:09:15.761 --> 02:09:20.350
you try to keep this person in you in your fucking,
uh,

2132
02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:25.180
in a holding pattern around your life.
And uh,
yeah,

2133
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:26.890
of course she's going to end up catching some feelings.

2134
02:09:26.891 --> 02:09:28.980
You're going to end up hurting the person.
You can't.
I mean,

2135
02:09:30.130 --> 02:09:33.310
if you're just friends,
what the fuck are you going over meeting her parents for?

2136
02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.100
You know,
like that level is shit.
No matter how much you've said from the get go,

2137
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.500
that,
look,
I don't want anything more than this.
We just,

2138
02:09:41.501 --> 02:09:42.730
I just view you as a friend.

2139
02:09:42.731 --> 02:09:46.810
If you go over and you meet her parents like that says something.

2140
02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:52.540
All right.
So my advice is,
is if you liked this girl,

2141
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:56.320
make her your girlfriend.
If you don't like her,

2142
02:09:56.410 --> 02:10:01.390
stop fucking her because you're hurting her.
You know,

2143
02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:05.020
that's all you're doing is because she's gonna forget about the fact that she

2144
02:10:05.021 --> 02:10:09.520
has these,
this by bipolar disorder or whatever.
Now obviously,

2145
02:10:09.550 --> 02:10:12.970
I don't know how that fucking plays into it.
Um,

2146
02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:15.101
but yeah,
dude,

2147
02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:19.870
you gotta you gotta man up and have the balls to either make this girl your

2148
02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:23.050
girlfriend or man up and just be alone,

2149
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:28.530
which is how most people I think fuck up their dating careers and getting

2150
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:30.070
married and all that is just,

2151
02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:35.020
they have a fear of being alone and they don't want to,
uh,

2152
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:39.620
just ride out that fucking six weeks.
You know,

2153
02:10:39.621 --> 02:10:42.980
going through the first few days of spooning with your pillow and crying and

2154
02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:47.600
feeling sorry for yourself and just learning how to pick yourself up off the
mat.

2155
02:10:47.601 --> 02:10:51.440
Join a gym,
right?
Get yourself in shape,

2156
02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.870
hang out with the fellas,
watch some games.
You know,
it's only

2157
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.290
being single,
really just,
it sucks on days off and it sucks at night.

2158
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:06.980
But other than that,
it's a,
it's pretty fucking awesome,

2159
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:13.250
you know,
to just kind of be able to walk into places,

2160
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:18.140
scope out every chick there and be like,
I want to try to fuck her.

2161
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.530
Or maybe that's the girl I want to marry.
Like that's,

2162
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:25.540
that's a great situation to be in and it's worth the loneliness.

2163
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:28.850
Come on,
be honest with me.

2164
02:11:28.851 --> 02:11:32.090
How many people out there are fucking with somebody right now you don't want to

2165
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:35.900
be with and you're going to these family fucking advance.

2166
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:39.620
You know when you just feel the noose getting tighter and tighter around your

2167
02:11:39.621 --> 02:11:44.570
neck.
I'm telling you,
just get out of it.
And when you get out of it,

2168
02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:49.280
go through the pain of being single on,
of,
of going through the breakup.

2169
02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:52.010
Don't just go out and run back to the person.

2170
02:11:52.011 --> 02:11:57.011
Don't fucking go out and just start dating somebody else and just use that

2171
02:11:57.231 --> 02:12:00.080
person to fill up your fucking loneliness.

2172
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:05.490
Like really just be alone.
And when you,

2173
02:12:05.491 --> 02:12:08.390
you know,
I'm telling you,
you have to fucking couple of weeks,

2174
02:12:08.391 --> 02:12:11.150
you're going to get through it and then

2175
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:16.370
you'll be comfortable being by yourself and then you can have a quiet fucking

2176
02:12:16.371 --> 02:12:20.420
mind that isn't thinking panic thoughts and he can just kind of make a list of

2177
02:12:20.421 --> 02:12:24.920
what the fuck you looking for,
you know,
and ask for if you don't know what to,

2178
02:12:24.921 --> 02:12:29.450
where to find it,
asked for some goddamn advice.
But the last thing you do is,

2179
02:12:29.451 --> 02:12:34.190
uh,
is,
is get involved in a situation like this where it's like,
dude,

2180
02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.500
if you really gave a fuck about this girl,

2181
02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.880
wouldn't you when you made her your girl or maybe you're afraid to make her,
her,

2182
02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:45.170
her,
your girlfriend?
I don't know what,
but,
uh,
that's my advice.

2183
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:46.160
I would do one or the other,

2184
02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:50.480
actually commit to this girl and try to make it happen.
Um,

2185
02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:54.590
or just get away from her.
All right?
But I got to admit,

2186
02:12:54.591 --> 02:12:58.520
you're really taking on a hell of a fucking thing here where you've got someone

2187
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:03.080
with a bipolar disorder.
You know,

2188
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:04.070
and I hate to say it,

2189
02:13:04.071 --> 02:13:07.970
but you have to be selfish when you're picking a mate and it says that something

2190
02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:11.810
you want to fucking deal with except something you feel you're capable of

2191
02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:12.291
dealing with.

2192
02:13:12.291 --> 02:13:17.030
This is the shit you have to ask yourself when you sit in there alone,
you know,

2193
02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.990
eating Doritos with one hand down the front of your fucking sweat pants.

2194
02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:27.290
All right,
there you go.
I think a lot of that made a little bit of sense.

2195
02:13:27.291 --> 02:13:30.590
God dammit.
Somebody sent me a picture the other day,
this guy at a,

2196
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:34.710
a pickup truck and on the back he had all this shit.

2197
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:39.990
Um,
Anti Obama.
Obama is how you say his name,
Obama.

2198
02:13:40.590 --> 02:13:42.740
And uh,
at one point he had this,
uh,

2199
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.840
this is what fascinates me about people who are straight up Democrat,

2200
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:49.770
a straight up Republican.

2201
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.120
It reminds me of people who are into like fucking organized religion,

2202
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:57.960
just like the blinders that they have on this is the bumper sticker.

2203
02:13:57.961 --> 02:14:01.950
This guy had had,
he said,
recession,
your neighbor loses his job,

2204
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:05.940
depression,
you lose your job recovery.

2205
02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:09.990
Obama loses his job,
you know,

2206
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:14.550
and it's just like,
that was fucking people.
It's like,

2207
02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:19.580
how do you not see that they all kind of do the same thing and they're all on

2208
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:22.830
their knees blowing the same fucking,

2209
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:29.760
I mean,
don't you see?
Okay,
Clinton,
Democrat,
liberal,
right?
Bleeding,

2210
02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:32.520
heart liberal.
What does he do?
The bleeding,
heart liberal.

2211
02:14:32.521 --> 02:14:34.980
He's for the fucking everyday Joe.

2212
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.280
He's just going to give it away to the broke people.
What does he do?

2213
02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:41.370
He helps deregulate the banks.

2214
02:14:43.170 --> 02:14:46.740
All right.
George Bush comes in,
right?

2215
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:50.460
He wants to help out fucking major corporations and all that type of shit.

2216
02:14:50.850 --> 02:14:53.370
Doesn't give him one war.
He gives him two wars

2217
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:58.170
billion dollars a fucking month or whatever the hell it is going into those

2218
02:14:58.171 --> 02:15:01.530
fucking cunts pockets.
God,

2219
02:15:01.570 --> 02:15:03.840
in the combination of those two fucking moves,

2220
02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.400
the deregulation of banks trying to fight to fucking wars,
to away games.

2221
02:15:08.401 --> 02:15:10.410
By the way,
on the other side of the fucking planet,

2222
02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:15.570
bankrupts this goddamn country.
Obama comes in,
right?

2223
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.810
Bleeding,
heart,
fucking liberal.
What the fuck does he do?

2224
02:15:22.290 --> 02:15:25.680
Gets us out of Iraq and then escalates to shit and Afghanistan.

2225
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:30.960
Has he taken any of these bankers to task?
They stole a trillion dollars.

2226
02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:33.050
They can't even say the way the fuck it is and who got it.

2227
02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:34.830
Is he going after those people

2228
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:40.290
now than not?
It's the same fucking people,

2229
02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:45.450
which is why I resent people when they tell me when I vote for Ron Paul,

2230
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:48.810
Oh rain or anybody else,
you know,

2231
02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:53.460
light of that ilk who saying that these bankers and these corporations are

2232
02:15:53.461 --> 02:15:57.110
completely out of fucking control and we need to do the audit,

2233
02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.190
the Federal Reserve or maybe even close to the,
you know,

2234
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:01.820
shut the fucking thing down and they,

2235
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:04.950
they're not allowed to debate and they're just considered a crazy person.

2236
02:16:05.670 --> 02:16:09.300
And then you go out there and you basically make a decision between the two

2237
02:16:09.301 --> 02:16:12.750
fucking guys that they're giving you to vote for,

2238
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:17.190
that you feel like,
oh,
we made these choices.
You didn't,

2239
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.870
you didn't.
It's all the same fucking guy.
Hi.

2240
02:16:21.871 --> 02:16:26.610
He didn't figure that out in 2004 when your choice was two white guys who both

2241
02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:30.580
went to Yale,
who were both a member of that fucking group,
the,
the,

2242
02:16:30.581 --> 02:16:34.240
the skulls or whatever.
It was the same fucking guy.

2243
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.740
And I love how these,
the fucking Democrats somehow get,
get off a guy,

2244
02:16:40.741 --> 02:16:44.590
get away with being like a,
you know,
they're all like millionaires.

2245
02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.610
Like John Kerry was a fucking God damn millionairey made somehow he's going to

2246
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:53.050
be a man of the people.
I don't fucking know.
I think,
I think,
uh,

2247
02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:54.610
I think at a lower level,

2248
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:59.290
I think you can actually affect change

2249
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:06.100
in political office.
But I think once you go past a certain level,

2250
02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.170
I think when even when you get to,
like if you,

2251
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:12.670
if you were like a senator of your state,
I don't,
I just don't feel

2252
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:16.930
that,
you know,
I dunno.

2253
02:17:17.590 --> 02:17:21.100
I think Obama said a bunch of shit that he was going to do,
got into office,

2254
02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:22.330
saw how shit works.

2255
02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:25.930
And right now he's trying to prevent getting shot in the fucking head.

2256
02:17:25.970 --> 02:17:29.020
And like everybody else who gets that job and you just,

2257
02:17:29.021 --> 02:17:32.500
you just do what they want you to do.
That's my,
that's my fucking 2 cents.

2258
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.520
But these fucking morons who will,

2259
02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:40.580
will come along and just sit there and blame the current president if they're of

2260
02:17:41.921 --> 02:17:45.940
course,
if they're not a member of their party,
it's just beyond me.

2261
02:17:46.810 --> 02:17:51.370
It's just fucking beyond me.
Like,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
But,
um,

2262
02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.180
but like I said,
I feel like I've,

2263
02:17:53.181 --> 02:17:55.390
I've talked about that enough on this fucking podcast.

2264
02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:58.270
People are still coming at me not understanding,

2265
02:17:58.330 --> 02:18:00.730
understanding what I'm saying about these,

2266
02:18:00.731 --> 02:18:05.080
these automated checkout machines at the grocery stores.
Once again,

2267
02:18:05.081 --> 02:18:10.081
this guy writes me like a five page fucking email talking about pulleys and

2268
02:18:11.891 --> 02:18:14.260
levers and inventions from back in time.

2269
02:18:14.261 --> 02:18:18.490
Like I'm against fucking,
uh,
um,

2270
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:24.070
progress
and he's comparing all of this shit.
I'm sitting there going,

2271
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:27.370
fuck airplanes.
We should be back riding horses.

2272
02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:31.810
What about all the Black Smith who got put out of business?

2273
02:18:31.810 --> 02:18:33.280
I'm not talking about that.

2274
02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:37.630
I don't want to ride a horse to a Gig and fucking Philly.

2275
02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:41.260
I don't want to do that.
I love airplanes.
I don't have a problem with that shit.

2276
02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:45.160
I'm not talking about progress.

2277
02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:49.480
I'm talking about something
that,

2278
02:18:49.481 --> 02:18:52.960
that makes me have to work for somebody for free.

2279
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.280
That's what I'm saying.
All right.

2280
02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:01.300
If they came out with those automated checkout machines and it got rid of

2281
02:19:01.301 --> 02:19:03.490
people's fucking jobs and,
but,

2282
02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:06.490
but I walked up there and it was like this thing that just,

2283
02:19:06.850 --> 02:19:11.850
just magically could tell me what I fucking owed without me having to do the

2284
02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:17.170
actual fucking job that the other person was just doing.

2285
02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.310
I wouldn't have a problem with it,

2286
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:22.180
but those fucking check that just all they did was turn the cash,

2287
02:19:22.181 --> 02:19:26.350
register around and now I have to do it and bag my own shit.

2288
02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:28.220
How the fuck that progress.

2289
02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:34.400
Somebody else was trying to tell me that it's all part of this movement of,

2290
02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:38.630
of it was really,
really a spiritual thing.
So that we'll have all these robots,

2291
02:19:38.631 --> 02:19:42.110
man,
and they'll be doing all these jobs and then life will just be all about,

2292
02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:47.360
you know,
just exploring life.
Cause you won't have to do a fucking job.

2293
02:19:47.361 --> 02:19:51.740
It's just like,
it's like,
dude,
you're completely ignoring

2294
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:58.670
sociopath's
all right.
Which is why like when,

2295
02:19:58.671 --> 02:20:00.650
when,
uh,
as much as I lean left,

2296
02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:05.600
I don't go all the way to the left because that's the big flaw in,
in,
in,

2297
02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:09.380
uh,
psycho level of,
of liberal thought

2298
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:13.970
is you completely ignore sociopath.

2299
02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:19.910
If everybody says nice,
everybody,
everything would be nice.
No,
it wouldn't.

2300
02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:24.710
They'd still be Charlie Manson.
It's still be those guys.

2301
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:27.680
They'd still be that guy who couldn't handle

2302
02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:32.180
not fucking having more than somebody else there couldn't,

2303
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:36.830
or the person who can't feel anything unless he's fucking poke in the eyes of a

2304
02:20:36.831 --> 02:20:39.970
squirrel out.
So I don't know.
My,
my,

2305
02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:43.430
my theory has always been that fucking hasn't always been that way.

2306
02:20:43.431 --> 02:20:45.770
Just just through the fucked up shit that I've read.

2307
02:20:45.771 --> 02:20:47.090
And God knows if it's even right,

2308
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:50.840
is that sociopath's basically run the fucking world.

2309
02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:52.813
You know,

2310
02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:58.390
they have the balls to just go out and take and they have the,

2311
02:20:59.210 --> 02:21:02.780
the,
I don't know if it's a chemical makeups,
psychological makeup,

2312
02:21:02.781 --> 02:21:06.320
whatever it is to feel absolutely no fucking guilt.

2313
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:11.000
They could give a fuck about other human beings.

2314
02:21:11.001 --> 02:21:14.660
They could give a fuck about nature.
They could give,
they could give a fuck.

2315
02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:20.230
They could give a fuck.
So
Jesus Christ,
I was,

2316
02:21:20.310 --> 02:21:21.800
I'm still on my God damn soapbox.

2317
02:21:21.801 --> 02:21:24.470
I didn't know what the fuck I was talking about.
Oh,
getting back to that shit.

2318
02:21:24.471 --> 02:21:28.130
So that is my,
I don't have a problem with ATS.
Okay.

2319
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:30.970
Htms I basically became my own fucking teller.

2320
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:34.130
But here's the big difference is I then had access to my money.

2321
02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:37.070
24 fucking seven you gave me a little something.

2322
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:38.810
I don't have a fucking problem with that,

2323
02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:43.910
but I walked into a grocery store and now I'm standing behind a fucking plumber

2324
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:48.110
trying to scan a week's worth of God damn groceries.
It's not quicker.

2325
02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:52.610
It's not.
It's,
it's sucks.
Fuck you.

2326
02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:57.710
I can't stop sending me fucking emails about pulleys and levers.

2327
02:21:58.250 --> 02:22:02.120
Jesus fucking Christ the advent of the wheel.

2328
02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:05.900
He fucking 30 fucking 40 PC.
Ah,

2329
02:22:06.890 --> 02:22:11.690
kill yourselves.
All right,

2330
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.660
my recorder cut out again.
And it wasn't the batteries this time.

2331
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.730
The memory was full on it or if you're of the spiritual ILC,

2332
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.600
I think it was the podcast.
God's telling me to stop being so fucking preachy.

2333
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.930
Um,
fuck the podcast gods.
All right.

2334
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:33.660
I'm not working for fucking free.
I'm not doing that.
Those God damn automated.
Uh,

2335
02:22:33.890 --> 02:22:37.410
um,
things there when you,
when you go into a parking garage,

2336
02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:41.040
now I've got to stand in two fucking lines.
I gotta stand behind somebody.

2337
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:44.070
They try to stuff their crinkled up dollar bill and trying to pay for their

2338
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:46.680
parking and then I got to dry and you know,

2339
02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:51.270
then I drive down waiting to leave and they don't get to just fucking leave

2340
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:53.050
cause they got to make sure they paid it.
They,

2341
02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:56.520
all he did was create an extra line and you eliminated the fucking parking

2342
02:22:56.521 --> 02:22:59.490
garage guy and now I've got to sit there and wait for the person to,

2343
02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:04.170
oh wait a fuck did they put the ticket that said I paid twice as God damn long.

2344
02:23:04.350 --> 02:23:07.620
That's what I'm talking about.
Pulley and lever guy.

2345
02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:09.090
That's what I'm talking about.

2346
02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:13.290
I'm talking about inventions that do not make my life easier.

2347
02:23:13.291 --> 02:23:15.540
They just make me work for fucking free.

2348
02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:20.700
And the time that I spend in the store is not any shorter and a lot of times

2349
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:24.900
it's a little bit fucking longer.
That's what I'm talking about,
sir.

2350
02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:29.700
All right,
here's a reference to last week I brought up chipped beef on toast.

2351
02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:33.330
Somebody from the military let me know that that's actually known as shit on a

2352
02:23:33.331 --> 02:23:37.740
shingle.
Um,
another here's another classic white trash meal that I had.

2353
02:23:37.741 --> 02:23:41.910
You guys ever have chicken Allah king that was like sort of chipped beef on

2354
02:23:41.911 --> 02:23:43.710
toast without the chips of beef.

2355
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:49.410
Another classic white trash meal that I had most white trash meal.

2356
02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:54.411
What it involves is some sort of sludge put on bread because all it is it when

2357
02:23:55.381 --> 02:23:57.090
it's real,
it's not about nutrition.

2358
02:23:57.090 --> 02:24:00.180
What it's about is taking away the pain of hunger.

2359
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:02.450
And I mean,

2360
02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:06.690
you could literally wallpaper a room using chicken,

2361
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:10.900
Allah king as your wallpaper paste.
That's how disgusting that Shit was.
Um,

2362
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:15.930
I don't even know what it was mixed with.
It was sort of this gray.

2363
02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:21.540
I'm not quite liquid,
not quite solid.

2364
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:27.540
It was like a great,
not a,
I got overly thick fucking gravy.

2365
02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:31.140
I mean it's one of those,
do you remember that when you took,
uh,

2366
02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.270
not to gross people out cause this is really,
you know,

2367
02:24:33.330 --> 02:24:36.240
getting kind of gross here and when you would open the can of chicken,

2368
02:24:36.241 --> 02:24:39.150
Allah King and you would turn it over,

2369
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:42.730
it would sort of slide out.
It would just be,
and before it,

2370
02:24:42.731 --> 02:24:44.630
it finally just dropped down on the play to be,

2371
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:49.440
and then there was like that,
that,

2372
02:24:49.441 --> 02:24:53.800
that sort of transparent gelatinous shit on the bottom of it,

2373
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:56.970
which just was fucking
disgusting.

2374
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:02.250
Yet somehow we weren't obese as kids.
It's because we were outside playing.

2375
02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:04.530
I think that gradually,
the only good thing with,
uh,

2376
02:25:04.531 --> 02:25:06.870
with those video games now where they are,
if you play soccer now,

2377
02:25:06.871 --> 02:25:10.530
you actually got to sit there,
swing your leg around and running and stuff.

2378
02:25:10.531 --> 02:25:15.510
I mean,
I guess,
uh,
I guess that's a good thing.
Right?
All right,
let's plow ahead.

2379
02:25:15.511 --> 02:25:17.730
Bill.
Uh,
he actually,
I got a thank you letter,

2380
02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:21.360
which is always nice because ever since I started talking about sports,

2381
02:25:21.361 --> 02:25:25.930
the level of fucking anger has really been ramped up on the,
uh,

2382
02:25:25.931 --> 02:25:30.310
on the emails to the point that I'm taking everything in a defensive way.

2383
02:25:30.311 --> 02:25:33.460
Like somebody actually sent me a hilarious email and I didn't even get it.

2384
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.040
They said,
Bill,
once you started talking,

2385
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:40.900
once you started defending bill O'Reilly last week on the podcast,
I shut,

2386
02:25:40.901 --> 02:25:45.901
I walked away from my recorder and I'm waiting for an apology and I was so like

2387
02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.680
read like five emails in a row of getting trashed that I wrote back.

2388
02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:56.470
Well,
why don't you go back and listen to what I said about it?

2389
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.830
I didn't even get the fucking joke,
the obvious joke.

2390
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.750
They got up and walked off the view.

2391
02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.720
So my apology to that person I just had written,

2392
02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:08.410
I'd read like fucking five in a row where I was getting trashed.

2393
02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:12.430
So I was kind of in that mindset.
So my fault.
Um,
look at that.

2394
02:26:12.431 --> 02:26:16.630
The comedian not getting a fucking joke.
All right,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

2395
02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:20.800
thanks.
Here's actually some from thanks y'all.
Bill,
what's up?
My name is,
uh,

2396
02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:24.550
I can't say your name.
I'm from Little Rock,
Arkansas.
I'm 23 years old.

2397
02:26:24.551 --> 02:26:27.920
Sort of a new listener to the podcast.
Been a longtime fan of yours.
Uh,

2398
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.830
but just a few months ago I discovered that you have a weekly podcasts.
Um,

2399
02:26:33.130 --> 02:26:37.000
anyways,
it's,
uh,
it's all great,
Yada Yada.
Anyways,
let's get to the point.

2400
02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:38.830
I think it was,
uh,

2401
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:43.860
maybe the second or third podcast of yours I had listened to and you were like

2402
02:26:44.201 --> 02:26:48.670
hung over,
I believe,
but you said something pretty God damn outstanding.

2403
02:26:48.670 --> 02:26:52.570
At least to me,
at least to me it was Jesus Christ.

2404
02:26:52.571 --> 02:26:55.060
Can you guys please use capital letters and periods?
You know,

2405
02:26:55.061 --> 02:26:58.780
I can't read out loud.
Um,
and he said it was,

2406
02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:00.200
this is the great advice you gave me.

2407
02:27:00.201 --> 02:27:04.660
He said it was the day when you discovered what a loser really is or it was the

2408
02:27:04.661 --> 02:27:06.550
definition of a loser.
Anyways,

2409
02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.980
you said the definition of a loser is someone who knows what they have to do,

2410
02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:16.600
but they always find some way to not do it.
And then he goes on to say,
man,

2411
02:27:16.601 --> 02:27:19.090
that shit was like so true to me because honestly,

2412
02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.830
I've been that guy for a while.
It's weird.
Anyways,

2413
02:27:22.831 --> 02:27:26.920
so it was around the same time that school was about to start up for the fall

2414
02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:30.340
semester.
So of course it's that time of year where my family is looming over me.

2415
02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:35.230
Like,
what the fuck?
When are you going to,
uh,
get your life together?

2416
02:27:35.530 --> 02:27:40.240
Anyways,
when you said that,
I was like,
Whoa,
okay,

2417
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:43.690
so fuck it.
I got up and went to the University of Arkansas,
Little Rock,

2418
02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:46.600
found out what I needed to get done to get my ass back in class.

2419
02:27:46.810 --> 02:27:49.980
To make an already long story short,
it went out,
got my GED,

2420
02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:54.370
took the Goddamn Act test.
I don't even know what that is,
but he said,

2421
02:27:54.371 --> 02:27:57.880
which I failed miserably apparently.

2422
02:27:57.881 --> 02:28:01.350
So the school told me I had to take the compassed test to get in.

2423
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.250
Took that thing,

2424
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.730
had to go through all the turmoil of finding my six year old high school

2425
02:28:06.731 --> 02:28:11.380
transcript,
which had been transferred to a billion places by then.

2426
02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:14.380
Um,
I wanted to say,
fuck,

2427
02:28:14.381 --> 02:28:17.140
it's so bad during all of that crap,

2428
02:28:17.141 --> 02:28:21.130
but I kept repeating that shit through my head of what the definition of a loser

2429
02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:21.980
in any ways.

2430
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:26.980
I'm halfway through my first semester as a freshman at the University of UAA l

2431
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:30.130
are whatever that is.
And I have,
uh,

2432
02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:33.200
and I got a 98% of my midterm and I can honestly say,

2433
02:28:33.201 --> 02:28:35.570
if it wasn't for me listening to your podcast,

2434
02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:40.880
I'd still be ignoring that voice in my head.
Uh,
it will,

2435
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:45.410
I'm sorry.
It's still ignoring voicemails from my bitch,
grandmother,
Jesus,
Dude.

2436
02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:49.700
Trying to pes pester me into going to school.
She just wants what's best for you.

2437
02:28:50.810 --> 02:28:53.800
Um,
so anyways,
I wanted to say thanks and all that type of shit and uh,

2438
02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:58.820
don't be scared to toward the south.
Me and my brother,
huge fucking fans and uh,

2439
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:03.230
and he's about as Hank Williams as it gets.
Well that's good.
Look at that.

2440
02:29:03.350 --> 02:29:05.210
See other than pissing people off,

2441
02:29:05.211 --> 02:29:08.090
every once in a while I helped somebody else will.
Congratulations Dude.

2442
02:29:08.091 --> 02:29:12.560
Stick with that ship.
Wear a condom.
That's the other one.

2443
02:29:13.250 --> 02:29:17.390
Respect yourself.
Where a God damn condom,
uh,

2444
02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:20.780
key and keep that fucker on until you know you're with the person you want to

2445
02:29:20.781 --> 02:29:21.230
marry.

2446
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:25.190
Then Merriam and be in a financial fucking position to bring somebody else into

2447
02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:28.850
the God damn world.
Have a game plan how you're going to marry him.

2448
02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.380
Have the condom on while you're having that conversation.
All right.

2449
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:38.330
Then have a fucking kid says the guy who's never had a fucking kid.

2450
02:29:38.331 --> 02:29:39.470
What the fuck do I know?
All right,

2451
02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.560
let's get to some questions and then some youtube videos and then I'm done.

2452
02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:47.030
Here we go.
Uh,
question.
Uh,
but,
but Buddha,

2453
02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:52.430
all right,
send some Monday morning podcast is rolling around.

2454
02:29:52.431 --> 02:29:55.010
I thought it'd be interesting if you rambled about this idea.

2455
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:59.480
Maybe the question is more,
when do women deserve to enjoy sex?

2456
02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:05.600
Um,
um,
always.
Okay,

2457
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:10.310
let's delve into this one recently.
It's their fucking sex life.

2458
02:30:10.311 --> 02:30:11.900
They can do whatever they want with it,
right?

2459
02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:16.070
I recently went to a mutually agreed upon dinner with a very motivated,

2460
02:30:16.071 --> 02:30:18.890
independent woman who expected me to pay for dinner.

2461
02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:25.040
What is a mutually agreed upon dinner?
Somebody had to ask somebody that dinner,

2462
02:30:25.041 --> 02:30:28.970
right?
I called bullshit and refused because as I told her,

2463
02:30:28.971 --> 02:30:31.370
I am not in the habit of paying for people's time,

2464
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:36.670
especially not people I know to be manipulative and who absolutely don't have

2465
02:30:36.951 --> 02:30:41.540
sex before marriage.
All right?
To right off the bat,

2466
02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:46.760
if you don't pay for people's time,
why would you go on sort of,

2467
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:49.370
not a date,
but sort of a date with somebody that you know,

2468
02:30:49.371 --> 02:30:54.290
manipulates people and who doesn't have sex before marriage?
Uh,

2469
02:30:54.650 --> 02:30:59.000
is this so you could have this argument with this person?
I mean,

2470
02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:03.080
you sound like an intelligent guy.
You know where the fuck this is going?

2471
02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:06.410
Uh,
whatever.
I'll read the rest of this,

2472
02:31:06.411 --> 02:31:10.520
but this is one of these things he'd got to get out of this Rut.

2473
02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:15.890
This does.
There's not plenty of good women out there the same way.

2474
02:31:15.891 --> 02:31:17.990
There's not plenty of good men out there.
You've got to find them,

2475
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:23.290
but you can't dating the same person that's going to keep reinforcing,

2476
02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:28.790
uh,
you thoughts or else you're going to end up like make,

2477
02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:34.080
which I'm not right now because I finally found someone who was awesome but uh,

2478
02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:35.363
you know,

2479
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:41.540
half the shit that I call women on or is the shit that I see on TV and residual

2480
02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:46.740
baggage that I have from dating the same fucking psycho from year,

2481
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:49.310
year after year.
Ah,
Jesus Christ,
I'm really on my soapbox.

2482
02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:50.700
I'm just shut the fuck up and read the rest of us.

2483
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.230
But more importantly I said what this woman failed to understand was how much

2484
02:31:55.290 --> 02:31:59.760
she lowered herself and is seen by saying I need a man to pay for my meals,

2485
02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:03.240
which is all the same time bullshit.

2486
02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:06.330
The whole idea of the dating dynamic is really warped.

2487
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:11.010
What are you paying for if not sex you are paying for,
you are paying for sex.

2488
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:14.130
What if you are paying for sex?
And I think women,

2489
02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:18.630
the woman forfeits her rights to have fun in bed.

2490
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.610
Oh I see what you're saying.

2491
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:22.980
Cause you're really just paying for a service at that point.

2492
02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:28.220
And you know what you are making points because there are women who will go out

2493
02:32:28.231 --> 02:32:32.640
with a guy on a Friday night because they're kind of broke and they're hungry.

2494
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:34.163
You know,

2495
02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:39.180
you can't say that shit on TV because it's considered a misogynistic.

2496
02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:42.750
But you know,
if you're really fair about it,

2497
02:32:42.751 --> 02:32:46.650
women are just like guys that they get the,
if you let them get away with it,

2498
02:32:46.651 --> 02:32:47.484
they will.

2499
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:51.180
And you sound like you're smart enough so you shouldn't be in this situation.

2500
02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:56.490
Um,
any continues and the whole,
whoever does the accent accent,

2501
02:32:56.491 --> 02:33:01.470
whoever does the ax asking pays for the meal bit is really getting tired because

2502
02:33:01.471 --> 02:33:05.580
the fact is women are pussies and they won't ask men out.
Yeah.

2503
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:08.730
And there's also the other thing that a lot of guys get a little nervous if

2504
02:33:08.731 --> 02:33:11.220
women are being really forward and they're like,
Jesus Christ,

2505
02:33:11.221 --> 02:33:15.990
if she's fucking asking me out,
how many Cox is,
this bitch sucked.
Oh,

2506
02:33:16.650 --> 02:33:20.010
um,
but why are so many women in this post feminist world?

2507
02:33:20.530 --> 02:33:23.880
Why are so many women in this post feminist world?
Sorry,

2508
02:33:23.881 --> 02:33:28.881
guys who have equal equal earning power as men and who even have an overt

2509
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:33.480
advantage in the marketplace these days.
Parentheses,

2510
02:33:33.481 --> 02:33:35.100
if they have a pretty face,

2511
02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:41.700
seem to insist on demeaning themselves to you.
You got a lot of issues here,
man.

2512
02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:46.980
Uh,
they have an overt advantage in the mark.
They're still making less,

2513
02:33:46.981 --> 02:33:47.540
aren't they?

2514
02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:50.400
At least that's what they're always fucking running their yaps about.

2515
02:33:51.690 --> 02:33:56.070
If they're good looking,
you know,
something that is a hell of a card to play.

2516
02:33:56.071 --> 02:34:00.060
If you're a hot chick,
how do you not get fucking hired?
You know what I mean?

2517
02:34:00.390 --> 02:34:03.390
Even if you are a fucking Bimbo,
you can go,
oh my God,

2518
02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:07.740
I love the carpet.
Can I have some money to be here?

2519
02:34:08.730 --> 02:34:12.710
I swear to God,
I'm always going to dress hot and pretend I like Ya.
Um,

2520
02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.190
why don't women so often refuse to step up to the plate and myth that they want

2521
02:34:16.191 --> 02:34:19.150
to fuck and put in their equal share

2522
02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:22.750
now that they have equal rights,

2523
02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:26.890
maybe there would be more satisfied couples in the world if women would learn to

2524
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:30.760
do this.
Uh,
dude,
you sound like me.

2525
02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:31.930
Like 10 years ago.

2526
02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:36.100
It sure seems to me that women are getting away with murder these days.

2527
02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:37.180
They cling to old school.

2528
02:34:37.181 --> 02:34:40.870
The idea is about paying for them to live while making a better living than the

2529
02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:45.730
guy they're leeching off of and expected to be pleasured wildly in bed.

2530
02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:50.980
How does that add up?
You can see it in newer poor now.

2531
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:55.420
Wow,
dude,
you really,
you're really,

2532
02:34:55.450 --> 02:34:57.960
you're really connecting some fucking dots here that,

2533
02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:00.040
where do you see this in porn?

2534
02:35:00.041 --> 02:35:03.760
He said more and more time is being spent actually pleasuring the woman,

2535
02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.380
Eh,
Jesus.
Really in all those fucking boot,

2536
02:35:07.381 --> 02:35:11.410
cocky facial dude.
I really,

2537
02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.240
out of all the examples you're going to say that,

2538
02:35:15.241 --> 02:35:19.900
that women are getting pleasured more important.
Uh,
if they are,

2539
02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:24.400
it's probably about fucking time.
You know,
how are they getting pleasured more?

2540
02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:24.761
They're,

2541
02:35:24.761 --> 02:35:29.761
they're not getting fucking bent over on a subway platform and getting Bang Gang

2542
02:35:29.890 --> 02:35:34.390
Bang.
My fucking 12 guys.
It's just one homeless dude doing it.
You know?

2543
02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:38.050
Come on dude.
Porn porn is horrific.

2544
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:44.470
You know,
occasionally where to women when in porn.
I think those,

2545
02:35:44.471 --> 02:35:48.910
those,
uh,
those,
those strip ones where they just do the strip tease,
that one,

2546
02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:51.220
I think they win because there's no guy in it.

2547
02:35:52.390 --> 02:35:56.170
They just sort of turn the camera on this sort of in control of the whole thing.

2548
02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:59.410
Yet you also got to ask yourself,
why are they doing that?

2549
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:04.270
What the fuck happened to them as a kid,
dad,
uh,
you know,

2550
02:36:04.271 --> 02:36:07.420
eventually made them think that this is the way to make a living in the world.

2551
02:36:08.140 --> 02:36:10.630
You know,
like that like this is going to lead to happiness.

2552
02:36:10.631 --> 02:36:15.400
Like you can actually do this film yourself and actually go out and find a

2553
02:36:15.401 --> 02:36:18.660
decent husband does are a person's,
it's a fucking settled down with someday.

2554
02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:22.060
Like they're going to be able to look past the fact that you were finger blast

2555
02:36:22.061 --> 02:36:24.520
and yourself on the Goddamn Internet.

2556
02:36:24.521 --> 02:36:26.990
That really sort of limits the amount of guys that,
I don't know.

2557
02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:32.060
I really come from the school that most of those people were fucking abused as

2558
02:36:32.591 --> 02:36:36.700
kids.
I really do.
I really do.
It doesn't stop me from watching it.

2559
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:41.350
Um,
so anyways,
this is what I would say to you.

2560
02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:44.980
I know you're probably fucking mad at me because you wanted me to fucking vent

2561
02:36:44.981 --> 02:36:49.900
your frustrations,
but uh,
I'm trying to help you out here,
dude.

2562
02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.050
Why would you,
there's no fucking,
you know,

2563
02:36:53.051 --> 02:36:58.000
something that Goddamned Jersey shore,
right?
The fucking,

2564
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.050
the Nice Guy,
the Nice Guy,
Vinny.
Oh,
that dude,
right,

2565
02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:06.130
right.
It's not like a moron here.
He went out in,
uh,

2566
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:08.430
he met some girl down there and the whole time I guess she was,

2567
02:37:08.431 --> 02:37:12.940
she's been playing the guy like she was supposed to meet him at eight calls up

2568
02:37:12.941 --> 02:37:16.700
at eight 15.
She says she's just getting ready.
And then when he's,

2569
02:37:16.701 --> 02:37:20.360
when he's out to dinner with her,
she said something to the effect of like,

2570
02:37:20.361 --> 02:37:24.770
so will you get an upset waiting for me?
Did you think I wasn't going to show up?

2571
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:29.840
And it's like right there,
right there,
right there.
You check,
please.

2572
02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:35.300
It's over.
You just fucking walk away.
Why would you wait?

2573
02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:37.620
The people who manipulate our,

2574
02:37:37.621 --> 02:37:42.621
our are honestly some of the biggest pieces of shit on the fucking planet.

2575
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:45.080
There's no way you want to hit your wagon to that.

2576
02:37:45.081 --> 02:37:48.260
Even for one fucking night and all it's gonna do

2577
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:55.100
a male of females.
It's just going to make you hate the opposite sex more.

2578
02:37:55.550 --> 02:38:00.440
You're,
you're dating cunts,
you're going on date with cons,
male or female.

2579
02:38:00.441 --> 02:38:02.420
You this,
why would you,

2580
02:38:02.421 --> 02:38:05.750
if you don't want to pay for somebody else's time,

2581
02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.470
all right?
That's because your time is valuable.

2582
02:38:09.471 --> 02:38:14.471
Why would you waste your time going out on a date with someone that you knew was

2583
02:38:14.631 --> 02:38:18.560
manipulative word?
I can't say manipulative,

2584
02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:23.060
manipulative,
manipulative.
That kind of sound right?

2585
02:38:23.390 --> 02:38:27.710
That's like learning a new drum.
Ruderman right?
You know,
just go full speed.

2586
02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.790
You've got to go right,
left,
right,
right,
left,
right,
left,
right,

2587
02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:37.870
right,
left,
right,
right,
left,
right,
left,
left us.
Only makes sense to drummers.
Um,

2588
02:38:37.871 --> 02:38:39.020
so that,
that's my advice dude.

2589
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:42.980
Cause I could really just sit here and do what the 9 million fucking rant on

2590
02:38:42.981 --> 02:38:46.670
women or I could actually maybe try to fucking help you avoid some of the

2591
02:38:46.671 --> 02:38:49.490
pitfalls that I,
that I went through that there's no fucking reason.

2592
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:51.320
The second male or female.

2593
02:38:51.321 --> 02:38:54.710
The second you figure out that you're with someone who's a cunt or you get that

2594
02:38:54.711 --> 02:38:58.790
feeling that the person I'm with is a cont.
Uh,
pay attention to that feeling.

2595
02:38:59.290 --> 02:39:02.060
All right.
When someone shows you who they are,

2596
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:06.770
believe them go to a bad and if they're a client,
walk away.
All right,
real quick,

2597
02:39:06.771 --> 02:39:09.020
because this podcast is really long.
Uh,

2598
02:39:09.021 --> 02:39:12.910
I only have one youtube video of the week,
but this is almost like youtube video,

2599
02:39:12.930 --> 02:39:16.730
the week slash daily show moment of Zen.
Um,

2600
02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:21.530
go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and check this video out.
It says,
uh,

2601
02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:22.041
this is actually,

2602
02:39:22.041 --> 02:39:27.041
I found it on break.com and it's called dot chick make same dumb face in every

2603
02:39:28.341 --> 02:39:32.720
pick.
It's Kinda going back to that duck face.
It's,
it's actually,

2604
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:34.070
it starts off funny.

2605
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:38.780
Then it starts to get boring because it's so long.

2606
02:39:38.781 --> 02:39:42.680
And then it becomes like,
I dunno,

2607
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:47.090
it's like astounding the amount of pictures that this woman took with the exact

2608
02:39:47.091 --> 02:39:50.300
same stupid fucking look in her face.
All right,
underrated.

2609
02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:51.230
Overrated for this week.

2610
02:39:51.231 --> 02:39:55.130
And then I'm out a overrated La love for your fellow man.

2611
02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:59.270
I'm tired of being made to feel guilty because I don't care about people whose

2612
02:39:59.271 --> 02:40:04.100
lives are not any part of mine.
Mostly because no one does.
No.

2613
02:40:04.101 --> 02:40:08.690
See because no one does and you're a hypocrite if you say you do.

2614
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:13.130
We aren't designed to care about everyone.
If we,
if we were,

2615
02:40:13.170 --> 02:40:17.250
then we would have survived.
If you think about it,

2616
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:20.940
I don't know what that means.
Resources or,
oh,
he's explaining it.

2617
02:40:20.941 --> 02:40:25.890
Resources are limited.
There's no shame in self interest.
Take care of your own.

2618
02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:30.570
It's a noble and honest outlook.
All right.

2619
02:40:30.810 --> 02:40:35.130
Underrated contest where you win something that isn't actually a prize.

2620
02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:39.510
I opened my flavored water and it said I won something.

2621
02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.770
I answered the code and the site to see what I won and hear what it is and I

2622
02:40:43.771 --> 02:40:47.880
quote by one and I'm not going to say the name of the water because they pissed

2623
02:40:47.881 --> 02:40:52.860
me off by one of these fucking waters and get one free.
Is that a prize?

2624
02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:56.310
No,
I think that's a fucking coupon.
You're 100% right.

2625
02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:00.210
CanNot agree with you more sir or ma'am,
whoever wrote this,
um,

2626
02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:04.140
overrated Cialis disclaimer on the commercial.

2627
02:41:04.141 --> 02:41:07.200
Do not drink alcohol in excess with Cialis.

2628
02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:12.410
The fact that they said it means someone out there needs both boner pills and

2629
02:41:13.291 --> 02:41:16.800
excessive amounts of alcohol in order to manifest the ability.

2630
02:41:16.810 --> 02:41:19.350
That ability to fuck whoever they're with.

2631
02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.210
Might be time to try a paper bag maybe.
Um,
all right.

2632
02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:27.400
Underrated to blade razors.
Surf,

2633
02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:31.410
I already mentioned this on the podcast,
so God bless you for backing me up.

2634
02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:34.200
Is it so hard to perfect the design of a shaving razor?

2635
02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.970
Is it every year they come up with a new design and how shocking they added

2636
02:41:38.971 --> 02:41:42.330
another blade.
Stop this bullshit marketing nonsense.

2637
02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:46.380
I hope no one falls for this shit to blades is all you need to.

2638
02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:49.530
Blades was the greatest one ever.
One digged up.

2639
02:41:49.531 --> 02:41:52.470
Your phase two was the greatest and ever since they are three or more,

2640
02:41:52.471 --> 02:41:54.630
you can't get those whiskers under your fucking nose.

2641
02:41:54.631 --> 02:41:57.690
It's a pain in the goddamn ass and it's not any closer.

2642
02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.820
I don't give a shit how many blades they have.
You know,

2643
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.250
it's really like an unfair fight.

2644
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:09.510
Like how many guys do you have to have Holden the fucking whiskers arms behind

2645
02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:12.390
his back and you come up and fucking start working him over.

2646
02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:15.490
Two blades is enough.
One holds the whisker,

2647
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:19.560
the other guy takes out his fucking knees.
All right.
Overrated.
Twitter.

2648
02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:23.100
A number of people are apparently disappointed to find out that celebrities have

2649
02:42:23.101 --> 02:42:28.020
normal lives in that they waste time and talk about stupid shit like everyone

2650
02:42:28.021 --> 02:42:28.530
else.

2651
02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:33.530
They must have thought they were riding around on the back of a Griffin hurling

2652
02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:39.210
lightening with a magic hammer all day,
underrated sleep,
sex.

2653
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:41.040
This is where this person becomes creepy.

2654
02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:44.220
And obviously I feel this is a dude at this point.
Uh,

2655
02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:48.090
this is the ultimate passive aggressive move to when you can't get any,

2656
02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:52.860
just wait until they're falling asleep.
Not only will they not stop you,

2657
02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:57.780
but they will,
but they tend to be much less critical of your performance.

2658
02:42:59.050 --> 02:43:04.050
Remember earlier when I was talking about sociopath running the fucking world,

2659
02:43:04.171 --> 02:43:06.900
this guy said overrated.
Um,

2660
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:10.380
love for your fellow man or whatever the fuck the initial one was.

2661
02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:14.480
I remember the hell is it over?
Yeah.
Love for your fellow man.

2662
02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:19.070
And now he's talking about how sleep sex,
which really seems like a form of rape,

2663
02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.500
sort of rape life,
sort of a light,
uh,

2664
02:43:25.310 --> 02:43:29.490
sexual assault.
Okay.
That,
that one's just creepy.

2665
02:43:29.491 --> 02:43:33.460
Surf Ed.
And with that,
I think I'm done reading underrated,

2666
02:43:33.461 --> 02:43:37.570
overrated to at this point.
I don't want to see what the next two one go.

2667
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:42.180
The next,
the next two ones go the next to go.
Ah,
who gives a fuck?

2668
02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:46.050
Anyways,
that's a podcast for this week.
God bless all the police come down.

2669
02:43:46.170 --> 02:43:49.110
I'm doing a benefit in Saint Louis.
Support the cause.

2670
02:43:49.111 --> 02:43:54.050
I have all the information up on my website and um,
if not,

2671
02:43:54.051 --> 02:43:56.060
if you just want to see me because of that show,

2672
02:43:56.061 --> 02:43:59.630
I think I've just doing 1520 minutes.
But if you want to see the full on me,

2673
02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.480
come to the Saint Louis funny bone this Saturday night,

2674
02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:09.740
which is Saturday,
October 30th the night before Halloween.

2675
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:14.310
Oh,
come on down and doing two shows at the funny bone.
Seven 30 and 10 o'clock.

2676
02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:18.750
I've got my brand new hour of material.
I'll have my brand new DVD.

2677
02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:22.710
I'll have a brand new fucking shirt on.
Everything's going to be brand new.

2678
02:44:22.711 --> 02:44:25.370
Come on down.
All right,
that's it.
God bless all of you.
Have a great [inaudible]

2679
02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:01.433
<v 8>dad.</v>

2680
02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.320
I don't take it down.

2681
02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:16.870
She's in [inaudible] case.
Shoot me.

2682
02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:24.610
She Cs and you dare to try.

2683
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:35.550
I said,
if someone's read not,
don't shoot your little woman,

2684
02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:42.810
my daughter pass shot gun.
It just won't fire.
