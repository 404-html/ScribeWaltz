00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.590
Hey,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.933
<v 2>Aw.</v>

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.570
<v 1>Specifically the ladies.</v>

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm checking in on the ladies to make sure that you feel okay,

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.540
that you feel like you're in a safe space to listen to this podcast.

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.220
Not because I care,
because I want to start trending on Twitter.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.693
<v 0>MMM.</v>

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.770
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.000
Jesus Christ with the award shows in the fucking the same speech given every

12
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.390
award show always called brave as if somebody's going to heckle it,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600
<v 2>you know,
like something.
Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.590
<v 1>Nobody's going to say that.
We're all gonna sit there and be like,
wow.</v>

15
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:56.260
That thing that was already said was just said again,

16
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.680
but this time it was said even better.
Hey,

17
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:01.870
keeps saying the thing you already said.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560
<v 3>I want to go out there and say the thing that was already fed.</v>

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
I want to be that person.
I wouldn't be brave.

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.690
<v 1>You want to be brave.
You go the other way.
And I said,</v>

21
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.870
I know there's a lot of guys out there took the dicks out at work,

22
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.580
but what about these gold digging whores?

23
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.670
Am I right fellas that now that would be brave.

24
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.590
Be Brave.
Okay,
good.
I think to see you fucking walk out of that one.

25
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.440
I'm saying the thing that's been said that everybody gets,

26
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.000
once again,

27
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.050
we'll be right back with the saying the thing that's always said it everything

28
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:45.820
now award show after these messages.
You know,
people,
while we were away,

29
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:49.600
something else was said that was already said that needed to be said again in

30
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.050
case anybody didn't hear it the first 19,000 times it was said,

31
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.370
um,
you know,
and like I swear to God and this is all it does,

32
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:00.490
is it just causes of copycat fucking behavior.

33
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.050
Same thing with these mass shootings,
you know,

34
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.140
which is why they shouldn't report on him because then everybody wants to do it.

35
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:09.370
Right?
Fucking some chick makes a porn and becomes fucking super famous.

36
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:13.150
Now every broad out there starts fucking dropping their panties.
I looked it up.

37
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.270
It happens.
Right?
So now fucking Pete is getting into it.

38
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.250
They're trying to say,
you can't say beat a dead horse.

39
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.630
And then they came up with all this dumb shit.
There's no fucking way that this,

40
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.360
this can't be coming from Peter.
Like they said,
when it's raining out,

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.290
don't say it's raining cats and dogs that promotes violence towards,
it's just,

42
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.860
you know,
can you say it's a frog strangler?

43
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.983
<v 0>MMM.</v>

44
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.230
<v 1>You can't listen to Christmas music.</v>

45
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.163
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

46
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.530
<v 1>Are they going to go through all of the catalog now?
That song I really cared.</v>

47
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:53.210
Stay cause baby,
it's cold outside.

48
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:58.211
I really can't stay was saying that that promoted some sorta rape or then don't

49
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.960
it under the apple tree.
What?
Anyone else?

50
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.450
What me that's controlling.

51
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.140
She can sit under whatever apple tree she wants to.

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.660
I think the meeting was that was,
hey,

53
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.340
don't go and fucking suck some other Dick while I'm off fighting war.
You know,

54
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.880
fight the war here.
Defending the country,
you know?
But you know,

55
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.030
you couldn't say that back then,
right baby?

56
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.860
It's cold out or does it go well I really can't stay baby.
It's cold outside.

57
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.650
I got to go away,
baby.
It's cold outside.

58
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.720
This evening has been been opened that you drop in.
So great.

59
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.480
This is such a cute fucking saga.

60
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.060
There's a bunch of fucking songs out there that you could just turn into some

61
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:45.260
shit.
Right.
Um,
anyways,
needless to say,

62
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:47.290
that's my new walk on music when I do a standup.

63
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.173
<v 0>Sure.</v>

64
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.820
<v 1>You know what's funny?
I don't even like that song.
It's,</v>

65
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.060
it's a fucking Corny Goddamn song.
I don't even fucking like it,

66
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:02.720
but I'm such a cunt,
you know?
Actually to be honest with you,

67
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:07.340
I think there needs to be some sort of a turning down the spigot on this fucking

68
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:12.341
insanity because it's literally 8% of the population is acting like they're

69
00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:15.950
speaking for or evidently babysitting the fucking rest of us.

70
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:20.000
But like I think I could listen to that song and not rape anybody.

71
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.370
I've done it for 50 years.

72
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm going to go out on a limb and think I'm going to be okay.
You know,

73
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:29.270
this goes like back to when they thought listening to Judas priest and all of

74
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:34.090
that Shit,
you know,
made you go out and fucking kill yourself and do all that,

75
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:37.880
which we all know is,
is it really comes down to just bad parenting.

76
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.500
Um,
it is a thing I know most women don't give a fuck about,
you know,

77
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.300
if you put on that song,
you know what I mean?
I know.
Okay.
I Dunno.

78
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.830
Was it brave to do what I just did?
That's what you do.

79
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.890
You're going in an award show,
you do a fucking tap dance.

80
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.170
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.520
<v 1>Two,
I really can't stay.</v>

82
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.040
And then you come out and you talk about gold digging horse.

83
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.863
<v 0>MMM.</v>

84
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.340
<v 1>You know,
and then you try to like,
you,
you go for the,</v>

85
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.730
the anti that crowd.
I bet that could still fill in arena.

86
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.090
Right?
I'm sorry,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.

87
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.400
<v 0>Um,
fucking Peta.</v>

88
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.550
<v 1>I love animals too.
Do you,</v>

89
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.980
do you know how much of a dose you have to be for somebody,

90
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.350
be behind your cause and also to be sitting there going,

91
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.760
the ace people are fucking assholes.

92
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.853
<v 0>MMM.</v>

93
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.270
<v 1>I think I just describe myself as a person because my wife loves me,</v>

94
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.940
but she really seems to side with other people a lot of the times,

95
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.630
<v 0>you know?
Um,</v>

96
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.850
<v 1>anyway,
so let's,
let's,
let's,
let's plow ahead here into the podcast,</v>

97
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.990
into the podcast.

98
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.220
I want to thank everybody on the Seth Meyers show for having me on.

99
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.830
I had a great time promoting,
uh,

100
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.890
so he's a three of f is for family as far as I can tell from the tweets.

101
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.250
It seems to be going really well.
People seems to be really enjoying,

102
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.650
but why wouldn't they?
We already have a great cast.

103
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.450
We already have a bunch of murderers in the writers' room and we added Vince

104
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.540
Vaughn.
That's right.
Spoiler alert.

105
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.760
Listen closely Vince font.

106
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.840
You'll hear his voice or the character that he's doing on season three.

107
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.090
And I'm really excited that people are enjoying it.

108
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.320
And I just want to say right now to all the brave people out there that are

109
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.440
fighting out there to try and get Netflix.

110
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.760
I just want to you to know that your voice is heard.
It's heard by me,

111
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.870
and that there's a bunch of people out there that love you when you try to sign

112
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.140
on and just,
you know,
try to stay positive.

113
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.270
Um,
I flew back from New York,
uh,

114
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.310
yesterday and,
um,
I was one of those,

115
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:50.311
one of the rare times of the year where you land over the water on at lax.

116
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.610
So usually,
you know,
usually the winds coming in off the water,

117
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:57.370
so you take off and land into the wind.
But this is the time we actually,

118
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:01.470
we came around,
landed,
it was pretty fucking cool.
Um,

119
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.000
except was too cloudy for me to see the approach.
You know,

120
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.330
I'm a fucking nerd when it comes to that stuff.
But anyways,

121
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:11.260
when I was on the plane,
I actually watched a premiere league soccer game.

122
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.930
I watched,
I watched a arsenal versus man United and I gotta Tell Ya,

123
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.900
I really fucking enjoyed the game.
You know,
and I'm starting to understand it.

124
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.630
I saw now I understand why

125
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.720
one thing was off site.

126
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.070
Do you know when they all line up and they cover their junk and somebody tries

127
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:33.020
to fucking bend it like Beckham around them?

128
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:34.340
You don't like that's stupid ass movie.

129
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:38.150
I never fucking saw they were saying that this,
they scored a goal on that.

130
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.650
Maybe they were off site.
It's basically any party,
a body that could score a goal

131
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.960
if it's behind that line on the offensive.
If you're an offensive player.

132
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.410
So this guy went to go make a move and as you know you lead with your head when

133
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.760
you start to run,
unless,
I dunno,

134
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.930
you're doing that dance underneath the stick there.
Right.
Um,

135
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.330
so I guess he was off site.
So I guess I understand that

136
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.040
it really takes away a lot of the excitement he should be able to take off a

137
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.950
little bit.
Well I get it cause they have to stand there and try to block it.

138
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.650
And then if the offensive players,
you know,
they don't give a shit,

139
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.350
they want that it's going to take off.
Okay,
I get it.
Um,

140
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.070
I gotta tell you some bad,
bad,

141
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.030
bad fucking defense and that God damn game be time,
Arsenal score.

142
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:25.000
Then they turn around,
they just fucking gave up another one,

143
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.510
that long fucking pass.
I don't know any of the terminology,

144
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.250
but I just know that that that shouldn't happen.

145
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.100
Sorry lolly gag and going after the ball and that little cunt came running up

146
00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:39.690
and kicked it in with his fucking toe hair.
That shouldn't happen.
Um,

147
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.670
but it was a,
it was a great game and um,

148
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.000
<v 4>okay.</v>

149
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.310
<v 1>I Dunno,
I haven't been drinking.
It just made me want to booze.</v>

150
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.590
There's something about watching the premier league game at night.

151
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.490
It's always fucking raining.
It's always like misty.
It just looks like,
yeah,

152
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:57.030
I want to fucking start the fire and drink like,
you know,
seven or eight pints.

153
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.610
Why wouldn't yet the cell about saying a pint?

154
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.730
You feel like you're a fucking world traveler and you don't feel like you're a

155
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.980
fucking alcoholic.
Speaking of which,

156
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.020
I actually watched this thing on youtube called what kind of drink or am I that

157
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.840
I'll be discussing with Joe to Rosa on uninformed.

158
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.910
The next episode I might Patrion page and um,

159
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.330
I went and I looked up those alkie questions.

160
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.900
<v 4>Okay.</v>

161
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.750
<v 1>Because this guy sounded like me.
Like,
you know,
I can stop when I want to.</v>

162
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:28.870
I don't wake up shaking and have to drink fucking booze.
I'm not an alcoholic.

163
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.490
What kind of drink or am I okay.
Are,
and I answered the questions dude.
All right.

164
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.210
Are you an El Co Hall?
Lik All right,

165
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.950
here we go.
Here we go.
Drug addiction treatment.

166
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.270
Are you high functioning?
Uh,
wait,
I got to see.
Oh,
quiz,

167
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.490
alcohol problems.
Screening,
quiz.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
If I,
okay,

168
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.300
question one.
Okay.
Do you sometimes drink more than you planned to drink?

169
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.360
Oh,
I don't have a plan other than I'm going out.

170
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.270
Let's see if I drink it all.
I have only one or two before dinner.
Okay.

171
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.800
I hope any joke I tell tonight we'll be funnier than that line.
No,
that's not me.

172
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.090
I will occasionally skip or delay meals to have a couple more drinks.

173
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.710
Uh,

174
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.710
well I've drank for a period where I didn't realize when I drink until I'm

175
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:28.430
hungry,
you know,
and then I get a slice at the end of the night.
Wait,

176
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.090
sometimes a few with the boys slash girls turns into an entire evening.

177
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.320
Well,
I never just go out for a few.
I go out with the specific.

178
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:39.700
<v 4>Okay.</v>

179
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.533
<v 1>MMM.</v>

180
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.380
<v 4>Okay.</v>

181
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.340
<v 1>I go out to get hammered.
I've been on benders that lasted for days.</v>

182
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.920
No,
I haven't done that.
I mean,
I my,

183
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.950
unless you call consecutive nights of drinking,
but I mean,
I sober up and go,

184
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.820
what am I doing?
And then the next night I have another one.
All right.

185
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.130
Do you sometimes drink more than you planned to drink?

186
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.380
If it'll occasional skip sometimes.

187
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.710
I guess the closest one was would be the third one,

188
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:09.711
c sometimes a few with the boys slash girls turns into an entirely new thing.

189
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.870
Yeah,
that's fair.
All right,
let's check that.

190
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.150
<v 4>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.160
<v 1>Yeah.
At the end of this quiz,</v>

192
00:11:15.161 --> 00:11:16.900
someone's trying to make money off of me so you know,

193
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:19.360
I'm going to flunk it and I need their help.
All right.

194
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:22.480
Have you ever tried to quit drinking and were unsuccessful?

195
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.090
I don't want to quit.
I enjoy an occasional drink.
I thought about quitting,

196
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:30.910
but I've just gotten around,
but I haven't got around to it.

197
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.270
I've tried to control my drinking,
but it hasn't worked for very long.

198
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.710
I've tried to quit drinking many times.
Uh,
I go on sabbaticals.
I like,

199
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:39.940
I need to shut it down.

200
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.770
<v 4>Okay.</v>

201
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.650
<v 1>And I've been able to do that,
but then I just get bored.</v>

202
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.740
I just keep pouring and I,
you know,
like,

203
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.090
what am I never going to have another drink?

204
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.940
<v 4>Okay.</v>

205
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.510
<v 1>So I guess I've tried to,
my drinking and it hasn't worked for very long.
Well,</v>

206
00:11:55.511 --> 00:12:00.040
I've gone a year.
All right.
How much time do you spend each week drinking?
Oh,

207
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.840
Jesus Christ.
I don't know.
I only drink on special occasions or no,
no,

208
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:08.410
no.
I only drink on weekend and I drank at least three nights a week.

209
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.220
Now we're getting there.
I drank almost daily.
As soon as I get off work.
Ding,

210
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:16.810
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
All right.
Do you have an,

211
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.370
do you ever get an urge to drink or a craving for alcohol?
Yes.

212
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.720
Okay.
No,
I can take it or leave it.
Jesus Christ.

213
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.050
Somebody who works at a library.
All right.

214
00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:34.490
Sometimes if I've gone a few days without a drink,
I'll get a desire to drink.

215
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:37.910
Yes.
If I skip a day drinking,
I'll have an urge to drink the next day.
No,

216
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.340
I can't wait until happy hour every day.
I'd say to,
uh,

217
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.200
the second one.
Number five.
Oh,
Billy booze hound.

218
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:50.920
He's almost halfway there.
Right.
How many fucking questions are there?
11.

219
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.620
Do you have to get board taking multiple choice questions now?
Right.

220
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.410
Do you often miss work or school or obligations that,
no,

221
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.640
I don't ever remember.
Miss.
No.
I've never,
I've never,

222
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:04.970
<v 4>yeah.</v>

223
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.350
<v 1>No.
No,
never.
I'm a Prof.
I wait till after the work's done.</v>

224
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.060
Uh,
has your drinking negatively affected your social

225
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:14.940
<v 4>okay,</v>

226
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.320
<v 1>or family relationships?
No,
I rarely drink enough to become intoxicated.</v>

227
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:22.020
Now sometimes I haven't embarrassed myself by drinking.
Yes.

228
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.750
I prefer to hang out with people would pick as much as I do.
Yes.
To that.

229
00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:30.980
I have lost friends relationship?
No,
it's somewhere between B and C in,
in

230
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.060
sometimes I haven't barest myself while drinking and I also prefer to hang out

231
00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:39.300
with people who drink as much as I do.
Um,

232
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.140
so I guess I picked the worst of the two.
That's only fair.

233
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.380
Have you given up hobbies or activities you used to enjoy now?

234
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.450
Alcohol doesn't interfere with my life.
No it doesn't.

235
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.370
I think I'm high functioning.

236
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.940
Does your drinking ever put you in a dangerous situation?

237
00:13:55.941 --> 00:13:59.300
When I drink it's only at home.
Uh,
that's not true.

238
00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:03.410
I have had a couple of drinks at lunch.
No return to work.
I've drank,

239
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.390
I have drinking.
I've driven after drinking before,
but I was not really drunk,

240
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.660
bad back in the day before I got arrested when I was 21.

241
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.870
I regularly drive home from the bar.
No,
I don't drive home.

242
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

243
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.440
<v 1>So where do I go with that one?</v>

244
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.340
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

245
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.880
<v 1>I have driven after drinking before,
but I was not really drunk.</v>

246
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.640
Well I've done that.
Yeah.
You wait till you're sober,
I'll click on that one.

247
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.630
Has drinking caused you any persistent health problems?
No.

248
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.590
All right.
There we go.
Does alcohol still give you the same feeling?

249
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.020
One drink helps me relax.
Yeah.
Three beers used to do it.
Now it takes a six pack.

250
00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:45.110
I changed to liquor because wine wasn't giving me a buzz.

251
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.610
I changed the liquor cause for the out for the calories.
Thought it was,
you know,

252
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.590
I mean,
I know they all have calories,

253
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.590
but I figured I'm just got a little shot glass if it's supposed to.
12 ounces.

254
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.890
<v 0>MMM.</v>

255
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.610
<v 1>Alcohol still give you the same feeling?
Well,
I guess the closest one here,
one,</v>

256
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.050
one drink helps me relax.

257
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.950
Um,
but I have changed the liquor cause wine wouldn't give me a buck.

258
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.420
Well it would,
but I have to drink too many.

259
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.140
Then I get like fucking acid reflux with that shit.
All right.
When you go out,

260
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.350
um,
without alcohol,
do you get withdrawal symptoms?

261
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.930
Now I don't feel any negative.
All right,
so now what does that mean?

262
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.160
Could you have an aisle?
You got a moderate alcohol problems?

263
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:43.330
Well,
I could have fucking told you that.
Um,

264
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.380
anyways,
yeah,
no,
I've been a,
I've been a good boy.

265
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:51.160
I haven't drank since the end of fucking November.
I'm coming up on two weeks,

266
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.830
you know,
and I'm doing it during the holidays and everybody's like,

267
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.010
lay them around.
I doing that.

268
00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.930
I got to get in shape for this fucking European run that I'm doing.

269
00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:05.890
European run.
Bill,
you don't say I've seen it on your website,
boy.
Oh boy.

270
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:10.030
A lot of them sold out any chance.
The yet is second shows in some cities.
Why?

271
00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:10.990
Yes,

272
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

Liverpool,

277
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.600
my adopted fucking premier league team,

278
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.690
I think.
I Dunno,
I got to,
I got to pick a team,

279
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:41.510
but I think it's going to be them and I'm doing it cause I liked the Beatles.

280
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.010
A London.
They added a second show,
March 5th,

283
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.760

So,
uh,</v>

284
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.570
yeah.
So I cut it off.
I,

285
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.650
I got some sort of fucking issue cause last night I was sitting by the fire with

286
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.480
my wife.
I had lit,
you know,

287
00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:11.910
put the Christmas lights on the tree and all of that shit.

288
00:17:11.911 --> 00:17:14.580
We're having a great time.
I love the holidays.
So she goes,

289
00:17:14.581 --> 00:17:18.720
you want some eggnog with a little in there,
you know,
she says,
and I said,
Nah,

290
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:21.480
I'll just take the egg.
Nog but I,
you know,
a little bit of a,

291
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.690
what's that shit you put on top of it?
The brown stuff,

292
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.420
not make a little nutmeg on top and I'll be good.

293
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.280
<v 1>Just gives you can't have just a little bit.
I go no,</v>

295
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.320
because then I want to have a bunch more and then that could turn into a,

296
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:38.980
you know,
me drinking every night for the next week or for the next year.

297
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.530
Just about,
you know,
I'm a habit guy and if I'm not drinking,
I,
I,

298
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.230
I'm either on or fucking off.
I be honest with you,

299
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.680
I lost that to kind of just like,
you know,
occasionally have a beer.

300
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.230
I have to like be not doing it or fucking doing it.

301
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:58.020
Now I can not do it I guess.

302
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

303
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.560
<v 1>The free time man,
I got too much fucking free time.</v>

304
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.810
Um,
if I had like an,
you know what,
I need this,

305
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.160
I think the biggest problem with my Busan is,
is I don't,
I,

306
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:18.840
there's no rules.
That's all I need because what likes cigars?
I have rules,

307
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.650
you know,
as far as how many I'm going to have a,

308
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.360
I just have to have rules with alcohol.

309
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:28.340
So maybe like I was thinking what if like,
uh,

310
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.710
two Saturdays a month,
you know,

311
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.790
that would be perfect cause then I'd still go out and get to drink cause I

312
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:40.500
fucking love booze,
but then I won't be like negatively affected myself.

313
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.900
Um,
you know,

314
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.310
my also won't be bored shitless and they also won't be a bloated fuck.

315
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.520
So maybe in,
I feel like in a,

316
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.200
when I do the European tour,
maybe the second to last night,

317
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:02.630
just so I'm not hung over for the flight or whatever.
No.

318
00:19:02.631 --> 00:19:05.390
Cause I know me.
Then I'll be like,
oh my God,
this flight's fucking longest shit.

319
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:09.770
Why don't we just have fucking three doubles real quick and just pass out,

320
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.650
wake up over fucking Greenland and be like,
yeah,
fuck.
We only have,
we didn't man.

321
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.670
Um,
whatever.
I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.

322
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.850
Um,
let's see here.

323
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.380
Maybe I'll go to an AA meeting.
Every time I go to a fucking AA meeting,
I'm like,

324
00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:31.990
Jesus Christ,
he's fucking,
people are crazy.

325
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.860
I just sit in a bar and drink and I get hammered and then I fucking go home.

326
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:43.300
That's it.
You know,
there's no cops there.

327
00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:44.780

333
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.470

335

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.850
I was telling you where it talked about him flying and all of that shit that was

397
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:15.770
called fly boys,
not flags of our father.
It's fucking hilarious.
I barely read.

398
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.530
I know it's not a surprise.
Um,

399
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.710
and I can't even remember the name of the God damn book.
Then I fucking red.

400
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.650
That was the one with the George Bush stories.
But you know,
I,

401
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.670
I didn't feel too bad that I picked the other book too,

402
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:33.500
cause they're both incredible books.
Um,
all right,
what else do we got here?

Uh,

No booze.
Oh,

405
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.210
oh,
oh,
I told you,
I'm thinking about switching to smoke in a pipe.

406
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.170
Both my grandparents smoked a pipe and they're dead now.

407
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:55.460
So I think it's a good napkin.
Um,
I should have been thinking about doing that.

408
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.840
I like it.
I like the whole fucking ritual.
It's just seems really cool.
Sit down,

409
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.210
packing the thing,
lighten it,
having to relight it,

410
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.150
pack it down with that little fucking thing,
cleaning it out,

411
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.530
the whole God damn thing.
Um,
somebody get,

412
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:12.380
when I was in a course,
one of my favorite cities of all time,
Milwaukee,

413
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:16.880
Wisconsin,
I was there and they gave me a pipe,
you know,
and I just,

414
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.530
I had lost the thing and I just recently founded it.
It,
let me,
let me,
let me see,

415
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.620
I got it right over here next to the wall of my things here.

416
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.760
This is all of my things are on your,
wait a minute.
Wait,
a flare.
It is,

417
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.690
let's see what I got in here.
Is it just the pipe?
But I have the little,

418
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.520
the little packer thing,
like,
I don't know the name of all this.
I also like,

419
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:41.540
you know what I like about cigar smoking and,
and also,
uh,

420
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.570
smoking a pipe is,
it's really fucking obnoxious,

421
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.190
like cigar smokers just because it's just all encompassing and nobody can get

422
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:51.320
away with,
get away from it.
All right,
so I've got a pipe.

423
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.120
I have some pipe cleaner and then do I have in here?
Do I have a little fucking,

424
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.060
oh,
I still got to buy the thing to pack it down.
Oh my God.
Dude,

425
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.040

426
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.183
<v 4>I gotta.</v>

427
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.570
<v 1>I gotta try this fucking thing out,
you know?</v>

428
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.150
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

429
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.510
<v 1>Oh,
there's a little thing for that,
that I watched this whole thing.
First of all,</v>

430
00:26:15.511 --> 00:26:19.740
I noticed people who smoke pipes have crazy facial hair.
Like,

431
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:23.340
I don't know if I'm going to fit in.
Like when I show up,
think that is a newbie.

432
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.370
Look at him.
He doesn't look like he,
uh,
you know,

433
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.580
he's a conductor or something like that.
Now Jesus,

434
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:30.840
you know what I want for Christmas?
I,

435
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:34.770
I really have to fucking fix this fucking God damn headphones here.

436
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.470
Why do I do this to myself?
What is,

437
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.110
you know,
it's gotta be this adapter thing.
That's what it is.

438
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.660
<v 5>I just have to buy a nice one.</v>

439
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.833
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

That can't be right.

469
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.360

472
00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:45.150
What the fuck does it do?
How do,
how do I get schedule?
All right.

473
00:28:45.151 --> 00:28:48.330
Let me hit pause here.
Sorry.
Hold on.
All right.
Yeah.

474
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:50.310
Did these Games a nice and spread out.

475
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

This is fucking easy to follow.
All right,
so what do we got?</v>

477
00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:57.340
They got one on Saturday,

478
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.510
then they got Saturday the eighth and they got Sunday the 16th

479
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.560
then they got the 21st and the 26th

480
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.470
<v 4>okay.</v>

481
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.310
<v 5>Then the 29th oh by,
if I watch all of those games,
I'll be on board.</v>

482
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.880
I'll be on board.
All right.
That'd be great.

483
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.250
<v 1>Liverpool on,
on one of these tours coming up.</v>

484
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.130
You know I'm also doing Manchester City,
so Jesus Christ,

485
00:29:24.131 --> 00:29:25.900
I'll get a bunch of shift.
They don't give a fuck.

486
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:29.260
I'm a stupid Yag then I can we give a shit.
Just be happy.
I'm watching.

487
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.090
They won't give a shit.

488
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.240
The perfect scenario would be if I become a Liverpool fan and then they lose

489
00:29:36.251 --> 00:29:38.830
demand city.
Right.
So then like Liverpool,

490
00:29:38.831 --> 00:29:41.530
people will be happy that I'm rooting for their fucking team then man.
See,

491
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:44.580
you won't give a fuck because my team didn't win bill.

492
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.370
I don't think they're going to give a fuck either way.
Hey,
fair enough.

493
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.143
All right.

494
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.890
<v 5>Um,
anyways,
I'm so psyched to be home.
I'm so fucking psyched to be home.</v>

495
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:56.450
I have the best fucking life in the world.

496
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.180

499
00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.510

500
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.900
Sit around the God damn Christmas tree,
right.
Have a good time.

501
00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:13.590
And in the meantime,
we're going to be listening to this,

502
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.700
a little bit of fucking music here and then a half hour of greatest hits from a

503

00:30:57.831 --> 00:31:00.350
I was supposed to do an inch after the music.

516
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.280
There's going to be a little clip from one of the uninformed episode three,

517
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:07.610
I believe from the Patriot and page,
give you a little taste.

518
00:31:07.611 --> 00:31:10.640
They're like a drug dealer will hopefully make you go to the fucking patriarchy

519
00:31:10.641 --> 00:31:14.750
to listen to the rest of it.
So here it is.
Me and all Joda Rosa,

The bureau.
Some Joe,
God bless the people that love those things.</v>

525
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.050
You know,
I'm going to shine.

526
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.580
Those are the kinds of people that fucking decorate their house on the holidays.

527
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.510
Neil loves him.
He is a fucking best and he is going to fucking,
you know,

528
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.240
deck the halls.
She's going to deck the halls.
That's high right now.

529
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.320
John going to throw up my back,

530
00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:08.270
pushing my fucking trash cans to the corner because there was fold with like

531
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:13.100
$300 with a fucking pumpkin since she bought it for fucking,
um,

532
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.220
Halloween and Thanksgiving and it looked great.
Joe.

533
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.220
I like Martha Stewart would have walked in.
She would have been nervous and like,

534
00:32:19.221 --> 00:32:23.030
Oh shit,
this,
this chick is common.
Right?
Then at the end of the day,

535
00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:25.700
they got a fucking,
you know,
they've got to go out to the curb.

536
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.780
I was sitting there like,
the,
I never get one.
I'm like,

537
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.130
I'm just going to have to throw it away.

538
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.760
It felt like there was a fucking dead body in there.
Dude.
It was like,
wait,

539
00:32:34.761 --> 00:32:37.640
as much as a person,
I never get one because I'm going am I going to,

540
00:32:37.641 --> 00:32:41.810
and then I also never put my up the already haven't think if you did stuff like

541
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:46.280
that,
maybe you could sleep a little better.
Dude,
listen,
I love nothing more than,

542
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.000
than putting the tree up and decorated for Christmas.
Here's why I don't do it.

543
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.940
Pause of Holly.
Follow La la.
Oh,

544
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.830
Paul's bell.
What?
Bells.
Bells.

545
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.230
They're like shaped the Holly bells are shaped like fucking people.

546
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:04.010
They're are trying to get the quarters.
Are these army people later on?

547
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:08.510
What branch there in?
Dang it.
Dang it.
Dang.
You know those guys at the mall?
No,

548
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:12.560
that's no Holly.
Bill fucking green shit with the berries on it.

549
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.420
Holly,
how are you saying those ELLs?
Yeah,
they're cog bells of Holly.

550
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:20.810
Like the things that you hang up,
those little bunches of Holly.
Oh,

551
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:23.350
I always had it.
I just thought it was literally bell's first.

552
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.690
I thought it was balls.
Maybe it means bells go.
I gotta be honest.

553
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.440
I shoot it my way through them.

554
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.600
We've got to look up this fucking Joe.
Is it,

555
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:36.890
has there ever been a fucking show named more perfectly uninformed.

556
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.090
I took a wild swing,
but I have a feeling of working title was dumb fucks.

557
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.380
That's gotta be,
that's gotta be what it is though.

558
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.850
Bells of Holly like,
like,
uh,
like bales of Hay or,

559
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.490
or you know what the fuck does,
hey,
you have to do with Holly.

560
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.210
I'm saying it's like the term,
like how you call a thing,
a hay bale of Hay.

561
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.180
All right.
I think you just call it a bell of Harley.

562
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.460
You know a Bushel of fruit.
In other words,
you know everything.

563
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.320
So many shaped bushels out there for me.

564
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:09.740
If you really know what it means to bill you been shaving your Bushel for years.

565
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.760
I had to it.
Ah,
we're both wrong.

566
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.340
Deck the halls with Bose of Holly,

567
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:19.610

Dude,

575
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:51.440
don't jog about John June.
John means put on our gay apparel meeting.

576
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:56.320
Joyous festive means something on a bill's closet.
Zig Zag,

577
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.480
zoom the H and you'll tide Carol.

578
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.970
I never got what that meant through.

579
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:05.060
This is like how much English language changes.
This is like what the F,

580
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.900
I don't know what they're talking about here.
Let's see here.

What the fuck is a bow Bo definition?

584
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.230
Like a bow took like a boat.
It's not B.
O.
W.

585
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.310
It's a main branch of a tree.
A branch,
a limb.

586
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.160
And Ah,

587

593
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.040

00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:05.251
night.

595
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:10.251
And a weapon for shooting arrows typically made of a curved piece of wood who's

596
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:13.940
ends are joined together by eight tots string.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.650

Nag in your pants.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:53.660
So now walk up and grab her tits unless she tells you to

606
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.840
be safe.
And don't do it.

607
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:02.790
Ever walked those titties and get your fucking hands and then take a stroll in

608
00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:04.454
the snow.

609
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:09.330
And then why do you know you're gonna fuck her in the ass?

610
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.160
It's a most wonderful time.

611
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.960
<v 6>Oh Wow.</v>

612
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:29.800
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built births.
The Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

613
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:35.490
December six 2010 how come I can't fucking hear myself going on here.

614
00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:39.940
Hello.
Hello.
Yo Mother fucker.
What is going on?

615
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.240
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
All the levels seem right.

616
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.410
The fuck am I doing wrong lately?
I used to have this shit down.
Wow.

617
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.070
I hope it's all right because it's late in the day and I have a football game to

618
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:56.200
watch.
Patriots are playing the jets.
You know,

619
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:59.830
those two fucking teams up and talking about for fucking 19 weeks in a row.

620
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.990
Uh,
they're playing tonight.

621
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:04.810
So I got fucking hustle through this thing because I'm doing this thing late

622
00:38:04.811 --> 00:38:09.190
cause I just flew back from San Francisco.

623
00:38:09.191 --> 00:38:11.390
I left my balls,

624
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.630
San Francisco.
Isn't that how the song goes?

625
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.520
Tony Bennett comes out,
luck be a lady two nights.

626
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.260
Um,
that's Frank Sinatra.
Go Fuck yourself there.
Crooner fans.

627
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.420
What do think about that during the holiday month,
as you can tell,
I,

628
00:38:31.421 --> 00:38:32.254
um,

629
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:37.040
I blew out my voice when I was doing cobb's club up in,
uh,

630
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.170
San Francisco and a,
I had a great fucking time.

631
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.300
I'm 51 days without drinking and I gotta tell you that's,
um,

632
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.640
San Francisco was one of those cities that makes you want to drink.
You know,

633
00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:54.880
it's just an awesome city.
You go up there,
uh,
that's two weekends in a row.

634
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.940
I've absolutely loved the city Seattle last week and now San Francisco this week

635
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.980
in San Francisco.
It was really,

636
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.610
I don't know how people stay sober there because every time you walk around the

637
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:09.910
corner you just see one of those bars.
You know,

638
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.870
it's just got that warm old

639
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.331
dingy,

640
00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:20.590
but it's got some character and he just want to fucking go in there and get a

641
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:24.190
pint and just start talking some shit.
You know,

642
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.910
it's fucking cold and rainy there the whole fucking weekend.

643
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.390
So site to be back in La those first time.

644
00:39:30.391 --> 00:39:32.110
I've seen the sun in like 10 fucking days.

645
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:36.130
It feels like the meet with the potty mouth this week.
Um,

646
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.770
but anyways,
yeah,

647
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:42.340
it was up there and I work cobb's comedy club and I want to thank all those

648
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:47.200
people who came out to see me.
It was ridiculous turnout.
A Cobbs is a,
uh,

649
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:52.790
it's a giant room for a comedy club and the place was packed the entire weekend.

650
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.890
And uh,
it was great.
Everybody was showing up.

651
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.310
Bunch of people came up and told me that they love the podcast and I had like

652
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:05.040
five people come up to me and tell me how much they liked the Socorro,

653
00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.280
what they love it.
So I'm thinking actually turning that into a bit,

654
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.350
sticking into my act.
Um,
I just don't know if it's going to work because,

655
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:18.370
uh,
I think maybe if I stick my mouth close enough actually,
you know,

656
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:22.270
and I listen,
listen back to the podcast,
it's sounded like the,
uh,

657
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.830
it sounded like the same sort of distortion.
I got to try it out.

658
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.780
I really got to fucking try it out.
You know what?

659
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:33.440
There's a room out here called the comedy union.
Uh,

660
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.660
used to be called mixed nuts.

661
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:39.250
It's called the comedy union is down on Labrea and uh,
well it's awful.

662
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:43.760
The Brayer can't remember.
It's right down the street from,
uh,
uh,

663
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.950
Roscoe's waffle house,
chicken and waffles.
Roscoe's chicken and waffles.
Huh?

664
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.690
African Americans.

665
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:55.000
You listening to the podcast as a big shout out to that fucking restaurant.
Uh,

666
00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.670
but anyways,
it's a club.
Um,
you know,
any comedian can go down there,

667
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.870
but it's a predominantly black audience.
Remember that from the news,

668
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.230
these to say that all the time,
a predominantly black neighborhood,

669
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.940
predominantly black
neighborhood.

670
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:15.400
So that's like what the crowds are.
So whenever I have a joke like that,

671
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:19.390
I like to go down to rooms like that or maybe do Tuesday night at the comedy

672
00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:23.170
store because I want to make sure that I'm saying the shit the right way.

673
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.513
You know,

674
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.900
granted that opens the door to some awkwardness if it doesn't come off the right

675
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:31.090
way.
But that's the fun of doing what I do.

676
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.190
So maybe I'm going to head down there and speaking of Roscoe's chicken and

677
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.620
Waffles,
I heard so much about that shit.

678
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:42.140
A so called white man heard so much about that ship from the predominantly black

679
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:47.630
comedians
always hyping that place up.

680
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:48.470
You gotta go down there.

681
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:50.870
You got to go down there and I got to tell you something.

682
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.310
I like chicken and I like Waffles,
but I do not like that shit together.

683
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.523
All right.

684
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.130
At no point in my life did syrup ever need to touch a chicken?

685
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.510
It's a,
it's fucking gross.
And uh,

686
00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:09.860
I went there once and I'll never go there again.
It was one of those,
uh,

687
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.970
you ever go to like a soul food place and it's like fucking like hardcore

688
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:18.610
African American and you feel foolish as you're ordering cause everything's

689
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.520
named after like some civil rights leader.
Uh,
you know,

690
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.650
Roscoe's chicken and waffles going to take you on it.
Yeah.

691
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:28.940
Let me get the Frederick Douglas a Chili fries.
Ed.

692
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:33.350
Can I get the,
uh,
Medgar Evers,
uh,

693
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.470
at a mommy?
Whatever the fuck.
Um,

694
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.600
you just feel dumb saying so,
and I don't know if it's that bad.

695
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:44.900
Where the fuck was that Amy Ruth's?
We're going back in my career here.

696
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.210
Back in my career when I used to,
uh,

697
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.390
I used to fucking jump over on both sides of the fence,

698
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:53.930
all the God damn time back in the good old days.

699
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.740
That was always a period in my career where I made sure that I,
uh,

700
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.410
on a regular basis when I was trying to figure out how to say what,
you know,

701
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.470
these glorious Dick Jokes and shit jokes that I do on stage.

702
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:09.500
There was a period during my career when I would,
when I would,
uh,

703
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.730
I would do all the rooms,
I could get in front of all the crowds.

704
00:43:13.731 --> 00:43:14.481
And if you're a comedian,

705
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:19.070
I suggest that you do that because it can do nothing but help you.
And,
um,

706
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.690
you know,
if you're really,
you know what I mean?
I learned that shit.

707
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.510
Cause I saw Eddie Murphy on the raw tour way back in the day.

708
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.310
I saw Rodney Dangerfield,
danger fields.
There was two of them,

709
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.580
Rodney Dangerfield.
And then two weeks later,
I say Eddie Murphy on the raw tour.

710
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:36.230
And I was like,
fuck at 18 years old.

711
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.790
And I remember looking at Eddie's crowd versus,
uh,
Rodney's crowd.

712
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:45.680
And for some fucking reason that just clicked to me.
Like Rodney's hilarious.

713
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.730
But Eddie is making everybody laugh.
So I remember,
uh,

714
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.770
kind of knew I wanted to be a comedian at that point,

715
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:56.390
but it took me another few years to get the balls,
you know,
to go on stage.

716
00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:58.550
And then I'll say,
I had this fucking thing in my head that,
you know,

717
00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:00.290
I had to make sure I finished college,

718
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:05.420
got to make sure I got tens of thousands of dollars worth of deck worth of debt.

719
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.470
So then I can then go on stage and talk about my Dick,
right.

720
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.790
To make my life even more difficult.
Um,

721
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.320
look,
I'm not saying whether or not you should go to college or you shouldn't,

722
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.030
but,
uh,
if you will like me and you just fucking knew,

723
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.740
you know,
you looked at standup comedy and you just,
you just fucking knew.
Uh,

724
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:31.650
I don't think it would be the worst thing if he just said to hell with the next,

725
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.130
you know,
$40,000 worth of debt.
But who the fuck am I?

726
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.780
Who am I to say that?

727
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.200
How far we ended it us seven minutes then seven fucking minutes.

728
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:43.910
And I could tell you,
oh my God,
I'm fucking red line.
And on this shit here.
Um,

729
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.580
seven minutes in.
I don't think I have anything left to talk about.

730
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.230
I am so fucking frazzled because I,

731
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:54.231
I don't know what happens when I fly back on the day of a podcast that you just,

732
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:57.870
I don't have any funny,
is no funny in me right now.

733
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.420
I'm just sitting here like I might as well be on meet the press.

734
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.430
You don't talking about budgets for the upcoming fiscal year?

735
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.640
Uh,
um,
did anything interesting happened to me in San Francisco?
Of course not.

736
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.800
I wasn't drinking.
I'll tell you that I went out and I,
yeah,

737
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:18.540
I tried a bunch of food up there and I'll,
this is something I can guarantee you.

738
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:24.510
All right.
If you like a Burrito,
go to San Francisco.
Those guys,

739
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:28.620
I had a Burrito when I was up in San Francisco.
I've been thinking about,

740
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.650
I'm always fucking thinking about it before he even said what I just said,

741
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.020
I've been thinking about this shit.
Like,
you know,

742
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:36.750
you have of just bang some fucking just,
you know,

743
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:40.560
some girl you never got to marry,
but she,
I don't know what she does.

744
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:44.130
I don't want to get graphic.
I try to stay away from the SEC ship,
but you know,

745
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.810
and you just can't stop fucking thinking and your brain's going,

746
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.350
don't go back to her.
She's out of her fucking mind.
She's a,

747
00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:56.950
that's not a mother.
That's not a mom.
You're not going to marry.

748
00:45:56.951 --> 00:46:01.530
You don't fucking go back.
But what she did on the other side,

749
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.640
right.
Come on.
We're all adults.
You know what I'm talking.

750
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.140
You can't stop fucking ticket about it.

751
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.890
I had the food version of that and God damn it,

752
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.670
it was a Burrito in San Francisco and like a fucking asshole.

753
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.620
I can't even tell you where I got it.
Uh,

754
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.320
I guess I can go a,
I can go on the Internet here and try and find it.
By the way,

755
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:25.560
here's a youtube video for you.
I'm a huge Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.

756
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.770
Huge Stevie Ray Vaughan Fan.
And,
uh,

757
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:34.650
he did a cover of an Albert King song called eight.
I just say,

758
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:39.500
ain't gonna give up on love,
but it's ain't gone and give up on love.
Uh,

759
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.330
I'm too white to say it that way.
So I say,
I ain't going to give up on love.

760
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:47.390
And the guy who put it up is a SRV music like Stevie Ray Vaughan music video,

761
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.150
SRV music video.
Um,

762
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.160
you put it up like a year ago for some reason I missed it.
And uh,

763
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.160
you got to see this.
If you're a fan of guitar playing,

764
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:02.310
even if you don't like Blues Guitar,
Stevie Ray Vaughn,

765
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.400
he gets like three quarters of the way through his second blistering solo and he

766
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:12.720
fucking does this little spin move on,

767
00:47:12.721 --> 00:47:16.980
does the fucking guitar straps and unal the guitars behind him,

768
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:21.810
straps the fucking guitar back on and proceeds to finish the solo behind his

769
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:22.644
back.

770
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.880
And not only is he playing with the guitar behind his back,

771
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:32.020
he takes the solo to a whole level beyond the Stevie Ray Vaughan level.

772
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:33.640
He was just at,
it's the fucking,

773
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.750
like if somebody could show me anybody who can play behind their back with that

774
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:39.820
level of passion,
that fucking good.
I mean,

775
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.400
I don't even know if Hendrix could do that.
Hendrix used to fucking,
I mean,

776
00:47:43.401 --> 00:47:45.280
I know Hendrix is a better fucking guitarist.

777
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:48.060
I'm not even going to start that fucking argument.
All right.

778
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.760
That's like compare and Jordan to Decoby.
I get it.

779
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.440
I'm not even trying to say it before we even have this fucking argument.

780
00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:00.940
Jimmy is,
yeah,
you can't even touch that guy.
But I'm just saying he took that,

781
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:01.660
that you know,

782
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.100
that stage trick to a whole nother fucking let's watch it.

783
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.970
And actually if you can find me one,
uh,
Jimmy doing it better,

784
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:12.550
which I'm sure you can,
maybe I haven't looked hard enough.

785
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.970
I'd love to see it because I get fucking chills watching this shit.
So anyways,

786
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.340
I'm going to,
uh,
I'm going to get rid of this screen here.

787
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:21.880
I'm going to find the name of this fucking burrito place cause it was,

788
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.030
it was fucking amazing.
Um,

789
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.360
now I can't look for this as I'm doing this podcast.

790
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:31.300
Isn't this going to get boring for you guys?
Huh?
How's,

791
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:36.260
I'm typing with my middle finger.
Cisco,
you're,

792
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.020
it's funny about people in San Francisco at where every time I go there and

793
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:43.600
somewhere I either read or somebody tells me that nobody calls the city San
Fran.

794
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.010
And I really want to tell him that nobody I know calls it San Fran.

795
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.520
We just say San Francisco.
We don't call it Frisco either.

796
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.570
Like you fucking hit people in San Francisco.
We don't call it.

797
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.750
We just say San San Francisco.
Go to San Francisco.

798
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.250
I wouldn't say I'm going to shy instead of Chicago would I?

799
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.790
I guess people say shy town.
All right,
here we go.

800
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.250
I am fucking zeroing in where I got this God Damn Burrito.

801
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:15.250
I'm going to find that somebody wanted to satellite like the fucking Illuminati

802
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:16.084
does.

803
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.470
You know that when this staring at you watching your fucking rubbing one out,

804
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.900
saving the video.
So if you ever go against,
all right,
it's on,

805
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.730
uh,
you motherfucker,
give me the satellite.
Come on,
give me that shit.

806
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:35.260
Don't you like how the Illuminati is allowed us to do this too so it won't seem

807
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:40.030
as creepy when they'd fucking do it to us.
Is that it?
All right.
There you go.

808
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:44.470
I got it.
It's on a you can't you fuck it.
Can't,

809
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.180
there it is right there.
It's on ninth avenue and Irving Street.
All right.

810
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:57.370
Just beyond Yancey saloon on that side of the road,
you walk down,

811
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:59.650
you make a right on nine fucking avenue.

812
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:03.040
Now I'm going to take the little yellow man.
The little Asian Dude,
right?

813
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:07.240
Is that it was supposed to be.
Huh?
Put them down on the street.

814
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.330
Look at me and there's where the fuck I was.

815
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:14.180
Slowly going down the street isn't as exciting,
isn't this?

816
00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.870
This is what you get when you get a free fucking podcast.
You get absolutely no.

817
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.630
Look at a poodle that the satellite took a picture of.

818
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.660
You think it's still alive.
It's one of those bigger poodles.

819
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:26.290
You know like the George Meichin have poodles.

820
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.300
You know those big ones?
They're actually really good at Frisbee.

821
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.540
They actually become a dog when they get that big.
All right,

822
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:37.220
where the fuck is it?
You fucking whore.
Don't be like this.
I don't fucking know.

823
00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:40.820
I told you basically where it is and it's on the fucking west side of the
street.

824
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.280
Anyways,
I had a god Damn Burrito.
I'm still thinking about it.

825
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:46.670
And here I am in the middle of the podcast doing one of the most boring things I

826
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:48.650
could possibly do is,
which is search for the thing.

827
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.480
That's how good this fucking Burrito was.

828
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:55.630
I've literally stocking it just so I can stand outside the window via my fucking

829
00:50:56.901 --> 00:51:00.710
laptop.
All right?
That was excrutiatingly boring.

830
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.690
And if this podcast wasn't free,
I'd fucking apologize for uh,

831
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.850
[inaudible].
So,
Hey,
I got a letter here for some,
a fan from Alaska.

832
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:12.743
All right?

833
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.800
You ever hear that expression where they say you can't run from your problems?

834
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.080
Well,
uh,
tell people in Alaska,

835
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.480
because most people up there are wanted,
you know,
and not in a good way.
Like,

836
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:27.980
we really love you to come back to South Dakota.
They are wanted in

837
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.240
one of those,
you know,
like you know those fucking idiots,

838
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.370
those spur of the moment,
bank robbers,

839
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.690
we stand in there and the only reason why you robbed the bank was because the

840
00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:43.250
line was just long enough to give you enough time to think like,
you know what?

841
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:46.940
I could always rob does fucking bank and if there was no one in front of you,

842
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.990
you just want it gone in and found out what you know,
what your balance was.

843
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.290
But there was just,
you know,
seven people in front of you.

844
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.010
You started working out the whole thing.
You know the fuck's going on.

845
00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.600
Look at everybody.

846
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.620
We all work every single day and every week they give us a check.

847
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:08.000
They don't give us cash.
They give us a check.

848
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:11.060
They give us these numbers on a piece of paper.
What do we deal with that?

849
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:14.390
We take it right down to these clients.
We give them all our money.

850
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.530
You know,
it's,
is this,

851
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.820
I feel like a fucking hooker right now.
I went out and I worked,

852
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.343
all right.

853
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.550
I get my money in this form fucking currency that I can't,

854
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:31.280
I can't even use unless I go to you.
You fucking asshole.

855
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.660
And then you keep the shit.

856
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:36.740
I got to stick it in there and you give it out to be $20 at a time telling me

857
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:41.180
everything's gonna be okay.
I want you to know something.

858
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:44.360
I would love to go to a bank where they actually had the nerve to walk around

859
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:47.660
and like purple sparkly suits with big feathers,
you know,

860
00:52:47.661 --> 00:52:50.120
driving Lincoln continentals from 1975.

861
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.050
Just dress like the fucking pimp that you are.
I'll give a shit.

862
00:52:54.051 --> 00:52:57.200
I'll doll myself up to go in there and try and get my money.
You fucking cunts.

863
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.120
So anyways,
this is a,
uh,
this is a,
um,

864
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.960
a letter from a crazy Alaskan fan set,
a pill I bought,

865
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:09.160
let it go on Itunes,
um,

866
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.130
earlier this evening and had,
uh,

867
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:17.110
quite the fucking goat rope.
I don't know what that means.
I'm,

868
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:19.610
I'm sure that means like,
I was freaking out in Alaska.

869
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.400
I had quite the fucking goat rope.

870
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.990
The fuck would that mean the Italia go to your cabin up there.

871
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.300
Goats eat everything.
I don't,
I don't get it.

872
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.560
Crazy Alaskan fan.
Can you please explain that to me?
I don't know.

873
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:42.400
You had quite the fucking goat rope.
Okay.
That doesn't sound like it was good.
Um,

874
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:47.100
anyways,
I live out in the middle of BFE Alaska.

875
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:49.471
I don't know what that means.

876
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:54.060
Either set up an area or is that bum fucking East Alaska?

877
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.770
I don't know.
And have no need for the Internet in my Ted Kaczynski Cabin,

878
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:01.480
according to mark Marin on Twitter,
uh,

879
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.640
Ted Kaczynski is a cabin is actually for sale.
Um,

880
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.480
but I digress.
Here we go.
Continuing my neighbor who is down the road has,

881
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:14.481
has the Internet and if I sit my laptop sideways facing due south on the very

882
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:19.080
top of my Warren commission volumes,

883
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.580
I can connect at tip top 1997 speed.

884
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.260
I only do this once a month.
So I went on iTunes and I bought let it go,

885
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:32.830
Joe to Rosen's album,
the depression auction and some Chuck Berry.

886
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.060
You've got great taste too.

887
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:39.390
Great Comedians and one of the greatest guitarists of all time.

888
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.270
Um,
all right,
Michael Graves.
I Dunno what that,

889
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:48.030
if I'm saying that right,
and the latest iron maiden effort,

890
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:52.500
I picked all the tunes out that I wanted sat my laptop on.

891
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:56.700
It's seven foot perch on its side so I could download,

892
00:54:56.701 --> 00:54:59.760
let it go so I could let it download all that shit.
All right.

893
00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.800
I sat down and out of the corner of my eye,

894
00:55:02.801 --> 00:55:07.801
I saw Sarah mcglothlin written on the screen and I immediately thought,

895
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:09.600
Oh fuck,

896
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.370
I somehow hit the wrong button and I fucking bought some Sarah McLaughlin Song.

897
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.391
Uh,

898
00:55:15.391 --> 00:55:20.190
so I grabbed the for the computer and there it went right down to the fucking

899
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.580
floor,
seven feet down onto a linoleum for boom.

900
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.070
I started screaming at the top of my lungs about that cut Sarah McLaughlin and

901
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:32.850
those prick bastards that iTunes for faking me out and make me buy that dumb

902
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.590
shit.
I was really freaking out.

903
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:39.390
I open my front door to cool off and therefore feet in front of me was a big

904
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:42.360
brown bear looking at me like I was some kind of asshole.

905
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.720
I grabbed the door and ran like hell back in Lik lickety split lickety split.

906
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:52.980
And that's the kind of fucking expression you use if you live in a cap fucking

907
00:55:52.981 --> 00:55:57.390
goat rope.
Lickety split.
Uh,
my heart was beating like crazy.

908
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.980
I was surprised to see,

909
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:01.920
and I walked up to my computer and I was surprised to see that my screen was

910
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:06.390
okay on the laptop.
It fired right up away.
Holy Shit.
It works.

911
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.120
When I reloaded Itunes,
I saw Sarah,

912
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:13.860
Sarah McLaughlin was actually one of the comedy cuts on let it go.

913
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.260
Uh,
I let it go.
All right,
you're crazy.
Alaskan fant Pete Jesus Christ piece.

914
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:23.740
It sounds like some shit I would do you guys that a lot.

915
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:27.460
Do you absolutely lose your shit.
You know,

916
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.751
you build up some,

917
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:32.680
some sort of conspiracy in your fucking head and then you realize in the end

918
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:35.500
that you were actually wrong.
You know,

919
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:40.530
but in that moment you by yourself and you try to blow it off by turning the car

920
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:45.721
radio on and try to drown out that voice that's screaming voice in your head and

921
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:47.790
that feeling of embarrassment that you,

922
00:56:47.791 --> 00:56:52.510
you were actually the Douche bag and then he just wasted the last whatever,
five,

923
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:56.740
seven minutes of your life.
Absolute flipping out about some shit that you know,

924
00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:01.510
really didn't,
didn't even fucking happen or maybe some shit that you created.

925
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.500
If you did,
then you can relate to the first 37 years of my life people.

926
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.080
Cause that's what the fuck I did.
My God damn fingernails,

927
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:14.770
I need to cut my fingernails.
I've been on the road too.
God Damn long it guys.

928
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:17.830
Is it okay if I just tap out?
Can I just,
you know,

929
00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.350
you know what I feel like right now when you guys are at work and you just don't

930
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:24.750
want to be there.
So then you just,
you start faking sick.
You know,

931
00:57:24.751 --> 00:57:29.200
you get that Douchey look on your face,
you know,
and you know,

932
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.790
you just start speaking in a whiny softly can't,
ain't,

933
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:36.630
don't really see is neat boss.
Excuse me.
Yeah,

934
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.620
I don't,
I don't know if it's something I ate.

935
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.870
I started feeling like this the other day.

936
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:44.140
You always have to give it credibility.
I started feeling this way the other day.

937
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.990
Really?
You were pretty fucking chipper when he came walking in.

938
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:53.220
You know I me tell you guys about that coke head I used to work with a long time

939
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:53.590
ago,

940
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:58.000
used to come walking into the warehouse like four hours late on a sunny day with

941
00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:02.800
his hair soaking wet from the shower and his excuse was always the same.

942
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:06.280
Oh,
the traffic traffic was unbelievable.
Really?

943
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.770
It's fucking 92 degrees out there buddy.
With your soak and wet hair.

944
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.950
I don't even know if it was from a shower.
Could have been like that drug sweat.

945
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:19.660
What time I was doing the opiate Anthony's show and they had some guys,

946
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:22.210
some fucking rock band guys in there that will the shit,

947
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:23.770
I'm not gonna fucking blow up the spot.

948
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:28.771
And say their name because it was like eight 30 in the morning when they came

949
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:28.931
in.

950
00:58:28.931 --> 00:58:33.790
We interviewed them for like an hour and at nine 30 in the morning I asked the

951
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.660
lead singer if I can get a picture with them and he goes,
sure.

952
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:41.650
He fucking pulled me into him at his head,

953
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:46.570
fucking side of his face up against my side of the face.
And it was just,

954
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:51.640
I don't know what it was.
Flop sweat,
drug,
sweat,
meth,

955
00:58:51.641 --> 00:58:54.400
sweat.
I don't know what the fuck it was.
But you have,

956
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:58.780
if you have a fucking play basketball and you play shirts and skins and the

957
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:01.120
fatty,
not only you gotta cover the fatty,

958
00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:05.910
but he fucking is skins and they're in that transition games and you fucking

959
00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:08.740
just standing there and the paint and that fatty goes running by you and you

960
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:12.790
feel like,
ah,
like somebody just emptied a Jacuzzi on you.

961
00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.280
That's what it felt like was fucking disgusting.
Oh wait a minute.

962
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:27.140
There it is.
There's the Burrito spot.
It's called Gordo,

963
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:32.550
g.
O.
R.
D.
O.
There we go.
There we go.

964
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.740
On Ninth Avenue in Irving.

965
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:42.250
Just walk North on Ninth Avenue.
Irving street was the fucking shit.

966
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:48.130
It's one of those things.
If I was like Elvis Presley,
you know I,
hi my house,

967
00:59:48.131 --> 00:59:52.480
go get a fucking burrito man.
I'm all hopped up on coils and shit.

968
00:59:52.481 --> 00:59:53.860
I want to fucking Burrito man.

969
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.360
I would get him a private jet van Nuys and I'd fly like nine of my friends up

970
00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.960
who don't really like me and at that point that just there for the money and

971
01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:04.990
they'll laugh at it.
All my jokes like I'm the funniest fuck or wherever,

972
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:07.600
you know I am.
I am.
Where'd you get those shoes?

973
01:00:07.601 --> 01:00:09.470
At a shoe store and they're all like,
wow,

974
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:16.780
you killed us to kill us.
I know,
man.
Everything I say it's funny.
Everything.

975
01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:21.170
Everything I sing is a fucking hit.
Let's go get a fucking burrito.
That steward,

976
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.540
he's thinks you'll suck my dick.

977
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.730
Everybody laughing like sexual sexual harassment didn't exist back then.

978
01:00:28.731 --> 01:00:33.731
If you sold enough fucking records in the 70s sexual harassment didn't exist in

979
01:00:35.051 --> 01:00:37.230
the 60s yeah,
you could just,

980
01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.620
you could just rape somebody if you had a hit record,

981
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.220
if anybody complained,
ah,
pipe down.
How many albums did you sell there,

982
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:50.930
sweetheart?
It's a brutal fucking time to be a female,
you know?

983
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.230
So we had to correct it.
And the only way we knew we would have known,

984
01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:01.340
we never would have found out if those ladies didn't start burning their bras.

985
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:06.230
How many of those fucking ex hippies do you think that regret that moment?

986
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.300
Standing in the street?
What?
What?

987
01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:13.050
What exactly was their fucking problem with the presenter?

988
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:18.350
You know,
what do you want?
You want your titties hanging down to your waist.

989
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.890
You don't want that.
The number one fucking thing that gets you some shit.

990
01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.820
Little things during the course of the day.
Oh Man.
Would you like to go first?

991
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:31.670
Go ahead.
You think I'm being a gentleman?
I'm not being a gentleman.

992
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.260
It's cause you have perky titties.
All right?

993
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.760
And you had the fucking decency to only button your shirt right up to just below

994
01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:43.260
your cleavage.
And because of that.
Yes,
madam,
you can go before me,
if I had a hat,

995
01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:46.530
I would take it off and I would bend over at the waist like,
like,

996
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.510
like one of those three musketeers,
you know,

997
01:01:48.511 --> 01:01:51.390
throw my fucking coat down over a puddle of water.

998
01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:56.220
You know that you are ma'am.
Right?
Cause he had Teddy's,

999
01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.590
what keeps you Teddy's parky ladies.
What keeps him yeah.

1000
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:05.640
Side from eating steamed vegetables instead of a quarter pounder with cheese.

1001
01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:10.160
Come on.
We all know shit.
Goddamn.
Birzir all right,
Si.

1002
01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.650
Si fucking the Sports Bra.
Whatever the fuck you want.

1003
01:02:13.651 --> 01:02:16.650
If you want to keep those babies high and tight.
All right.

1004
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.950
And I know it's hard for you to hear this from a man he's coming off showed

1005
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.160
chauvinistically right?
If I was,
you know,

1006
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:27.510
some fucking motivational speaker and I was a female standing up here saying the

1007
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:30.270
exact same shit,
but I had a clam,
you'd be listening,

1008
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.960
you'd be listening you by my stupid books and I'd have those fucking arm smart

1009
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:40.320
glasses on,
you know,
you know those women dress,

1010
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:44.220
they walked that fine line of having a business suit on.

1011
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:47.550
But they still look like,
you know,
I'll fuck the shit out of you.

1012
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.260
You know that look,
exactly.
Speaking of that,
you guys seen that fuck.

1013
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.100
And I'm walking around right now.
I got to stand up.
Let the funny fall down.

1014
01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.360
Wash over me.
You guys watched that show up.

1015
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:05.090
I don't know what the hell it's called,
but you know what I mean?
That's it's,

1016
01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:09.200
it's stars,
this woman.
Um,
it's kind of like that Shana.

1017
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:13.500
Let's show that bald guys screaming about the stocks and he's throwing stuffed

1018
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:16.050
animals around it for some stupid fucking reason.

1019
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:21.090
People that I know why people listen because he's loud.
He's passionate.

1020
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.980
I've made a fucking career out of that.

1021
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.410
If you just say my jokes without screaming them in working up a sweat,

1022
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.640
I don't think that that funny,

1023
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.290
you know,
the true masters to bill,

1024
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.650
Bill Cosby can sit in a lawn chair and kill for two straight hours.

1025
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:44.280
I couldn't do that.
Jesus Christ.

1026
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:46.560
If I sat down for two hours to try to tell jokes,

1027
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.220
just the sound of my own voice with that put me asleep again about the fucking

1028
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:55.140
crowd.
But anyways,
so I'm watching the show late night cause I'm not drinking,

1029
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.340
you know,

1030
01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:01.340
staying in this fucking hotel down on Jefferson Street and hide the Apocalypto,

1031
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:03.240
whatever the fuck it's called.
You know what's funny?

1032
01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:06.840
I think I took a picture to them and to put it on the [inaudible] podcast.com

1033
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:08.700
for some fucking reason.

1034
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.920
Did you guys ever see that movie a Shaka Zulu that the name of it?

1035
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:18.750
Chuck a Zulu,
Shaka Zulu Zulu for Hulu,
whatever the fuck it's called,

1036
01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:22.500
right?
It was basically about a Ah,
gee,

1037
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.900
I don't know what the fuck was abuzz about English guys in Africa.

1038
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:26.210
And they went down there and uh,

1039
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.220
they took over some shit and the Zulu nation and had enough right

1040
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:33.140
and a,

1041
01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:38.140
they all stood on the fucking hill and that they had this slamming their fucking

1042
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:42.450
weapons against their,
uh,
their shields.
That's the shit.

1043
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:47.190
You know,
Michael Caine and all those guys.
You remember how they were dressed?

1044
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.200
No stupid white hats.
I don't know what,

1045
01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:54.810
I don't know what it looked like.
You know what it looked like?

1046
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.990
You might have you guys ever watch bonanza?
Remember that guy,

1047
01:04:57.991 --> 01:05:02.280
hos where that 10 gallon fucking hat.
Just imagine if you had that hat,

1048
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.660
but you cut the brim off of it.
He just left that big stupid hat on.
Amy,

1049
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.390
you've got a little bit of a brim on the front and on the back.

1050
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.980
Like if,
uh,
what do you call those?
Those little hats.

1051
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:18.010
You know those little hats that fucking people were like Charlie Chaplin.

1052
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.390
Just imagine if that had,

1053
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:22.900
could get an erection right in the fucking brim was the balls.

1054
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:26.380
So you know that just fucking stay in the same,
that's what the hat look like.

1055
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:31.330
Okay.
For some fucked up reason.
The,
the,
I was going to say the guards,

1056
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.670
the,
the dudes who stand outside on the sidewalk and go,
hey,

1057
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:41.080
can I help you with that bag that you obviously carried here with no problems so

1058
01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:45.910
I can possibly make a couple of dollars.
Those guys,
the doorman,
they it go,

1059
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:50.580
they were dressed like those fucking Englishman and uh,

1060
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.920
Shaka Zulu or chuck or Zulu,
Zulu,
Hulu,
whatever the fuck it's called.

1061
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.450
I Dunno why I thought to need to bring that up.
Well,
let's talk about the hotel.

1062
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:02.500
They had a wine tasting place right next door,
you know,

1063
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.710
which just attracts soccer moms.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1064
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:10.240
You know those Goddamn broads,
when they get older,
they have a couple of kids,

1065
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.460
they can't go out and do keg stands with their,

1066
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:15.190
who ha hanging out of their panties anymore.
They're a fucking mom.

1067
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.220
So they gotta be,
you know,
they've got to be more mature with their drinking.

1068
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.230
So they go out to places like those little,
those wine bars.
Husic isn't too loud,

1069
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:26.890
you know,
it doesn't make their tits quiver.
Right.
So they can sit down,

1070
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:30.370
sit down with their friends,
they have cheese,
they got wine,

1071
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.180
and they could sit there and discuss shit,
you know,

1072
01:06:34.181 --> 01:06:37.750
and act like they're fucking adults rather than just scared teenagers with

1073
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:42.300
children.
Um,
the fuck.

1074
01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:45.790
So I had to walk by that shit all the time and evidently one of these broads had

1075
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:50.170
too much to drink.
I don't know what somebody's fucking yakked on my floor.

1076
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:54.400
It was cleaned up before I got there.
But she know that,
you know,

1077
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.530
once somebody pukes that it's just going to be there.

1078
01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.860
It's going to be there for what you need.
You need a new rug who's getting no.

1079
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.360
All right.
If you puke enough,
they really need to tear down the building.

1080
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:09.340
So anyways,
I know I got an that fucking subject,
but this is good man.

1081
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:14.200
I got a little bit of momentum.
I stood up feeling.
All right.
All right.
Oh,

1082
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.250
I know what I was talking about.

1083
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:19.420
I was talking about that lady I was watching on the show.

1084
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040
So uh oh,

1085
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.130
I'm not drinking salt back in the hotel where the dude's address,

1086
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.160
like the fucking apartheid Englishman at the door and somebody yakked on my

1087
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:33.040
floor.
I'm sitting there watching this fucking show.
That's how I got there.

1088
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:33.580
All right,

1089
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.580
so I'm watching the show and a flipping through the channels and watching TV and

1090
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:42.700
I'm flipping through the fucking channels.
I'm losing all my,

1091
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:44.920
God damn bet someone one in three this week.

1092
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.590
I'm not flipping through the fucking channels.
And I stopped on this show

1093
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:54.310
and it's this lady,
I don't know what her deal is,

1094
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.780
but like adults call her up and say,
I want to buy this.

1095
01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:02.110
Can I afford it?
You know,

1096
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:07.900
like they're fucking eight years old.
Just call.
Hey,
see is,
and this is,

1097
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.990
this is jail.
I'm calling in from Arkansas for thoughts.

1098
01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:14.800
You want to tell you I love your show.
I absolutely love it.
Me and my husband,

1099
01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:18.080
we watch it all the time.
We absolutely love it.
We think you're great.

1100
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:18.951
And you know,

1101
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:21.890
a lot of people probably think that you put too much bleach on your teeth,

1102
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.920
especially with that orange fake Tan,
you know,

1103
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:29.180
so you look like that fucking plant in little shop of horrors.
But that's not me.

1104
01:08:29.181 --> 01:08:33.200
I think you look great,
right?
They go through all that bullshit.

1105
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.390
So this bitch calls up in though.
Why do I say that?

1106
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.280
I never talked to women that way.
So this lady says,
I want a fucking,

1107
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:44.120
uh,
I went,
I want to buy,
uh,
I want to buy a fucking condo down in Florida.

1108
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.530
Do I have enough money?
Do I have it?

1109
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:51.080
Can I have 40 that's what the fuck she said called up.

1110
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.680
This complete fucking stranger says,

1111
01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:57.200
I want to buy a condo and ass.

1112
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:00.890
This other fucking complete fucking stranger.
Can I afford it?

1113
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.033
It's like,

1114
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.980
did you mail this woman all your bank records like five fucking years ago and

1115
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:13.580
you haven't,
you have no fucking idea how much money you have.
You dumb cunts.

1116
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.790
Jesus,
what?
The whole fucking hour was.
Hey,
my name's Mike.

1117
01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:23.870
I'm calling in from Rhode Island.
Listen,

1118
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.050
I want to get a tattoo on my fucking ball bag,

1119
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.470
but I also want to cut out the rope so I can get tee tops.

1120
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.850
Oh my fucking 85 rally sport.
Can I afford to do that?

1121
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:39.380
That's what the show was.
This woman telling adults

1122
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.370
who had jobs and lives and probably children,

1123
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:48.230
whether or not they could afford something.
It just really was.
You know,

1124
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:51.890
that was one of those times where it's just like,
you know what,

1125
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:55.490
there's not enough lightning in the world.
You know?

1126
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.040
Just as far as the odds of being struck by lightning.

1127
01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.300
We need to bring that average up because the amount of fucking morons out there

1128
01:10:02.301 --> 01:10:05.990
versus actually intelligent people,
you're going to hit a fucking moron,

1129
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.640
you know basically going to hit a moron or are you going to hit the ocean?

1130
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.190
Those are going to be the top two in that order.

1131
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:17.240
Even though the fucking world is three quarters fucking water,

1132
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:22.260
you still got a higher chance as lightening to fucking hit a moron.
That's that.

1133
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.120
That's,
I'm telling you,

1134
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.150
that's my goddamn theory and that's what I want the new staff to be.

1135
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:29.520
Rather than being like,
you know,
the,

1136
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:32.750
the odds of getting hit by lightening are higher up than Blah,
blah,
blah.

1137
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.170
I want it to turn into,
I want so much lightening that,
that,

1138
01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:40.790
that the new stat is the odds of an intelligent person actually being hit by

1139
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:42.110
lightening are x,
y,
and Z.

1140
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.520
Do you like how in my own little style in esque world that I'm actually

1141
01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:49.950
intelligent and everybody else is just a sea of morons?
Huh?

1142
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:53.360
You don't have thoughts like that.
Murderous thoughts.

1143
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:59.400
I was actually talking to this broad up in,
uh,

1144
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.790
San Francisco and

1145
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:08.970
I got this whole chunk about hitting women that I've been doing on stage.
And,
uh,

1146
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:12.980
it's actually something embarrassing I have to admit about myself as much as I

1147
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:14.940
do the,
the comedy thing for a living.

1148
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.990
I'm really bad at picking up on sarcasm.

1149
01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:25.180
I don't know why I use sarcasm.
I'm sarcastic,
right?

1150
01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:31.390
But for some reason when someone uses it against me,
I,

1151
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.090
I like that old guy downstairs.

1152
01:11:34.091 --> 01:11:37.870
But if I told you that shit last year and I was dragging my Christmas tree down

1153
01:11:37.871 --> 01:11:42.460
the stairs,
he stuck his head out the window and he just goes,
beautiful morning,

1154
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:46.930
isn't it?
And he had this fucked up look on his face,
but he said,

1155
01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:51.380
beautiful morning,
isn't it?
So I was confused and I just went,
yeah,
yeah,

1156
01:11:51.381 --> 01:11:54.440
it is a beautiful morning.
I don't think of,
why is he yelling with that,

1157
01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:57.590
twist it up,
looking his face.
And then I walked around the corner.
I was like,
oh,

1158
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.840
he didn't mean it.
He,

1159
01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.070
what he really meant was she making a lot of fucking noise ruining this

1160
01:12:04.071 --> 01:12:08.260
beautiful morning.
So he got me.
Then I always end up feeling stupid.
So you know,

1161
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.140
I'm doing this whole chunk on hitting the broads over there.
Right.

1162
01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:17.010
And I'm standing afterwards whoring myself out,
right.
Selling my DVD,

1163
01:12:17.011 --> 01:12:21.510
showed a little bit of leg doing what I gotta do and this fucking woman is

1164
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.020
walking out in,

1165
01:12:23.021 --> 01:12:27.680
her husband has sort of shuffling her out and she starts going,

1166
01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:32.470
ah,
oh yeah,
she,
she has has once again the twist it up,

1167
01:12:32.471 --> 01:12:35.920
look on her face.
She goes,
thanks for the domestic violence jokes.

1168
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.760
I really appreciated it.
I really appreciated the domestic violence.

1169
01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:43.360
Jux thanks a lot for the domestic violence jokes.
That's what she was doing.

1170
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.850
And because she was saying thanks,
it just,
it went totally past my head.

1171
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.500
I was more just confused by her facial expression.
So she said he called.
Yeah.

1172
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:56.750
I really appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.
I'm literally just waving gone.
Alright,

1173
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.370
glad you enjoyed the shop.

1174
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.030
Which is funny because it probably pissed her off more,

1175
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.730
but I was sincerely thanking her completely missing her sarcasm.

1176
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:11.360
What she was really saying was ivy that dealt with that personally or that's

1177
01:13:11.361 --> 01:13:15.620
happening to somebody right now or has happened to someone or I grew up with it

1178
01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:19.250
or whatever,
and you brought up bad memories and you ruined my fucking evening.

1179
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.680
That's what she was really saying.
But of course I took it at face value,

1180
01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:24.000
which actually when I look back on it,

1181
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:26.490
I think makes it even funnier because who's kidding who?

1182
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.050
She already thinks I'm a fucking moron at that point,
you know?

1183
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:37.270
So it would actually would have made her a little bit happier if I tried to

1184
01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:38.960
appear intelligent.

1185
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.210
<v 9>If like actually you missed the point of the geocode.</v>

1186
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:46.170
It was really trying to do is expose the hypocrisy of us,

1187
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:49.090
some of the relationships between the male and female fixes.

1188
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:50.190
If I went that route,

1189
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.430
<v 8>you know,
okay,
then she could have gotten this hot.</v>

1190
01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:58.870
But the fact that I literally was the moron that she thought I was,

1191
01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:03.180
and then that there was this whole line of people,
you know what,

1192
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:06.510
I just realized I should be struck by lightning.
Where the fuck is wrong with me?

1193
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:11.350
I'm one of those fucking morons.
Um,
all right,

1194
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:15.880
so there's that portion of the fucking program that's 36 minutes.
Do it.
I'm not,

1195
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:17.740
there's no way.
I'm going more than 50 minutes.

1196
01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:20.240
I got to make a judgment call here.
Like,
uh,

1197
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:24.600
I'm trying to find some friends where I can watch his patriots jets game cause
I,

1198
01:14:24.601 --> 01:14:25.434
I,

1199
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:30.510
I can't go out and watch just regular games at a sports bar unless it's a team I

1200
01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:32.680
don't give a fuck about,
but there's no way,
uh,
uh,

1201
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:37.270
a game like this that I care so much about.
Um,

1202
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.540
I know too,
a lot of people,
this is going to be a huge fucking game,

1203
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.650
which obviously it is,
but I gotta be honest with you.
I,
I,

1204
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.600
I'm not feeling our defense.
I really want to talk some shit,

1205
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:53.980
but I gotta be honest with you.
Okay?
You guys want to hear my big prediction.

1206
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.010
I'm going to go on a limb here rather than all these other fucking assholes who

1207
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:00.310
email me after the game and don't make any sort of predictions.

1208
01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:02.530
This is my prediction.
I think

1209
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:07.000
obviously you guys know I don't like our fucking defense,

1210
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:09.490
but I gotta I gotta tell you this.

1211
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.940
We have no fucking pass rush and the jets haven't fucking incredible offensive

1212
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:19.480
line.
Those guys are the shit.
So what's his face?

1213
01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.830
Sanchez is going to be sitting back there like bill Cosby doing a standup

1214
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.000
special.
Um,

1215
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.140
and then you combine the fact that with that we have a shit defense that lets up

1216
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:33.370
24 to 30 fucking points a game.
I don't like that aspect of it,

1217
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.520
but I believe in our offense.
I think our offense is great,

1218
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.940
but they have a great defense.
So I dunno,

1219
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:43.950
I just really see this being one of those 28 to 17 you know,

1220
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.780
don't listen to my gambling tips.
But if I was gambling,

1221
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:50.590
I actually had to put money on this.
It was my last fucking 100 bucks.
I would,

1222
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.830
I would take the jets in the fucking points,
but uh,

1223
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.400
but if the Patriots do win because we got fucking Tom Brady and we have the

1224
01:15:57.401 --> 01:16:02.401
genius of Bill Bellacheck who can somehow figure out a way during the second

1225
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:06.790
half to come back.
I think,
uh,
even if they win,

1226
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.910
I still don't think it means shit other than that.

1227
01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:14.770
We've come a long way since September,
but we'd still have to,
I think write,

1228
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:18.370
we'd still have to play
that.
I Dunno.

1229
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:23.110
Then if the play offs came around,
I had a playoffs.
I don't know.
I don't know.

1230
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:27.570
This game is going to be fucking awesome.
Plus you also got to look at,
but uh,

1231
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:32.260
Rex Ryan has Buddy Ryan at his fingertips.
So this dog,

1232
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:33.760
this is going to be a fucking awesome game.

1233
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.430
This is really going to be an awesome game and I am going to age at least eight

1234
01:16:39.431 --> 01:16:41.710
fucking years.
I'm not gonna be able to handle it.

1235
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:45.550
Like I got to tell you some games like I,
this is how fucking psycho I get.

1236
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.320
Like I give a shit so much.

1237
01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:52.060
Sometimes I taped the game and I don't even watch it.

1238
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.470
And then I just find out if my team wins,
then I'll sit down and watch it.

1239
01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:59.480
But if they lose,
I just fucking erase the game because that,

1240
01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:03.850
that's how much it affects me,
you know?
And I know what you think.
Oh,

1241
01:17:03.851 --> 01:17:05.860
what are you a fucking pussy?
Yes.

1242
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:09.790
I don't know if a pussy up from fucking intelligent.
It's like I don't want,

1243
01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:13.430
I don't want to waste that amount of my fucking life.

1244
01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:17.960
I don't want to care that much,
but I do.
So I try to protect myself.

1245
01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.690
Oh,
so let me tell you guys about San Francisco.
If you go into San Francisco,

1246
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:29.150
if you're going to San Francisco,
um,

1247
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:33.830
here's some shit to know.
Their public transportation system takes,

1248
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:36.950
it takes a minute to kind of get to figure it out.

1249
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.840
They have like all these different subway lines that they're like street cars

1250
01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:46.220
and then they go underground ground.
They all sort of funnel inter down there.

1251
01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:50.150
The Union Square area,
the Union Square area,
as far as I can tell,

1252
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:51.590
is the most touristy fucking place.

1253
01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:56.591
Like the Times Square of San Francisco in that,

1254
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:59.810
I don't think anybody from San Francisco goes there.

1255
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.800
I think people from Oakland go in it.

1256
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.780
Douche bags like me go down there before they figure out like,
oh,

1257
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:09.620
this place sucks.
But,
uh,
I actually,
uh,

1258
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:13.570
if the line's not too long and you can jump on one of those rice,

1259
01:18:13.571 --> 01:18:18.571
a Roni trolleys and he can go all the way up to fucking north beach and hang on,

1260
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:23.600
who do we got here?
Ah,
Jesus.
He says,
the guy's calling about the game.

1261
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:27.790
Hey Ben,
I'm doing my podcast.
Let me call you back in like 20 minutes.
All right.

1262
01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.010
All right,
cool.
Um,
all right.

1263
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:34.971
Yeah.

1264
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:38.240
So I don't know if you go there with you girl is all the shops it down there.

1265
01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:40.550
So you're going to want to go,
they already told you where to get a burrito.

1266
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:44.660
Actually,
if you just want to go to Burrito ground central,
go to go to a,

1267
01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:45.710
the mission district.

1268
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:49.310
And this is just for people if you're going to San Francisco.

1269
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:51.440
And then there's just all kinds of fucking awesome bars.

1270
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:55.070
And I actually was staying.
Uh,
you know what?

1271
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.730
It fucking rained the entire time I was there.
Where else did I go?

1272
01:18:58.731 --> 01:19:02.180
I got some decent Italian food.
I went to that place,
Mama's for breakfast.

1273
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.770
I wasn't really impressed,

1274
01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:06.230
but I got French toast and I figured most people don't.
You know,

1275
01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:08.810
something that's something that a lot of people don't know how to make.

1276
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:12.320
I can actually make better French toast than most of the fucking assholes out

1277
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:15.500
there.
You know,
they just don't do it right.

1278
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:19.820
They just don't fucking do it right.
The bread just doesn't taste right.

1279
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:25.370
I go old fashioned way.
My mom used to make it,
you know,

1280
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.820
you actually use white bread that Wonderbread shit.

1281
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:32.030
And I know it's a lower quality meat,
a fucking bread than they use.

1282
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:35.330
But I'm telling you,
sometimes you can overthink something.

1283
01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:38.360
He get to fucking fancy.
I've gotta tell you right now,

1284
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:42.200
you go out and make yourself a fried egg.
You fry it up and butter.
All right.

1285
01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:43.370
Fuck the surgeon general.

1286
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:46.400
Every once in a while you've got to tell that guy to stand the fuck down.

1287
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.210
All right,
sit out.
Oh man,

1288
01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.450
I'm cooking this shit and butter,
right?

1289
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.290
With your stupid fucking half a beard

1290
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.510
surgeon general looks like you already fucking die.
Did he die?

1291
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:07.760
We had that like,
like he was the commander in chief of all love boats.

1292
01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.060
That fucking uniform.
Um,
so whatever you fry it up in butter.

1293
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.520
All right,
you cook it over Eg.
Daikin,
Eg.
All right.

1294
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.900
Cook it over easy.
I don't know how to fuck you guys do it.

1295
01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:25.170
When I do something over easy,
I fucking uh,
I turned the egg once.
All right,

1296
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:29.100
after I cook the fucking egg and I get it to the consistency.
I want what?

1297
01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.920
I cook it on low heat too,
by the way,
Ron,

1298
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:35.290
she'll cook Christ your cook that shit out of it.
Um,

1299
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:38.310
you cook it on a low heat,
right?

1300
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.730
And then once you do is once you get it looking the way you want it to look,

1301
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:42.270
y'all see,

1302
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.690
put your salt and pepper on the top right as it's fucking cooking in the butter.

1303
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:51.300
Then you flip it over and the second you flip it over,
you take it off the heat.

1304
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:55.100
All right?
And you let,
how hot the uh,

1305
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:58.230
the pan already is cooked the other side.
All right,

1306
01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:01.140
so almost like mark and a steak.
That's how you do the other side.

1307
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:05.880
That way you get the egg isn't runny,
you know,
but you still got the yolk there.

1308
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:09.120
All right,
well that's how I make an egg over easy.

1309
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.400
But if I'm making a fucking fried egg,
you know,

1310
01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:14.520
you've got to cook a thing over heart.
Same Shit.
You Cook it in butter.

1311
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.540
Sit the fuck down old man.
He kicked you cook it in butter and he'd do that.

1312
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.660
All that bullshit and you just,
you want wonder bread.

1313
01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:24.300
You want the shittiest fucking bread ever.
All right?

1314
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:26.040
That kind of shit that you're not going to digest.

1315
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:30.330
See like 62 slices a wonder bread.
All right,
you salt and pepper.
That bitch.

1316
01:21:30.331 --> 01:21:31.530
She cook it in fucking butter.

1317
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.920
You put it on the God damn sandwich and he put a little mustard on top of it.

1318
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.310
Nothing fucking fancy that,
that grey poupon shit.

1319
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:43.080
I'm talking broke ass white trash.
Fucking my mustard.
All right.

1320
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.750
Yellow plastic container comes out yellow like mustard.

1321
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:53.460
Should be not that golden shit.
None of that stuff.
Straight up.
All right?

1322
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:56.820
You fucking,
you know,

1323
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.890
put that bitch on a plate and you go to Tom Delicious,

1324
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.930
straight up fucking comfort food,
all those fucking places.

1325
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:10.950
I don't know why they don't just make shit like that.
Just,
you know,

1326
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:14.760
it's like the Mcdonald's concept,
but you actually use sort of real food.

1327
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.560
I was speaking to that,
you know,

1328
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.680
when I was walking through Haight Ashbury or the hate,

1329
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:22.530
you don't want to get a fucking look like,
oh,
you're a tourist.
Just say,

1330
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.020
I want to go to the hate.
How did we get to the hate?
Right?
You go to fucking,

1331
01:22:26.021 --> 01:22:29.160
and I don't,
what the fuck?
I still feel stupid saying that.
Uh,

1332
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.790
but you go out there,
you know,
and that's where all the dirty white people are.

1333
01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.470
Hey Man,
can you spare Asian folk can change me in.

1334
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:40.320
And they got dreadlocks and shit,
you know,
you know,

1335
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:44.130
dirty fucking wrangler jeans from sitting on the fucking sidewalk.

1336
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.000
I really am reverse racist when it comes to fucking,
uh,

1337
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:52.230
white homeless people,
you know?
Okay.

1338
01:22:52.231 --> 01:22:56.760
If you're white and you're fucking homeless and you're under the age of 62

1339
01:22:56.761 --> 01:23:00.480
you're not getting a fucking dime out of me.
You just knocked unless you,

1340
01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:05.010
maybe if you're a female,
then he got that look.
You know you got that right.
Look,

1341
01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:09.130
I'll do it,
you know?
But other than that,
it's like,
come on man,

1342
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:12.790
seriously get a fucking job.
You're a fucking white dude.

1343
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:17.110
Go get a fucking job.
I really shouldn't be making those jokes in this economy.

1344
01:23:17.111 --> 01:23:20.710
I apologize,
but you know what I'm saying?
All right,
talking about,

1345
01:23:20.711 --> 01:23:21.670
I'm not talking about you.

1346
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:24.400
If you're out of work right now and you're looking for a job,
hang in there.

1347
01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:27.340
I fucking respect.
You're right.
But I'm talking about those other bumps.

1348
01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:32.130
Talking about bumps in their 20s all right,

1349
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.320
this is a deal.
If you're white,
if you look like boxcar Willie,

1350
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:39.010
you know you've got to stick with that little kerchief tattoo it.

1351
01:23:39.011 --> 01:23:42.100
I'll give you some money.
You know,

1352
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:45.820
if you could stick IOM nose in your mouth because you don't have any fucking

1353
01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:50.350
teeth,
I'll give you some money.

1354
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.660
You know what?
As far as the rest of the people go,

1355
01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:59.920
you get money out of me.
If you look like you're sober,
other than that,

1356
01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:03.730
you can go fuck yourself,
whatever.
Hap Who,
what,
who does shit like this?

1357
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:08.020
And December,
this is what all saint nick is coming down the fucking tube.
Right?

1358
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.960
Oh,
you better watch out.
You better not cry.

1359
01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:18.961
You better not pout up telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town.

1360
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:24.770
Um,
you know,
did I tell you guys,
I went up to a,

1361
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:28.120
I went to this observatory and I was looking at stars the other night cause I'm

1362
01:24:28.121 --> 01:24:31.210
not fucking drinking and I'm desperately trying to fill these hours.

1363
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.900
When I used to have fun in my life and uh,

1364
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:38.530
I was looking at the moons of Jupiter and,
uh,

1365
01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:41.430
one of the moons was named after some fucking,
um,

1366
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.510
let's see if I have the information here was named after.

1367
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:52.330
What the fuck would I think?
Like,
you know what,
I can witness,

1368
01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.400
you guys don't need to know the name.
You don't give a fuck.

1369
01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.260
One of the moons of Jupiter is named after a,

1370
01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.030
Jupiter was basically the Roman Zeus,
right when it comes to mythology,

1371
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:07.600
if I remember correctly,
they basically stole all their gods,

1372
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:10.210
like stealing like a fucking script idea,

1373
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.880
and they just changed up the names of the characters.
Like,
Nah,
man,

1374
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:14.260
it's different.
We talking about,

1375
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.880
so Jupiter was married to a,
I dunno,

1376
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.420
I dunno what the fuck her name was Apollonia right,

1377
01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:27.610
which is going to use fake names here.
And they had a daughter named die.

1378
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.070
Heather are Helena.
I don't know what the fuck her name was.

1379
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.350
One of the moons is named after this girl.
And I evidently,
uh,
this is how this,

1380
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:39.130
this is how the story goes and mythology is

1381
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:45.690
Jupiter had basically a crush on his own fucking daughter and his wife,

1382
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:51.520
rather than reporting it to the proper authorities,
was just simply jealous.

1383
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:56.290
Like he was banging some hottie down the street rather than her fucking
daughter.

1384
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:02.260
So Jupiter is banging his own daughter.
His wife gets wind of it,

1385
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:06.590
he gets fucking nervous.
So he turns her into a cow,

1386
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.380
not his wife.

1387
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.560
He turns his beautiful daughter that he was banging into a Heifer Heifer

1388
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:19.550
evidently is a fucking a fucking cow that doesn't give an a calf yet.

1389
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:25.160
You know,
it's ready to be fucking banged raw dog style,
right?

1390
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:30.650
That's a fucking story.
I swear to God,
if all you,

1391
01:26:30.651 --> 01:26:34.130
Jesus freaks out there who are looking down your nose at that sort of myth

1392
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:37.970
mythology,
you'll fucking religion starts to same goddamn way.

1393
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.950
Adam and Eve,
first two fucking people,
they were hanging out.

1394
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.810
Somehow they became more people.
It's really weird.

1395
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.250
Like that guy was basically,

1396
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:54.530
this guy told this fucking story or at least brought it up.

1397
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.250
I guess he didn't tell the whole story.
Then I researched it.
It's just the,
uh,

1398
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:02.930
the incest you was the acceptance of incest back in the day.

1399
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:07.760
I don't know if it's creepy or if it just makes sense.
You know,
you gotta be,

1400
01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:10.580
you gotta be asking yourself this.
All right.

1401
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:15.530
There's only 40 people on the planet.
All right,

1402
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:19.730
let's just say 25 of them are women.

1403
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:25.190
15 of them are men that doesn't even add up,
does it?

1404
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:30.950
There's 40 Gat does 25 and 15 is 40 see that we all learned something here today

1405
01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:33.550
on the podcast.
All right,
let's see.

1406
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:41.540
Let's say 15 a men and 25 are fucking women.
All right?

1407
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:46.730
Now who's kidding?
Who you've been to a bar?
Does 25 fucking women in there?

1408
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.020
All right.
How many of them could you completely give a shit?

1409
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.910
About 12 good.
Half of them.
You don't give a fuck.

1410
01:27:56.990 --> 01:28:01.970
You stone sober.
Yeah,
whatever with you fucking jeans beat it.
All right?

1411
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:04.700
You got weird eyebrows.
Get the fuck away from me.
I don't care.

1412
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:08.540
It's the 12 of them are out the window.
Now you're down to 13 women.

1413
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:14.600
How many of them are going to be hot?
Let's use the bar analogy.

1414
01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:18.110
There's going to be about four hot ones.
All right?

1415
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.120
Now if there's 25 women and 15 guys and only for those women a fucking hot,

1416
01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.790
this is a good God damn chance that one of those women is going to be your

1417
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:29.624
daughter.

1418
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.540
No laws have been made about it.

1419
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:39.430
You know there's no real Saudi.
You know,

1420
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:43.040
they haven't even invented the fucking wheel yet or the hammer.
There's no does.

1421
01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:47.900
No jurisdiction is no jurisdiction.
There's no laws.

1422
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.500
I guess that that's why it made sense.

1423
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:53.600
Like why all these religions started that way.

1424
01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:00.430
And then Thor banged his sister in front of his daughter and Nope,

1425
01:29:00.431 --> 01:29:03.010
nobody questioned the shit.
So anyways,

1426
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.240
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about here.
People.

1427
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:09.000
I'm just trying to get to 50 and it's 51 minutes.

1428
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.600
45 seconds bump up,

1429
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:14.670
bump it up to them.

1430
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.660
It's time to go watch Monday night football.
Everybody.
All right,

1431
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.000
let's hope we have a nice fair game.

1432
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:27.810
I've got a lot of balls saying that as a patriots fan.
Um,
anyways,

1433
01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.870
I'm looking forward to this.
I don't like it.
I don't have a good fucking feeling.

1434
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:33.880
I just,
I don't like it.
But what's great is,

1435
01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:37.900
is I had a feeling that I was going to go undefeated this week,
four no,

1436
01:29:37.901 --> 01:29:41.290
with my picks and I went one in three.
So,
uh,

1437
01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:46.280
the odds have it that the fact that I think the jets are going to win means my

1438
01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:50.120
patriots might win.
Right.
Does that make any fucking sense?
All right.

1439
01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:51.410
Listen to this fuck faces.

1440
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:54.950
I'm going to upload this thing and I'm going to put up some pictures that I took

1441
01:29:54.951 --> 01:29:59.190
when I was in San Francisco.
How hilarious is that?
You know,

1442
01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.750
it's like all of a sudden,
I'm not drinking on the road and now,

1443
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:05.780
now I'm taking pictures like God damn tourists,

1444
01:30:05.781 --> 01:30:08.820
and I'm telling you how to fry fucking egg.
I don't know if I like it,

1445
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:13.210
but I'm 51 days in.
I'm definitely going to drink again.
Um,

1446
01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.700
I just need to learn to do it in moderation so my head doesn't get all big and

1447
01:30:16.701 --> 01:30:19.190
fat.
All right,
well that's the podcast for this week.

1448
01:30:19.191 --> 01:30:20.540
You guys all have a wonderful week.

1449
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.690
I hope all your dreams come true when Dacko fuck yourself.

1450
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:24.220
<v 0>Okay?</v>
