00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.950
Hey,
what's going on and still burned his time for the Monday morning podcast for

2
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:06.784
Monday,

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.550
July 24th,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.080
2017 was going on.
How,
why?
Yeah,
I got to keep my voice down.

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
I got my little,

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.250
little one here is sleeping and the next room I am in New York City.

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.370
I got a little acting Gig here on a little movie in a little city called New

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
York City.
Um,
for the next week I'll be doing that shit.

9
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.800
So I'm acting during the day and night whenever the hell they have me doing it.

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.290
And um,
then I'm looking,

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.860
I'd come home and I look at the scripts that we're working on for F is for

12
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:48.060
family and um,
I dunno,

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.590
that's become my life here.
I actually did one spot this weekend though.

14
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.960
I went over to the Gotham comedy club,

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
hadn't been there in fucking years.
Went over there,

16
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:02.310
had a great time and uh,

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.410
try to maybe pop in and do another spot maybe next weekend or something just to,

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.150
you know,
so I don't forget all my fucking jokes,
but uh,
Jesus Christ,

19
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.250
Has New York changed?
I can't believe it.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.790
Like everybody lives in Brooklyn now.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.003
<v 0>MMM.</v>

22
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.740
<v 1>I don't know.
I mean there's a bunch of people still living in Manhattan,</v>

23
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:28.700
but like,
I dunno,
Manhattan,
so weird now.
Like they,
uh,

24
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.750
they took it too far.

25
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.620
Like I remember when I first lived here,
it's like Manhattan was,
it was scary.

26
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.550
Like you were always kind of,
you know,

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.430
being aware of people around you.

28
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.230
I remember buying a jacket behalf,

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.300
trying to look tougher than I really was just trying anything you could do to,

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.620
you know,
keep that fucking thing off you.

31
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.680
And um,
and even then,

32
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.830
I guess it was way better obviously than it was in the 70s and the crack

33
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.770
eighties and everything and Giuliani had just taken over.
But uh,

34
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.510
somewhere along the line,
man,
they,
they,
they just took a two,
four,

35
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.650
I felt that I was in like Sacramento or something.
Right.

36
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.413
<v 0>You know,</v>

37
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.520
<v 1>not saying there aren't dangerous parts of Sacramento,</v>

38
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.450
this dangerous parts of very,
it just felt like a dish.

39
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.880
It didn't feel like New York,
like there was just no,
there was no vibe.
I guess.

40
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.590
It was kind of cool.
You know,
like families and Shit.
It kind of just,

41
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.160
it's starting to feel like a theme park.
Um,

42
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.360
I know it's a weird thing to complain about that it's,
it's like too safe,

43
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.850
but it's just a,
I dunno,
probably just a grumpy old man.

44
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.300
It's definitely not the city I remember.
So,
um,

45
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.300
I was out in Brooklyn,
you know,

46
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.660
rehearsing some of the shit that I get to do for next week.
And,
um,

47
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.780
just going through there.
Oh my God.
All fucking high rises.
Oh my God.

48
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.420
All the fucking high rises and shit.
They're building over there and um,

49
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080
it's shit.
It's just not,
I haven't met,
I'm up.

50
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.410
I used to date this woman that fucking lived off the g train like fucking 15

51
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:13.640
years ago and it was like,
it was like going to another fucking world.

52
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.240
<v 3>Um,
and uh,</v>

53
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.550
<v 1>now you go,
I don't know what the fuck's going on.
I don't know.</v>

54
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.860
I'm just an old man going,
no way.
It used to be,

55
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.130
<v 3>you know,
I went over there and it's like we're all like the hipsters,</v>

56
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.060
but even everybody's so anti hipster that even hipsters don't dress like

57
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.010
hipsters anymore.
But you can still see him,
you know,
now the new vibe.

58
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:38.950
But she's sort of like,

59
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.951
you have like the Conor McGregor haircut with the good Charlotte Tattoos and

60
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.810
close,
you know,
so you kind of look like,

61
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:51.811
does this guy build custom motorcycles or does he ride a tricycle with the giant

62
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.860
front wheel?
You know,
is he making his own brew?

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.610
Is either,
you know,
z working one of those fucking breweries,
you know,
you know,

64
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.530
it's none of that.
You know,

65
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.600
the Michael Jackson pants that don't quite make it down to your fucking sneakers

66
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.100
or shoes or whatever the fuck they are.
So I don't know.
Like

67
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.300
<v 1>Brooklyn's like,
it's like nice now.
I don't know.
It's fucking,</v>

68
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.440
it was,
yeah,
Jesus Christ.

69
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.470
What I want to know is where did all those people go?

70
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.110
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

71
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.180
<v 1>when they weighed it all up,
like where do,</v>

72
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:32.990
where do all the rest of the people go where all those restaurants go?

73
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.880
Where does that vibe go?
All that culture.
Where the fuck does it go?

74
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:41.030
Everything just looks like a fucking forever 21 now.

75
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.800
And everything's just a giant glass luxury fucking apartment building.

76
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.480
Who the fuck has all this money?

77
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.240
I thought these fucking millennials were broke.

78
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.630
They were coming out of college with all this college debt and they went no

79
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.490
fucking jobs and all they do,
you know,
I don't know what's going on.

80
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.970
If you're trying to buy a house right now,
it's like if you don't have,

81
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.560
like you tried to buy a house in,

82
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:10.561
there's some Chinese guy or our guy from the Middle East or a Russian guy that

83
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:15.280
just comes in and just fucking bids all cash.

84
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.183
I think,
I think

85
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.130
<v 3>this is my fucking conspiracy theory that Russia,</v>

86
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:27.750
China and the Middle East or in cahoots with each other and they're like,
look,

87
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:32.670
well,
we can't like just go over and start bombing those guys.
You know,

88
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.510
the United States have nuclear weapons and as we saw in World War II,
uh,

89
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.490
they will use them not once,
but twice.
Right?

90
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.470
So they know they can't do that.

91
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:46.050
So I think what they're doing now is to just going to fucking,

92
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.570
just slowly by as much as they can and put a Chinese guy,

93
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.170
a Russian or an Arab in all of those.
And then they'll be,

94
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.070
they'll have infiltrated our country then

95
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.950
<v 1>the run for office and then they'll just switch the whole fucking thing.</v>

96
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.920
Do I sound like that guy talking about bottle our precious bodily liquids or

97
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.720
fluids in Doctor Strange love.
I don't know.
Fuck enough.
Um,

98
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.560
I think this is a part of being my age where like you live long enough that you

99
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.170
remember how it used to be and now you've seen it changing.

100
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.260
It's kind of freaking you out.
Maybe that's what it is.

101
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.170
Maybe I'm just one of those guys being like wow,
you know when I die someday,

102
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.360
like no one's gonna give a fuck and this is just going to keep going isn't it?

103
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.900
I guess I'm not that important.
Um,

104
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.360
anyways.
Um,

105
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:41.840
I'm fucking got my handheld goddamn recorded here cause um,

106
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.430
yeah cause I'm on the road and I didn't have any room to bring all my podcast

107
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:51.650
shit cause I got the kid now and uh,

108
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.700
that's a fucking trip,
Huh?
Packing up all your stuff,

109
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.720
all this stuff you need for the kid.
Um,

110
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.300
yeah.
I don't know.
It's not that bad.

111
00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:08.301
You just pack it all up and then you just go to curb side fucking hand somebody

112
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:13.620
a 20 and just be like,
yeah,
just shovel is shit under the plane and that's it.

113
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.170
And you get one of those giant wheelie things when you land,

114
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.610
you just wheel it out and you throw it all in a cab.
Right?

115
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.080
Again,
you yank it out and then you got the guy at the hotel,

116
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.310
you fucking peep puts it on a wheelie thing.
It's,
it's really not that bad.

117
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.280
Everybody acts like they have to carry it and fuck it,

118
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:36.000
hold it in their lap on the plane ride.
You don't just pay the extra money,

119
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.070
shove it under the fucking plate and be done with it.
Um,

120
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.580
but my daughter did great on the plane.
You know,
I guess kids before,

121
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:46.800
they're like one years old,
like the,
uh,

122
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.910
the air pressure stuff doesn't quite bug them as much.
I don't know why.

123
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.570
Maybe there you station tubes,
they're so small.
They are,
I don't,

124
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.550
I don't understand why
it wouldn't,

125
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:00.980
but people claim that it doesn't,
you know,

126
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.760
and for those of you who don't understand that ear popping thing,
which I didn't,

127
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.100
it's just,
you know,

128
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:12.101
when you take off the air inside your ear on the other side of your ear drum

129
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.420
is a,

130
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.480
that pressure as you ascend becomes higher than the pressure on the other side

131
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:27.920
of your eardrum.
The outside part,
right?
That leads to the,
uh,

132
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:30.560
the little fucking escape patch on the side of your head,
right?

133
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.070
So there's that difference in air pressure and we all know high pressure always

134
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:37.690
goes to low pressure and it takes the most direct route,
which is,
you know,

135
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.470
pushing against your fucking ear drum.
Um,
and then when you land,

136
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:44.660
it's the exact opposite.
So when you're going up,

137
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.920
your eardrum is getting pushed out because the pressure was higher there and

138
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:53.000
then when you land it becomes the opposite.
I believe that's correct.
Right?

139
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.840
Yeah,
that's right.
Cause as,
as you go back down again,

140
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.760
the pressure becomes higher outside of here.
That's all that's going on.
Um,

141
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.500
and you can't explain that to a baby.

142
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.330
I was barely able to explain it to you.
Um,
so anyways,

143
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.710
she did great on the plane.
She slept a lot.
And then when she wasn't,
you know,

144
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.670
I just got up and I was walking around with her and um,
you know,

145
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.660
flight attendants loved.
I mean,
who doesn't love a baby,
right?
And fortunate.

146
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:28.380
My daughter's like really cool.
He's got this thing where she just kind of like,

147
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.470
she's met so many people already that she's not freaked out by people.

148
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.750
So when she meets someone new,
she just like,
you know,
borderline in a rude way,

149
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.250
just stares at them and it takes to like a good,
like three minutes.

150
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.210
And then eventually she's like,
Hey,
I get to this person is,

151
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.010
and then she smiles and then turns away into your chest.
She gets a little shy.

152
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.780
Um,
oh,
would you look who's here?
Will you look who's here?

153
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:59.010
And she gives me a wave and there she goes,
you're going to come back out.

154
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.200
Alright.
Um,
yeah,

155
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:08.880
so able to do that and it wasn't that bad.
And uh,
this is kind of cool.

156
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:09.714
Like I'm,
uh,

157
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.910
back in New York with the whole family makes doing the road way better.

158
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.530
I can tell you that now we just have to convince my wife to come along with me

159
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.000
with our daughter when,
when I go to like the not fun places,

160
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.900
I've always given a shit about that.
You know,
she's always good to support me.

161
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.930
You know,
when I go to a fun city,
you know,

162
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:38.640
but when I go to like fucking Jacksonville,
Florida,
I'm on my own,
you know,

163
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.900
which is really bullshit because I have a lot of fun in that time.
You know,

164
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.390
eat a little bit of alligator.
You go to a gun range,
why not?
Um,
anyways,

165
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.260
let's try to bring the energy up here.
This is fucking hard one to do.

166
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.810
Try to do when I got to keep my voice down,
you know.
Um,
anyways,

167
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.790
so I'm totally back into my New York vibe.
You know,

168
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.680
I really missed when I lived in neat.
Uh,

169
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.100
since living on the west coast is I really miss the yes network.

170
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.720
Um,
when I lived here 10 years ago,

171
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.600
I can't fucking believe that I've been out in La for 10 fucking years.
Um,

172
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.760
I used to always,
you know,

173
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.170
I would watch the yes network in root against the Yankees.

174
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.320
That was like my shit.
I never watched the mets.

175
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.710
I could never get into the fucking maths,
but that's what I would do.

176
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.140
I would watch almost every single Yankee game as many of them as I could,
um,

177
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.410
or watch the replays when I got home and I would just sit there and I would just

178
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:39.570
root against them.
But I mean you had to watch them.

179
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:41.700
They will like this $200 billion juggernaut.

180
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.310
And I used to always go to Yankee stadium.

181
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.210
I'd go by myself cause I lived on the east side and you just jump on the
fucking,

182
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:49.710
what is that,
the four,
five,
six,

183
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.280
take it right up to the Bronx old Yankee stadium,

184
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.540
which was actually renovated all the Yankee stadium.

185
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.070
And I would sit and like the fucking upper deck for like 12 bucks and it keeps

186
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:04.870
score like an old man.
And I used to watch Clemens and uh,

187
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.740
was it Mike Messina,
that whole era.
But I remember like in 1998,
you know,

188
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.050
the 1998 Yankees,

189
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.430
I got to go to a couple of couple of games that year knowing full well that I

190
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:19.630
was watching what looked like was going to be one of the great teams of all
time.

191
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:20.081
And you know,

192
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:25.081
20 years later I still believe that and I'm based to fucking root against them,

193
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.370
especially Clements.
I used to root against that guy hard.
And um,

194
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.640
but so if I lived here once again,

195
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.550
I would be going to games because,
uh,

196
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.240
now they got Aaron judge and I,
Jesus needy.

197
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.780
Um,
you're looking good.
Um,
anyways,

198
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.930
I used to always go up there and I would just root against the,

199
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.110
but now they've got Aaron judge and you can even a red sox fan.

200
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.260
You got to give it up to the fucking Yankees said the greatest franchise of all

201
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:58.330
time is as far as spotting talent.

202
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.150
Do you realize for basically the last 80 out of 100 years,

203
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.860
that'd be a century.
Near a hundred years is its is a century.

204
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.650
You understand that?
Huh?

205
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.300
Why you clamming up?
Where are you going right now?

206
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.940
Okay.
Um,

207
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.880
for the last 80 out of the last 100 years,

208
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.350
they have scouted and picked the guy.

209
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.500
There's no other fucking franchise out there.
They can say it.
They thought,
okay,

210
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.470
they bought Babe Ruth.
All right.

211
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.110
The Red Sox fucking owner was so goddamn pussy whipped.

212
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.530
He had to keep his fucking wife quiet and she wanted to fucking,

213
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.620
I don't even know what the play was,
you know,

214
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:55.390
but he needed to finance her fucking Broadway play to just shut her the fuck up.

215
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:59.290
And he sells babe Ruth.
No excuse for that.

216
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.020
It's not like we didn't know who the fuck he was.

217
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.250
The guy was winning cy young awards that hitting the fucking zillion home runs

218
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:10.510
and we still get rid of them because there's fucking lady had to get a little

219
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.630
tap dance,
fucking Farsi Shit going right?

220
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.390
So they don't get credit for that one.

221
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.250
That was a dumb move by the fucking red sox.

222
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:20.290
And everybody knew the babe was the shit.
However,

223
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.710
this is what they'd done for the last 80 fucking years.
All right.

224
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.270
From their farm system,

225
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.510
they went Lou Gehrig to Joe Dimaggio to Mickey Mantle,

226
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.850
right?
Then June,
and they added a little damp.
George Steinbrenner comes in,

227
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.890
you know,
the Oakland A's don't want to pay anybody.

228
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.580
He buys the fucking Oakland A's.
They went to championships.
Fuck all of that.

229
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.170
And he buys Dave Winfield.
Fuck all of that.
A bad 20,

230
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:52.040
25 years in there.
Okay,
then fucking Derek Jeter,

231
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.650
I forgot it.
Oh wait,
I forgot what's his face?
Uh,
Don Mattingly.

232
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.590
You know the reason why people don't look at him like he's one of the greats,

233
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.330
cause he never won a fucking world series.

234
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.260
But don Mattingly to Derek Jeter,

235
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.370
to Aaron judge,
you can argue with me on don Mattingly.

236
00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:11.200
He wasn't quite one of the greats of the greats,

237
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.110
but like this fucking Aaron judge's,

238
00:15:14.111 --> 00:15:16.090
it's like Paul Bunyan's coming up to the plate.

239
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

240
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.650
<v 1>Six foot seven.</v>

241
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.410
Just as you see that whole money yet against Seattle the other night,

242
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:24.590
he almost fucking hit it out of the stadium and that's supposed to be able to do

243
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:29.480
that.
He hit it so hard,
so fucking far,
they,
they,
they couldn't measure it.

244
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.840
I think these are like 440 feet,
which,
you know,
I've heard of shit go on farther,

245
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:38.500
but it's like,
that's just because of the stop top of the stadium stopped it.

246
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.720
Um,
Jesus,
they'll,
Seattle pitches get lit up.

247
00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:48.580
Don't they give me see that one McGuire hit off of,
uh,
Randy Johnson.

248
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.920
No one's put a hole in the roof of the fucking kingdom.
Um,
yeah,

249
00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:55.930
that was a brutal combination of like a,

250
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.260
like a hundred mile an hour pitch meeting.

251
00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:03.100
Fucking Andrew Steam how,
whenever the fuck he was on.

252
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:04.883
Um,

253
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.730
if you're old enough to remember what it was like to watch a roid it up,

254
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.400
professional athlete hitting baseballs and watching the though that fucking

255
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:19.330
laser show that those guys put on.
I don't think you can argue

256
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:20.850
<v 2>okay</v>

257
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.280
<v 1>that that steroids definitely should be in the game.</v>

258
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.940
They're gonna be like,

259
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.900
all they gotta do is just work on the side effects and just get it down just

260
00:16:30.901 --> 00:16:33.810
like weed,
you know where he got the,
at the uh,
the vaporizer.

261
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.800
Just if they can vaporize like steroids.

262
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.150
Can you imagine that you pull a muscle or whatever the fuck you feel like an old

263
00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:45.360
man he is just breathe in that mist.

264
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.690
You fucking muscles repair like a Goddamn ex med and every day feels like the

265
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:55.440
first day of spring.
Oh my God.
Am I swinging Tony Bennett?
Every,

266
00:16:55.441 --> 00:17:00.441
if I ruled the world every day would be like the first day of spring.

267
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:05.600
So they'd done it at like,

268
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.303
<v 2>yeah,</v>

269
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.540
<v 1>with Aaron Judge,
I just had that,</v>

270
00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:14.541
that's the greatest fucking franchise of all time is far as their ability to see

271
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:19.260
the guy.
No,
the guy is the guy and somehow sign them before anybody else.

272
00:17:19.261 --> 00:17:20.520
I don't know how the fuck they do it.

273
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.490
Like how does everybody else miss out on Aaron?
Judge,

274
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.570
I could see missing out a Derek Jeter,
you know,

275
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.680
I could definitely see that he was a kid,
you know,
and another six,
three,
six,

276
00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:34.440
four fucking guy.
I mean there's a zillion of those,

277
00:17:34.441 --> 00:17:39.441
but as six foot seven guy coming up there like the fucking jolly green giant,

278
00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:44.310
like how do you miss that guy somehow everybody does.
Um,

279
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.480
I know there's probably some people out there arguing for the Lakers and I got

280
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.870
to give respect to the Lakers as,

281
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.830
as in my lifetime from 1968 until now,

282
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.160
the Los Angeles Lakers have won more championships than anybody else in my

283
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:01.490
lifetime.
Believe it or not.
It is the Lakers stay one.
Uh,
let's,

284
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.430
they won like one in the 70s,
five in the 80s.

285
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.900
That's a,
that's six.
And then they won.

286
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.700
They won five with Colby and a thousand fucking free agents.

287
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.220
Um,
so that's 11.

288
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.940
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

289
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.450
<v 1>the only person that comes close to that in my lifetime and be the Canadians</v>

290
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:27.750
where they want it.
68,
69,
71 73,

291
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.660
76,
77,
78,
79 86 93 they want 10.

292
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.050
Um,
anyways,

293
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.570
but I don't kind of like the Lakers,
like

294
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.280
the real story of the Los Angeles Lakers is fucking free agents.
You know,

295
00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:48.700
like when they always stay.
I,
he's tried to get someone to join and be,

296
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.750
become part of the history of the Great Lakers centers in every one of them is a

297
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:57.260
fucking free agent except for the first giant white dude that George,

298
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.500
whatever the fuck his name was.
Alma said mirror son.

299
00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:03.290
What the fuck was that guy's name?
I don't know.

300
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:07.460
He looked like a giant science teacher.
He actually played with Minneapolis.

301
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.080
Mike in the fuck was his name.
I can't remember.
Anyways,

302
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.760
then you got Kareem,

303
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:18.650
he was a Milwaukee Buck right shack.

304
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.490
Like they're all just fucking,
you know,
wilt,

305
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.110
they're all just from someplace else.

306
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:28.490
So I have a bad feeling that fucking Lebron James is going to go out there and

307
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:31.250
that the Lakers are eventually,
you know,

308
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:37.340
despite whatever Danny Ainge does,
I just think it's inevitable that the Lakers,

309
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.610
it will pass the Celtics as far as number of championships because for the

310
00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:47.120
simple fact,
we can not offer what the Lakers can offer.

311
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.010
I've said this before,
like this is our pitch.
Hey,
you know,

312
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.750
do you want to come to racist Boston with Shitty fucking weather and Bang sixes

313
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.550
or do you want to go to racist fucking Los Angeles,

314
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.230
fuck movie stars and feel like you're in Hawaii with the weather.

315
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.720
You know what I mean?
We can,
we can't fucking compete with that.

316
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.740
We can't compete with that.
So that's,
that's fucking it.
Now,
you know,

317
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:19.100
and then like our colors,
you know,
our fucking mascot's a Goddamn Leprechaun.

318
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:23.770
I mean,
we just can't get any wider.
The Lakers have like,
you know,
you know the,

319
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.300
the colors is somebody that has no money but they want,

320
00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:28.330
they want a fucking look like they're doing something right.

321
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

322
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.200
<v 1>That's what the Lakers colors up with the gold.
And the purple,</v>

323
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:40.140
you know what I mean?
The Lakers just scream new money.

324
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.100
Like you remember when you used to watch those MTV cribs and you'd watch some

325
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.050
fucking idiot,
you know,

326
00:20:46.051 --> 00:20:50.440
with a giant fucking need to have like a fish tank in his fireplace,
you know?

327
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:55.240
Yet the fire still works on,
you know,
like those,
you look at that Shit,
you like,

328
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:58.630
this guy's going to go fucking broken.
This guy's going to go pro.

329
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:01.270
Like he's got like 20 people hanging out in his fucking house.

330
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.380
This guy's going to go broke.
That's when I look at the Lakers uniform.

331
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.960
That's what I see.
Especially those old road ones,
those purple ones.

332
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.600
Um,
I dunno,
I always thought there if their uniforms were a little silly.

333
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.310
I like the,
the home ones,
but the road ones always looked really silly to me.
Um,

334
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.360
but anyways,
would you,
and I was just like,
you know,
green and white,

335
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.950
we got a fucking Oh,
a topic your morning until,
yeah.
Fucking mascot.

336
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.590
I mean,
I can't imagine what Danny Ainge has to say to people to try to get them

337
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.450
to come to Boston.
No,
no,
no,
no.

338
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.130
The n word that was shouted at a red sox game this year,
not at a Celtics game.

339
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.780
It's fucking brutal.
Um,
having said that though,

340
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:53.230
I feel like the cops in La beat the shit out of black people way more.
I Dunno.

341
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.880
It's a push.
As far as like the racism,
it's a real,
it's a push.

342
00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:58.781
You know,

343
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:02.050
people always sit there and they try to act like all the racism is in the south

344
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:04.410
and in Boston.
But you go out to la,
it's fucking ridiculous.

345
00:22:04.411 --> 00:22:09.100
They got all the black people quarantined,
you know,
in this little area.

346
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.750
That's coincidentally enough,
final approach for fucking lax.

347
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:16.570
They get goddamned jets flying over their fucking heads every day,

348
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:23.290
fucking 500 feet off the fucking ground for runways all day long.

349
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.520
People just landing on final fucking approach.
You know,

350
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.880
that wouldn't make you fucking be in a certain mood.
I know it would,
would make,

351
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.290
um,
anyways,
let me read a little bit of advertising here.

352
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.650
I know my stomach is grumbling here.
This always happens when I have the fucking,

353
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.230
uh,
the recording here.
So I'm on my fucking eye of acting work diet,
so I don't,

354
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:48.550
uh,
I go 12 hours without from the last time I ate,

355
00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:50.050
ate about 10 o'clock last night.

356
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:52.330
Something you gonna have to deal with the rumbling and the grumbling here.

357
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.920
Alright.
Oh Jesus,

you feel when you listen to easy listening.

400
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.330
Just imagine your balls feeling like that.

401
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:48.740
That's what it's like wearing this underwear.

Is that for like fucking black guys over in their 50s?

416

Let's get back to the podcast,
the one up,
up,

461
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:37.890
up,
up.
Oh,
when else did I want to talk about?

462
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:42.160
I don't know if I have anything else to talk about.
Too busy out getting picked

463
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.030
<v 1>up by the sad van,
the sad van that always takes you to this set.</v>

464
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.070
It's a bare bones van.

465
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:52.780
It's always white with either gray or black vinyl interior.

466
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.790
And you just get in there and you're just like,
I don't know.

467
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.930
I find it very stressful,
this acting shit,
you know what I mean?

468
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.970
Um,
because I never could just focus on the day.

469
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:07.720
I always look at it like I'm always looking at the entire shoe.

470
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.780
Like I've already thought like,
you know,
you know,

471
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:13.870
this time next week I'll be done.
You know,

472
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.940
rather than trying to enjoy it.

473
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.690
So I learned a long time ago,

474
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.440
well I can't say I learned it because I'm still stressing about it,

475
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.960
but I've just kinda learned to be like,
okay,
you know,

476
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:31.300
I am just going to just fucking deal with today when it comes to these acting

477
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:32.140
gigs and just be like,

478
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:36.970
we're just doing this scene and I've got to make these choices and this is what

479
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:40.330
I'm going to do and I'm going to listen to the fucker director if he wants it

480
00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:43.750
this way,
I'll do it that way.
Bucket that can take a day and then that'll be it.

481
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.290
And then I'll go home and then I'll memorize the lines for the next day and then

482
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:48.790
I'll just fucking do that.
And I could just,

483
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.730
rather than fucking looking over the horizon,

484
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.050
just dealing with that fucking day,
you know?
I know that sounds fucking weird,

485
00:30:56.051 --> 00:31:00.730
but that's how I have to do it.
Cause if I,
if I don't do it that way,
then I,
I,
uh,

486
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.121
you know what I mean?
It's,

487
00:31:02.121 --> 00:31:05.200
it's the kind of thing that stops you from fucking looking at your taxes.

488
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.323
You know what I mean?

489
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.920
If you're incorporated and you play like quarterly taxes and shit.

490
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.680
You know what I mean?
If you,
if you don't pay quarterly,

491
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:16.960
you got like the end of the years I fucking,

492
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.110
I ended up every month I get my receipts together,
I get everything.

493
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.730
It fucking sucks but only sucks for like an hour,
you know what I mean?

494
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.020
As opposed to waiting the entire fucking year and it takes like three days to

495
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:31.150
get through the shit.
Um,

496
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.530
it also lets me know what the fuck I'm spending and um,

497
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.790
and all of that type of ships.
So did that make any sense?

498
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:41.310
Cause it didn't even make sense to me.
All right.

499
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.960
Why don't I just get out of this shit and I'm just going to read a few of these

500
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:47.690
questions,
a couple of these questions.
All right.
On the,
uh,

501
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.091
all right.

502
00:31:49.091 --> 00:31:52.140
For those of you listened to his podcast religiously or maybe cut the last one.

503
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.833
<v 0>MMM.</v>

504
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.830
<v 1>I was asking like how that expression came about because I brought it up in the</v>

505
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:03.820
writer's room.
I used,
uh,
fourF is for family.
I was talking about a,

506
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.190
it's on the arm and it was a number of people that had never heard that

507
00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:09.890
expression.
And I said,
well it means yeah,
it means it's free.

508
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.880
You don't have to pay for it.

509
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.563
<v 0>MMM.</v>

510
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.730
<v 1>And then when I was looking it up,
trying to figure out where it came from,</v>

511
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:20.230
it said it was a,
a um,
yeah,

512
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:22.040
it came from like law enforcement or whatever.

513
00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:25.160
But evidently I was wrong cause someone else went to another part of the

514
00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:28.160
Internet and they came up with this,
it said,
Bill,

515
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.200
here's what the internet said about on the arm or ears,

516
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.530
what you found that it's said,

517
00:32:33.531 --> 00:32:37.490
because what I found that it said was about those from came from the fucking law

518
00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:39.050
enforcement.
He,
this person,

519
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.380
<v 3>uh,</v>

520
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.110
to show their respects to the mafia boss who protected their neighborhood.

521
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.800
Um,
or fear of being extorted.

522
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.510
The store owners would not allow them to pay for items.
Well,

523
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:56.090
if you're afraid that you're going to be extorted,
I don't think that,

524
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:59.240
like bowing down to somebody.
You should make them fucking pay for it,

525
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.650
I would think.
But anyways.
Um,

526
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.350
the store owners would take their right hand and brush it against their left arm

527
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.730
as a way of saying,
forget about it.
No charge free.

528
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.560
All right.
Well where I looked at it that it came from,

529
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:19.610
it came from law enforcement that the cops wouldn't pay for stuff.
I don't know.

530
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.420
Yeah.
The fuck knows it's the internet.
You don't know what's true.

531
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:25.810
You don't know what isn't.
Right.

532
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

533
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.540
<v 3>How far did you look?
How far onto the Internet did you go?</v>

534
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.620
Let me see how far it took me to get.
Okay.
On the arm,
here we go.

535
00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:36.150
On the [inaudible]

536
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:43.010
origin.
Come on man.
Come on.

537
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:46.430
Internet work for me on the arm.
Any he did to his origin.

538
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.470
Is it that the police might have threatened with his gun?

539
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.010
I doubt it,
but I'm just trying to figure out this is what I get.

540
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.190
That's the first one.
The first one.

541
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.720
It's just one of these,
what are these fucking chat rooms by the way,

542
00:34:04.721 --> 00:34:08.770
and who and who are these people in them?
Where are these things?

543
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.930
How do you chime in to these things?
You got to sign in on,

544
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:16.310
I'm on like word reference.com and this guy just rights or this woman writes,

545
00:34:16.601 --> 00:34:20.260
hi there.
I heard the phrase on the arm in the movie,

546
00:34:20.261 --> 00:34:22.900
Donnie Brasco about a Mafia guy,

547
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.630
Al Pachino as an undercover policeman.

548
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.810
Parentheses Johnny Depp is their movie.
That old.

549
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.300
He could have just said fucking Donnie Brasco people know who's in it.

550
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.500
I learned that it's police lingo for free of charge.

551
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.570
Any idea as to its origin?

552
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:41.410
Is it that the policemen might have threatened with his gun?

553
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.330
I doubted,
but I'm just trying to figure DRM in there.

554
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:53.480
Like why would you present a theory and then doubt your own fucking theory?

555
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.123
<v 2>MMM.</v>

556
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.140
<v 3>Here is what the People's response was.</v>

557
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.150
Okay.
Dictionary georeferenced somebody has this click on this arm.

558
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.880
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.690
<v 3>The upper limb of the human body,
especially part extending from the shoulder.</v>

560
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:19.620
There was a series,
the upper limb from the show,
the foreign land,
the verb base,

561
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.050
any arm like attachment,

562
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.580
an administrative or operational branch of an organization,

563
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.000
an arm or a leg is a great deal of money.

564
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

565
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.920
<v 3>Uh,
arm and arm,
arms linked together and arm's length on the arm,</v>

566
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.980
a slang free of charge.

567
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.030
And investigation of policemen who ate lunch on the arm,

568
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.360
uh,
put the arm on to solicit or borrow money from.

569
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.930
She put the arm on me for a generous contribution to force or use violence on

570
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.410
you strong.
I,
you know what,
I don't even give a shit.
This is what happened.

571
00:36:02.411 --> 00:36:04.380
And by the time I get to this part of the Internet I was like,

572
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:08.880
I don't fucking care.
And there's usually something I can click on the side like,

573
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.600
oh look at Tyson.
Keep it real.
Keep it Tyson.

574
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.921
Check them out.

575
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:18.921
I guess it's some sort of fucking lunchmeat luxury now what about me fucking I

576
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:22.020
guess cause it's on the arm.
Like they think somebody wants a free sandwich.

577
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.170
Catch it at a store near you.

578
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.970
Some giant fish.
Oh,

579
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:34.170
where did the day high Falutin that's a word I thought that was just something

580
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:38.610
you said.
You him,
me sandwich.
Say Dag burn highfalutin environment.

581
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.133
Um,

582
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.110
Dominic was at the back at a back table talking to a suited man in the psalm.

583
00:36:45.111 --> 00:36:45.944
Bray.

584
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.920
And the somber high Falutin English she put on for four people of stature.

585
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.020
I'll,
it's like Madonna in this case,
probably the noodle salesman.

586
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.810
I have no idea what that sentence meant and I,

587
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.590
I probably mispronounced most of it,
but Donna puts on the fake accident,

588
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:04.980
you know,

589
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.800
why does she not act like she's just some white trash chick from Detroit?

590
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.530
She got that stupid English accent now.
Uh,

591
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.270
border land still love it.
So,
alright,

592
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.360
solution to dude's girlfriend with the gross teeth.
Oh my God.

593
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:21.990
Well this fucking story ever end.
Hey Billy.

594
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:25.350
Ginger vite is a,
that's a clever one.

595
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.780
I found a real easy solution for the dude says that's dating the girl with crows

596
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.430
teeth.
Yes.
So did I dumper?

597
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.110
All you got to do is when you're sitting down to watch a movie just happened to

598
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:38.820
put on Austin Powers.

599
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.340
There's a couple of different scenes where the woman,
Austin is trying to bang,

600
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:48.780
hint hints that Austin needs to brush his gross fucking teeth.

601
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.300
This would be a good subtle way for a girl to realize that maybe she should take

602
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:58.620
care of her own teeth because believe me,
she knows they are disgusting.

603
00:37:59.490 --> 00:37:59.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

604
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.820
<v 3>Wait,</v>

605
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.550
who walks around know that they stink when should do something about that.

606
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.240
And plus,
I don't think that,
you know,
if you're with somebody who's overweight,

607
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:11.910
if you put it on the clumps,
you know,

608
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.810
the nutty professor,
I mean,

609
00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:18.350
I think it would just make them feel self conscious and bad about themselves and

610
00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:21.470
make the,
the old person want to go fucking binge eat more.

611
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.670
I Dunno what the gross tooth person does it go eat some fucking

612
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.950
fucking head cheese with the,
I don't know,
some onions.
I Dunno.
Anyways,

613
00:38:30.951 --> 00:38:33.980
he said you could maybe even say something during the scene like,
yeah,

614
00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:37.230
why the British tea people have gross teeth.
Yeah.

615
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:42.710
And he goes,
I dunno,
probably won't work,
but it's worth the try.

616
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.120
Is this everybody just shits on their own theories.
Yeah.
Dude,
this won't work.

617
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.660
You know,
it won't work,
but it was worth it for your Billy gingivitis.

618
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.480
Uh,
also built,
uh,
have you been doing any grilling or smoking this summer?

619
00:38:56.481 --> 00:39:00.290
I recently did some smoked chicken wings and they were the best ones I've ever

620
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.230
eight hands down.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
No,

621
00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.460
<v 1>my,
my,
uh,
my grill,</v>

622
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:12.500
my big green egg and my flat top grill have been like,

623
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.100
you know,
if they were a car,
I'd have him up on blocks right now.

624
00:39:16.101 --> 00:39:20.570
I just been so swamped with the work,

625
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.810
um,
you know,
and I got the kid and it's just like,

626
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.420
I dunno,
I occasionally I will crank the thing up and I get into it,
but,

627
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.680
um,
I pitch been super,
super fucking busy writing,
writing and writing,

628
00:39:36.681 --> 00:39:41.480
but I gotta tell you sentiment.
I actually really enjoy writing.
Like,
um,

629
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.760
I hate the notes part and having a pull it apart.
I get frustrated with that,

630
00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:49.710
but that really is part of it.
And people always goes,
well,

631
00:39:49.711 --> 00:39:53.550
you know what they say?
Writing is rewriting.
And I always want to be like,
yeah.

632
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.620
Is that what they say?

633
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.610
<v 3>Like,
whatever the fuck you do for a living.
Can you imagine if she just fucking,</v>

634
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:01.150
if you feel,

635
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:05.200
if you put in floors and you put in all the floors in and then somebody comes in

636
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:06.640
and tells you to rip up most of it,

637
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.290
<v 1>you know,
and you're like,
really?
And Hey,
you know what flooring is?</v>

638
00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:14.220
Flooring is reflowing when she want to just take the board and just fucking

639
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:16.650
smash your own head in with it too.
You just weren't consciously,

640
00:40:16.651 --> 00:40:19.920
you wouldn't have to live that life anymore.
Well,
that's the life of a writer.

641
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.880
But I actually,
uh,

642
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:29.150
I really found that I liked doing it and I think just by hanging out with all of

643
00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:31.950
these writers that have been doing it for so long,

644
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.760
obviously they're way better at it than I am,
but you just kind of

645
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.670
start to absorb.

646
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

647
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.240
<v 1>How to write stories and shit like that,
which was always my problem.</v>

648
00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:44.530
I could always write dialogue,

649
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:48.840
but I just couldn't get the story from the beginning to the end.
Like I,

650
00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.170
my brain just didn't work that way.
I could write scenes.

651
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.650
I think that's why I became a comedian because I bits like,
oh,
look at that.

652
00:40:56.651 --> 00:40:59.290
That's a funny joke.
That's a funny little scenario and done.

653
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.350
I don't have to fucking take the ball from the one yard line all the way to the

654
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:06.880
end zone like,
like writers have to,
you know,
I was on special teams.

655
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:11.500
That was a wedge breaker.
That was it.

656
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:16.090
That was the fucking level of,
of ad history that I was doing there.

657
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.320
What am I up to here for 41 minutes?
Jesus Christ.
Bill 41 minutes.

658
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.150
Fucking mediocrity.
Alright.
Microchipping Oh God.

659
00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:29.980
Don't even get me started on this.
I just cannot fucking,

660
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:34.050
but like,
I just can't

661
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.010
<v 2>fucking believe this shit.</v>

662
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.660
Do you know Delta Airlines wants to start using people's fingerprints

663
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.280
<v 1>as a way for you to get on the fucking plane and do you know that most people</v>

664
00:41:45.281 --> 00:41:48.520
won't have a problem with it is so fucking stupid.

665
00:41:48.521 --> 00:41:51.910
It's like there's so many people out in the world.
It's almost like,

666
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:54.880
you know what dude?
Why don't you just become a fucking slave?

667
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.430
Like how much are you going to give to these people?

668
00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.930
How underpaid a politicians that they will not stand up to these people,

669
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.570
these corporations,
I swear to God,

670
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.290
they sitting there wasting all this fucking time with Isis and all this other

671
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:10.780
bullshit,
these fucking corporations,
the mud,

672
00:42:10.781 --> 00:42:13.700
the shit that they're doing to their own goddamn countryman,

673
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.780
which they really don't have because they're fucking global.

674
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.700
They don't give a shit about anything about just trying to make more fucking

675
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:26.200
money and do they want,
they're going to start with microchip and people.

676
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:31.410
It's what's called Wisconsin Company to implant Mike implanting microchips,
uh,

677
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.310
in employees
in like,
like five people already agreed to it.

678
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.610
They're going to take something foreign that's not natural to your body,

679
00:42:39.611 --> 00:42:41.890
and they're going to stick it underneath your fucking skin.

680
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.940
They're going to know where you are at all fucking times and all these fucking

681
00:42:45.941 --> 00:42:49.900
dope.
We're here.
You know?
[inaudible] we keep fucking prevalent.

682
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.330
Here's the fucking problem,
okay?

683
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:57.390
Just because you're a fucking dope doesn't mean the rest of the world is okay.

684
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.720
I think it's safe to say that me and everybody else listening to this thing,

685
00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:06.400
for the most part was not as smart.
It's fucking George Washington,
right?

686
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.280
Fair enough.
Okay,
well,
here's the deal.

687
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.590
If George Washington was microchipped and all his fucking buddies where

688
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:13.181
microchip,

689
00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:17.320
this fucking country wouldn't exist because they would have known where he was,

690
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.020
they would've gone over there and they would have fucking killed him and that

691
00:43:20.021 --> 00:43:23.110
would have been the end of the fucking rebellion.
So what you're doing is,

692
00:43:23.111 --> 00:43:26.860
is you're having faith that these fucking people at the top who have not even

693
00:43:26.861 --> 00:43:30.190
remotely demonstrated on any fucking level at any point in history,

694
00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:34.390
that they give a flying fuck about anybody other than themselves are going to,

695
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.430
you're going to turn over that level of power.

696
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.670
You're going to get fingerprinted by Delta fucking airlines,

697
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.070
like you've committed some sort of a fucking crime.

698
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.420
If fucking airline is going to have your fucking fingerprints,

699
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.440
who in the fuck did they think they are?
Do you know what?
I went to buy my car.

700
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:52.510
They asked for my thumbprint.
I was like,

701
00:43:52.511 --> 00:43:56.930
I'm not getting my fucking fingerprints to it.
You're a car dealership.
They go,

702
00:43:56.931 --> 00:43:58.960
well,
this is to protect you.
No,
it isn't yet douche.

703
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.620
You're going to sell this to somebody is part of my profile.

704
00:44:02.621 --> 00:44:04.120
I think they're just,
they're collecting,

705
00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:07.660
they're all sharing information about you,
what you buy,
where you live,

706
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.720
what you social security number is your fucking fingerprints.

707
00:44:10.721 --> 00:44:13.000
They're gonna get it all the way down to your fucking DNA.

708
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.830
It's an it's,
I dunno.

709
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

710
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.710
<v 1>And these politicians will not push back on any level because the president</v>

711
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.210
makes 500 grand a year.

712
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.170
That's the highest paid political office is 500 fucking grand a year.

713
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:33.510
And they need $100 million.
Get the job.
I don't have 100 million.

714
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.320
You don't have 100 million corporation still.
And that's who they all were too.

715
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:40.200
So they just look the other fucking way.
And what do they do?

716
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:43.740
They sit there and they shit on fucking comedians constantly going after.

717
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:45.510
Do you hear what he said about Caitlyn Jenner?

718
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.140
And they look the other way with pharmaceutical companies handing out fucking

719
00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:49.651
opiates.

720
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:53.430
Like they're giving out flyers to some sort of jam band and now we got this

721
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:56.220
heroin fucking problem.
They don't give a fuck.
They don't say anything about it.

722
00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.810
Sorry.
I know I'm fucking losing my shit here.
But like

723
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.690
what they've done to the food supply,
what the fuck they,

724
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.180
they that what the bankers have done left all these people upside down in their

725
00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:14.030
own fucking houses.
What they've done to the water supply,

726
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:18.470
fracking causing earthquakes in parts of the world that never had fucking

727
00:45:18.471 --> 00:45:22.780
earthquakes fucking up the drinking water.
You know,

728
00:45:22.781 --> 00:45:26.140
they got to send a fucking pipeline out of the fucking native Americans land.

729
00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:29.500
I mean,
like,
like we haven't done enough to those fucking people,

730
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.850
you know?
Do you hear any politicians talking about that now?

731
00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.300
Nobody talks about that shit,
but God for fucking bid,

732
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.990
you'd do a fucking joke in a strip mall and it fucking all over it.

733
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.050
Then that becomes like some big goddamn story.
Um,

734
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.530
this is fucking horrific and it makes me happy.
Then I'm 49 years of age.

735
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.480
The fact that I think I'm going to maybe get to live half a fucking century

736
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.400
without a fucking airline having my fingerprints and me walking around with the

737
00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.300
goddamn microchip.
You know,
I love that.
I lived 50 years before the fucking,

738
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.860
oh Jesus.
She's up.
Huh.
Um,
I love that.

739
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:09.690
And I got to live 50 years before robots showed up.
Um,

740
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.100
it's just,

741
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.020
<v 2>okay,</v>

742
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.660
<v 1>it's just greed and power.
Completely.</v>

743
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.570
100% out of control.

744
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:25.010
And I hate like this is,
I'm reading this,

745
00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:29.270
this is eye witness ABC News.
So these guys are all bought and paid for.

746
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.890
CNN is bought and paid for a Fox News is bought and paypal,

747
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.440
they're all fucking bought and paid for because the same people I just brought

748
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:37.190
brought up,

749
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:41.300
they advertise on their fucking networks so they have to watch what they say

750
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.990
cause they don't want to lose the ad money cause that's how they get paid.
Right.

751
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.090
So they always have like the Oh Geez this is a little unsettling.
You don't,

752
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:51.330
when they always come back from it,

753
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.630
when they show some fucking robot you've ever seen that you watched the local

754
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:59.190
news or they showed somebody getting microchip and they always come back to the

755
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:01.730
anchors and they kind of do that.
Ooh that's kind of a,

756
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.220
and then they just move on to the next thing.

757
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.430
But some fucking old lady who makes her own jam,

758
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:11.430
like that's supposed to make you feel better at the end of the fucking newscast.

759
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:16.350
Some puppy that they thought was lost and fucking sniffed its way back to the

760
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:20.310
station wagon,
three towns away,
right?
Whenever the fuck they leave you on.

761
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.870
Um,
no.

762
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.490
Corporations are completely out of control.

763
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.130
They've been out of control entire life.
And

764
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:35.110
<v 3>now it's,
it's reaching a level that it's like you're watching a bad scifi movie.</v>

765
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:38.140
I think it's fucking insane.
Why?

766
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.170
Why the fuck do you need my fingerprint as a fucking airline?

767
00:47:42.171 --> 00:47:46.040
Who the fuck are you?
You're not the FBI.
You're not the government.

768
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:47.270
You're a fucking airline.

769
00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.940
Your fingerprint.
And this is the thing people will do.

770
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:57.330
People will fucking do all of this so they don't have to stand in a line.

771
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.533
<v 2>Hm.</v>

772
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.040
<v 3>They'll let them scan their fucking retina.</v>

773
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.900
Don't give them a fucking baby just so they can be pre checked.

774
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.700
That's all you gotta do.

775
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.350
You just hold a little cookie out and the average fucking mouth breathing and

776
00:48:12.351 --> 00:48:15.450
fucking moron.
But you know something,
I go to a swear to God.
I mean,

777
00:48:15.451 --> 00:48:16.530
this is really cynical,
but I,

778
00:48:16.531 --> 00:48:19.410
you walk around and I fought and got half the fucking people should be

779
00:48:19.411 --> 00:48:22.510
microchipped.
You should know where these fucking idiots are.

780
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.940
I'll never forget that guy gallop and sideways on that Trump rally screaming at

781
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:36.500
all these stupid liberals going,
fuck political correctness.
Build the wall.

782
00:48:36.501 --> 00:48:39.200
Build the wall is he's fucking gallop and like,

783
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.600
like that was going to make his life better.

784
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

785
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.550
<v 3>Like that was what was holding him back.
I swear to God,</v>

786
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.773
<v 0>like</v>

787
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.540
<v 3>I don't give a fuck how dumb you are.</v>

788
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:56.560
You have to know as a white dude if you were born in the United States of

789
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.393
America,
okay,

790
00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:02.020
you're not going to get a better starting block than that.

791
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.930
All right?
And if you can't figure out,

792
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.070
<v 2>okay,</v>

793
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.950
<v 3>some sort of gay,
I mean,
if you're going to fucking blame anybody,</v>

794
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.320
why don't you going to look down?
You got to go up.

795
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.600
That's what's fucking you over.

796
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.220
Democrats and Republicans fucking you over.

797
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:24.350
I just don't get how people don't see that.
Um,
but I'm like most people,

798
00:49:24.351 --> 00:49:27.110
I feel like my ideas are right and no one else has a good point.

799
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:31.323
<v 0>MMM,</v>

800
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.980
<v 3>unreal.
This fucking car dealership,
can we get your thumb print?
It's like,
yeah,</v>

801
00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:40.330
no,
you guys sell cars.
Do you understand that?

802
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.950
You guys lie for a living?

803
00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:47.330
Other salesmen who lie for a living turn the other way.
You're like,

804
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.140
turn the other way.
When they see a car salesman,
you like the head,

805
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.070
<v 2>okay,</v>

806
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.430
<v 3>you like the bottom of the barrel fucking salesman here.</v>

807
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:55.700
I'm going to give you my fingerprint.

808
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.610
You know why they said they wanted my fingerprint?

809
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.150
They go just in case somebody comes in and tries to,

810
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.820
it's an imposter and pretends that they're you and tries to buy a car and I just

811
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:09.160
looked at the guy and I was like,
you know what?

812
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:10.740
I'm going to take my chances on that.

813
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.630
Did the guy literally goes in,
this one killed me.
He goes,

814
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.220
you're the first person we've ever have say no to that.

815
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.010
Now I hope he's just being a car salesman.

816
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:31.610
And he was lying to me and that was his last ditch effort to try to convince me.

817
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:33.833
<v 0>MMM.</v>

818
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.650
<v 3>But uh,
the other part is he actually telling the truth.
It's just like,</v>

819
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.020
then what happens is what,

820
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.700
this is how they do it is most people are adults.

821
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.900
So they don't think,

822
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.380
and then what happens is it becomes a herd mentality and all they gotta do is

823
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.080
get most of the herd to start running over the fucking cliff.

824
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.200
And you have to do it too.
Cause if you don't,

825
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:01.460
then you're just going to be fucking sitting there all by yourself.
Like,
Hey,

826
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:03.860
I'm not going to have a cell phone.
Hey,
I'm not going to have this.

827
00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:06.590
I'm not going to have that.
And then your life,

828
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:09.050
the way you're going to lead it becomes extremely limited.

829
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.310
And next thing you know,

830
00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.660
you fucking half naked walking around your backyard trying to like trap

831
00:51:14.661 --> 00:51:15.171
squirrels,

832
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:19.310
seek and eat that day because you're not doing what everybody else is doing.

833
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.910
It's just,
you know,
it's going to be the worst is when they try to convince,

834
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.793
<v 0>uh,</v>

835
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.390
<v 3>when they try to convince people to do it right.</v>

836
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.080
There's going to be some politician getting it with that fucking smile on his

837
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:39.110
face where he's like,
I don't want to do this,
but I have to do this.

838
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.270
I have to do this so I can go on the post president fucking,

839
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.860
you know,

840
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:50.780
$70 million speaking tour where I go out and I give speeches to the same fucking

841
00:51:50.781 --> 00:51:55.280
people that put me into office.
Like the hero of all hero presidents.

842
00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:56.870
Obama is about to do.
He just,

843
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:01.700
he has that motherfucker has $69 million with the gigs on the books

844
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.800
<v 0>coming up.
You know,</v>

845
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.300
<v 3>I will never,
for the life of me understand why that guy,</v>

846
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.260
people like liberals look at that guy like he fucking did something for them.

847
00:52:13.261 --> 00:52:14.280
I will never get that.

848
00:52:14.281 --> 00:52:17.970
It's like that guy had his face in the pig trough just like everybody else.

849
00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:19.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

850
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.930
<v 3>I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno what it is.</v>

851
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.980
I think it's because he's sandwiched between two of the worst public speakers of

852
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:28.340
all time,
Bush and fucking Trump.
You know what I mean?

853
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.900
I think if he came after Clinton where Clinton wasn't the greatest,
oh,
whoa.
Oh,

854
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:36.200
whoa.
But he,
I dunno,
the women fucking loved them.
I will never get that either.

855
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:41.240
How much women love that fucking big fucking baby.
He,
we look at goofball.

856
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.310
Um,
Jesus bell there.
Any presidency you liked?
Yeah,
I lied in mind.

857
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:51.170
The first George Bush fucking war hero and I liked,
uh,

858
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.620
I liked Jimmy Carter
anyways.
All right.

859
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:57.300
B of a outage.

860
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:58.503
<v 0>Uh,</v>

861
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:04.410
<v 3>hey banker bill.
I worked for B of a and from the customer service side,</v>

862
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.850
that outrage was very stressful.
If you haven't already mentioned it.

863
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:11.460
Slash found out the outrage was a result

864
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.020
<v 0>of a</v>

865
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.640
<v 3>Oh Jesus Christ.
This guy works for the fucking bank.
He's going to,</v>

866
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.310
he's going to tell me what happened and he can't even spell the words were I

867
00:53:20.311 --> 00:53:21.144
don't.

868
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

869
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:27.090
<v 3>And aren't you wrote half a word here,
buddy.
S.
E.
V.
E.</v>

870
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:31.500
R a sever reboot.
Is that supposed to be a severe reboot?

871
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.580
Is sever a word.
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong.
Uh,

872
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:37.020
I was told from my boss,

873
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:40.770
my boss's boss and passing when he was leaving work,

874
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:45.330
one of the tech guys managing the server ran a program to check for viruses and

875
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:49.470
shit.
Okay,
this guy manages your money check for viruses and shit.

876
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:55.140
Oh God.
He talks like me and the program made

877
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:57.683
Jesus Christ.

878
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:03.170
The program made that one particular server to shut down causing the rest of our

879
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.930
online products to not work.

880
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:10.350
That's a sentence by a guy who works at a bank.

881
00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:15.351
The program made that one particular server to shut down to shutdown.

882
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.790
The program made that one particular server shut down.
Is that what you mean?

883
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.640
Causing the rest of our online products to not work.

884
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:29.940
The bank had to restart all the servers to sync that tech crap up resulting in

885
00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:34.150
the six hour delay from the call center side.

886
00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:37.660
We could still see all the balances and account information.

887
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.040
Clients themselves just couldn't process any maintenance.

888
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.710
Nothing made my day more enjoyable than apologize into client after client for

889
00:54:47.711 --> 00:54:52.240
our system error.
Had a few people in the situation.
You mentioned on Thursday,

890
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.440
what were they stuck outside the country with no money.

891
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.200
Oh,

892
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.200
had a few people in the situation you mentioned on Thursday where they are stuck

893
00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:07.121
outside.

894
00:55:07.121 --> 00:55:11.590
The of this guy is a fucking this guy who should've been in summer school next

895
00:55:11.591 --> 00:55:13.420
to me.
Totally agree.

896
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:18.280
You need to have backup plans when it comes to accessing your money,

897
00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:23.440
whether it be multiple bank accounts or stuffing some cash underneath the pillow

898
00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:28.370
where you rest your bulb freckled dome at night.
Keep doing what you're doing.

899
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.630
Uh,
and go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

900
00:55:31.631 --> 00:55:34.180
I've never met a banker that believes in the banking system.

901
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.140
If you really talk to them about it,
they're nervous to,

902
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.250
I dunno.
Anyways.
Uh,

903
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.460
was that supposed to make me feel better?
I mean,

904
00:55:45.461 --> 00:55:47.560
I guess it's good that no one hacked into your system.

905
00:55:47.561 --> 00:55:52.170
You guys just kind of were running something to some got fucked up.
Um,

906
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.210
but he agreed with me.
Yeah.
Have a little money here.
A little money.

907
00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:57.760
They're a little money there.
Don't have it all your eggs in one basket.

908
00:55:57.761 --> 00:55:58.720
We all know that.
Right?

909
00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:03.100
Because then everything's going to be on the arm with the fucking one flew over

910
00:56:03.101 --> 00:56:07.360
the cuckoo's nest.
All right.
Much older man.
Okay,
here we go.
Well,

911
00:56:07.361 --> 00:56:10.930
I'm just trying to buy,
oh,
56.
Okay.
I mean there,
I'm in there.
All right.

912
00:56:10.931 --> 00:56:15.810
Much older man.
Bill Burr.
How are Ya?
I been listening to your part.

913
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.970
I was just from a lady.
I love it.
I love when the ladies right in.

914
00:56:18.971 --> 00:56:21.170
You guys don't do it enough.
Um,

915
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:25.240
I've been listening to your podcast for a little a year basically since the day

916
00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:27.180
I discovered them and I've seen all your specialists.

917
00:56:27.181 --> 00:56:30.130
Hope to catch you live when he stays.
Well,
thank you.
So here it goes.

918
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.600
I've been living for eight years and married for four of those years to a man

919
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:38.170
who was 21 years older than me.
Yeah,

920
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.200
we met when he was 45 and I was 23 and we have been together since Nia.

921
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:51.390
Can you do this one or no?
You can.
Okay.
All right.

922
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:53.483
<v 0>MMM.</v>

923
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:55.230
<v 3>Uh,</v>

924
00:56:55.230 --> 00:57:00.230
we have a two year old son and I am now 31 and he is 52.

925
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:06.210
Okay.
I know many think that when they first heard my husband,

926
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.260
uh,

927
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.180
that my husband is well old enough as well old enough to be my father,

928
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.270
that it's some sort of sugar daddy situation,

929
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:18.330
which honestly is not the case at all.
Our lives are quite simple.

930
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.120
We live in a four bedroom house.
I own two soccer.

931
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:24.150
We own two soccer mom type vehicles.

932
00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.660
The only expensive piece of jewelry to my name is my wedding ring and one would

933
00:57:27.661 --> 00:57:31.560
not find a pair of red bottom shoes in my closet.
But I digress.

934
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:36.060
Only so folks don't get the wrong picture.
Uh,
for the past year or so,

935
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:39.570
it seems like he has aged mentally in a drastic way.

936
00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.940
Our Age difference was never an issue until the last year or so.
Um,

937
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.480
oh look who's here.
Hey Buddy.

938
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.220
Hey Buddy.
How are you doing?

939
00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.020
You're making a lot of racket out there and this is called a podcast.

940
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.780
Um,
anyways,
so anyways,
now here's the deal.
This,
this lady,

941
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:12.210
uh,
is married to this guy.
He's,
he's 21 years older.

942
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.580
Um,
what's going on?
Yeah,
these are had phones.
He's looking at me like,

943
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:22.140
what is this?
What is this?
Um,

944
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:28.080
so if you're going to keep looking at me with that cute little smile,

945
00:58:28.081 --> 00:58:32.340
how do I do this?
All right.
So,

946
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:35.910
uh,
yeah,
she was 23.

947
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:39.570
He was 45,
so I guess he's 22 years old.

948
00:58:39.571 --> 00:58:43.620
And when they met 23 and 45 yeah.

949
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:47.280
And now she's 31 and he's 52.
I don't know.

950
00:58:47.281 --> 00:58:50.400
Somehow he was 22 years old or now he's only 21.

951
00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.010
It must be when their birthdays are.
But anyways,

952
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.140
she said it wasn't a sugar daddy thing.

953
00:58:55.141 --> 00:58:59.760
They don't really have a lot of money that just live in a basic lifestyle.
Oh,

954
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.240
you got to stop smiling kid.
Um,

955
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.570
I'm totally losing my train of thought here.
He just two adorable,

956
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.220
adorable for me to do this.

957
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.790
Yeah,
I know.
That's what,
that's what my listeners that don't,
Eh,

958
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.140
can you get through this place?
Um,

959
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:22.640
so basically she said he only spends piece of jewelry she has is her wedding

960
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:24.500
ring.
She doesn't have any red bottom shoes.

961
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:27.830
She just basically really loves the guy.
Okay.
So,
but for the past year or so,

962
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:31.430
it seems like he is aged mental mentally in a drastic way.

963
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:36.340
Our Age difference was never an issue until the last year or so.
Uh,

964
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.550
he seems to be almost bitter that I'm in my thirties and he's beginning to

965
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:45.230
become beyond insecure that I will decide I want a younger man out of nowhere.

966
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.830
One day,
uh,
I'm all over the place with this.
She says,

967
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:51.230
it seems like you're pretty focused,
sorry.
Anyways,

968
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.840
his constant insecurity and vastly changing behavior is really causing issues in

969
00:59:56.841 --> 00:59:58.940
our marriage that I believe may never go away.

970
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:02.030
Being that our age difference is not going away anywhere.

971
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:07.070
Obviously was hoping for some of your whys input on my current situation or tell

972
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:09.860
me I'm a dumb ass for marrying an older man,

973
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.180
older man than my father.
Like my mother does.
Uh,

974
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:19.610
have a good one.
And of course go fuck yourself.
Uh,
so what do you think Nia?

975
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.590
<v 4>Um,
yeah,</v>

976
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:27.591
he was probably too old for you because now that's just too much of an age of

977
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:32.880
it.
He's older than your dad.
Do you have daddy issues?

978
01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:37.650
Maybe while regardless,
it seems like the power dynamics have shifted.

979
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:42.750
So before you were a young,
you know,
impressionable thing and he was the older,

980
01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:46.140
wiser,
more on control.
Now he's getting older,

981
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.000
he is becoming aware of his mortality and you're in your thirties what your like

982
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.260
your towards your peak now as a woman like that's when you really peak and

983
01:00:55.261 --> 01:00:57.210
you're actually in your forties but you're getting there.

984
01:00:57.211 --> 01:01:00.690
You're probably still hot.
You're smarter than you were before.

985
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.760
You're on top of your game where it's like,
yeah,
he's feeling some type of way.

986
01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:09.930
So I don't know if he's having a midlife crisis.
Yeah.

987
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.610
I don't know if he's having a midlife crisis and you're going to end up being

988
01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:19.020
collateral damage,
um,
or,
or what's going on.

989
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.770
But you guys should probably have like a frank discussion about it.
But yeah,

990
01:01:22.771 --> 01:01:24.660
if he's afraid of you leaving him,

991
01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:28.020
he might be having some kind of a mid life crisis.
All right,

992
01:01:28.021 --> 01:01:32.130
let's have the frank discussion before her.
I'll be the guy.
All right,

993
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.020
well you want to be the guy?
No,
you'd be that.

994
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.610
You'd be the guy because you're the other,

995
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:39.330
you're an actual older guy and our relationship.
So I know it's true.

996
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:42.540
That's just like too on the nose casting.
No,
it's okay that we can,
we can,

997
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:47.250
we can do it that way.
So you're the older guy and I'm the hot young,

998
01:01:47.251 --> 01:01:52.110
new bile wife.
Boy,
you're going to go out where you gone.

999
01:01:52.111 --> 01:01:54.890
You gone out.
Whoa.
No,
I gotta be older.
I'm just done.

1000
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:04.090
My girlfriend.
I told you that.
Did you not?
Do you not remember?

1001
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:08.340
Yeah.
Okay.
Well I'll be back soon.

1002
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:13.150
I told you last night that I was going out with my girlfriends tonight.

1003
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:18.390
I'm going,
I was like,
oh
okay,

1004
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v 3>I'll bring you back something by goes to have an affair with my young lover.</v>

1005
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.360
What do you think you should do?
Just have a talk with them

1006
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.820
<v 5>and if he's like,</v>

1007
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.180
<v 3>what is that noise?</v>

1008
01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:39.320
It's just shown a dump truck makes when it backs up before dumps the load up the

1009
01:02:39.321 --> 01:02:42.740
back.
Married the guy.
She shouldn't just like completely jumps ship.

1010
01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:45.610
But if it's a,
if he's becoming unbearable and you know,

1011
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.700
difficult to live with and he won't make any strides to work it out,

1012
01:02:49.701 --> 01:02:53.450
then why doesn't he take like those legal roids that those old guys that are all

1013
01:02:53.451 --> 01:02:56.750
shredded,
you know,
they jump in the pool,
then they come out and all those,

1014
01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.540
those women who was sitting in the pool like look at that old guy and then he

1015
01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.670
comes out of the pool and then like,
oh wait a minute.

1016
01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:05.660
I think go bang that grandpa.
Well maybe it's too,

1017
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:09.230
because they are live like this,
a very like modest lifestyle.

1018
01:03:09.231 --> 01:03:13.220
He's feeling even more insecure than he doesn't have anything until like offer.

1019
01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:17.300
So even if he wanted to get out of it to like go back to a younger girl or

1020
01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:20.990
something like younger than her,
he wouldn't have anything necessarily to offer.

1021
01:03:20.991 --> 01:03:23.570
And so it's,
yeah,
this guy's an idiot.
I wouldn't have married a girl.

1022
01:03:23.571 --> 01:03:28.340
Then younger.
I remember a time before I met uni,
I was like,

1023
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:33.500
what was I 35 or something?
One of those when I was 25 years.
35 all right.

1024
01:03:33.501 --> 01:03:38.330
So I was like,
whatever,
34 35 and I met this woman,
right.
And she was like 22,

1025
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:43.700
2122 and she said the first night we hung out,
she goes,
where's this going?

1026
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.160
I remember you told me this story.
Yeah.
And I said,
where's it going?
I go nowhere.

1027
01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:53.840
I go by when you're 30.
And we'd be like 106,
so this isn't going anywhere.

1028
01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:58.520
So I won't say what I said next,
but it worked out well.
Um,

1029
01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:02.790
all right.
That's the,
uh,
that's the pocket you,

1030
01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.590
this is their new thing.
She just grabs you got such a grip.

1031
01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:10.340
That's my forearm here that you just grabbing a whole handful of,

1032
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:15.410
um,
all right.
I want to hang out with her before you have to go to work.

1033
01:04:15.411 --> 01:04:16.730
So I got to get off the thing here.

1034
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.270
You're just fascinated with anything that's technology.
There's no screen on it,

1035
01:04:20.271 --> 01:04:24.710
so that's boring,
right?
It's got a light on it.
It's got a light on it.
Oh,

1036
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.490
it's got a light on it,
doesn't it?
Yeah.

1037
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:35.600
I always think you can't get any cuter than you get cuter.
Huh?
All right.
Okay,

1038
01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:37.940
cool.
Hang on a second.
I'll hang out with you in a minute.
All right.

1039
01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.710
That's the podcast.
My thoughts here,

1040
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.100
<v 5>af yourselves,
and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
There.</v>
