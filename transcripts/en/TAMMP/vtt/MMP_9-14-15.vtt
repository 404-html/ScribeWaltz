00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.940
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast,
uh,

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.440
for Monday,
September 14th,
2015.
What's going on out?

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:14.520
Why Ya?
Um,
I know what you guys are expecting.

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:17.850
They're probably expecting me to talk shit about the Patriots winning and the

5
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.560
Steelers crying about the,
uh,

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.320
the headsets or whatever the hell they were crying about this week.
Why get,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.560
why does everybody,
you know,
I love about giants fans.

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.180
They never bitch about the patriots.

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.540
They just beat us all the rest of you fucking sit there crying every week.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
Anyways,
I'm not going to get into that.
Um,
I have a very special guest here,

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.220
one of my favorite all time comedians of all times,

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.660
but first I have to read his amazing a intro here.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.880
Um,
Brian Regan,

14
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:49.881
everybody is going to be performing live at Radio City Music Hall and the first

15
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:53.070
time ever in the history of comedy central,
Brian,
you minds,

16
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:56.800
we'll talk at this point I've already said yes.
Um,
how many,
how many,
uh,

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.590
specials would you guess that comedy central has in their mountain?
Yeah.

18
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.230
<v 1>Oh,
wow.
I probably quite a few,
but,
uh,
8 million,</v>

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.060
seven to 8 million I think is a,
well,
this one,
I'm going to bet on the over.

20
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:10.470
I'm going to say it's 9 million,

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.490
<v 0>9 million.
I liked that.
A 9 million specials.</v>

22
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:18.110
This is the first guy who has ever had the nerve to a tape,

23
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.070
a standup special,

24
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.750
live on comedy central and he's going to be doing it and see if like on

25
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:28.751
September 26 at 9:00 PM live from one of the most legendary venues of all time,

26
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:33.860
Radio City Music Hall.
Um,
I mean,

27
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.260
I'm looking at the whole press release.
You got like,
you know,

28
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:41.030
five stars from Jerry Seinfeld,
Chris Rock,
Dennis Miller,
Joe Rogan,
Patton,

29
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:45.290
Oswald,
Mark Marin,

and uh,

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.590
we all love you,
man.
You are,
you are,
you've been,

31
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.040
what's it like to have been a comic's comic for a quarter of a century?

32
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.170
<v 1>I,
it's a huge,
huge honor man.
You know,
when,</v>

33
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:01.940
uh,
you know,
making audiences laugh is great,
makes you feel good,

34
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:04.190
but to also,
you know,

35
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.250
make the comedians feel like you're doing the right thing that makes you feel

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.303
even better.

37
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.140
<v 0>I know my fun in this podcast is going to be torturing you.</v>

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.570
You with comp compliments because I can tell him very senior,

39
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.060
hey,
what's it like to be a legend?
Brian talking about being a legend like that,

40
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:22.990
say,
yeah,

41
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.880
<v 1>the other right into a bombing story.
Let me tell you what have I want to bombed.</v>

42
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.160
And that wasn't so legendary.
Yeah,

43
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.010
<v 0>no ma'am.
I've been doing this shit for 23 years.
I'm old now.
I am an old man now.</v>

44
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.950
I know that every time when I tried to do stand up out in silver,

45
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:41.180
like I'm not saying the kids are bad,
it's just,
I definitely feel like,
wow man,

46
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.590
I feel like that that generation gap.
But you,
you've been like,
since I started,

47
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.790
um,

48
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.540
for those people like unfamiliar who'd been living under a standup comedy rock,

49
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:51.050
like,

50
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.050
like Brian basically goes out and for 90 straight minutes it sounds like a jet

51
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.800
is landing.
How hard guy kills and he never,
and unlike me,

52
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.470
you couldn't be the more polar opposite of me.
You don't,
you,

53
00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:09.090
I don't even think you say heck no,
sure I do.
You say that,
but okay.

54
00:03:09.091 --> 00:03:12.450
But still I do some hex and some dams,

55
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.580
but to joy act is like airtight like nobody can met.
No one can be like,
oh,

56
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:22.360
you know,
he's just a,
he's just what?
He's just writing perfect jokes for,

57
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.270
I'm sorry Brian.
I hate the torture with this,

58
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:28.650
but there's no other way to go with this absolute master.
You're very kind,

59
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:32.610
very incredibly kind and I cannot thank you enough.
That's very no eye contact.

60
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:37.350
Very.
And I'm like,
yeah,
I remember I'm going to keep going here.

61
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.640
I remember when I,
when I first started headlining in the late nineties,

62
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.230
um,
the legend back then was when you booked Brian Regan,

63
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.530
you would do two shows in one night and you would do to completely hour plus

64
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.660
totally clean,
absolutely destroying sets.

65
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.720
Like you had like the [inaudible] set in the be set and you had like there,

66
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.510
there was always this,
this urban myth.
He's got two notebooks.

67
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.930
They're both filled up once,
once,

68
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:06.180
so first show and once the second show he's doing the,

69
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:10.230
literally the guy's got two hours and 40 minutes of a level material.

70
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.640
I called it the idiot and the oddity,
oh those were the two,

71
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.503
the two shows.

72
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.570
<v 1>There were two different one hour shows and I would go to a comedy club for like</v>

73
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.870
a month and um,
and I would alternate them.

74
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:28.280
And the idea was if somebody came out and they liked what they saw,
they go,
wow,

75
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.800
he's got another one.
Maybe we'll come back and see the other show as well.

76
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.840
<v 0>So now did that come about because back then when you are coming up,</v>

77
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:39.520
like you had to be like anointed to do a special and nowadays you just need

78
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.060
somebody with the camera and you can put it up however you want it.

79
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.790
Like back in the day HBO had to say like,
you know what,

80
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.520
you're one of the six people that were picking this year.

81
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.230
Or I don't even think comedy central is really making too many specials,
uh,

82
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.790
back then.
So I was just wondering,
did you,

83
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.100
like you wrote a special at that point,
did you just say to hell with,

84
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.140
I'll just keep writing.

85
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.860
Like how did you end up with that much material at one time?
Actually,

86
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.150
<v 1>well just because I,
you know,
I'm always trying to write stuff,</v>

87
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.430
but it came about because,

88
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.080
do you remember when people were starting to do the one man shows?
Oh yeah.

89
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.170
Like Rob Becker defending the caveman,
you know,

90
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:22.171
they would take a stand up and then kind of make it into a little story with a

91
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:23.680
beginning,
middle and an end.

92
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.870
<v 0>They got a few laughs.
You sit down behind a desk.
Yeah,
I moved.
Right.</v>

93
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.660
Backers is great,
but there were a lot that were just,
you know,

94
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.320
seemed like kind of repackaged,
stand up,
you know.
And people were telling me,

95
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:39.740
well you should do a one man show you.
She should do a one man show.
And I'm like,

96
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.830
I like stand up.
I like the way stand up works.

97
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.760
I don't wanna I don't wanna like,
you know,

98
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:51.450
do a joke and then have a serious point and then walk across the stage.
And says,

99
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.090
I have a tear coming out of my dramatic lighting.
You know what's so funny,

100
00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:59.530
I totally to that because I've had so many people were like,

101
00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:02.110
my dream was always,
I just want,

102
00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:06.340
if I could sell out Improv's that was the dream.
If I could,
if I could just go,

103
00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:10.270
like I to me,
when I was starting out,
when somebody said,
oh,

104
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:14.590
I have a Gig in Houston this week or I'm in Minneapolis this week.

105
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.630
Like to me there was nothing cooler than that.

106
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:21.631
Like this guy gets to get on a plane and fly and people know who he is and he

107
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:25.360
gets to go in there.
And back then was you get to where the sport coat right?

108
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:27.130
And you get to go out and be and be a comedian.

109
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:28.840
I just thought that that was the coolest thing ever.

110
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.140
And I don't know how you feel about this one when,
whenever,
um,

111
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.920
you could have like the greatest special lever and then they're always just like

112
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:40.450
a,
it's a,
any TV and he moved like four.
It's,
it's always looked at.

113
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:44.350
Um,
it's got this weird thing where it's standup has really respected by people,

114
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:48.880
but then it's also looked at as just like this stepping stone into,

115
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:50.760
uh,
you know,
doing like,
uh,
I don't know,

116
00:06:50.761 --> 00:06:54.580
like a sitcom or be in some sort of actor or something like that.

117
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.640
And I always just,
I always thought like,
no,
dude,
this is the thing.

118
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.050
This is the thing.
It always will be the thing.
I can't get fired from this.

119
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.040
I'm always going to be employed and it happens in real time.
There's no cut.

120
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.000
Let's go back and do it again.
And you're sitting in a trailer for 14 hours.

121
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 1>Yeah.
It's,
you know,</v>

122
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.790
there are a few people who like it as an end result.
I want to say a few.

123
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.490
There are a lot of people who love standup comedy,
but yes,

124
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:22.360
for a lot of people it's a stepping stone to get into acting,

125
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:27.070
did get into a TV show or movies and that's great.
Um,

126
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.570
but I like it as it is,
you know,
and um,
you know,

127
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:36.270
people do always ask about the thing you don't have,
you know.
Um,

128
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.840
I just remember for years,
you know,
people coming up to me,
uh,
you know,

129
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:44.320
have you ever done the tonight show or whatever and,
and then when I hadn't,

130
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:49.150
and yeah,
I think,
no,
no,
I haven't done that.
And you know,
you should call Jay.

131
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.290
Yeah,
that's there.
It's there.
Yeah.
Yeah,
no,
I,
I the the very,

132
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.820
the first year I was working at the comic Strip in Fort Lauderdale,
I was uh,

133
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.790
I work in the kitchen,
you know,
I would like cook burgers.

134
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.100
They would let me go on stage at the end of the night.

135
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.060
And a guy came up to me after a show and said,
um,

136
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.920
Rodney Dangerfield is playing down the road at the sunrise musical theater.

137
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.110
He goes,
why don't you go down there and open for him instead of this,
you know,

138
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:21.190
like,
like,
like all it took has made it,
just know where the theater was.

139
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:25.840
Like I just walked down there,
oh,
is he in town where it was it that way?

140
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.590
So I just go down there and I opened for him in a theater,

141
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.990
didn't show where the apron a friend.
He is such a moron.

142
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.070
I'm neighborhood's been in the kitchen here and a comedy club.

143
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.860
I could go right down the road and open for Rodney Dangerfield.

144
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.330
Do you look for the suggestion?
Yeah.

145
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.111
<v 0>Do you know what's funny?</v>

146
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:45.460
In a way that mentality is how I got into this business was because I wanted to

147
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:50.230
be a comedian.
I didn't dare say it out loud,
but I didn't think it was possible.

148
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.850
Cause like when I was thinking about doing it was,

149
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:54.380
which is like the lady who started in the early nineties with the ladies.

150
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.260
I first started thinking about it but there wasn't any youtube,

151
00:08:57.261 --> 00:08:58.190
there was none of that crap.

152
00:08:58.191 --> 00:09:02.870
So to me I was living in Massachusetts show business was 3000 miles away.

153
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.030
Like it just seemed impossible.

154
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.000
And then I was working in a warehouse with this guy and he was just going like

155
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:10.340
do one of these nights.
And he likes staying up like glad he goes.

156
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:10.821
One of these nights,

157
00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:14.150
I'm gonna take a shot of Jack Daniels and I'm just going to go down to an open

158
00:09:14.151 --> 00:09:16.100
mic down the street that you know,

159
00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:19.820
and just go up on stage and all of a sudden I was just like,
Oh wow,

160
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.910
you can just do that.
I thought I had to like,
you know,

161
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.620
get my teeth captain,
moved out to La and get a fake Tan.

162
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:29.480
Like I had no idea how to cook.
So I always,

163
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.370
I always had like a panic attack when I think about that.

164
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:35.480
I go and thank God I worked with that guy and thank God that he said that and he

165
00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:40.220
took it out of seeming like,
you know,
it was like the Milky Way away.
He,
he,

166
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.670
he like made it like,
yeah.
Yeah.
Just go right down the street.

167
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.860
<v 1>He just did the,
did that guy ever do it?</v>

168
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.911
<v 0>You know,</v>

169
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:50.060
I don't know because we worked together such for such a short period of time.

170
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.141
I have no idea.

171
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:53.240
That's the only reason why I don't like telling that story because then people

172
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:56.900
like,
did that guy end up doing it?
Who would ever happened to him.

173
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.320
He's probably like some zillionaire banker,
you know,
I'm sure,
you know,

174
00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:04.250
sit by a pool loving his wife and kids and his dog.
Just totally happy.

175
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:08.240
But it's just to me,
he didn't do what you did in life.
So he must not be happy.

176
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.140
When I,

177
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.840
<v 1>when I first decided I wanted to be a stand up,</v>

178
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.470
the only comedy clubs were in Los Angeles and New York.

179
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.990
I was in college in Tiffin,

180
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:22.010
Ohio and I knew I wanted to do stand up.
This is why in fourth year,

181
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:26.990
what year was this?
1980.
This is going way back.
Right.
And um,

182
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.460
so I knew I wanted to do it,
but comedy had not yet,
you know,
exploded.

183
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.200
It was only in those two cities.

184
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.540
So I was gearing up to having to move to New York City.
I'm like,

185
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:39.120
I didn't know

186
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.580
<v 0>what's going on.
So when I thought I had to do in 92,</v>

187
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:43.080
you actually had to do an 80.

188
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.840
<v 1>That's what the,
yes.
And then I went back down to south Florida,</v>

189
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:48.830
which is where I grew up.

190
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.280
And I open up the Miami Herald and there's an ad in the Miami Herald for grand

191
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:59.660
opening for the comic Strip Comedy Club in Fort Lauderdale.
It says,

192
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:04.160
Sister Club of the famous comedy club in New York City,

193
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.590
open mic night,
Monday night.
And I'm like,

194
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.930
Damn.
Like,
like it could not have been more beautifully perfect.

195
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:17.980
Like that's,
I don't have to have move,
right?

196
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.760
I don't have to move to New York City.

197
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:24.761
I can just fill up the car with gas and go up to Fort Lauderdale and try it.

198
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.410
And so it became so much more attainable when I saw that ad,
you know?

199
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.610
And that's where I started.

200
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.850
<v 0>That's amazing.
I a very similar thing.
I hate me.</v>

201
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.880
I made a new year's resolution in 1992 that at some point in the calendar year

202
00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:42.440
of 1992 I was going to do an open mic.

203
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:46.880
That's how like shut down and shy was,
I was so nervous about it.

204
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.080
And the second I said that within two weeks,
uh,
in the school paper,

205
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.380
the Emersonian I went to Emerson,
it said,
uh,
Nick's comedy stop.

206
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.060
I had a contest,
it was an ad find Boston's funniest college student.
Wow.

207
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.490
And the whole thing was just,
uh,

208
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.500
just impact pack the club with a bunch of drunk kids,
right.
Buying drinks,

209
00:12:04.501 --> 00:12:09.180
watching their friends bomb.
So I immediately,
I bought the paper,

210
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.390
uh,
might even been free,
I think,
I can't remember what the school paper,

211
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.530
I think it was free.

212
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.920
And then I brought it home and I just immediately called the phone number before

213
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:18.290
I chickened out.
And I was just like,

214
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.343
<v 1>and</v>

215
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.380
<v 0>I remember so many kids from Emerson signed up that they actually gave us two</v>

216
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:26.160
nights.

217
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.790
So I was supposed to go on at the end of something the last Monday in February.

218
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.310
And then they called up,
they said they had overflow,

219
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:35.160
would you want to do the first Monday in March?
And I was like,
okay,

220
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.450
like just to put it off.
And then I hung up and I felt like I pussied out.
And um,

221
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.120
but very like a similar thing.
So,

222
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.610
<v 1>yeah,
I mean,
it's weird how things will leap out at you.</v>

223
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.290
I mean that,
you know,

224
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:52.100
all the ad of all the ads in the world,
you know,

225
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:55.040
for fast food places and hotels.

226
00:12:55.041 --> 00:13:00.041
And that ad for that comedy club like jumped off the page.

227
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.270
To me it was like,
holy shit man.
Um,
it was just,

228
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.300
it was just perfect.
And then I went there.

229
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.750
<v 0>So it's 1980.
So you went down there.
So tell me about your first,</v>

230
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.200
when you went on stage.
Uh,

231
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.730
<v 1>well actually they want,
they wanted you to get there early to draw on numbers.</v>

232
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.270
So I had to make the hour drive.
I was still living with my parents in Miami.

233
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:24.690
I make the hour drive up there and I get there.
I Dunno six.

234
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:28.720
And I know you were going to try it.
You pay,
I don't know if I,

235
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.640
I may have told my parents,
but I,
I didn't tell anybody to,
I didn't tell.

236
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:36.270
I don't even tell nobody nothing.
You know what I mean?
And it's like a mob hit.

237
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.990
Yeah.
It's like,
no,
I want to go up there and if I bomb,

238
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.400
nobody's going to know about this till the day I die.
So you seem so quiet,

239
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.370
you know,
what are you doing this?
You know,

240
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.670
I'm just getting a little dressed up and leave in the house.

241
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.210
So I go up there and they were like 20 comedians that I had to draw a numbers.

242
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.680
You had to draw numbers for your time slot.
I didn't know what any of this meant.

243
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.780
And um,
I drew I guess a good number.
You know,

244
00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:14.260
I had like a sweet spot right in the middle and then right after the,
um,

245
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.480
the drawing all these other open makers who had done it before,

246
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.170
I guess it had been open like a month,
you know,
came up and said,
I'll trade you,

247
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:25.230
I'll trade Ya,
I'll trade you my number for your number.

248
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:30.231
And all I knew is whatever I was holding was valuable and I wasn't trading it

249
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:34.740
for nothing,
you know?
Nice.
You know,
I'm like,
they want this so I'm keeping it.

250
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:39.870
So I went on,
um,
and what,
they had three co headliners.
It was very weird.

251
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:41.910
And then they stuck the open miker is up in the middle.

252
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.600
I went on right in the middle of the show and uh,

253
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.240
I just completely blanked out on stage,
just complete,
wipe out blank,

254
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.860
not remember anything.
And judge,

255
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.690
you realize that walking towards the stage or when you got up and turned and

256
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:01.580
faced him,
what happened was I had every word memorized I had,

257
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:06.200
hi,
how are Ya?
Written down which hand you are going to wave where?

258
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:09.260
Everything I had,
hi,

259
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.050
how are you written down and memorized.

260
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.450
I walk on stage and that's the first time I realized how bright these lights
are.

261
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.080
Like I'm like wigging out that I can't see a soul.

262
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.670
And then I,
I started to say hi,
how are you in the microphone?

263
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.290
And there was feedback.
I was too close.
I went,
hi,
how are you?

264
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.930
You know?
No.
So I did my first ad Lib.
I said,
uh,

265
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.910
well I've already learned one thing.
I don't know how to work a microphone.

266
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.550
And it got a laugh.
Oh Nice.

267
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.950
And then my brain just shut off.
Oh cause you didn't,
you know what?

268
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:47.840
Because I had memorized hi,

269
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:51.860
how are you to the next thing and when I ad libbed yeah,

270
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:53.960
I didn't know where I was supposed to go after that.

271
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.960
And so they laughed at my ad Lib,
you know?
Wow.

272
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:00.890
I don't know how to work a microphone.
They laughed and I'm standing there going,

273
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.450
I don't know I could,
I blanked out blank blankety blank.

274
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.940
How,
how long before you,
I stood there for about 10 seconds,

275
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.230
which seemed like nine years,
like an eternity.
And,
uh,
I said,
well,

276
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:17.960
you're not going to believe this folks,
but I forgot my act.

277
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.240
And they laughed and I said,
no,
no,
no arms.
I'm serious.

278
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.080
And they laughed.
It was like a twilight zone thing.

279
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.780
You learn in honesty works.
And I,

280
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.040
and I started ad libbing about how stupid I was for not being able to remember

281
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:35.960
my act.
I went,
ah,
this is great.

282
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.800
I spent all this time and effort trying to figure out something and I can't

283
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:42.110
remember nothing,
you know,
just off the top of my head.

284
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.020
And I started killing and I,
and I,

285
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.280
I started killing rolling about how stupid I was.
Um,

286
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:53.610
we were able to enjoy killing or you,
so I enjoyed it.
I,
I knew enough to go,
well,

287
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.460
all I want is laughs,
you know what I mean?
Um,
and I'm just winging it,
you know,

288
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.690
talking about what an idiot I am and how this drive I made and all this stuff

289
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:06.230
memorized and I can't remember a single thing,
but blah,
blah blah.

290
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.120
And I crushed it.
It will,
at least in my mind,
I don't fall for an open mic too.

291
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:13.340
That's crushing.
And then I said,
well,

292
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.060
I can't see myself ever remember in any of it.
So good aid.

293
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.620
And then I got this big hand,

294
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.060
I was going great.
I walked off stage and then like the,

295
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:26.150
the headliners,

296
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.420
one of them came up to me and said that that was a great routine about how you

297
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.920
pretended to blank out.
I said,

298
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.840
pretend they said that you really were winging out.
And I was like,
yeah,

299
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.370
but I was like in a fog.
And what did he say?
You should definitely come back.

300
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:46.250
Was He supportive guy?
I forget who it was,
but he was supportive.

301
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:49.040
He said it was really funny.
And um,
you know,

302
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.200
what was great for me is that my next time I went,

303
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.610
I remembered my act and just ate it,
but hilarious.

304
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.500
But I had the memory of knowing how to make people laugh from the first time

305
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.260
that just kept fueling me to just keep going back.

306
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.970
<v 0>What do you think would've happened if you just did your act and that first</v>

307
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:11.130
thing didn't happen?
You completely ate it.
Did you have it,

308
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.110
you think he had an Indian to keep coming back?
I don't know.

309
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.770
<v 1>You know,
I've talked to other comedians about this and,
and I,
uh,</v>

310
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.770
what's weird to me is that most comedians I talked to say that they're ver very

311
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.860
first time on stage.
They did well,
you know,

312
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.500
and then didn't do well the second time or third time.

313
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.910
And I wonder how many potentially good comedians out there,

314
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.290
it didn't go well and just said hell with it.

315
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.620
<v 0>Now they're working at a home depot.
Just crushing it every day.</v>

316
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.590
Hey Guy I've ever met in my life.

317
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.960
<v 1>And they just,
you know,</v>

318
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.680
and I truly wonder how many people have just had the bad experience and go,

319
00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:50.810
I need this.
Like I need a hole in the head,
you know,

320
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.360
<v 0>I know because the first time,
first I,
my,
my first two were,
uh,
I did Nick's the,</v>

321
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.090
the,
the talent thing and went okay.
And then I did stitches,

322
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.140
comedy club.
Uh,
and when did,
okay.

323
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.640
And those are both comedy clubs,

324
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:08.100
but the first time we did a room that wasn't a comedy club,

325
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:09.750
I've told the story a zillion times in the podcast,

326
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:13.170
but it was a Jack Lynch had this room,
uh,

327
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.440
Kelly's something or other and it was some bar.
And I went up and I,

328
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:22.440
and I absolutely just ate it wire to wire.
I said,
on the microphone,
Jack,

329
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:26.040
I'm bailing.
I said that to the host.
And all the communities went,
ah,

330
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.230
they collectively were like disappointing to me that I quit and I hated myself.

331
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.360
And I remember,
uh,
but I would say it never dawned on me to quit.

332
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:40.200
Maybe it was because I did well those first two times,
but I just never,

333
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.040
I was just like,
all right,
well what can I do to avoid that?
Right.

334
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.170
That awful feeling again.
But you know,

335
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:48.510
it's funny when I finally started getting a little bit funny,

336
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.130
I actually was doing one of your mannerisms and people kept giving me shit go

337
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:55.640
and you steal them from Brian.
It's like I'm two,
three years in.
Oh,

338
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.070
I'm going like,
no,
I'm not.
You're a little,
you're crouched thing that you do.

339
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.990
I was so influenced by you cause I had seen you like,
first of all,

340
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:07.590
everybody was freaking out when you will come into play,
Nick's comedy stop.

341
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.530
And everyone's always got to Brian Regan's coming.
You ever heard of Brian Regan?

342
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.410
And um,
and I was like,
yeah,
I had seen him a couple of,

343
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.440
I'd seen you a couple of times on TV is like,
you gotta see this guy.

344
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:19.020
And he's like,
every comic in Boston was going,
you got to see this guy.

345
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:20.760
And I was like,
I'm doing a dick.
He's room.
It's like,

346
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.280
I don't give a fuck and finish your set and drive in here.

347
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:25.980
And I came in and I caught your second set.

348
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.370
I still remember you wearing this red button down shirt.

349
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:33.990
You went on stage and you,
you were killing so hard like,
uh,

350
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.970
you know what people wiping tears away,

351
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:38.280
like fallen into the isles isles and stuff.

352
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.990
And it was just so like you probably the first big comic like traveling comic,

353
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.063
you came in,

354
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.040
you followed all the Boston heavy hitters cause you know how they used to love

355
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.150
sticking like yeah,
you know,

356
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.450
some legendary headliner with all the local references in the feature act to try

357
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.140
and barrier.

358
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.220
And then you went up totally clean and it was a combination of watching you

359
00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:00.640
murdering and then seeing all the comics that I respected,

360
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.570
like turning into like audience members and j and they were doing that laugh,

361
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.520
like,
like love and stand up and then being like,
fuck,
why didn't I think of that?

362
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.930
And that was when you would do,
and like the prescription Lens,
uh,

363
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.080
when Sheila and cheering and all that,
it was just,
it was an amazing thing and I,

364
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:20.710
and I appreciate it.
I was so influenced by that,
that I started doing,

365
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:22.960
I'll act it out.
I was doing,
while I was doing like a little bit of,

366
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:27.070
when I would go into a punchline,
I would like drop down a little bit.
And um,

367
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.580
it took me,
I did that for about maybe eight months to a year.

368
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:35.290
I was doing that and it took me about seven years to get that stink off of me.

369
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.450
People go,
Nah,
he's stealing from Regan.
He's still from Regan.

370
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.550
And I was just like,
I was like,
oh,
it's two years in.

371
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.500
I didn't know what I was doing,
what we're going to,

372
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:43.830
we've got to learn from something.
We got to watch him.
Yeah.

373
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.540
It's just a huge honor.
And thank you.
So I was actually,

374
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.550
I was doing you a little bit and,
uh,
and then I,
I,
they,

375
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.860
fortunately I had guys like,
uh,
you know,

376
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:57.220
Veloce and Norton and Patrice and all of them,
they teased me out of it.

377
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:00.280
We used to all,
we used to all sit there and trash each other going,

378
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:02.220
you know who you're doing and who you're doing it.

379
00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:04.970
At the time I used to tell Patrice,

380
00:22:04.971 --> 00:22:07.600
she was doing a little bit of Fred Sanford when he was going like,

381
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:10.090
and it's kind of kind of do like that thing with his face.

382
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.590
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
well thank you man.
Now you,
I don't want to let,

383
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.710
I very much appreciate the good words.
Yeah.
Well look,
I won't,

384
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:22.260
I won't torture you anymore compliments,
but a little,

385
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.300
so how did you come up with the idea to do a special live?

386
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:29.860
I mean that's uh,
well,
you know,
um,

387
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.390
you were saying about comedy central does a lot of specials with comedians and

388
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.050
I've done a couple of,
with,
uh,
a couple with them in the past.
And,
uh,

389
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.730
you know,
I just,
I just wanted to do something different,
you know,

390
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.530
you know what I love about it is the thing I hate the most about doing a special

391
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.390
is afterwards when you have to watch the footage and edit and look at yourself

392
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:55.030
and listen to yourself.
I've always,
for the most part,

393
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.500
throughout all the specials I've done,
the few that I've done is I just,

394
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.690
whatever's show felt better.
I just go,

395
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:06.010
just take that Shell and whittle that down to whatever time they need because I

396
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:09.730
don't want to sit there and look at both shows.
Then it's twice.
I don't,

397
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:12.670
I don't want to fucking deal with any,
I hate it.
I absolutely hate it.

398
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:16.030
And I avoided the way I do like a term paper.
So back in the day.

399
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.380
So I was thinking about how your,
you're not going to have to do that.

400
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.490
You just going to go out,
you're going to do it and it's done.

401
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.770
And then another thing too is like you only time comics do a special where they

402
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:33.550
only have one show as if they don't have any budget.
You clearly,
you know,

403
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.390
at this point you can afford to tape two,
four,
six shows if you want it to.

404
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:40.240
You're only going to,
you're going to do it all in one.
Um,

405
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.450
what is the game plan you got going into that as far as like,
is there,

406
00:23:45.451 --> 00:23:50.100
is there any like mindset that you're going into before that?
Like,
all right,

407
00:23:50.101 --> 00:23:53.590
Brian,
just go out there and have a good time and,
uh,
some shits the bed,
you know,

408
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.190
dress it and keep plowing for,
I mean,
what are you going to do?

409
00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.850
<v 1>It,
it,
it's weird,
like,
I don't want to overthink it,
you know what I mean?
Like,</v>

410
00:24:00.851 --> 00:24:03.340
uh,
on the one hand,
I just,
you know,

411
00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:06.430
I want it to be a show just like any other show.

412
00:24:06.431 --> 00:24:10.190
Did it just happen to be some cameras in there and some people out there and TV

413
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:13.130
world watching it,
you know.
Um,
but at the same time,
I,

414
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:18.040
I want to have a couple of things going on.
Like I've been talking to my manager.

415
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:22.420
It's like all it takes is one idiot,
one idiot in the audience that you know,

416
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.960
wants to,
uh,
you know,
have this be his moment.
You know,

417
00:24:25.961 --> 00:24:27.460
it's like you can't watch golf.

418
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.140
You can't watch golf without a guy hitting a tee shirt.

419
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.270
<v 0>Yeah.
And he just go,
Geez,</v>

420
00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:38.100
what are you really that starved for attention?
You know,

421
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.670
like what are you going to go home and listen to yourself?
That was me.
I yelled,

422
00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:45.330
go in the hall,
getting old,
getting where they say they all say it too.

423
00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:48.680
It's like he came,
come up with something original.
It's just,
you know,
so

424
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.970
<v 1>I have this little fear,
not a big one.
Cause my,
my,</v>

425
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.600
my audiences are pretty damn cool,
you know?

426
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.510
But all it takes is one idiot in the audience who's like,
Oh wow,

427
00:24:57.511 --> 00:25:00.900
it's going to be live.
I can do something that I,
you know,

428
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:03.570
I can get some attention for myself.
So,

429
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.950
<v 0>but then if you trash them,
then it should work.</v>

430
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.470
What that would actually do is it makes it like really unique as far as like if

431
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:16.880
somebody were to do that and then you were to trash them,
um,

432
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.420
even if they were to kick them out,
like live on the thing.

433
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:21.620
I don't want to talk about this too much,

434
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.310
but you have a great crowd anyways to give anybody any ideas.
But um,

435
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.000
<v 1>okay.</v>

436
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.430
<v 0>Actually the way you're looking at that,
and you know,
when I was trying to think,</v>

437
00:25:29.431 --> 00:25:31.230
you know,
it's not like whenever I go do a show,

438
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.880
I just do the show wire to wire and I don't screw up any jokes.

439
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.940
You know what I mean?
It's just when you're recording it gets in your head like,

440
00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:43.170
oh my God,
the documentation of that joke,
I flubbed this word.

441
00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:46.020
And it's just like,
you don't care when the cameras aren't there.

442
00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:48.120
So I would think that you would just get into a fucking,
you know,

443
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.210
this is just a documentary,

444
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.390
my performance of this hour on this night and this is how it came out.

445
00:25:54.391 --> 00:25:56.580
And then you just go out there is that we're going to do,

446
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.830
<v 1>yeah.
Well,
it's been a while since I've recorded an hour.</v>

447
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:04.270
The last thing I did was about five years ago,
and that was,
um,
a CD.

448
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.530
I get,
I get antsy,
man,
when I get material,
I want to,

449
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.490
I guess,
you know,
a lot of people get material and they go,
wow,

450
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:16.150
this is good material.
I want,
I want to keep doing it.
I get to where it's like,

451
00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:19.180
I don't want to do it anymore.
Yes.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
wow,

452
00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:22.960
this is really good.
I'm sick of it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I want to read,

453
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.070
I like to record it so it's there.
You know what I mean?
It exists,

454
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.290
but now I can move on,
you know?

455
00:26:29.291 --> 00:26:33.280
So that's one thing I'm really looking forward to is this material that I've

456
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.490
been kicking around for the last four or five years.
And,
uh,

457
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.090
I look forward to it as nailing it down and then being done with it the week

458
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:43.990
that it's probably

459
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.230
<v 0>gonna be more fun for me.
Like just starting to play around and,
and,</v>

460
00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.750
and get it back into,
uh,
some different stuff.

461
00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:51.250
But I'm really looking forward to it.

462
00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.970
But as far as the jokes in Iraq right now that you hate and you're actually

463
00:26:54.971 --> 00:26:56.260
thinking that,
oh my God,
not you hate,

464
00:26:56.261 --> 00:26:59.640
but you just so sick of talent that you're like,
I can't wait to record this.
Yes.

465
00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.370
So I can just be done with it.
Start bumping up to that.
And I,

466
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.070
and I try to resist it and fight it and then like,

467
00:27:06.071 --> 00:27:09.520
as soon as I start feeling that way,
I try not to do that bit for a month or two,

468
00:27:09.521 --> 00:27:12.130
you know?
Yeah.
So that when I redo it,
it feels fresh.

469
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.850
And this is a challenge because I'm coming up on this special and I need to have

470
00:27:15.851 --> 00:27:20.851
it in my bones would degree but not so into my bones where it's like you're a

471
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:23.350
machine up there.
You know what I mean?

472
00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:26.730
You don't want to suck the funny out of it,
you know?
So it's,
it's a title.

473
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.350
I always know which one's subconsciously,

474
00:27:29.351 --> 00:27:33.350
I don't even realize how much I hate certain jokes by the end of them.
Um,

475
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.190
is when I got one,
once I do this special,

476
00:27:36.191 --> 00:27:39.310
it's just naturally the ones that you said,
you don't even make the choice,

477
00:27:39.311 --> 00:27:42.140
the ones that you hate,
you just never do them again.
Right.

478
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.490
And I always think like,
wow,
man,
I must have really hated that joke.

479
00:27:45.491 --> 00:27:48.400
I must have really been sick of doing that thing.
But uh,
you know,

480
00:27:48.401 --> 00:27:52.180
it's funny to me is a,
it's just like in your normal progression,
you know,

481
00:27:52.181 --> 00:27:54.670
you come up with a bit,
you know,

482
00:27:54.671 --> 00:27:56.740
some new thing and you're excited about it and you,
you know,

483
00:27:56.741 --> 00:28:00.070
you have your hit list,
right,
of,
uh,
uh,
here's something new.

484
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.480
I want to get to hear something relatively new.
I want to get to,
and you know,

485
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.330
and I'll look over that before I go onstage,

486
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.450
but I don't have a list of the bits that I'm dropping.

487
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.710
They just fall away.
Oh,
they just fall,
you know,

488
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.420
if there's something like you say about your subconscious that just goes a,

489
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:19.840
I've had enough of this one.
Yeah.
And it's just gone.
And then you,

490
00:28:19.841 --> 00:28:21.940
and then a year later you think could go,
oh wow.

491
00:28:21.941 --> 00:28:24.190
I used to do this bit about such and such and I just,

492
00:28:24.191 --> 00:28:27.370
it just fell away and he never did it again after my special.

493
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.760
We got to take a real quick break here so I can do a little bit advertising
here.

494
00:28:30.761 --> 00:28:34.330
And uh,
I almost did the radio thing.
I was thinking to do that.

495
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.630
We're here with Brian Rigor,
like,
like people don't look,
listen to these things,

496
00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:40.080
wired or wireless.
So I'm going to do a little bit of,

497
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.590
you got to listen to me read out loud here.

498
00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:43.870
Everybody and I will be back in a second.

499
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.531
<v 2>All right.</v>

500
00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:49.531
Every body trunk club trunk club gets you a close in a trunk.

501
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.440
Yeah,

502
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.130
Who has the patience for crowded stores?

503
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:02.370
Lace they do or the time to run?
Uh,

504
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.380
I fucking hate computers.
You know,
something.

505
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.920
Every fucking motherfucking time I tried to do anything on these fucking,

506
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.131
you know,

507
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:11.250
I've got a brand new fucking computer and somehow it's synced up to my fucking

508
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:16.200
phone.
So every time I have a text message he goes,
Dang,
Dang.

509
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.540
And half the time it's behind.
I already saw it on my fucking phone.
I don't know.

510
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.820
I don't even understand these things on any level.
I know

511
00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.013

514

515
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.760
that don't even fit?
Well,

516
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.450
why don't you look at the sizes and pick a color for Christ's sake,

517
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:45.520
you need 10 of them.
All right,
but here's the problem.

00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:42.340
comfortable.
But how can you feel comfortable?

550
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:44.650
Have your balls is stuck to the side of your leg.

551
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.600
How can you feel great if your is wrinkling and riding up Mondays gets it.

552
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.990
And that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear.

553
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.390
We had some of the smartest scientists with some of the sweatiest balls in the

554
00:31:58.391 --> 00:31:59.224
world

555
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.960
to solve their own problem and now they're passing that knowledge on to you for

556
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:08.430
a daily dose of confidence.
You wear underwear everyday,

557
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.830
that's turned 65 days a year of rain or shine.
You need,

558
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.710
well sometimes you wear two pairs if you work out right or if you have an

559
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:19.450
accident.
Um,
you need to be extraordinary without an insane price tag.

560
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.460
You need it to be an extraordinary thing and the same price.

561
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:24.850
Tag me undies understands this and that's why they've created the world's most

562
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:29.740
comfortable underwear,
luxury and half the retail price you find anywhere else.

563
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.480
When you look good,
you feel great.

564
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.160
It's a cliche because it's true me undies understands this and that's why the

565
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:39.400
design underwear that makes you look and feel fantastic.

566
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.283
A note,

567
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.640
modelle is pound pronounced model undies is the motto of fabric that is,

568
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:54.050
is made from model of fabric that's twice as soft as cotton for the life of me,

569
00:32:54.241 --> 00:32:57.540
I don't know why they don't have an accent on which syllable I'm supposed to.

570
00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.190
I was supposed to a stress.

571
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.520
<v 3>Okay.</v>

572
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.540
<v 2>Mardel</v>

573
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:04.990
<v 3>okay.</v>

574
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.100
<v 2>Madell maybe this shit that evidently makes you balls not sweat.</v>

575
00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:11.530
That's twice as soft as whatever underwear you're wearing right now.

576
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:16.150
Me undies has tons of colors and styles and the only place to get matching pairs

577
00:33:16.151 --> 00:33:19.300
for men and women.
They even release a new design every month.

578
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.340
I were fill in the blank,
design parentheses,
black stripes,

579
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:29.110
tie dye,
et cetera and parentheses plus.
We all know that paying for shipping.

580
00:33:29.111 --> 00:33:32.200
I actually got I where the free ones they sent me.
And you know what?

581
00:33:32.201 --> 00:33:35.560
They're great.
Especially when you're playing hockey.
You know what I mean?

582
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.450
If you don't want to go like a,
you know,
you don't want to go commando,

583
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.430
they fit nicely underneath you.
A little hockey pants there.

584
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.020
I heard Wayne Gretzky warm in the 90s.
He got him first.
That's how good he was.

585
00:33:47.021 --> 00:33:51.310
He had,
he had me on his back then.
All right,
this is getting way too long.
Um,

586
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.430
plus we all know the paying for shipping sucks.
So Mandy said,

587
00:33:54.431 --> 00:33:57.640
remove that from the equation.
All orders in the U S and Canada,

588
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.120
Canada shipped for free.
Mandy's even as a money back guarantee.

589
00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:04.030
If you don't pay for you,
if you don't love your first pair,

590
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.590
you get to keep it for free.
Well,
why would you keep it?
You don't like it.

591
00:34:08.591 --> 00:34:10.750
You get to throw it out,
but no charge to you.

592
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:15.640

All right.

599
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.560
I love when they say shipping is for free.
It's no,

600
00:34:38.561 --> 00:34:40.960
you've rolled it into the cost of whatever the fuck you're selling.

601
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.580
You know Jesus.
All right.

Probably because you don't want to shell out 20 bucks for a pack of new ones.

I thought about that years ago.
I'm like,

why is this little pack of horseshit blades?
Why is it so much fucking money?

629

You know what I mean,

Getting your mailing and shipping done can seem like a no win situation.

634
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.560
Go to the post office,
take going to the post office.
Takes up valuable time.

635
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:46.710
Sorry guys.
I took a red eye last night.
I'm even worse than usual.

636
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.900
Leasing a postage meter,
expensive with multiyear commitments and hidden fees.

637
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.720
Luckily I know a better way.

638
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.960
What is it you might've asked or might not have asked?

639

643
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.911
She can't find it.

645
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:17.160
fraction of the cost.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.360

You know what I mean?

Stand out there and have people with sweaty armpits who are taller than me.

Rest that hot armpit right on my shoulder.

Sorry.
And finally,
lastly,

658
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:00.750
but not leastly legal zoom,
everybody.
Hey,

659
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:04.290
you shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive hourly rates

660
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:08.130
when you need legal help,
should you.
But the legal system is so complicated.

661
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.910
What other choice do you have when you need help with your business or want to

662
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:14.970
protect your family?
Well,
you can start with legal zoom.

663

664
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:21.390
They provided a way for regular people like you and me to confidently navigate

665
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:23.700
the legal system,
legal zones,
not a law firm.

666
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.830
And that's how they provide such a great value.

667
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.020
That is a weird sentence.
Yeah.
You know,

668
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:35.010

Hey,

669
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.900
I'm not a mechanic,
but dude,
I'll do it for 10 bucks.
There's gotta be,

670
00:38:38.901 --> 00:38:40.910
there's gotta be an answer to this.
And the next paragraph,

671
00:38:40.911 --> 00:38:44.120
legal zoom is not a law firm and that's how they provide such great value.

672
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.730
They don't rely on charging you by the hour.

trademarks last,
oh,
I get it.

676
00:38:57.171 --> 00:38:59.750
If you do this through a lawyer,
they rip you off.
They're just,

677
00:38:59.751 --> 00:39:03.890
they specifically do this.
I get it.
Sorry.

As you can tell,

688
00:39:33.921 --> 00:39:37.640
probably at this point,

689
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.200
so I'll do it here when he can't hear it.

690
00:39:39.201 --> 00:39:41.420
He's one of my favorite comics of all time and he's,

691
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.830
he's just the best and he's the best,
nicest,
most humble is fucking guy.
Ever.

692
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.580
Absolutely loved this guy.
Here's more Brian Regan.
Right?

693
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.530
<v 0>All right.
And we're back.
Um,</v>

694
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.720
so I was one of the tell that story.
Uh,
you know,
um,

695
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.360
one of the coolest things,
it was the first time,
like,

696
00:40:08.361 --> 00:40:12.430
I really got to hang out with you and meet you.
I was playing,
um,

697
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:17.480
I was playing the comedy works in Denver,
one of the great all time rooms.

698
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.060
And uh,
you were playing like the,

699
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.380
the United Center of the Pepsi Center or something in Denver at this you play

700
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.740
like with the avalanche play her assumption red rocks,
red rocks.
Yeah.

701
00:40:27.741 --> 00:40:32.190
Will you two shut that video that,
yeah,
like unbelievably 8,000 seater.

702
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.830
And after you did just show,

703
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.420
you still took the time to come in and catch my late show.
And at that point,

704
00:40:38.421 --> 00:40:40.970
I don't think I had really four.
I'd met you a couple of times,

705
00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:43.200
but I never really got to hang out with you.
And right before I went on,

706
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.700
someone goes,
hey,
just so you know,
you know,
Brian Regan's hanging in the back,

707
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:48.440
he came in and wanted to check out,
you said,

708
00:40:48.441 --> 00:40:51.590
and it was the most ridiculous honor.
I can't believe it.

709
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.470
Then I was thinking like,
don't fucking go down in that crowd.

710
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.210
Like he did 1995 it seems like

711
00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.980
he's doing me.
We both filthy word.
Hey,
wait a second.
No,

712
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.330
I'd be like,
no,
God,
like filthy.
Yeah.

713
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.383
Um,

714
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.790
and then we ended up hanging out and you were so complimentary and nice and uh,

715
00:41:18.201 --> 00:41:22.490
and also something that I loved was you would like me,
you were over 40,

716
00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:26.660
but hadn't quit drinking.
I can't stand people that just can't,

717
00:41:26.661 --> 00:41:29.480
he can't fucking handle alcohol.
I mean,
right.
I should talk right now.

718
00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:34.090
I'm going like,
I shut it down every once in a while for like 70,
75 days a,
uh,

719
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.220
by the time this podcast comes out,
I'll be on like day 71.
So.

720
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.810
<v 1>Well,
you know,
it was funny,
in the middle,
in your set that night,</v>

721
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.310
you said that you weren't drinking.
You said,
uh,
you know,
I don't,
yeah,

722
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.250
I'm not drinking now or something like that.
So I was thinking,
Oh man,

723
00:41:48.251 --> 00:41:50.470
we're not gonna be able to have a couple of cocktails after the show.

724
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.710
And then we went out to the bar afterwards and I said,
you know,
I,

725
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.430
I know you don't drink and you go and you were like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
hold on.

726
00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.750
But you,
boy,
yeah,
no,
I was just like,
okay,
if he's having a drink,

727
00:42:01.751 --> 00:42:04.240
I got to have a drink of Reagan.
It's not fucking way,
I'm not doing this,
but

728
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.450
<v 0>take times off because I find a,</v>

729
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:11.710
like one of the things that I cherish about being a standup comedian is the free

730
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:14.080
time that I have,
um,

731
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.830
to pursue whatever the fuck I want to do either just sitting on the couch.

732
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:18.900
Like right now,
you know,

733
00:42:18.901 --> 00:42:21.940
it's a Saturday when we're taping this and I'm taping three college football

734
00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:25.450
games,
which I probably won't watch until like Monday or Tuesday.

735
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.790
And I just loved that I can just have a Tuesday.

736
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:32.110
Then if I want to get up at nine and have an English muffin and then just watch

737
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.630
three college football games in a row,

738
00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:37.150
like I'm some assistant coach watching game film.

739
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.670
Like I got to break them down for somebody.
I just loved that.

740
00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:41.950
I that I can do that.
But the,
the,

741
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.640
the dark side of all of that free time is I can go out and get hammered whenever

742
00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:53.860
I want to and if I don't watch it I will start drinking again.

743
00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.330
Like I did when I graduated high school with,

744
00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.900
I just remember like 10 days after I graduated high school,

745
00:42:58.901 --> 00:43:00.490
my mother just walked in,

746
00:43:00.491 --> 00:43:05.491
classic her just really stoic and right to the point was your father and I think

747
00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:08.530
you've done enough celebrating

748
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.880
<v 1>it was all she said.
And that was her way of saying,
dude,</v>

749
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:16.790
you're a fucking lush and you can end up in the gutter.
So grading.
Yeah,

750
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.693
well I mean

751
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.360
<v 0>I was going out to like like two,
three,
four o'clock in the morning.</v>

752
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.690
It was so funny cause I was young.
I would go on out,

753
00:43:24.691 --> 00:43:28.270
we'd be absolutely fucking hammered in by eight 30 in the morning I was at my

754
00:43:28.271 --> 00:43:32.320
warehouse job unloading trucks and all he had to do was make it to 10 when the

755
00:43:32.321 --> 00:43:35.290
roach coach came and eat like us.
One of those sausages.

756
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.990
And then it just sort of leveled me out and I was fine.

757
00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:40.900
And somehow I still had a flat stomach was fucking idea.

758
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.990
I didn't realize how lucky I was back then.
So that's,
that's why I,

759
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:49.300
I just go through periods of,
uh,
I just sort of shutting it down.

760
00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.110
To me,
it's like,
it's a once every

761
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.600
<v 1>two month thing,
you know?
Like I,</v>

762
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.660
I know the night that I'm going to be able to get crazy and I'm careful and I'm

763
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:06.290
not driving and I don't,
I know I don't have anything to do the next day.
I mean,

764
00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:09.980
like,
it's planned,
you know,
when you're younger,
you know,
you just wing it,

765
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:13.490
you know?
But now it's like,
it's in my calendar.

766
00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.270
I'm getting racks on the 28th,

767
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.580
so I was friends,
you know,

768
00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:22.490
I was hoping you could say once every two months you shut it down because you've

769
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:25.910
been going to like,
once every two months I drank.
I'm like,
Oh God,
I'm a mess.

770
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.750
I'm a mess.

771
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.550
<v 0>But I got a,
I don't know,
man.
Like I go on the road with my buddies,
you know,</v>

772
00:44:32.551 --> 00:44:35.620
any of those guys are Jason Lawhead,
Joe Barden,
nick,
uh,

773
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.460
just these great guys that I go to the rose bowl with every year.

774
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:41.140
Paul [inaudible],
they're part of that,
uh,

775
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.210
that wave that came probably a couple of waves after my graduating class and

776
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.620
they're all just guys,
guys,

777
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:50.700
cigar smokers like to go to sporting events and all of that.

778
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:55.701
So it becomes like a sort of a standup tour and a little bit of like a Bachelor

779
00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:58.470
party kind of Vibe,
you know,

780
00:44:58.471 --> 00:45:01.320
minus of course the hookers and the blow and all that type of shit.
We don't,

781
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:05.040
we don't,
it's pretty main street.
It's all above the board legal stuff.

782
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:06.600
But um,

783
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.130
you know what the funny thing is is we get to the point like none of us will be

784
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:13.260
like,
dude,
we're not drinking tonight.
We're not blah,
blah blah.
And just,

785
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:15.780
there's something about the chemistry of all of us really,

786
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.810
and the f and the free time that we have that we just ended up getting

787
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:22.500
absolutely annihilated.
Like,

788
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:24.870
some of the worst nights of drinking we have is like,
dude,

789
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.140
we'll go easy to not just shut it down.
You know,

790
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:31.140
we've been hitting it hard the last three nights and tonight we do the show,

791
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.620
we get in bed,
we hit the hope,

792
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.120
we hit the fucking hotel gym and then we're on the road.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Yeah,

793
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:37.620
yeah.
And then all of a sudden like,
you know,

794
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.190
La heads hosted and they'll come off and be like,
then I just have one heater.

795
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:45.510
Yeah.
All this.
And then,
uh,
and then it just,
and then went lap.

796
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:50.250
And as we're doing it,
we're laughing,
just laughing at ourselves.
So

797
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.430
<v 1>it's like a game of chicken because I,
I have,
uh,</v>

798
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.580
three different golf weekends a year with brothers and friends and it's just guy

799
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:04.170
golf weekends and,
um,
I don't even golf and that sounds awesome.
Oh Man.

800
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.530
[inaudible] golf during the day.
We played Texas hold 'em at night.
And,
um,

801
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.500
and you know,
I've got this bus,
you know,

802
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:13.950
that can we use for the golf weekends and it's kind of cool.

803
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:17.790
And sometimes we have a long cool,
that's fucking awesome.
It's cool.

804
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:20.640
I think golf would get hammered.
Texas hold 'em we got a tour bus.

805
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:25.080
It's kind of cool.
I got a poker table that was made to fit in the,
uh,

806
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:29.550
in the bus so we can play Texas hold'em while we're rolling.
So anyway,
you know,

807
00:46:29.551 --> 00:46:31.710
you get in early,
you get on the bus early,

808
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:34.290
sometimes 7:00 AM you got a long haul to get to the,

809
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.380
and there's like 12 guys and it's like,

810
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:41.010
who's going to be the first one to crack a beer?
You know?

811
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:45.360
And because everybody's like having coffee and trying to look like they're sane

812
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:47.140
and normal,
you know,

813
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:52.160
they have a thing of orange juice pretending like we're normal.

814
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.410
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
And then one guy goes,

815
00:46:55.411 --> 00:46:59.460
a hand me a Budweiser and then the next thing you know,

816
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:01.110
12 Budweiser's are open.

817
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.550
<v 0>And everybody just goes like,
yeah,
the first guy goes,
let me get it Budweiser.</v>

818
00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:06.190
He says
somebody

819
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.090
<v 1>hello?
Literally here.
Right?
And then five minutes later they're in,
you know,</v>

820
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.000
the second you just hear it open,
just like,
ah dude,
I

821
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.370
<v 0>got to get one of those.
The last one I last run I did,
I did with Bartok and uh,</v>

822
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.890
we actually had,
we actually went to the hotel gym like every day.

823
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:24.700
This is when I knew I was drinking too much and I had to kind of shut it down.

824
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.090
I was getting all fucking bloaty and shit.
And uh,
we,

825
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:31.780
this thing that we did every day,
that week after we worked out,

826
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.340
we came out of the hotel,

827
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:36.520
we went onto the bus and we had one bud light and we knew we were just gonna

828
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.190
have one bud.
Like,
cause we had a show and you know,
we're older guys,
you know,

829
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:41.260
if you have two drinks,
you're going to have to nap for nine hours.

830
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.420
You'd have to keep going and you can go for like 12 hours or you drink too and

831
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:49.930
you'd done.
So we would have one.
And because I knew I was just having the one,

832
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:53.890
I would like savor it.
Like,
I would just be like sipping it.
Like I was,
you know,

833
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:57.370
like when you stole your Dad's first beer and it was like one of the highlights

834
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.860
of the toys.
It was a fucking bud light,
I think.

835
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.660
I think I could figure out how to make that in a bath.

836
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.320
<v 1>I can prohibition.
It was so fucking cold and delicious</v>

837
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.440
<v 0>just sitting there and they had,
you know,
the little TV,</v>

838
00:48:10.441 --> 00:48:13.980
they're on the bus and it just sat there and we would always put on like sports

839
00:48:13.981 --> 00:48:15.600
center or something.
And it was a,

840
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:20.910
and then the hardest thing is when you finished was not in that next 10 minutes

841
00:48:20.911 --> 00:48:22.410
to grab the next one.
I found that like,

842
00:48:22.411 --> 00:48:25.830
if I just could get through that 10 minutes and I grabbed the water and I

843
00:48:25.831 --> 00:48:29.190
started drinking that,
like,
whatever that chemical need of like,
yeah,
man,

844
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.210
let's have some more of that.

845
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.630
I would kind of wear off and I was able to do my show.
But,
uh,

846
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.260
it's something that,
uh,
[inaudible]

847
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:38.060
<v 1>and I had my,
uh,
my brothers and,
uh,</v>

848
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.700
some other friends out in Las Vegas where I live.
And,
uh,
they were on there,

849
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:45.600
they were on a golf weekend.
I live there and I was able to join them one night.

850
00:48:45.601 --> 00:48:50.250
And it was one of those nights where I said,
you know,
I got a car for us,

851
00:48:50.251 --> 00:48:54.060
you know,
and,
uh,
please call me.
I one of these not yet love to for that shit.

852
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.960
Oh man,
that'd be fantastic.
That's what he knows in alkie.

853
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.910
Call me in for the drink
when you're flying in.
Oh yeah.

854
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:07.110
So,
um,
I don't play Texas hold'em.
I don't golf.
I'll just be that guy.

855
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:10.770
I'll be the guy.
See,
I guilty.
I'll just open that first beer.
Yeah.

856
00:49:10.771 --> 00:49:15.210
You'll be our designated first beer opener.
Yeah.
So we go out and it was my,

857
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:19.200
you know,
it like,
I,
I knew I could let loose,
you know,
I didn't have my kids,

858
00:49:19.201 --> 00:49:21.390
I didn't have to drive by,
blah,
blah,
blah.

859
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:26.520
So it was one of those deals where you wake up the next day and you're like,

860
00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:30.470
I don't quite remember at the end of the evening.
I swear I look on the,

861
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.710
I shouldn't be telling the story cause uh,
but I I

862
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.810
<v 0>you're going to say is going to be any worse than I though</v>

863
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.530
<v 1>the my shirt.
I had a button down shirt that I had worn the previous night.</v>

864
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.650
It's laying on the floor next to me on the bed on the,

865
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.030
on the floor next to the bed.

866
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.900
I pick it up and there's a tire mark across the back of it of car tire mark and

867
00:49:55.241 --> 00:49:58.090
I don't,
I don't know how it got there.
I'm like wow,

868
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:05.080
I'm in a car.
Couldn't have run me over.
I mean I'm,
I'm alive.
I'm in bed.

869
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:06.610
I think he went a little will Ferrell.

870
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.410
I think you took literally a tire mark and I had to call my brothers and go,

871
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:16.411
how has a tire mark a car tire mark on the back of my shirt and they told me

872
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:22.150
that we're getting in the car and that my foot hit the curb and I kind of like

873
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:27.500
tripped and fell on my back underneath the car and like I might back ended up

874
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:28.220
against the car

875
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.450
<v 0>tire.
They say,
you don't remember that.</v>

876
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.250
US having to pick you up and put you in a limo.
And I'm like,
Damn Dude,

877
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:38.350
you fell under underneath the car?
Yeah.
Not into a car.

878
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.840
Not on a car.
I fell under it.
Fell under it without it moving.

879
00:50:41.841 --> 00:50:46.580
It's now you've got sucked under.
That's not even possible.
Yeah.

880
00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:50.360
That's a trick shot coming off a curb.
I don't know how you could do it.

881
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:54.350
They said I did some weird kind of flip around and then ended up with my back up

882
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:58.970
against the tire.
I'm like,
did you say I should go home after that?

883
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:03.210
I hope those were your lines.
Yeah.
It's time for him to get home.
I uh,

884
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.610
Joe de Rosa,
another one of my great drinking buddies.
He's got what?

885
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:11.540
He's got a buddy of his back home.
Uh,
you know,
when you have a beer and a shot,

886
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.540
which was one of my favorite ways to start out,
you know what I mean?

887
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.590
Just sort of set the tone and uh,
his buddy calls it Bingo.

888
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:21.950
Banga Oh yeah.
Which is the greatest thing ever.
To me.
He just go,

889
00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:25.160
he came showed up one time,
he had a shot in the beer and Joe's just going like,

890
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:27.350
Hey,
what do you got going on there?
You guys,
you know,
Bingo.
Bingo.

891
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:28.700
Just kind of went like with the shot.

892
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:33.701
Fingal bank is one that I hit that one I would think go is the a would be the

893
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:36.080
shot bingos gotta be the beer,
right?

894
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.160
Well you do the shots first and then the beer in the beer.

895
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.940
So I would say bangled Bingo.
I was uh,
let me,
I'm trying to rewrite it

896
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.000
<v 1>out on the road.
And uh,</v>

897
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.470
this guy ordered a bunch of Irish car bombs.

898
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.260
Okay.
That's,
you drop it.

899
00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:58.880
It's a big thick black stout beer and a big glass.

900
00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.760
Then you take this,
what is it again?

901
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:07.450
And then you take a shot of whiskey and you drop the shot glass into the beer.

902
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:11.860
So the whiskey and the beer all together and then you chug the whole thing.
Yeah.

903
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.510
Alright.
Irish car bomb.
Well,

904
00:52:14.511 --> 00:52:17.600
I got the name wrong and then the next time I was in that city,

905
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.550
all these guys get to,
it was Philadelphia.

906
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:24.170
And we all went to this like kind of cool,
rough Philadelphia bar.

907
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.970
And it was this guy who we had done the Irish car bombs within his friends.

908
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:34.220
So I'm trying to be like a guy and I thought it was a mud slide.
I thought that,

909
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.500
which is,
you know,
malaria chick chick.

910
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:43.230
So I'm trying to fit in and I went,
who wants to do some mudslides?
And uh,

911
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:47.010
my buddy who was the one who did the Irish car bumps and look at it and be like,

912
00:52:47.011 --> 00:52:49.260
what the hell are you doing?
And I'm like,
no.

913
00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:51.840
And then now I don't want to back down.
I'm like,
Oh,

914
00:52:51.841 --> 00:52:53.670
you guys don't want to do mudslides,
Huh?

915
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.300
Like I keep pushing it and they're all looking at me.

916
00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:02.580
So I go over to the bar,
you know,
mister big,
big,
big shot bartender over here,

917
00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.550
seven,
seven slides,

918
00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:08.170
settled all of us mud slides.

919
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.400
Please check drinks.

920
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.350
And then next thing I know we're doing like these late cream shots.
Oh,

921
00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:23.100
they all went?
Yeah.
What?
Because they knew I was a comedian and they were like,

922
00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:26.070
wow,
this is something this guy likes.
I guess know they,
they,
they don't want to

923
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.510
<v 0>like undercut me.</v>

924
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.660
And then my friend finally took me aside and know what the hell are you doing

925
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:32.940
here man?
And I went,
this is what we did last time.
He goes,

926
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.190
those are Irish car bombs,
man.

927
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.550
That's like a reoccurring thing with you.

928
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.290
It's like you're one of the smartest guys.
I know what you're always saying.

929
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:46.190
I'm a moron.
And all that type of thing.
You just always seen big,
heavy,

930
00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:51.000
socially awkward.
You know what Terosa did that when he was in Boston,
hang,
hang,

931
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:53.160
hanging out with me.
We,
uh,
we did the shows over at the,
uh,

932
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:55.020
the Wilbur and afterwards,
all my,

933
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:58.110
my fucking knuckle head friends from high school,
all my great friends,

934
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.220
we were all drinking.
And uh,
in,

935
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:06.150
one of my buddies was really talking to Derosa.
They just saw the hit it off,

936
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.750
right?
And then he walked and he walked over.
He wants point.
He goes,
dude,
he goes,

937
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.380
what's up with you,
boy?
He goes,
what's up with the boy?
I go,
I go,

938
00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.320
what are you man?
He goes,
he goes,
see,
I just asked,
you know,

939
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:20.700
what do you want for a drinky?
He wanted a white Russian and he goes,
dude,

940
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.530
he goes,
dude,
I'm all set with that guy.

941
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.490
So I'm laughing thinking he's just breaking his balls.

942
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.870
So later on in the night after we go to leave and I'm laughing,
I go to Rosie.

943
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:32.820
You know what's hilarious when you ordered that white Russian,

944
00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:36.540
my buddy was breaking your balls,
balls to me saying he goes,
dude,

945
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:40.350
I'm done with that guy.
And then Joe just goes,
is how he stopped talking.

946
00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.850
He wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the fucking night.
He was dead serious,

947
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.210
which killed me.
Cause that's such like a Boston thing where like,

948
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.960
like that's still like that.
That alone.
I imagined Phillies the same way.

949
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.410
If you were to order like the raw,
like someone's just,
I liked this guy,

950
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.140
this guy's cool.
And then all of a sudden you order,

951
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:03.240
you order something that's just a little too fucking soft over right.

952
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.920
You're dead to me,
mudslides much.
I should get together with him.

953
00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:11.550
He will do some mud slides and some white Russians might white Russian chasers.

954
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.360
All right.
Bingo.
Bingo.
Bingo.
Bingo.

955
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:21.870
It was a sugar savory sugar salt or something.
Um,
all right,
let me,

956
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:24.270
uh,
let me make sure that I promote this thing.

957
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.140
I'm sure this went by and yet I knew it 44 minutes already.
Ah,

958
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.820
W before I get out of here,
um,
I,
I do want to bring this up to you.

959
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.550
We have to talk about the time when,
uh,
we decided for some reason I'm,
I'm,

960
00:55:37.551 --> 00:55:40.680
I'm going to say it was my idea that we were going to do a show together,

961
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.800
you know,
and this is of course,
was,
was I was like,

962
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:47.610
not only is this guy the funniest dude ever,
he also likes to drink,

963
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.200
I have to do a weekend with this guy.

964
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:51.660
But I knew that you were playing like these giant places.

965
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:55.260
I think I was doing clubs or whatever.
And so I was like,
I'll open for,

966
00:55:55.261 --> 00:55:58.260
I don't give a shit.
And then you were like,
hey,
why don't we just do a club?

967
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.430
You know,
the whole excuse was for us to drink.
So like why don't we just,

968
00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:03.600
we'll just do a club.

969
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.920
We picked COBB's comedy club in San Francisco and it was just like,
you know,

970
00:56:07.921 --> 00:56:11.730
for charity,
for charity.
So we figured we won't even make any money.

971
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:15.180
It'll just be an excuse for you and I to hang to get together and drink.

972
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:17.070
And I was,
I was going on first,

973
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.050
you were going on going on second and in,

974
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.320
and that's how I found out about the saint Jude's charity,

975
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:26.140
which I still donate money to.
And uh,

976
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:29.310
it just seemed like such a great idea in our heads.
It's like,
she's like,
yeah,

977
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.050
you know,
I'm completely filthy.
You're totally clean.
They're going to get the,

978
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.880
they're going to get the total standups,
white guy spectrum here.

979
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:41.470
And we went up there and I go on stage and your crowd was looking at me like,

980
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.780
Whoa,
who is this angry Leprechaun?

981
00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:49.120
And I would say on a scale of one to 10,
I'd give,
my set was about a four.

982
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.830
And then you go on stage,
I'm going to,
I Regan's going to,
or at least rig.

983
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.340
I felt bad.
I was like,
Oh man,

984
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:58.360
I kind of bombed in front of his crowd and everything.
And then you go on stage.

985
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.120
I remember my sister was there,
you were killing her.

986
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:05.250
And then all my more on friends fans is sitting there looking at you like he's

987
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:08.010
on a stage for eight minutes.
He hasn't said fuck yet.
Yeah,
I don't,

988
00:57:08.011 --> 00:57:12.490
I didn't feel like I killed either.
I mean I,
I felt like,
like you say,
I,
I,
I,
I,

989
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.780
you know,
I,
I did fine,
but I think we both did.
I like to do fine.

990
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:20.410
You know what I mean?
Flying is not what we want,
but you know,

991
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.430
it was like for a good cause.
But yeah,
I think it was like the two disparate,

992
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:27.630
if that's the right word,
you know,
audience who big a gap.
Yeah.

993
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:31.510
And I remember afterwards sitting in the bar and it was sort of like the

994
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:34.900
elephant in the room that we didn't want both wanted to address that we both

995
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:37.970
just sort of did fine.
And we would just sort of sitting there.

996
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:41.980
It was ruining our night sitting there drinking and then finally you brought it

997
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:46.580
up.
You just like,
like for three beers.
He was just like,
Hey,
what did you have?

998
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.140
How do you feel about that?
It's like,
I didn't think that went that good.

999
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:52.990
And then we would sort of stand in their little buzz going like,
yeah,
dude,

1000
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:56.680
what the fuck it was for charity?
Like we said,
we didn't have to be there.

1001
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:58.180
We almost got like pissed for a second though.

1002
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:02.320
We just started laughing and realize that there was too big of a gap.
Uh,

1003
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.210
well it was a noble cause you know,
it was weird about that too is a,
I think,

1004
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.570
I forget what the charity ended up being.

1005
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:12.640
American heart association or something like that.

1006
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:16.330
I thought we did the saint Jude thing.
I,
it was one of those too,

1007
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:21.490
but I remember like a cancer society something,
but you know,

1008
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:22.750
we contacted me,

1009
00:58:22.751 --> 00:58:27.010
my manager's office contacted them that we were going to donate all the money

1010
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:31.000
and like they don't say yes right away,
which is weird to me.
They're like,
well,

1011
00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:33.740
who are these guys?
And I'm like,
it's right.
You know,
and,

1012
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.660
and they want to know a little bit about us.
It's like,
heck no,
we're,

1013
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.750
we're giving money.
We're not asking you for money.
Yeah.

1014
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.680
And it was like you have to figure out how to give the money away.

1015
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.280
But you know what?

1016
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:50.280
I think that was because it was probably the way things are nowadays.

1017
00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:54.450
Like if,
if they get associated with somebody yeah.

1018
00:58:54.451 --> 00:58:58.960
Who controversial or whatever,
like say Donald Trump the week he said,
you know,

1019
00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:02.830
I guess evidently all Mexicans are rapists and he was saying something to that

1020
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:06.820
effect.
And,
uh,
if he was to donate them money,

1021
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:08.320
like the blowback had gone to them,

1022
00:59:08.321 --> 00:59:12.340
like you're accepting money from a known racist and they're like,
hey,

1023
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.800
we're trying to cure cancer here.
Right,
right,
right.
You know,

1024
00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.260
I probably shouldn't have brought that up.
Ah,
no.
It was great,
man.

1025
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:23.480
It was a,
it was a blast and I,

1026
00:59:23.481 --> 00:59:27.650
and I thought we had a great time that night hanging out.
So,
uh,
it was cool.
Wow.

1027
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:30.760
I would like to have done a little bit.
I'm not going to lie to you.

1028
00:59:30.761 --> 00:59:32.690
It's that sets you not,
it's still fucking bugs me.

1029
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:36.260
I think I probably said that during my set.
Like,
Dude,
do you understand?

1030
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:38.750
I don't have to fucking be here right now.
He's like,
I'm working for free.

1031
00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.050
Can you,
you know we should do,
can you give it up a little bit?

1032
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.410
We should do like the opposite extreme.

1033
00:59:45.411 --> 00:59:49.730
Like I should perform in front of your crowd and then I'll get a one out of 10

1034
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:54.731
and you get a 10 out of 10 and then you can perform in front of my crowd and we

1035
00:59:55.461 --> 01:00:00.461
need somebody to feature to Kinda sorta bridge bridge the two worlds like a

1036
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.090
David Feldman is this unreal,
unbelievable comedian.
Unbelievable joke writer.

1037
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.160
But he will out of nowhere to say Kentucky on stage maybe.

1038
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:16.640
I don't know.
Are you a sports fan,
Brian?
I like sports,

1039
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:20.030
but I'm always reluctant to say I'm a sports fan because then I immediately get

1040
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:23.960
hit with a question I can't answer.
I grew up in Miami.
I'm a dolphins fan.

1041
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.910
I like football and I like golf.
You know what's the great thing about,
uh,

1042
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:32.360
you coming out of Florida?
Florida has a bad reputation for comedians.

1043
01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:35.580
Like they tried to say that a bunch of hacks come out of there and uh,

1044
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.200
then you're always the go to guy.
They're like,
fuck you.
They're like Brian Regan.

1045
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.420
It always named three,
I forget who the other two are,

1046
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:46.340
but every city I think kind of just has three good ones every state at this

1047
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:50.660
point.
I mean there's only like the top hundred right?
Comedians.

1048
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:55.130
You got 50 states you got to go to from each state.
Yeah.

1049
01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.020
Who are the two from Rhode Island.
That's funny.

1050
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:01.010
Everybody's got that.
Oh,

1051
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:04.250
I was trying to steer the conversation towards sports because I've been

1052
01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:09.020
defending my New England patriots as they've literally become like the fucking

1053
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:13.660
antichrist.
Uh,
the antichrist,
however,
however you supposed to say it,

1054
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.460
it just now at this point,
like we just,

1055
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:21.140
after the 9 million thing that we've been accused of,

1056
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:25.100
of course just accused,
nothing has ever been proven.
Other than that,

1057
01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:29.540
we cheated for one game in 2007 where we filmed the jets and then a bunch of

1058
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:32.900
people like,
well then you're super bowl championship shouldn't count.
It's like,

1059
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:37.340
yeah,
they should because it wasn't against the rules for us to be doing what

1060
01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:38.900
everybody else was fucking doing.

1061
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:42.770
We just ignored them and we cheated against the jets that we get ratted out by

1062
01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:44.480
fucking meant.
Janey.
Other than that,

1063
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:48.770
it's just been a bunch of fucking hearsay and I was just hoping you would either

1064
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.800
100% agree with me or 100% disagree with make and we'd get into an epic argument

1065
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:57.560
about it,
but you,
you're into golf.
Do you watch tennis at all?

1066
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:02.390
Did you see Serena last?
I saw that she lost.
Yeah.
That was devastating to me.

1067
01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.460
I hate,
that's why I hate watching tennis and golf.
Those are the two most brutal.

1068
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.030
It's all on you.
It's like doing it.

1069
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:13.490
It's like doing stand up on a late night talk show.

1070
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:17.750
If you go out and fucking bomb,
it's Nike.
You're out there with somebody else.

1071
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:22.630
It's just a hundred percent
trying to keep your emotions in check.

1072
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.010
Like the first time I actually sat and I've watched a golf tournament wire to

1073
01:02:27.011 --> 01:02:27.844
wire.

1074
01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:32.850
I watched the masters in I think 2007 it was when the wheels came off with,

1075
01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:35.320
with Kenny Perry.

1076
01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:39.190
And I was watching that whole thing rooting for this guy and he's never won and

1077
01:02:39.191 --> 01:02:40.670
he's going to win his first major,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1078
01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.770
The guy was like three fucking holes away the wheel.

1079
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.820
And I saw his kids go from tears of joy to,

1080
01:02:48.821 --> 01:02:53.110
to devastation.
Like the guy died.
And I later heard that he,

1081
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.750
when he lost,
he didn't even talk to his family.

1082
01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:57.490
I'm sure he said a couple of words.

1083
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.340
He just got in his car and just started driving.

1084
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.570
And I remember being as a sports fan,

1085
01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:09.520
so upset that I actually sat and watched that happen to a fellow human being.

1086
01:03:09.521 --> 01:03:12.720
I felt horrible.
I felt like I was looking at it and getting an execution.

1087
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:17.470
It's like watching an execution almost,
you know?
Um,
but I mean,

1088
01:03:17.471 --> 01:03:21.810
there are similarities between that and what we do.
You know,
it's like,
uh,
you,

1089
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:27.100
you have a horrible set somewhere,
especially on TV,
you know,

1090
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.070
but at least the least,
you can blame the crowd on some level.

1091
01:03:30.071 --> 01:03:34.390
You can stand and yell.
Alien could,
not on TV,
but in like a a at a comedy club,

1092
01:03:34.391 --> 01:03:35.500
I'll fuck you people.

1093
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.480
You can do something to try to do something to at least some sort of,

1094
01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:45.490
I get you're better at that than I am a minor victory in it today.

1095
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.440
Just have to sit there and,

1096
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:52.710
and as people are commentating who don't nearly would never have the,

1097
01:03:52.841 --> 01:03:56.770
we'll have the skill to do what they're doing and just be seeing that guy.
Oh,

1098
01:03:56.771 --> 01:03:59.290
the wheels,
it just coming off right now.
You can see he's,

1099
01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.180
he's just visibly upset.

1100
01:04:01.181 --> 01:04:04.900
He's perspiring and they're just sitting there just giving play by play.

1101
01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:09.880
Nobody quiz you bomb as a comic is bad as it gets this nobody giving play by

1102
01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:13.330
play doing that mystery science theater thing as you're doing it.

1103
01:04:13.331 --> 01:04:18.130
That's all I'm saying.
So I,
I,
I like golf.
I actually loved tennis,

1104
01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:21.880
but I like watching somebody.
I went to the,

1105
01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:23.830
I was in France this year and I went to the,
uh,

1106
01:04:23.831 --> 01:04:28.831
the French Open finals and I was so excited to see Djokovich when the French,

1107
01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.300
and then he would have won on all four,
all surfaces.

1108
01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:34.300
And he would have become part of this short list.
And he won the first set.

1109
01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:38.710
And after he wanted it,
he looked over at his coach and he fucking did like that,

1110
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.060
that tiger woods fist pump.
And I was like,
Oh man,
this guy is dialed in.

1111
01:04:43.061 --> 01:04:47.710
He's fucking dialed in.
He lost the next three straight.
Oh Man.
It was just,

1112
01:04:47.711 --> 01:04:50.500
it was,
and it was great to see that where Rinca guy when his first one.

1113
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.020
But that's one thing that

1114
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:58.950
<v 1>is so great about sports is if you do win a championship or you do when</v>

1115
01:04:58.951 --> 01:04:59.341
something,

1116
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:04.140
you have that Eureka moment where you can jump up and down and celebrate and hug

1117
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:07.170
people.
Most jobs don't have,
yeah.

1118
01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:11.850
Now that line in the sand moment,
you know,
where you can just go,

1119
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.370
yeah.
You know,

1120
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:18.460
you go to work a nine to five and you do what you're supposed to do.

1121
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:22.600
You don't have some moment where you're just jumping up and down on your desk,

1122
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.100
you know?
Um,

1123
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:28.930
so I get to be that they should do that for people every Friday when it's like

1124
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:30.850
four 59 and they're like,
well,
you know,

1125
01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:34.180
do that one minute left in the period like they used to do in the Boston Garden

1126
01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:37.420
and then that wouldn't be good.
Count down from 10

1127
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:45.820
people,
got the goggles on,
spraying champagne and all that shit.

1128
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:48.760
And then you go home for the weekend.
Well we did it,
you know,

1129
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:50.170
we had a good week at work.

1130
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.820
That might actually be a morale booster if especially if like some shit fucking

1131
01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:57.820
job.
I think that would be a great idea.
You have your week,

1132
01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:01.060
your weekly count down man.
You send everybody home in a good mood.

1133
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.390
<v 0>Absolutely.
Well Dude,
we gotta we gotta go.
I gotta wrap this thing up.</v>

1134
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.410
I got to do some more advertising here,
but it's,

1135
01:06:06.411 --> 01:06:08.790
it's been an absolute pleasure as a,

1136
01:06:08.791 --> 01:06:13.720
as a fan of the art of standup comedy to watch as much as your careers is.

1137
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:15.100
I've seen it to actually,
you know,

1138
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:18.310
when you came down to the comedy still comedy store,
the comedy works,

1139
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:22.210
that that is still and always will be one of the biggest highlights of my
career.

1140
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.490
And uh,
I will definitely be there.

1141
01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.520
What is the date of when you're a shooting it here?

1142
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.370
<v 1>Oh,
September 26th,
a Saturday.
Um,</v>

1143
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.450
nine o'clock eastern time and I don't know what time it will be on all the other

1144
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:38.140
time zones,
but a nine o'clock eastern on comedy central.
Bill,

1145
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:42.760
you're the best man.
I've stand up comedy special ever first.

1146
01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:46.210
Live special on comedy central.
I think HBO has done one.

1147
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:48.280
I think Seinfeld did a live special on Hbo,

1148
01:06:48.281 --> 01:06:51.670
but this is comedy central's first one.
So that's,
it's incredible.
Thank you.

1149
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.130
It's incredible.
Hey listen man,
I think you're great.

1150
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.090
I've always loved your comedy.
I've always loved your perspective.

1151
01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:00.640
I love her saying,
look,
you're cursing.

1152
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.040
I love your drinking.
Yes,
no man.
Um,

1153
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.950
and so I just wanted to return the compliment man.
You're,

1154
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:11.380
that's why we wanted to come down to see you because you're great.

1155
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.380
Well I appreciate

1156
01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:16.310
<v 0>that.
And next time you are boozing.
I don't play Texas hold'em or golf.</v>

1157
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:20.330
I'll learn the Texas hold'em golf.
I can keep it on the course.
Hit me up,
dude.

1158
01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.090
I'll fly in.
I fly and I'll tell my wife I'm doing a corporate gig.

1159
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:26.720
Just I just won't show up with any money afterwards.
All right.

1160
01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:31.721
Please tune in September 26th at 9:00 PM on comedy central eastern time to watch
