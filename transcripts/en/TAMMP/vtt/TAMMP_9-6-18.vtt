00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.860
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.410
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.990
<v 1>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.220
<v 0>it's checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.</v>

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.420
So you know your week's going,
hi.

6
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:25.421
You're holding up how you're handling today's top stories in the news.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.770
Um,
I haven't seen much about it,
but I guess Nike,
uh,

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.780
got on board with the colon.
Karnok Colin Kaepernick,
right?

9
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:40.580
Say Hey,
sometimes you gotta do what it is to get debt.
Right.
And then everybody,

10
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:44.740
you know,
you know the deal,
you know people are,
it's like,
Hey,

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.510
my point is about police brutality and ever since nine 11 a bit.

12
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.430
Yes sir.
Sir.
We're not talking about that.

13
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.280
No one is saying that your brother is not over in Iraq.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.170
He's talking about police brutality.
What?

15
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.430
And that right.
There is political discourse

16
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.400
in 2018.

17
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.770
<v 0>You know,
not saying people listen back in the day,
but at least they,
they,</v>

19
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.040
they did a better job pretending,
you know,
well,
what,

20
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:22.360
where does Nike get off acting like they give a fuck about people.
You know,

21
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.320
if they really gave a shit,

22
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.100
people wouldn't they have allowed that documentary exposing their fucking

23
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:31.930
sweatshops to air at some point.
Oh,
shots fired and bill,

24
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.820
if,
uh,
if you gave a shit,
wouldn't you not be wearing a Nike shirt right now?
Hey,

25
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:41.250
fair enough.
We're all full of shit.
Um,

26
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.180
Jesus Christ.
If I see one more fucking moron,

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.470
<v 2>okay.</v>

28
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.681
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:52.681
no screaming about troops or nine 11 on a subject that has nothing to do with

30
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:54.034
it.

31
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.390
<v 2>Okay?</v>

32
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.650
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.
It's a protest about police brutality.</v>

33
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.410
He is allowed to do this law.

34
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.330
I'm allowed to misconstrue good Straw.
What he's saying,
Dad.
Dad,

35
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.610
<v 2>okay.</v>

36
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.470
<v 0>You know,
but that's what it is.</v>

37
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.170
I think that's what happened with the Internet is now everything.

38
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.170
Even when it isn't about you,
it has to be about you.

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.980
<v 0>You know all of these fucking people,
you know what I mean?
It's,
it's,
it just,</v>

41
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.600
it just be all of this shit.
Oh,

42
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.860
this fucking shit you see on Instagram with a person's acting like they're

43
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.090
trying to inspire you when they're really just trying to show you all the cars

44
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.500
they have outside of their fucking a giant house with their abs.

45
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.630
You know the fuck was I joking about that with,

46
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.410
I did the Bill Simmons podcast that was joking about that.
You know,

47
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.970
all these fucking celebrities always telling you how hard they're working.

48
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.760
Yo,
we out here grinding.
It's like everybody.
Everybody is.

49
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.330
A lot of people weren't blessed.
Most people were not blessed with your gifts.

50
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.230
They're grinding does not fill an arena,
you know,

51
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.600
but there are really good fucking carpenter,

52
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.660
but no one's going to sit there and watch him frame of fuck.
Well,

53
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.300
I guess you wouldn't frame a house as a carpenter,
a finished carpet.

54
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.850
Nubson I'm thinking,
what are you saying,
Bill,

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.360
that regular carpenters aren't as good as finished carpenters?
Well,
I mean,
yeah,

56
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.280
you can hide a lot of your mistakes in the walls.

57
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.333
<v 3>Hey,
Mike.</v>

58
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.690
<v 0>Um,
he built a shack and I rack,</v>

59
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.770
that's not what I was talking about.
Obs.
I struck it felt like yelling.

60
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.113
<v 2>MMM.</v>

61
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.470
<v 0>Anyways,
I saw a little bit of it.</v>

62
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.540
I saw somebody retweets something and it was something about Fox News,

63
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.000
of course,
trash and Kaepernick of course saying he's not American.
Uh,

64
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.770
and of course saying probably that,
you know,

65
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.250
he doesn't support the troops because he's talking about police brutality.

66
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.750
Oh,
the weather outside is frightful.
Um,
so there you go.

67
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:17.590
But by all means,
you know,
people,
uh,
you know,

68
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.470
don't burn your own property,
you know,

69
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.040
even if he don't like Nike,
she could give it to a homeless guy.

70
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.930
And also when you burn that stuff,

71
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.090
you just really polluting your own environment.
Yeah.

72
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:31.850
With all that rubber and God knows what else is on the fucking sneaker,

73
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.010
what do you have to burn it?
Why can't you just throw them out or set them aside?

74
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.800
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

75
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.760
<v 0>I,
he's got to burn it.</v>

76
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.720
I remember when Lane Kiffin lift left fucking Tennessee in this guy somehow at

77
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:50.170
some lane Kiffin Jersey and he liked,
lit it on fire,

78
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.770
filmed it and then pissed on it.

79
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

80
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.490
<v 3>You Renell we went off lake link,</v>

81
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:02.030
you and leave and Tanner see per buck and UFC.

82
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.801
<v 0>Uh,
what do you think about it?</v>

83
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:09.150
An American corporation poisoning our own food supply.
What

84
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.590
are you going to let your cornflakes on fire and then pee on him

85
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.990
<v 3>or do you and I says,
what the fuck you talking about?</v>

86
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.400
You Bald headed freckled mother fucking Yankee Code word the fuck you do now.

87
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.730
<v 0>No southern guy ever said can't do.
They can't if birken curd,</v>

88
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.280
that's how they see it.
Um,
our brain,

89
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.330
why am I acting like it's everybody down the south burning their Nike's?

90
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.263
<v 2>No,
no,
no.</v>

91
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.370
<v 0>I don't know why there's not more people saying like this was about police</v>

92
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:51.540
brutality.
You may or may not agree with it.

93
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.880
Well,
to then try and make it about something else,

94
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.100
which then leads you to burn your own sneakers.

95
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.020
It's probably not the direction you want to go in.
However,

96
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.970
that's not what you know.

97
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.650
But the thing is is if somebody is burning their own sneakers and then you show

98
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.880
it on TV,
like all of those channels you flipping through,
right?

99
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.650
There's this,
the fucking the lawyer chick,
right?
You flipped the channel.

100
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.150
There's the,
there's the Jack Ryan Guy.
You flip the channel is decipher.

101
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.730
You flip the channel.
There's a commercially of flip.

102
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.270
The channel is a saga gave you flip the channel.
Somebody sneakers are on fire,

103
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:27.860
you're going,
what the fuck is that

104
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.620
<v 2>okay</v>

105
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.010
<v 0>with somebody in those,
when those caught on fire?
My God,</v>

106
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.400
what?
What,
how did those sneakers catch on fire if fire?
Well,
yeah,
you know what?

107
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.260
I think we cracked the code here.

108
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:44.880
People for anyone in Hollywood listening to this,
if you want to hit series,

109
00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:49.860
you need fire.
That'll make people stop.
But it's got to look real.

110
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.660
So in other words,

111
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.100
<v 2>yeah.</v>

112
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.960
<v 0>You know like when you shoot without a permit,</v>

113
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.580
you got to like light something on fire without permission and then it'll look

114
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:00.570
real because it is real.

115
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.050
And if you can somehow capture the people running out of whatever the fuck you

116
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:04.890
lit on fire,

117
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.810
then I think you could actually get people to stop long enough and possibly sit

118
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:14.640
through some commercials that they would allow your show to air for the

119
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.670
following week.
So see,
I guess there is a silver lining

120
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.561
for the life of me.

121
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:25.561
I will never fucking understand people that take it to that fucking level.

122
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.960
I get Nikkei,
he not agree.
Well,
let's say you know it's about police brutality,

123
00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:34.830
but you're like,
that's not the way to go about protesting.
Fine.
I get that.

124
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.730
Fair enough.
Good point to you sir or madam,

125
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:41.070
but wouldn't like you take it to the point that like,

126
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.703
<v 2>you know,</v>

127
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.640
<v 0>you're going to burn your shit</v>

128
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.120
and then film it and then upload it onto the Internet and no point during any of

129
00:07:51.121 --> 00:07:52.410
that fucking process.

130
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.070
You like those sneakers when it was just crying children's sewn them together,

131
00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:02.660
didn't ya?
You don't like how fucked up.
I mean,
I mean,

132
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:06.920
how far back will be going to take this?
You know,
if you really care,

133
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.073
<v 2>all right,</v>

134
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.100
<v 0>then you wouldn't buy those things in the first place.</v>

135
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.640
You'd be going down to the fucking,
uh,

136
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.750
sneaker factory and given that little kid a break and you'd sit down on the

137
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.780
stool and you'd fucking glue your shit together yourself,
wouldn't you,

138
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.680
wouldn't you?
Um,

139
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.910
<v 2>okay.</v>

140
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.000
<v 0>I Dunno.
All I know is I'm sitting here right now and I don't have the Internet.</v>

141
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.310
I'm a 50 year old man.
I don't have the Internet.

142
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.770
I don't know when I'm going to be able to upload this.
Uh,

143
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.600
I once again upgraded my sister,
you know,
my,
a buddy of mine was just telling me,

144

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.660
Fucking Michigan Wolverines is sponsored by Nike.

178
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.320

179
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:41.660
pants.
They run around it.
Is it a hug?

180
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:43.700
Their buttocks is in such a way.

181
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.331
I'm sorry people.

182
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:50.540
I don't have the Internet right now so I can't look up anything about sports,

183
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.120
so you're just going to have to suffer through another fucking 20 minutes of

184
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:53.954
this.

185
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:00.150
<v 0>I'm contractually obligated to continue running my fucking mouth for another 19</v>

187
00:11:01.331 --> 00:11:04.880
minutes.
The contract.
I signed with myself kind of Likewhen,

188
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.410
Motley Crue signed that contract that they were never going to tour again

189
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.250
because if they did then I guess they're going to sue themselves.

190
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.440
That's how that works.

191
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

192
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.740
<v 0>I'm sitting here right now.
I am staring at a VCR DVD player.</v>

193
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

194

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.380
I'm trying to find a fucking radio shack or something.

196
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.140
Oh Jesus.
What did I just do?
I can't hear myself.

197
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.130
I can't hear myself.
There we go.
Now I can hear myself.
You know,

198
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.750
I just literally just fucking bought this shit and now it doesn't work.

199
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.930
You know what?
I'm going to blame.
I'm gonna Blame Colin Kaepernick.

200
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.020
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.200
<v 0>Uh,

202
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.430

Well,

203
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.860

Um,

204
00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 2>okay.</v>

205
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.260
<v 0>But there's best buy still sell the shit you need for that.
Does anybody know</v>

206
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.380
that's one of those things,
man,
when you hang onto the old technology,

207
00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:10.500
cause I got all my old standup tapes over here on VHS.
I converted most of them.

208
00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.030
And then there's other ones and it's just like,

209
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.210
I dunno what the fuck is only shit before I go send it over there.

210
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.773
<v 2>Well</v>

211
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.800
<v 0>trying to think,
did I ever make a porno?</v>

212
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:31.130
You got to ask yourself before you send your VHS tick you get here VCR man,

213
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:33.060
it's this new fangled fucking machine.

214
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.700
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.880
<v 0>Is it put up on Nacky cause I'll light it on fire.</v>

216
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.513
MMM.

217
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.270
Some redneck is going to go to a Chinese restaurant and accidentally light one

218
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.380
of the people there on fire.

219
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.893
<v 2>You know,</v>

220
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.960
<v 0>cause he's going to give them a tip and he's going to be like,</v>

221
00:12:56.961 --> 00:13:01.010
do you like you know you like and she's going to be I like e and then he's going

222
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.920
to think she said Nike and then that.
See that.
See that how that happens.

223
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.740
It's a slippery slope.
Once you start,

224
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.010
you start lighting shit on fire man.
Like you don't know where,

225
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.540
where's it going to stop?
I mean maybe if you do it,

226
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.680
you start to like it,
right?
And then the next time your wife's like,
hi,

227
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.830
could you take the trash out?

228
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.660
And you're walking over their shoulders slump looking down at the linoleum

229
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.120
defeated man.
You get like a foot away from the trash.

230
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:41.350
It's suddenly just remember

231
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.130
how good it felt to let your own sneakers on fire.

232
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.290
Oh,
of a sudden you lift that fucking head up proud for the first time in years.

233
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.343
<v 2>Okay.</v>

234
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.720
<v 0>And you knew that.
You know what?</v>

235
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.020
You want me to take this trash out?
You fucking bitch.

236
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.563
I'll take it out.

237
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.400
I'm allotted on fire and I'm a film it and I'm going to put it on the Internet

238
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.770
and then we'll see what them sneakers sale and motherfuckers say then

239
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.423
<v 2>mmm.</v>

240
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.030
<v 0>16 minutes to go.</v>

241
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.680
Oh geesh.
Um,

242
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.230
the red sox are playing 500 bull.
When is Chris sale coming back?

243
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.580
I have no,

He is the guy that prevents us

244
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.370
from slicer.
Fucking funny.
Everybody I told,

245
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:46.090
you know I told those fuckers at ESPN,
they wouldn't listen to me.
They don't.

246
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.430
They are afraid to listen to this podcast when they said the fuck and Yankees

247
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.590
got swept.
This division series is over.
Yeah,

248
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.700
he said that the first week of fucking August.
And what did bill say?

249
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.610
What did the balding freckled con who never played baseball belong beyond the

250
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.350
minor or major leagues.
Okay.

251
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.420
Got kicked out of baseball because he got a d in math in 19 fucking 79 was the

252
00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:19.671
last time I played in an organized league and even I could see it even I was

253
00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:22.800
going,
hey,
wait a minute.
ESPN.

254
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

255
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.090
<v 0>There's like 60 fucking games left and were up by nine and a half games.</v>

256
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.600
I don't know what kind of fucking Muslim asses textbook you're looking at.

257
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.330
The numbers don't add up.
Um,

258
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.903
<v 2>yeah,</v>

259
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.440
<v 0>we'll probably going to win like 105 games.</v>

260
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.090
I even know where the fuck we're at right now.

261
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.560
Last I saw he was like 91 or 92 probably go 500 for the rest of the fucking
year.

262
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.350
You know,
it's an,
it's never fucking Yogi Berra said,

263
00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:03.070
it's not over till it's over.
He said that before there was a wild card,

264
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.630
a one game playoff,
19 fucking rounds of baseball.

265
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.560
He said that back when all you had to do was win the fucking division and you

266
00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:14.080
won the pennant and then you had to win four more games.

267
00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:15.340
You won the world series.

268
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.760
Even that fucking guy

269
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.820
who essentially mocked mentally challenged people his entire life with is

270
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.410
planned out.
Goofy Sakes,

271
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.563
<v 2>right?</v>

272
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.060
<v 0>Plain Glib.
The whole time,
like a hot chick trying to get some free drinks.</v>

273
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.580
Never figured out what that guy's angle was.
Even he said,

274
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.280
it ain't over till it's over.

275
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.100
Who said what first

276
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.013
<v 2>bye.</v>

277
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.400
<v 0>Sounded like Abbott and Costello who said it ain't over till it's over first or</v>

278
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.420
like what came first that or it ain't over until the fat lady sings,

279
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.323
<v 2>right.</v>

280
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.440
<v 0>Everybody knows if you want to hear somebody could sink,</v>

281
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.830
you gotta get a fat woman,
right?
Fat Woman,

282
00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:15.831
fat woman listen to was saying and mine is not that theme song and they come

283
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.040
walking out,
oh,

284
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.940
he's had some sort of flair on for a code or some sodas,
some sort of,

285
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.270
I dunno what something but dazzled coming out day with their fat feet.

286
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.840
Fucking
just all squeezed into those little pumps.

287
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.080
[inaudible] who right singing the shit out of the national anthem.

288
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.500
Why would they send at the end of the game?
You know why?
I bet.

289
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:50.280
Because they didn't have fucking jumbo trons back in the day.
You don't see,

290
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:54.450
everybody's just walking out and all you could hear was the sound of fucking

291
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.840
people stepping on empty peanut shells.

292
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.920
<v 0>Just racist shit.
Right.</v>

294
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.130
They had to stop people from being racist to each other to get them out of it.

295
00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:04.240
And that's just the white people.

296
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.240
You're fucking day go bastard.
I mean a fucking Irish bastard.

297
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.321
Fuck you're,

298
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.280
you're fucking Daigo right back then when like the Irish and the Italians,

299
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:19.800
like white people were like racist against each other.

300
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.263
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.940
<v 0>Polish people,
all of that shit.</v>

302
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.610
They needed to keep him calm when they walked out of the ballpark.

303
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.030
So then they just have some fat lady come waddling out there.

304
00:18:31.031 --> 00:18:33.820
Everybody could laugh at her.
God,
well,
you know what?

305
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:35.740
I might have fucking tuberculosis.

306
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.410
At least my feet aren't oozing out of my shoes.

307
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:44.950
And she'd get out there singing and [inaudible] five [inaudible] bars.

308
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.080
Jaymar Mike.

309
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.450
<v 2>Okay,</v>

310
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.240
<v 0>everybody just put on the fucking derbies and they walked up.</v>

311
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.480
<v 2>Okay,</v>

312
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.550
<v 0>take me out to the ball game.</v>

313
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.300
Take me back to my neighborhood where everybody looks like me and we fucking

314
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:08.560
cabbage for three cause where I rich people in the Irish section of they'll

315
00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:09.700
fucking town.

316
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.470
Keep your pasty freckled fucking ass in your own neighborhood.
Right.

317
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.040
So weird how they glorify that,
that error in sports.
A simpler time.

318
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.060
The good old days of baseball.
They way they tell it two different ways that you,

319
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.060
they either have like that,

320
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:30.990
that version we're Billy crystal talks about going to the Yankees game and

321
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:34.470
seeing Mickey Mantle or they do the real shit,

322
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.920
the Jackie Robinson story that it's just like,
oh,
okay.

323
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.661
And all in.

324
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:43.530
It's the exact same fucking footage other than that black cat being thrown on

325
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:44.760
the field.
Other than that,

326
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.390
it's all the exact same footage and how you're viewing it has less to do with

327
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:54.450
what they're saying and more to do with the music that they play underneath it.

328
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.190
11 minutes to go.
I don't have my rear right now.

329
00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:07.940
I'd be reading my fucking advertising and I could get through this part,

330
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.430
but I don't fucking have it

331
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.180
by the way.
Butcher box.
You're welcome.

332
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

333
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.720
<v 0>I have blown up heritage bread.
Pork.</v>

334
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

335
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.280
<v 0>I blown it up.
I brought,
I brought it back.</v>

336
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.620
It was so fucking far gone.
People didn't even know it was missing.

337
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:33.650
I had never heard,
I've been eating pork chops my entire fucking life.

338
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.250
<v 0>Bacon,
Ham and cheese sandwiches got older.</v>

340
00:20:40.251 --> 00:20:43.730
I moved to New York.
I was introduced to a Cuban sandwich.
Right.

341
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.150
All of that fucking

342
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.890
<v 2>what do they got their welcome whenever I think I got to go fucking</v>

343
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.890
cause you're dumb bill.
Oh that's probably it.

344
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.430
<v 0>Pork Butt,
right?
Pork shoulder.</v>

345
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.700
Is it really the ass of the pig and they just say pork shoulder cause they don't

346
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:09.370
want you to be reminded,
you know,
they do say rump roast,
right?

347
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.783
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

348
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.680
<v 0>Hey,
all you guys out there burning your sneakers,
you know,
you know,
you know,</v>

349
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:18.820
you also have like an apocalypse like game plan,

350
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.660
you know what I mean?
You like Bill Walsh,

351
00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:26.661
she call in all the plays in the first half and I'm just fucking showing up and

352
00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:29.400
I'm not even going to know what the fuck's going to hit me.
Right.

353
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.200
I have an apocalypse plant to die within the first hour.

354
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.580
Oh Shit.
That's that.
I mean that is the ultimate plant,

355
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.110
you know,
cause then I,
then I get to be a ghost.
Right.

356
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.310
And I'm already as white as one.
Right.
That might be my,
my disguise.

357
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.870
The freckles would give me away.

358
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.103
<v 2>MMM.</v>

359
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.750
<v 0>No,
you die within the first hour and then you just hang around you.</v>

360
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:07.480
What you don't like.
Remember Patrick Swayze and uh,
Moondance,

361
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.820
whatever the fuck fucking movie was called,
our hair to Tahoe.

362
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.920
<v 0>A dad or not damaged with this chick and her knows that she chose to change.</v>

364
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:28.810
You know,
Wade,
that was weird.
Um,

365
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.530
ghost.
Jesus Christ.
I said I wanted to be a fucking ghost.

366
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.030
<v 2>Okay?</v>

367
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.220
<v 0>Yeah,
I remember that.
When he would look up at the light,</v>

368
00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:42.990
evidently you have an option when you die.
All right?
If you go into hell,

369
00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:45.150
you don't have an option.
You just get manhandled.

370
00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:48.240
Look like you grabbed some chicks ass at the club.

371
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:53.250
These fucking Damon's just come up or they just grab you and then that's it.

372
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.170
But if you lived a good life,

373
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.760
if he took out their trash and you didn't light it on fire,

374
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.160
I guess you could look up at the light and,
and God gives you the option.

375
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.020
You're like,
hey man,
you want to come behind the velvet rope boy?
Like,

376
00:23:12.021 --> 00:23:16.160
do you just want to fucking,
you want to be a voyeur for awhile?
I'm not judging,

377
00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:20.420
dude.
This isn't going to go against your record.
Okay?
You done good.

378
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:22.280
You did good enough to get up here.

379
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.060
You know there's another train coming in and a couple of weeks if you want to

380
00:23:26.061 --> 00:23:28.880
just fucking hang around.
I mean you got to hang around,
right?

381
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.720
You got to go Tom Sawyer and hang out at your own funeral.
That'd be,

382
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:36.230
that'd be no funerals at the fucking apocalypse.
There'll be the old school ones.

383
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.553
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

384
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.620
<v 0>They fucking dig up fucking foot and a half foot trench.</v>

385
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.970
Deep Trench.
He does hope.

386
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:49.520
They don't see anything sparkling in the dirt or they're just going to leave you

387
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:53.360
out in the open and keep digging
is that you?
Rainium

388
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.390
you know it's going to have an easy time during the apocalypse are going to be

389
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.640
the hipsters cause they're already like,

390
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.190
they already have the fucking grizzly Adams beard.

391
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.000
So this stay warm in the winter.
They're already,
you know,

392
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.660
they know how to make like their own jam and fucking beer in the bathtub.

393
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.900
Like all this old school stuff.
Some of them know how to make their own clothes.

394
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.080
Like I think hipsters are going to be,
I think they're going to be all right.

395
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.210
And we're all going to be like,
wow.
You know what?

396
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.050
I remember I wanted to fight that kid cause he told me that he's learning how to

397
00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:25.950
be a blacksmith,

398
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.003
<v 2>you know,</v>

399
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.230
<v 0>and the other kid was building a steam ship and then all of a sudden the</v>

400
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.330
apocalypse is going to happen.
You'll be like,
you know something.

401
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:37.160
Those are some skills I wish I had right now.

402
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.100
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh,
this is like the longest fucking podcast ever.

403
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

404
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.440
<v 0>Okay.
Five minutes to go.
Jesus Christ.
Five minutes left.</v>

405
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.703
<v 2>Okay.</v>

406
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.700
<v 0>Um,
I'm going to be in Sacramento this weekend.</v>

407
00:24:57.701 --> 00:25:00.880
Everybody know north of Sacramento.

408
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.560
I'm doing a casino up there with a rose bowl tailgate.

409
00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:09.610
Lez Legend Jason Law,
head master,

410
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.200
flat top grill.
Shep,
master smoker.

411
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.840
Math.
You put them on a green egg.
A fucking,

412
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:25.270
a standard fucking grill.
Demand is going to eat.

413
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.720
He's going to make something.
He just makes,
he makes everyone around him better.

414
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.611
<v 0>With like,
you know,</v>

416
00:25:30.611 --> 00:25:34.870
it'd be like if you just add that player that causes everybody to elevate their

417
00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:38.470
game.
The second we added Jason Law had to the fucking tailgate.

418
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.630
Everybody had a few more beers,

419
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.393
<v 2>right?</v>

420
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.470
<v 0>Everybody?
Uh,
I dunno,
eight,
a little bit more every,</v>

421
00:25:45.471 --> 00:25:48.860
but everybody just took it a little bit more and we got this extra for the first

422
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:53.750
time ever,
we made it to the playoffs of arguably the top,

423
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:57.320
whatever,
400 tailgates in our section.

424
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.240
Now there's some people that throw down,
man,

425
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.630
they bring like satellite dishes and shit and like TVs,
you know.

426
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:03.464
But I'm telling you,

427
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.990
you wanna you want to bring the fucking flat top fucking grill.

428
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

429
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.710
<v 0>All right.
What's the God damn propane tank?</v>

430
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.000
None of that shit squat and around with your little firebox trying to get the

431
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:21.020
coals burning and all of that shit.
Fuck that.

432
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:22.020
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

433
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.560
<v 0>you just turn on the gas.
We weekly quick.</v>

434
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.820
Let that fucking thing.
Heat up.

435
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.420
Drink a bloody Mary and next thing you know fucking,

436
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:36.470
you mean you making yourself an egg sandwich with bacon.
Ah,

437
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.570
delicious.
Toasting up your ag mic.
Yeah,

438
00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:46.170
you're fucking,
yeah.
Yo English muffins.
That's just breakfast.

439
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.650
Now you've moved on to Whiskey,
right?

440
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.310
It's fucking pro.
I got the flat top going over a

441
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.830
over Labor Day.
And by the way,
I'm telling you,
I made the,

442
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:04.510
I made the practice Burger,
I took it right out of the fridge and I was like,

443
00:27:04.511 --> 00:27:04.871
you know,

444
00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:09.640
I should have fucking had this spin room temperature but I don't have the time.

445
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.690
And I threw it on.
I did five minutes,
both sides.

446
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.750
I made sure it was nice and thin or whatever.
Um,
it was,

447
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.090
I guess a little too thick and I took it off,

448
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.910
had a nice crunch to it and everything.
But when we got to the middle,

449
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.780
it was like rare.
So I was like,

450
00:27:25.781 --> 00:27:30.430
well thank fucking God.
I didn't,
by the way,
I hate,
it's still,

451
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.323
I still ate it.

452
00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.790
Fucking hamburger in the middle of it was like the consistency of bubblegum and

453
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.690
a very dangerous,
very dangerous thing to do.
You can,

454
00:27:37.691 --> 00:27:41.290
you can get away with that with steak because you just fucking with one steer at

455
00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:44.470
that point.
But hamburger is just like a million stairs,
you know what I mean?

456
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.100
That's like,
you know,
eat that raw.
That's like going raw with a porn star.

457
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.620
You have no idea how many people you just fucked.

458
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.780
So I took the meat out of the fridge,
got it at room temperature,

459
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.840
and then I did six minutes on both sides and uh,

460
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.480
got nothing but compliments.
So there,

461
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.310
there's a little tip for you and this little tip that I learned from a pro chef

462
00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.550
is you got to get up to you.
Got,
you got to hit a fucking breakfast ball.

463
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.000
All right?
You got to make one for yourself.

464
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.350
You make the mistake on your own.
All right.

465
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.380
If I just took all that meat out and just throw it on there,

466
00:28:20.381 --> 00:28:23.950
everybody would have had bubble gum in the middle of fucking raw meat in the

467
00:28:23.951 --> 00:28:24.910
middle of their burgers.

468
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.320
They'd have to take the fucking buns off and all of that messy shit and I'd have

469
00:28:29.321 --> 00:28:34.210
to put it back on and everybody would be looking at me like my balls just rolled

470
00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:35.560
off the fucking porch.

471
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.020
What kind of a man does it?
Not a cook over an open flame,

472
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.633
<v 2>Huh?</v>

473
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.740
<v 0>That's what they would be saying.
But nope.
Didn't say that about me</v>

474
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.540
because in private when no one was around,

475
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.800
I failed miserably.
Okay.

476
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.130
And that's one to growing for the love of God.
Is that 30 minutes,

477
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.780
29 minutes.
One minute to go.
People.
What have we learned here?

478
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.840
We've learned that bill can do a southern accent.

479
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.940
We've learned that anytime anybody's dumb bill does a southern accent,

480
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.070
we've learned that bill has watched dirty dancing and ghost.

481
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.040
And uh,

482
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:27.070
I think I did an advertisement for eating pigs and putting them on a flat top

483
00:29:27.231 --> 00:29:31.130
grill.
I don't know what else you fucking need out of this.

484
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.390
At some point this will be uploaded.

485
00:29:35.391 --> 00:29:37.880
And the next thing you're going to listen to his,
uh,

486
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.910
audio of me on my cell phone,
probably reading

487
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.080
that should have already been read at this point.

488
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:47.410
When I wrapped it up on Saturday,

489
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.070
this Saturday I'll be at the Toronto Film Festival for the Premiere of the front

490
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:58.720
runner star and Hugh Jackman who's already getting Oscar buzz.

491
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.480
Uh,
it's going to be very exciting to be a,
to be that close man,

492
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.320
to be that close to the biggest trophy out here in Hollywood.

493
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:12.370
And I ain't talking about your third wife.
There's a southern accent again.

494
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.560
Um,
yeah,
it's going to be,
it's going to be cool.

495
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.620
I am so fucking site and feel so lucky that I got to be in that movie.

496
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.740
Everybody knows seeing the trailer,
except everybody who listens to this,

497
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:28.060
who will now write negative shit,
hip,

498
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:31.870
all have positive things to say about it.

499
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.530
And I'm like I said,
don't blink.

500
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.930
If you blink,
you're gonna miss me,

501
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:42.850
but you will not and I guarantee you will not miss my mustache.

502
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.560
All right,
that's it.
Have a great weekend.
You cunts.
Enjoy the reads.

503
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.860
A little bit of music and then I'm going to give you another 30 minutes for free

504
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.580
of a greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

505
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:59.050
Monday morning podcast from a month,
uh,
for our Thursday earlier this year,

506
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.470
years ago.
I have no idea.
I forget how the system works.

507
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.110
Don't talk to me about it.
All right,
that's it.
I'll see y'all later.
All right,

508
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:12.370
time for the advertising.
Speak of the devil.
It's butcher box.

509
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.710
Butcher your box delivers healthy.

510
00:31:14.711 --> 00:31:18.850
100% grass fed and grass finished beef free range,

511
00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:21.670
organic chicken and heritage bread,
pork.

512
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.760
The incredible quality of butcher box meets,

513
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:29.500
starts with the commitment to raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics

514
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.870
and hormones before they're slaughtered.

515
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.350
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

516
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.260
which is enough for 24 individual sized meals.

517
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.080
Unless you're a fat bastard or a competitive eater,

518
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.060
you can choose from five different box types.
All beef,
beef and chicken,

519
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:47.830

Oh,

H,
I m s is a problem.

529
00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.360
66% of their men lose their hair by age 35 Jesus,

530
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:37.450
I got past 35 without that then it was all downhill.

531
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.550
Thing is when you start to notice hair loss.
It's too late.

532
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.760
It's easy to keep the hair you have them to replace the hair you've lost.

533
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:49.040
Is that a hairline slew really starting to move backward?
Any bald spots yet?

534
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.510
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

535
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.340
Why did guys turned a weird solutions or do nothing when they can turn to

536
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:00.770
medicine and science?
I feel like they're insulting me here.

548
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.810

All right,

What'd you,

552
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:03.380
if they took me under their wing and they got me all my fucking hair back,

553
00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:08.330
how weird would that be?

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:33.430
I called in a sports gambling podcast and I gave my picks for tonight's game and

578
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.500
a few others over the weekend.
And then we got some throwback clips.

579
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.400
Enjoy the music.

580
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.520
<v 4>Thank you guys for listening and have a wonderful weekend.
Your sons of bitches,</v>

Agee joining us on the line,
Bill Burr.
Bill,

586
00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:18.220
how excited are you that football is officially back?

587
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.370
<v 6>Oh,
this is the greatest time of year.
It's Jagan.</v>

588
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.320
An La is starting to get colder at night.
I love it.
I'm actually,
I,

589
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.050
you know,

590
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:31.320
I know there's all these new rules and they could barely hit each other.

591
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.100
Oh my God,
I don't care.
I don't even care if it's flag football.
It's football.

592
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.023
I'm sorry.

593
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:41.510
Is this the best football into Halloween and the Thanksgiving and Christmas.

594
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:43.170
I love it.
My favorite time of year,

595
00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:47.260
<v 4>honestly,
Sean,
it's the feeling I get when I uh,
when I give myself a little,
uh,</v>

596
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.150
abstinence from the old medication and then I get to indulge again and,
and that,

597
00:36:52.151 --> 00:36:55.900
that first like sinking into the couch.
That's football for me.
I'm,
I'm stoked.

598
00:36:55.901 --> 00:36:58.990
It's back.
Yeah.
Comfort food baby.
It is so great.

599
00:36:58.991 --> 00:37:02.530
I feel like they scared us a little bit in the a week two and week three of the

600
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:05.500
pre season.
They were just flagging everything.
Any,
any uh,

601
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:08.740
guy lowers his helmet even though he's got his head up trying to hit him right

602
00:37:08.741 --> 00:37:09.574
in the chest.

603
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.800
They're throwing a flag and then all of a sudden week for the preseason,

604
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.770
all those flags dried up.
I have a feeling when it comes.
Yeah.

605
00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.990
Thursday night we'll see.
Very few of those penalties actually called the,

606
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:25.870
because the refs are just as big a fan of football as us and they know it'll

607
00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:29.030
just kill the game if they do it all the time.
I think they set up,

608
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.370
<v 6>don't,
the reps aren't making that call.
It's the top talent to do it.</v>

609
00:37:33.371 --> 00:37:37.910
This is the deal.
At some point,
if the game's going to get tenure,

610
00:37:37.911 --> 00:37:39.970
you're just going to have to sign a release.

611
00:37:39.971 --> 00:37:42.550
So if you want to play this at a professional level,

612
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.670
these are the risks and they're going to make you like,

613
00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:48.310
they're probably drawing up that contract right now.

614
00:37:48.311 --> 00:37:52.360
You can never come back and sue us.
I mean,
look,
if if,

615
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:57.660
if the state or the federal government can put you in jail for like 30 years and

616
00:37:58.451 --> 00:38:02.470
then realized they screwed up and the only way they let you out as you can't sue

617
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:06.300
them.
I'm sure the NFL can draft something.
Yeah.

618
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.430
See these for these people,
that belt,
they'll come up with something.

619
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:11.050
So I think the game will be okay.

620
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.300
<v 4>Yeah.
The same people who drew up the warnings for cigarettes now,</v>

621
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:18.020
the Philip Morris guys,
they'll meet up with the NFL.
They'll figure it out.
Hey,

622
00:38:18.021 --> 00:38:21.620
you just got to put this warning on the helmet.
You know,
we'll still be good.

623
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.160
Yeah,
come on.
It was great.
It did feel like this,
uh,

624
00:38:25.161 --> 00:38:30.161
this college football weekend leading into the NFL was almost a kind of a warmup

625
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.460
or play baby.
Yeah.

626
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.130
<v 6>Did you watch football?
Because football has been like,</v>

627
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.740
it's just been what it's been all about man for the last few years.

628
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:40.480
Like it's just,
it's so exciting.

629
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.470
And then they finally figured out not to have all those like just a hundred

630
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.270
cupcake games.
You know,

631
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:50.040
like I remember back in the day when you would gamble in like in like,
uh,

632
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:50.861
September,

633
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.840
like Nebraska would be favored by 58 over at Kent State and then they'd cover,

634
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.830
it was like ridiculous.
Um,
but now there was smart enough where they had,

635
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:02.770
they had the Michigan Notre Dame game.
They had Lsu Miami,

636
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:05.140
they're the Florida state game last night.
I missed all of that.

637
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:09.520
I was doing some daddies labor day stuff with the family.
I missed that one.
But,

638
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.710
um,
I I absolutely,

639
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.950
I love college football as much as I love pro so much to my wife's Chagrin my

640
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.670
entire weekend and this weekend I'm actually in Sacramento and then I got to go

641
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:23.910
to the Toronto Film Festival.
Uh,

642
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:29.030
so I'm missing Saturday football and I'm flying home during the one o'clock
game.

643
00:39:29.031 --> 00:39:31.990
So this is going to be a lot of Dvr and going on in my house.

644
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.080
<v 4>Oh that's my favorite thing.
Every season is the really football's back already.</v>

645
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.220
It's only August wasn't it?
Just the draft.

646
00:39:41.221 --> 00:39:45.060
What happens then you've got the combine and then you just go,
hey honey,

647
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.930
one of the real housewives in the off season.
Exactly.

648
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.550
The Bachelor is a full time sport.
Like you know the NFL should be as well.

649
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.270
<v 6>Yeah that ain't that Andy Cohen show.</v>

650
00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:59.300
That's their sports center where they get those women all stirred up again.

651
00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.580
What about on this plate,
which she said you're,

652
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.210
you're barren and you couldn't have children.
They start yelling at each other.

653
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.430
It's like watching her round the horn.

654
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.100
<v 4>Yeah,
it does.</v>

655
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:15.280
It does it in the pacing of a studio show cause they bring up game film.

656
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.460
They're breaking it down.
What do you,
you know,
they have former players,

657
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.440
former bachelor's weighing in turning point.
Madden a telestrator over there.

658
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.270
That's great.

659
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.680
<v 6>That's the only way I could,</v>

660
00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.600
I had to like get like look at my wife's perspective and just be like,

661
00:40:30.601 --> 00:40:32.130
this is just her sports center.

662
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.290
And then I was able to kind of relax and then I really look at a lot of the,

663
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:39.330
you know,
it's a lot of the sports chatter out there.
It's just so ridiculous.

664
00:40:39.331 --> 00:40:42.450
It's like somebody like me who's not even connected to it.
Just be,
I'll tell you,

665
00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:45.960
I'm really concerned about a middle relief,
you know,
talking baseball.
It's like,

666
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.040
oh are you somebody who never played beyond not getting picked in gym class.

667
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.850
<v 4>The we thing is always funny.
Sean's a big fan of doing that with the egg.</v>

668
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.150
But I do enjoy the,
uh,
you know,
we're,
we're going to win it all this year.

669
00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.570
<v 6>It is a way,
it's a way because if you don't win,
you get all this crap.</v>

670
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.680
You guys saw that show you aren't modeled,
Blah.

671
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.450
Then all of a sudden your win and then the other guys like

672
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.430
<v 4>we're easy there,
but you didn't play.
But what do you mean?
Yeah,
when,</v>

673
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.350
when I wake up Monday and the eagles got their ass kicked,
I'm fucking depressed.

674
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:20.280
All right.
I have to live with that.
These guys,
that's just a job for them.

675
00:41:20.281 --> 00:41:22.530
This is my fucking life.
So yeah,
I may dress right

676
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.230
<v 6>and people give you shit saying you guys suck.</v>

677
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.130
You guys show Philly's a bunch of losers and then all of a sudden if you're win

678
00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:35.690
every that that's when you know you want to gain.
When people say,
oh,
we,

679
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:39.020
it's not we,
it's like,
oh,
we must have one.
Something that,
that you resent.

680
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.890
<v 4>Yes,
exactly.
All right,
well,
perfect transition bill.
We uh,</v>

681
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:46.580
we picked up a couple of games here to break down with you.
Of course,

682
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.730
all the spreads coming from our official partner,
my bookie dot.
Aig.

683
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.450
He's that Promo Code Bill bets for 100% deposit bonus.

684
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.120
First game opening game of the season.

685
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:59.540
Atlanta falcons heading into Philadelphia right now.

686
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.390
It's looking like eagles minus two and a half.

687
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.490
I think it opened at like three and a half.

688
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.780
It was up to four when it sounded like,
when says playing now when's is out?

689
00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:12.050
Falls is named the starter.
Which way you lean in on this game.

690
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.433
<v 2>Ah,</v>

691
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.270
<v 6>you got to take the eagles at home.
I know.
I,</v>

692
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.440
you know they're going to be raising the flag.

693
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.000
Every one's going to be going nuts.

694
00:42:22.001 --> 00:42:26.650
Half the crowd will be in that little jail they have.
Um,
I,

695
00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:31.410
ah,
it is,
it's still the eagle.

696
00:42:31.411 --> 00:42:35.640
So those should win this game,
but there's still until they,
when that second one,

697
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.480
this still the eagles,

698
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.820
but I'm going to take the eagles at home considering,
uh,

699
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:46.410
nick falls had a pedestrian 300 yards in the Superbowl

700
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.320
<v 4>compared to Tom Brady's 500 yards and losing,</v>

701
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:54.010
which will never be broken unless Tom less.
Tom Does it again.

702
00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.790
Thank you so much for bringing this up.
Thank you so much.

703
00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.480
I go at it with Patriots fans who say that Brady had a better game,
that false.

704
00:43:01.481 --> 00:43:01.631
Now,

705
00:43:01.631 --> 00:43:06.631
Brady had an amazing game and you can't obviously knock Brady's play at all,

706
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.830
but in that particular game I would say nick foals out play them because of the

707
00:43:11.831 --> 00:43:16.210
couple key plays fulls made and the limiting of the turnovers and Brady

708
00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:17.044
obviously.
Yeah,

709
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:22.050
Sean's defensive of Nick fold is a passion of mine and Brady obviously.

710
00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:25.360
What?
Well No,
and then the fumble,

711
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:29.440
that kind of turned the game at the end.
On the other side,

712
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:31.510
you've got nick foals driving down to get a touchdown.

713
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:33.650
Now I'm not trying to time out too.

714
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:38.930
<v 6>First of all,
Tom Brady's not a running back.
He's like 51 years old.</v>

715
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:43.790
If you don't block and he gets tackled that one fumble duty true for 500 yards.

716
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.710
If you're really going to put it,
it was our defense.
He fix.

717
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.200
What's the problem on both sides of the ball?
Both sides of the ball.

718
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.920
Nick false came out like it was a regular season game.
He wasn't nervous.

719
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:58.580
Tom Brady's Tom Brady.
Balsa offenses play great.

720
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.090
That defenses on both teams sucked.

721
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.810
The only thing was the eagle sucked a little less.
They,

722
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.710
he goes basically the eagles made the only,

723
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.240
I think defensive play the game.
You all I'm saying,
listen,

724
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.360
you started this shit.
I sit there congratulating you.

725
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.570
If you're going to say like,
like that is like,

726
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.830
like some ESPN shit to say like somebody how takes gone.

727
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.550
Somebody throws to a 500 yards and they're the problem.

728
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:31.980
They they I think Carol kind of offs.
Yeah.
Tom didn't have the

729
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 4>magic.
No.
I,
at this point it's my,
it's probably my second favorite sport.</v>

730
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:40.110
Watching Sean talked about how Nicole's had a better game than Tom Brady and to

731
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:42.320
be clear,
Tom Brady had an amazing gape.

732
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.930
The reason the patriots lost was because they couldn't stop anyone on defense.

733
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.170
That's,
that's what I'm not really what you're bringing it full circle for us.

734
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.340
Nick Nicole's is going to suck like he has the rest of his career and the,

735
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.340
<v 6>but also like eagles couldn't stop the patriots either.</v>

736
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.550
They stopped him one fucking to do.
There was like two pumps the whole game.
Yeah.

737
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.473
Yeah.
It was crazy.

738
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.580
There's no talking shit about what your defense did in that game other than we

739
00:45:06.581 --> 00:45:11.500
made one play.
The offense was,
it was the weirdest.

740
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.290
I can't watch it because it's too still too close,

741
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.530
but I have to go back and watch it.
It's the weirdest fucking game.

742
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.460
I mean at this,
that's,

743
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:22.810
that's some shit that happens at like division three high school where it's like

744
00:45:22.811 --> 00:45:27.560
two pumps in a game.
He looked like a big game.
It was really,
uh,

745
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.180
it was,
it was bizarre.
I not start yet.
Um,

746
00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:34.390
and it started off with what's his face is like,
like,
like crying,

747
00:45:34.391 --> 00:45:37.420
like he's had a funeral.
Malcolm Butler.

748
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.860
<v 4>Oh Man.
What did he do?
What did he do?
I guess we'll never find,</v>

749
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.320
<v 6>I should've known.
I should've known when he was,
when they'd better.</v>

750
00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:47.620
Anytime Bella check does that we lose.

751
00:45:47.621 --> 00:45:51.070
So I remember we were playing the jets at home and Wes Welker had made all those

752
00:45:51.071 --> 00:45:54.130
feet joke about Rex Ryan.

753
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.220
We sat him and then Brady threw the worst passivist career on that.

754
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.750
That screen pass or it was just,
it was like he threw it three yard hail.

755
00:46:01.751 --> 00:46:05.800
Mary went up in the air and it's always a pick six.
And uh,
so anyway,

756
00:46:05.801 --> 00:46:06.340
what happened man,

757
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.450
I wish that you guys beat somebody else because I was very happy.

758
00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:13.960
I would have what?
I could have enjoyed watching the eagles.
Finally,
what am I,

759
00:46:13.961 --> 00:46:18.961
because I don't wish long term misery on any sports fan other than a select stu,

760
00:46:19.721 --> 00:46:21.160
you,
Montreal,

761
00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.340
Montreal Canadians fans and Yankee fence to everybody else.

762
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.820
Everybody else.

763
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.910
<v 4>All right.
So Kramer said,
what are you,
uh,
are you,
are you going with,</v>

764
00:46:31.911 --> 00:46:33.470
obviously I'm going to be on the eagles.

765
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.450
The key with foals is if you give him time,
if he,

766
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.110
if he doesn't face a pass for us,
she's going to be okay.

767
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.770
They got Jason Peters coming back and left tackle.
I think that'll be huge.

768
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.330
They get some of their weapons back.

769
00:46:44.331 --> 00:46:46.220
I think they could scheme up a decent game plan.

770
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:50.570
I think their defense will play good,
uh,
against the Falcons here week one.

771
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.930
And uh,
yeah,
they're raising the banners.
I think there'll be jacked for it.

772
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.480
I'm going on the eagles.

773
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.540
<v 6>You got shut down the vikings,
you know everybody,</v>

774
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.640
you guys just completely shut them down in the,

775
00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:04.270
in the NFC championship game if I remember correctly.
So they'll,

776
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.030
the census there,
I just don't,
that was like a twilight zone game.

777
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.640
<v 4>It was bizarre because I every scenario in my head going over the game for the</v>

778
00:47:12.641 --> 00:47:15.870
eagles to when it was going to be a defensive struggle,
you know,
or,

779
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:20.680
or a low scoring game.
I certainly didn't see 13 yeah,

780
00:47:20.681 --> 00:47:21.550
something like that.

781
00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.560
That's what I was thinking and I was shocked to see them pull it out with the,

782
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.690
you know,
74 points or whatever scored.
Yeah,
I mean listen,

783
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:32.140
it's tough go against the the,
I mean the Patriots got run up last year,

784
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:35.910
but typically the team raising the banner,
it's a good bet.
You know,

785
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.820
the contrarian in me also likes the line,
the line move is moving the wrong way.

786
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.490
Nick falls did just win the Superbowl MVP.

787
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.830
So gotta give them the benefit of the doubt.

788
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.230
But what I would say the Falcons could have that pass for a show and you

789
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:51.040
mentioned the pass rush.
That could be the problem.
And just out of principle off,

790
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.370
I'm of course I'm going to fade the eagles fair niggles.
All right.
Next up,

791
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:59.050
big game.
Houston Texans at the New England patriots right now.

792
00:47:59.051 --> 00:48:03.640
Patriots six point favorite.
And uh,
I'll kick things off.

793
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.370
I like to Pat's here,
lane six against his texts and his team.

794
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:11.770
I mean one thing that's been pretty consistent in the Brady Bella check era is

795
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.600
they look good coming off a loss.

796
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.660
And if you look at 2012 when they lost the Superbowl in 2008 they and even back

797
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:22.270
to the parcels and 96,
they came back and uh,

798
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.740
they want 34 13 they want 1710 they won 41 to seven.

799
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:27.610
Like this team,

800
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.550
I think we'll come out with a statement game and really put it on the tech since

801
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.393
that's what I mean,

802
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.080
<v 6>I'm not trying to be a jerk here,
but how does,</v>

803
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.200
how does that have anything to do with this team?

804
00:48:39.201 --> 00:48:42.870
All those and all of the personnel from all of that.
It's like,
you know,
they,

805
00:48:42.871 --> 00:48:46.790
they,
they play really good historically and when it's 70 degrees out,

806
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.300
<v 4>Bella check I guess.
Yeah,
I guess,
I guess to me it's,
I don't spell checks.</v>

807
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:56.570
The guy that just doesn't lose back to back games and I think,
listen,

808
00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.590
little brothers coming off coming off a Superbowl loss.
Yeah.
Bill O'brien,

809
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.640
former guy in the coaching tree.
I think he's going to want to put it on him.

810
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.320
I just,

811
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.680
this patriots team seems like they're ready to make a statement at home against

812
00:49:09.681 --> 00:49:10.514
the Texans team.

813
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.000
<v 6>How do you see it go?
Well,
I think that Texas quarterback,</v>

814
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:19.480
what's his name there to Sean Watson?
He's coming off the ACL.

815
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.310
He's going to be a nightmare.

816
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.980
He's going to be a nightmare for us trying to contain him.

817
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.020
And the only thing I like is like,

818
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.690
I guess they have the worst offensive line in the league.

819
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:33.490
I think that bodes well for us.
Um,
what's the spread?

820
00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.900
<v 4>Six patriots lane six at home.</v>

821
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:40.610
<v 6>Oh,
they always pick the perfect number.
Dot.
Yeah.
They're so good.
You know what?</v>

822
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.380
I'm going to dope.
I'm actually,

823
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.810
I'm actually going to take the Texans with the points because you have the last

824
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:51.140
year we played the Kansas City chiefs and they came in and they killed us.

825
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:54.860
And I'm so I'm gonna play your game and talk about something that happened

826
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:56.570
before.
Probably doesn't matter.

827
00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.870
I think everybody's going to jump on the patch being like,
oh,

828
00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:02.180
they're going to be pissed because they've lost the super bowl.

829
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.040
Everything you just said.
And then the time Julio Jones,

830
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.840
that wasn't really,

831
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.080
you're at a sports bar like me who don't have jobs and make a couple of great

832
00:50:12.081 --> 00:50:14.990
catches in.
Now also,
this is the revenge game.
I'll forget.

833
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.810
They haven't seen us since we,
uh,
came back and this,
you know,

834
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.980
came back historically two years ago in the Superbowl against them.
So,
uh,

835
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.323
I guess going to,

836
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.240
<v 4>sorry,
I think you're bringing the falcons in there for a second right there?</v>

837
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.560
<v 6>No,
we were playing Texas.
Oh,
sorry.</v>

838
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:36.240
<v 4>Oh,
good.
Kramer.
Which way?
Which way you lean in here?
Uh,
I mean,
yeah,</v>

839
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:41.100
it's Bellicheck just whoops.
On his disciples period.
Yeah,

840
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:45.660
not much.
The handicap to Sean Watson would scare me with that defense.
Yeah,

841
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.650
I do.
I am curious to see the offensive line,
but I've just seen,

842
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.610
I feel like we've seen this so many times where a t and optimistic disciple of

843
00:50:53.611 --> 00:50:58.050
bill Bellacheck comes in and just gets,
gets a shit pushed in.
So yeah,
I'm not,

844
00:50:58.051 --> 00:51:00.290
I'm not saying the Patriots week one.
Yeah,
I do.

845
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:03.330
I do think bill is hitting on something.
No,
because I feel like,

846
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:06.330
and maybe this is again just kind of a gut instinct,

847
00:51:06.331 --> 00:51:09.500
but the pats kind of play themselves in September.
They,

848
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:12.990
they use it as an extended preseason,
kind of tried some stuff,

849
00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:14.190
figure out some things.

850
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.820
And I'm still shocked that Patricia got a head coaching job because I don't know

851
00:51:20.071 --> 00:51:24.090
that defense didn't want,
you know,
instill a lot of confidence.
So that's,

852
00:51:24.091 --> 00:51:25.830
that's crazy that he got that Detroit Gig.

853
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:31.710
<v 6>Y'All can't reminds me of when I first moved out to la the first time it'll late</v>

854
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:31.870
nineties.

855
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:36.870
Everybody out here either had a Seinfeld or a friend's credit and that entitled

856
00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:40.510
them to some sort of show runner like,
or Dave,

857
00:51:40.511 --> 00:51:42.670
we get some sort of deal and they would pair them up like,
oh,

858
00:51:42.671 --> 00:51:45.180
this guy wrote on friends,
this guy wrote on Samsung.

859
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.450
I think bill Bellacheck is the Seinfeld of writers' room.

860
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.290
If you did,
if you did anything,
if you were the waterboy yeah,

861
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.840
but he was the water boy bill Bellacheck you don't make a lateral move.

862
00:51:58.841 --> 00:52:01.950
You don't become the waterboy you,
you get elevated in physicians.

863
00:52:01.951 --> 00:52:05.620
So maybe that's why a Patricia's where we,
yes.

864
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.360
<v 4>I mean it's so true,
but it sounds like Patricia is just,</v>

865
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.180
it sounds like people are already penciling them in as a failure.

866
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.670
It sounds like things aren't going well.

867
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.360
There's some weird dynamics going on with that team.
All right.
One of the,
uh,

868
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.850
one of the Monday night games.
There's the dual Monday night game.

869
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:21.950
Do a kick off the season,
which fuck it.

870
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:26.000
Why not the La Rams head up to Oakland right now.

871
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:30.140
The Raiders four point home dog bill.
I'll let you,
uh,

872
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.650
get things cause started here.
How do you,
how do you see this game shaken out?

873
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.740
Do you look?
Do you like the Raiders?
What's your thoughts on John Gruden?

874
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.500
<v 7>MMM,</v>

875
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:45.170
<v 6>I'm hoping that he doesn't regret going back to the 24,</v>

876
00:52:46.231 --> 00:52:46.741
seven,

877
00:52:46.741 --> 00:52:51.420
three 65 life of coaching when I always feel like when coaches get into

878
00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:56.421
broadcasting and there was good at good at it as is groupness they gotta be

879
00:52:56.461 --> 00:53:00.270
sitting there going like this,
just job as a joke compared to what?

880
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:04.770
Compared to what I used to have to do.
But I imagine he missed it.

881
00:53:04.771 --> 00:53:06.720
Obviously they getting the right amount of money.
He came back,

882
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:10.320
I mean Gruden I know he's been gone for a while,
man.
I mean,
well how many years?

883
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.830
Like almost a decade and a half.
He left like early two thousands.
Am I right?

884
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.240
<v 4>Yeah,
I think it's good.
At least 10 years.
I think we looked it up.
It was,</v>

885
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.600
it was before the wildcat.
So to put that in perspective.
Yeah.

886
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.840
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

887
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.840
So that's a long time and each generation of kids is a little bit different and

888
00:53:31.801 --> 00:53:34.260
he's also rebuilding and uh,

889
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:37.690
I saw the thing on the Ram's head coach where he could recall like,
you,

890
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.950
you see that in real sports with Bryant Gumbel.
Like they'd be like,
Hey,
a minute,

891
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.940
42,
week eight,
third quarter,
what happened?
He's like,
Oh yeah,

892
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:48.020
we ran that sweep play.
Uh,
the guard didn't get out,
uh,

893
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:50.310
quite where we wanted him to,
but he got the job done.

894
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.940
He has like a photographic memory.
I think that guy is,
is like,

895
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:58.620
if anybody's going to be the next generation of guys,
it's going to be him.

896
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.960
And um,
where he's,
where he's just taking the ramps so quickly.

897
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.280
I just think,
uh,
because gluten's just starting to put it back together,

898
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:09.720
I would take the ramps.
Okay.

899
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.090
<v 4>Kramer,
first of all.
Yeah,</v>

900
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:17.250
it comes off like somewhere between a serial killer and rain man and that piece,

901
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.420
he's definitely like,
well advanced of grew and,
and,
and just just imagine,
I mean,

902
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:23.480
I have to deal with millennials on a daily basis.
John,

903
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.000
I can not imagine John Gruden dealing with millennials.
I mean,

904
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.820
we know why he came back.
We saw it in hard knocks last year.

905
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:32.790
He still was making a playbook.
He just didn't have anyone to give it to.

906
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:36.720
He loves the racking,
the visors.
He's,
he's cut like half the team.

907
00:54:36.721 --> 00:54:41.630
I think I saw that there's,
there's 31 new players on his 53 man roster.
Um,

908
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:42.960
I saw a great tweet.
The,

909
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:46.590
the Raiders decided to pay a coach $100 million and not pay their best player.

910
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:51.330
90.
Uh,
so many reasons to,
I mean,
this is the ultimate,
like,

911
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:53.910
just take the ugly dog,
right?
This is the ultimate,

912
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:56.730
take the ugly dog on Monday night,
but I,
I can't do it.

913
00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.750
I can't do it in this spot.
So yeah,
I'm going to fake.
I come on,
we,

914
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.930
we think Jay Gruden's a joke.
At least I do.
He made a mistake,

915
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:06.720
he's gonna realize it quickly.
My talks,
I wouldn't,

916
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.320
I wouldn't normally like to take a kind of road favorite here in a divisional

917
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:15.300
spot.
I,
I normally like to take a Monday night home dog.
Great Opportunity here.

918
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:16.081
But man,

919
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:21.030
this Raiders team is in crazy disarray and it just seems like the quarterbacks

920
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.760
pissed off.
He's upset that they traded their best player.

921
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:27.720
It's a weird move to pull this close to the season.
And the Raiders did the what,

922
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:32.610
24th ranked defense with Kaleel Mack.
You trade a all time defensive player.

923
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:35.010
Now maybe this will end up working out for them in the long run.

924
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.080
But I think this rams offense,

925
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:40.500
even though they didn't get a lot of reps in the pre season for whatever reason

926
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.850
McVay maybe,
you know they use the crazy analytics and some sports side,

927
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:48.990
no wig Gruden's using analytics.
He openly challenges analytics,

928
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:53.280
which I Kinda,
I normally like the old school guy approach there but uh,
yeah,

929
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:56.430
<v 6>well I'm lucky.
Yeah,</v>

930
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.510
half the shits and boxes.

931
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.100
<v 4>Look at that.</v>

932
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.150
You look at the ram season that last year in St Louis didn't go well,

933
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.530
moved out to Fisher.
It was just a complete disaster.
We just think of this,

934
00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:14.640
if Joe like John Gruden became a caricature,
much like John Madden,

935
00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:19.290
imagine if John Madden came back to coaching after like 15 years.
No fucking way.

936
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.590
Yeah.
I think burden.
Uh,
it'll be interesting.
I don't know.
I'm not that guy.

937
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:24.424
Can't coach.

938
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.960
I'm just saying he walked into a hell of a situation and he's playing these guys

939
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:33.430
week one who are just going to build on what they,
the past two seasons,

940
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:35.190
how much they've improved.
I just think they're,

941
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.370
I think they're going to keep going.

942
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.350
The rams have a lot of momentum from last year.

943
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.820
Not even catching like an east coast team play in that late kickoff.

944
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.560
You're catching another west coast team.
So it's not like they have no,
it's,

945
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.460
there might be more rare.

946
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.460
I mean there's gonna be a lot of rams fans right now that the bandwagon has

947
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:55.090
gotten nice and roomy.
Yeah,
I think it's,
I think it's just,

948
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.840
I don't see a lot of Ram fans going up to Oakland,
you know all those.
True.

949
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.700
That's also true for a picture show.

950
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.680
That is such a weird tradition.
You guys.

951
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.010
Let's get her costumes on and go to the game.
The foam spike shoulder pads like,

952
00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:11.230
hey,
I got to,
hey,
we're going to go tailgate.

953
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:15.910
Let me stop off at Michael's first to get all my face pain and Styrofoam cones.

954
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:19.570
The glue on the shoulder pads.
I'm a pirate.
Yeah.

955
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:23.280
They used to look like a biker gang.
The crowd somewhere along the line.
Yes.

956
00:57:23.281 --> 00:57:27.830
Starting to look like like a musical,
you know what I mean?
Like,
like,
like,

957
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:32.710
like for kids,
even the scary things looks a little friendly.

958
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.760
It's almost like if kiss just became a cheering section.

959
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.960
<v 6>Yeah.
It's like rocky horror pictures,</v>

960
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.180
whatever the hell that stupid movie is meets like,
uh,

961
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:46.070
like needs like a Disney ride or something.

962
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.560
Like we can only make it so scary because we don't,

963
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.380
this is something about like when you have the dad bod

964
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.990
and foam spikes coming up.
I love that.

965
00:57:56.991 --> 00:57:58.910
They think that they're intimidating.
The other team,

966
00:57:58.911 --> 00:58:03.140
the other team literally has 300 pound guys trying to rip their heads off.

967
00:58:03.141 --> 00:58:06.370
But you're up there dressed like a pirate and you're the one who's going to be

968
00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:09.810
<v 4>throw him off.
Oh,
you're eyepatch man,
you're freaking me out.</v>

969
00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.810
<v 6>There's a lot of that.
The dog found a lot of that silly stuff.
Like,</v>

970
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.010
you know,
your dad goes there on a rubber mask,
eat dog biscuits.
It's like,

971
00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:20.300
come on dad,
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

972
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:24.170
<v 4>Cool.
On Monday.
I have to respect your father.
Come on.
Yeah,</v>

973
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:29.100
you just helped me with my math homework.
You're not crazy.
All right bill,

974
00:58:29.101 --> 00:58:33.810
before we,
uh,
before we let you go here,
what is a,
maybe it's these three games,

975
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:37.410
maybe it's a,
a,
another game you feel really strongly about week one.

976
00:58:37.411 --> 00:58:41.670
Can we get you to throw out a lock?
You know,
we are gambling podcasts,
so what is,

977
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.220
what is bill burrs lead pipe lock for week one,

978
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.260
my lead pipe lock.
All right,

979
00:58:49.261 --> 00:58:52.990
this is my lock and it's not going to be gambling related.
Yes,

980
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.680
<v 6>my lock is going to be whatever happens this week.</v>

981
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.450
Most people in sports are going to talk radio are going to act like,

982
00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:07.860
you know,
like say Oakland gets their asses kicked,

983
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.640
all they're going to be talking about that John Gluten was Jacob was he sitting

984
00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:18.960
on $100 million and he's,
and he's,
he's all in one worst case scenario,

985
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:24.140
one game out of first they're going to act like every goddamn thing that happens

986
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:28.580
this son Thursday,
Sunday and Monday is what's going to happen the whole year.

987
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.410
They do it every fucking year.

988
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.040
When Kansas City came out and checked the Patriots ass,

989
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:38.450
all of a sudden Kansas City was the fucking team of the future and what happened

990
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:42.710
to them?
You know,
the Patriots went back and won the AFC championship,
you know,

991
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:46.790
so I mean,
just don't listen for gamblers.

992
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:51.380
Do not listen to all of the freaking out that they're going to be doing when

993
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:54.380
they feel that it's just,
I don't know,
they always got asked like,

994
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:59.360
the fucking sky is falling or Jesus just came back after every single game.

995
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:00.060
You know what I mean?

996
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.450
<v 4>You look at some of the teams that started to now and then get destroyed,</v>

997
01:00:03.451 --> 01:00:06.780
missed the playoffs.
And that's a great advice,

998
01:00:06.781 --> 01:00:11.220
especially for gamblers because a lot of times you see one week and then

999
01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:15.180
complete crazy overreactions and we always talk about that week too.

1000
01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:18.180
When you're picking your games,
don't overreact to that week one.

1001
01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:21.090
If you had a strong feeling or know whatever you,

1002
01:00:21.091 --> 01:00:24.270
you were really high on the team,
it could just be one bad game.

1003
01:00:24.271 --> 01:00:27.910
Don't totally throw out your shit by low Sean.
Bye.
Hello.

1004
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:33.170
<v 6>Exactly.
Look for the look for that overreaction spread.
If he can jump on that.</v>

1005

1012
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:02.563
Souls.

1013
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.490
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper.

1014
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:24.840
<v 8>It's the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,</v>

1015
01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:28.440
September 6th,

1016
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.280
2010 happy Labor Day to one and all to all the laborers out there.

1017
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.230
All right.
God bless you if you got a job,
God bless you.

1018
01:01:37.231 --> 01:01:41.640
If you're looking for a job and if he just sitting on your ass and you're not

1019
01:01:41.641 --> 01:01:45.430
doing either,
um,
how do you get away with it?
Cause that's what I want to do.

1020
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:50.190
You know?
Isn't that the dream?
That's my dream in life to work.

1021
01:01:50.191 --> 01:01:54.420
If I choose to just fucking lay around all day and just be like,
you know what?

1022
01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:57.270
I am so sick of fucking lay in round.

1023
01:01:57.271 --> 01:02:00.690
I think today I'm going to go down and put some hubcaps down on a fucking Ford

1024
01:02:00.691 --> 01:02:04.180
Fairmont.
You know,
maybe that's what I'll do.

1025
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.150
What do you guys doing for Labor Day?
Huh?
You guys boozed at this point,

1026
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.190
I'm a little bit late with the podcast.

1027
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:14.840
It's four 16 east coast time when I'm recording this.
Hi.

1028
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.860
Have you already gotten drunk?
Had it out with your brother,
you know,

1029
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.130
after three beers she did that,

1030
01:02:20.131 --> 01:02:24.030
that paranoia that your mom loved him better starts creeping in and all of a

1031
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:27.030
sudden you guys get out there for a little fun game of volleyball and all of a

1032
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:31.530
sudden real quickly,
it's not fun is it?
Huh?
You staring at him through that net,

1033
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.420
that fucking transparent fucking screen.
You can see through it,

1034
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.710
but you can't penetrate it.

1035
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.570
Kind of like the fucking ice cold personality of your mom.
You know,

1036
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:44.670
she'd never quite let you in.
So what do you do?

1037
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:49.230
You bury your sorrows and fucking alcohol on Labor Day.

1038
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.730
Happy Labor Day,
happy Labor Day,

1039
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:59.130
getting shit faced,
eating some shit.
Hate in your fucking life.

1040
01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:02.490
The next day at work.
That's a new labor day song.
Everybody,

1041
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.010
it might sound familiar,
but it's a,
it's cause it's so catchy.

1042
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.130
It's not a Christmas song.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

1043
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:12.030
actually I was sitting here wondering,
you know,
bit being,
um,
as it's,

1044
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.990
it's Labor Day.
Labor Day is another one of those days.
Um,

1045
01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:21.120
that I just don't understand the history behind it.
Like,
I don't,

1046
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:25.350
I don't know shit about flag day.
I don't shit about Labor Day.
I don't know.

1047
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:28.620
I don't understand Columbus Day,
you know,

1048
01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:32.070
is that the day that he thought he landed in America?

1049
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:34.890
But he was actually down in the,
in the fucking Caribbean.

1050
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:38.400
Then he started making them dig up diamonds that weren't there.

1051
01:03:38.401 --> 01:03:40.510
So we started cutting their fucking hands off.
Is that,

1052
01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:44.730
is that why we have a day off on Columbus Day?
Huh?

1053
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.370
I understand Memorial Day.
That's for the troops.

1054
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.960
Anybody laid down their life or even served.
I get that one Easter.

1055
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.670
That's when the bunny comes.

1056
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:59.160
Here comes Peter cottontail hopping down the bunny trail.

1057
01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:02.790
Hippity hoppity Easter's on its way.

1058
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.470
That's one of the widest songs ever.

1059
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.620
So I would like to apologize to all the non whites out there for wherever.

1060
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.620
Whatever white guy wrote that song,
bragging all his Easter,
Jill.

1061
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.960
Something like a basket full of me.

1062
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.240
They actually sit there and that song and this something like he's got jelly

1063
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:25.230
beads for Bobby colored eggs.
Four sisters sue.

1064
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:30.870
He's got nothing for Yolanda.
Now.
What's,
what's,

1065
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:33.930
what's a Tayshawn?
There's nothing in there.
No candy for any,
any,

1066
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.210
anything like that,
you know,
do [inaudible] Kim,

1067
01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:39.390
he doesn't get any fucking Easter grass,
does he?

1068
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.280
He doesn't even get the grass at the bottom of the basket and that fucking song,

1069
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.280
you know.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.
So I was wondering what is he,

1070
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.090
what is he history of Labor Day?

1071
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.340
Because I'm a nerd and a so let me,
let me read you guys a little bit of history.

1072
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.790
Labor Day.
How did Labor,
Labor,
Kumu,
Hildy um,

1073
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.310
this has been the history of Labor Day in the United States.

1074
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:06.750
Dates back to September 5th,
1882 in New York City,

1075
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.150
uh,
in accordance with the plans of the central labor union.

1076
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.090
I really feel like a history teacher right now and you guys are all starting to

1077
01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:18.670
zone out and I'm standing up there with dockers with chalk dust on the front of

1078
01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:21.980
them,
but 80,
18,
84,
um,

1079
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:27.060
the first Monday of September was selected as the holiday to celebrate wherever

1080
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.160
day,
trying to have even more annoying,

1081
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.560
fortunate as originally proposed by the union.

1082
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.240
This is all going to be on attached tax next week.

1083
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:38.820
So I hope you guys are all taking notes.

1084
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.900
So it's done just not to wherever you and your nerves,

1085
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.250
similar organizations and other shit is to follow the example of New York to

1086
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:48.550
celebrate a workman's holiday.
Sorry,
I'm back on that date.

1087
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:51.700
So basically it started in New York City and then with the growth of labor

1088
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:56.701
unions and the pressure that they then were able to apply to the ruling class,

1089
01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.420
they then tried to make it a national holiday and they finally did.

1090
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.910
They made it a federal holiday.
This is really interesting why they did it.

1091
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.820
Not because they were like,
yeah,
you know what?

1092
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.270
We got these guys working their asses off all week.

1093
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:18.450
They're in these dank fucking apartments getting tuberculosis as we sit out here

1094
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:23.200
in our fucking manners.
Why not give them one fucking day off?

1095
01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:27.820
This is when they finally did it was following the deaths of numerous,

1096
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:33.030
a number of workers at the hands of the u s military and us marshals during the

1097
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:38.200
Pullman strike.
So basically,
uh,
you know,

1098
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:40.060
they were fighting to get a decent,

1099
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:43.600
decent wage and they brought in the u s military,

1100
01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.490
which is really,
you know,
it's like what the,

1101
01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:50.110
what the fuck's it wants to deal with Lewin,
you know,

1102
01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:54.550
US military supposed to protect us.
I thought that those guys were on our side.

1103
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:58.230
No,
they worked for the rich.
They,

1104
01:06:58.231 --> 01:07:02.860
you go and whether you fuck with the rich in this country overseas or here,

1105
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:07.930
they will send in the military to fuck you up.
And US marshals cops also.

1106
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:13.420
So,
uh,
yeah,
basically because they went so over,

1107
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.710
they cross such a fucking huge line by actually killing workers and that they

1108
01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:21.700
were worried that we were going to storm.
They're fucking mansions.
They said,

1109
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:25.840
all right,
we'll give them one fucking day off.
All right.

1110
01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.700
Goddamn cons.
Right.
And President Grover Cleveland,
he's a guy who moved it in.

1111
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.630
He put it into a action there.
And Grover Cleveland actually,

1112
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:39.160
who just looks like the most boring human being on the planet.

1113
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:41.410
He actually looks like out of nowhere.

1114
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:45.760
He gets catchy with the joke and he would deliver it totally dead pan.

1115
01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:49.000
You just catch that twinkle in his eye of who we used to be before he got

1116
01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:51.760
married and had to listen to some fucking broad,

1117
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.430
tell them how to give his goddamn speeches to the union.

1118
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:59.440
He actually holds the title of the only president to serve two terms,

1119
01:07:59.441 --> 01:08:00.670
but not consecutively.

1120
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:05.590
Hence he is the 22nd and 24th president of the United States.
Did you know that?

1121
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.900
Well,
why don't you break that out at your Labor Day fucking barbecue?
Huh?

1122
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.140
You know,
he looks like he looks like that guy in uh,

1123
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.710
<v 9>was that Ron Howard movie about the old people doing cannon balls in the pool</v>

1124
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:21.570
cocoon.
He looks like that guy also.

1125
01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.580
He did the diabetes commercial something with a w I got no fucking idea.

1126
01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:31.880
So anyways,
yeah,
this is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday.
Uh,

1127
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:38.210
what the fuck?
September 6th.
There we go.
I got so much shit.
I'm trying.

1128
01:08:38.211 --> 01:08:41.960
I give like literally 12 fucking windows open on my laptop right now.

1129
01:08:41.961 --> 01:08:46.660
My laptop is sitting in my lap radiating my nuts.
Yeah.

1130
01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:46.991
How so?

1131
01:08:46.991 --> 01:08:51.490
Someday in the future I can be on 60 minutes talking about how the wind just

1132
01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:53.050
blows right through my clock.

1133
01:08:53.051 --> 01:08:57.250
My crotch getting divided by my Dick because I no longer have balls.

1134
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:00.070
And if you're wondering why,

1135
01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:04.060
why can't my balls take it but my Dick can because my dick is that fucking

1136
01:09:04.061 --> 01:09:08.320
strong.
All right.
The balls are the weak point of my unit.
You know,

1137
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:12.380
it's kind of like a muscle car.
Hey fuck it.
It's great.

1138
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.550
But just in a straight line.

1139
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.930
That's what my Dick is like a speaking of which last week I shot a pilot and I

1140
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:22.931
rented a dodge challenger and I was unbelievably fucking frustrated trying to

1141
01:09:22.971 --> 01:09:25.460
drive that car out here.
I didn't even get the one with the hammer.

1142
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:27.590
I just got one with the six cylinder,

1143
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:32.591
which felt like it had a Hemi after getting out of my fucking Prius and um,

1144
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.900
I've decided I'm not going to get that car.

1145
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.590
I'm just waiting for everybody to Groan.
Oh,
Bell Bell.

1146
01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:42.550
Don't give up on your dream.
I haven't given up on it,
but there's just,

1147
01:09:42.551 --> 01:09:46.370
there's nowhere to drive it out here.
You know,

1148
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:51.700
this is what a fucking dodge challenger sounds like in the middle of Nebraska.

1149
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.090
This is what it sounds like.
An La,

1150
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.200
<v 7>oh blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,</v>

1151
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.043
blah.

1152
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.030
<v 9>Fucking go
that.
That's all I did.
I'll fuck a week.</v>

1153
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:32.940
There was nowhere to go with the fucking thing.
I get on the highway,

1154
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.190
some fucking truck driver in the left lane,

1155
01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.400
cause there's no god damn rules out here.
It's like,

1156
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.230
do you you,
you play the game tetris.
That's,

1157
01:10:47.231 --> 01:10:51.160
that's what driving a car is like out here.
There's no like there's no,

1158
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.270
there's nowhere to go.

1159
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:58.160
There's just always this cascade of shit just coming at you and that there's no

1160
01:10:58.161 --> 01:10:58.941
way to drive the car.

1161
01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:03.130
And I've just decided it's the stupidest fucking thing you could ever do out

1162
01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:04.480
here.
So now I'm thinking,
I don't know,

1163
01:11:04.481 --> 01:11:08.230
maybe I'll get a good old car that just a cruiser,
you know,

1164
01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:11.050
like a Malibu or a Chevelle,
maybe an impala.

1165
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:14.070
Just something I could just of have a little style

1166
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.270
<v 8>as a cab.
My arm out the window drive 25 fucking miles an hour out here.</v>

1167
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:22.050
If anybody lives in La and you actually have a fast car,

1168
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:26.430
can you tell me what you drive it?
You got a fast car.
Remember that?

1169
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:30.620
Remember when Whoopi Goldberg wrote that Song.
We look,
get it fan as well.

1170
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:32.400
Get a car and we'll drive away.

1171
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.940
A lot of people don't remember that would be Goldberg was actually a singer

1172
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:42.000
early in her career and she sang that song a fast car.
Uh,

1173
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.610
actually it wasn't whoopie Goldberg.
It was Tracy Chapman,

1174
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.830
Tracy Chapman who looked a lot like Larry Holmes.

1175
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.823
Um,

1176
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.370
that was really fucking mean.
Oh,
you know,
what do you want from me?

1177
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:04.050
I'm 10 minutes in and I'm feeling like,
uh,
I'm running out of energy.

1178
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.330
You know what it is?
I'm in holiday mode the same way you guys were Friday,

1179
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:14.280
Friday afternoon,
you had your feet up on your plastic fucking desk.
And uh,

1180
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.610
that's how I feel right now.
So actually listen to this,
everybody,

1181
01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:23.220
I've finally figured out a way where I can make a little bit money off of this

1182
01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:23.941
podcast.

1183
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:28.500
It's not going to break the bank and I can take the money and buy this recorder

1184
01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:30.510
that cost about six,
700 bucks.

1185
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:34.770
That would actually allow me to drive around and record podcasts like I did back

1186
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.930
in the day.
Um,
every once in a while.

1187
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:40.050
Do that just to switch it up because I get bored being in my apartment after a

1188
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:43.560
while.
So this is the deal.
Um,
I was trying to,
you know,

1189
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:46.500
come up with something I didn't want to charge for the podcast and I also want

1190
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:47.410
to give people the,
uh,

1191
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:52.380
the option of donating to the podcast.

1192
01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:55.020
So basically this is what we came up with.

1193
01:12:55.021 --> 01:13:00.010
We came up with a ringtone and,
uh,
the ringtone is,
Oh gee,

1194
01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.970
all right,
it's 99 cents.
You go to the MM podcast.com.

1195
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You Click on that page,
you need to look right on the left hand,

1196
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.380
the left hand corner,
the top column.
I might as well go to the,
the uh,

1197
01:13:13.381 --> 01:13:14.670
the podcast right now.

1198
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:20.030
You just click on that and you pay for it through paypal.

1199
01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:24.060
It's 99 cents.
Um,
you can't,
if you have a flip phone,

1200
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:26.760
don't fucking do it because you're not going to be able to upload it to your

1201
01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:30.240
phone.
Uh,
but if you have any one of these smart phones,

1202
01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:34.530
I believe that they're called.
Um,
you can upload it right to your phone.

1203
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:36.660
All it is is 99 cents.

1204
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.040
Now I know all you fucking computer savvy people are out there.
Like,
dude,

1205
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.020
I could just make a fucking,

1206
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:46.200
you know a god damn ringtone.

1207
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:49.950
I know you can I get it.
I know your kid.

1208
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.660
Um,
hang on a second.
What the fuck am I going to,
I know you can do that shit.

1209
01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:58.290
This is just a God damn donation.
That's all it is.
Okay.

1210
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.330
So I know you can make your own fucking ring tone,

1211
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.210
but this is just to donate to the podcast.
All right?

1212
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:06.910
So basically what you do is you go to the Monday morning podcast and uh,

1213
01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:08.610
if you look in the left hand corner,

1214
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:11.980
it says get there and underneath pages you see,
Oh

<v 9>gee,
she's right under the home.
So all you do is you just click on it,</v>

1216
01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.940

1217
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.020
99 cents people for three years of fucking podcast.

1218
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:26.470
How about jumping on board and donating 99 cents?

1219
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:31.150
I'm going to buy better equipment.
All right.
And uh,

1220
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.350
and then basically what you can do is you can assign that ringtone to the

1221
01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:39.220
biggest pain in the ass in your life.
Be it your boss,

1222
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:44.350
your,
your,
your girlfriend,
your boyfriend,
your mom,
your dad,

1223
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:46.570
your fucking landlord.
Anybody,

1224
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.440
whoever's the biggest fucking cunt in your life.

1225
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.760
This will give you a warning because it won't just Rick.
Okay?

1226
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:58.510
It'll be sitting there on the coffee table and all of a sudden you see,
oh Jeez,

1227
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.040
oh Jeez.
Oh Jeez.
And then he can laugh and be like,

1228
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:06.310
I am not answering that shit.
And he can go back to drinking.

1229
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:10.570
So that's set people.
There you go.
And this is deal.
If you don't want to get it,

1230
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:13.780
don't fucking get it,
you know,
but you want to get it.
Go ahead and get it.

1231
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.080
Typical thanks to the podcast is basically technically free.

1232
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:21.850
I'm just asking for a donation.
99 fucking sense.

1233
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.490
Can you look,
look into your heart.

1234
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.210
You guys ever see that Miller's crossing?

1235
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:31.090
It's one of my favorite fucking monologues of all time.

1236
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.700
I watched that again the other night.
Ah,
yeah.
If you want to do it,

1237
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:37.030
go ahead and do it.
If not,
I get it.
It's a tough economy.

1238
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:42.160
99 fucking sense.
Don't be a con.
Go on there.
Download it.

1239
01:15:42.161 --> 01:15:44.620
Put it on your phone.
That'll put a smile on your face.

1240
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:46.570
Just like the podcast does every Monday.

1241
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.450
Now I'm getting you for the whole fucking week.
And there's another thing too.

1242
01:15:49.451 --> 01:15:54.130
If you guys have anything else you'd like me to do.
Any other uh,

1243
01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:57.520
ringtones,
if you'd like me to do the girl voice.
Hey Guy.

1244
01:15:57.521 --> 01:16:00.460
What is this relationship going?
Anything like that,
you know,
for your girlfriend,

1245
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.830
from we have a dump voice for your boyfriend.
Any of that shit,

1246
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:07.120
we can actually make a couple of more ringtones.
Um,
you know,

1247
01:16:07.121 --> 01:16:10.420
and this is just something every once in a while just like,
uh,
uh,

1248
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.190
what are those where the PBS station,
you know,
every six months they're like,

1249
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.990
oh my God,
we're going broke,
you know,
by these fucking Doo wop cds.
Basically.

1250
01:16:19.991 --> 01:16:22.540
This is what I'll do every six months or three months,
whatever.

1251
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:26.080
However you guys will determine it.
How popular you like,
I mean,

1252
01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.600
basically 99 cents.
I think I could do it every month,

1253
01:16:28.601 --> 01:16:29.770
every two months or whatever.

1254
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:34.870
Give you guys some custom ringtones here for your phones.
And,

1255
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:39.610
um,
and you know,
and being people,
you're gonna have friends here.
You,

1256
01:16:39.611 --> 01:16:43.400
uh,
you know,
hear your ringtone.
It'd be like,
where did you get that?
Uh,

1257
01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.373
don't tell him,

1258
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:52.000
don't tell him where you got it.
Just be like,
Eh,
it's too long a fucking story.

1259
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.130
That way.
The podcast,
you know,
remains kind of underground the way I like it.

1260
01:16:56.170 --> 01:17:00.700
I'll make it a little bit of cash,
99 cents at a fucking time.
And,
uh,
who knows,

1261
01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:03.850
you know,
we,
we,
there's other talks about coming up with some other,
uh,

1262
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:08.500
merchandise for the podcast every once in awhile,
maybe once a year,

1263
01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:10.010
maybe around holidays.

Um,

1277
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.980
I might design one of those the Monday cause I've,
I've joked about,

1278
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:07.970
I used to joke about that.
Me and Derosa did,
uh,
back on the uninformed show.

1279
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.780
And uh,
we still always joke about shit like that,
but enough about that crap.

1280
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:15.350
Let's get,
let's get to the funny.
All right.
That was the money.

1281
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.440
Now we're back to the funniest fucking rhymed and I'm amazed at that.
Um,

1282
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.470
let's get to some questions here.
Um,
Bill,
I have a question for you.

1283
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:29.330
I know from the podcast that you played the drums and I had a couple of

1284
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:30.141
questions for you.

1285
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:34.880
I'm 22 and have really been itching to pick up the pick up an instrument and it

1286
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:37.220
seems like nowadays everyone plays guitar.

1287
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:42.140
I was wondering when you started playing the drums,
how you got started playing,

1288
01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:46.460
did you take lessons?
I guess I'm trying to find out where to start out.

1289
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.110
Uh,
all right,
great questions.
Um,
I actually didn't start until I was 20.

1290
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.380
Um,
I always loved music,
but um,
my dad,
uh,

1291
01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.260
is an unbelievable musician,
but he had music like forced on them.

1292
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:05.630
So,
uh,
he views,
you know,
he kind of viewed,

1293
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:11.420
I dunno,
giving us instruments the way I view,
you know,
if I ever have kids,

1294
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:16.520
I'm taking them to organized religion,
some sort of church.
I just,
you know,

1295
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.490
just something I had a bad experience with it so I stayed away so he didn't

1296
01:19:19.491 --> 01:19:21.860
really introduce.
So we just sort of gradually found it.

1297
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.550
And I kind of grew up in a jock towns.
Everybody played sports.
So I did that.

1298
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:30.140
So I didn't start till I was 20.
Um,
and I think,

1299
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:33.620
I dunno,
I was watching the fuck made me start.

1300
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:36.500
I know I was watching the iron maiden,

1301
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:41.600
a VHS tape,
um,
whatever the,

1302
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:45.200
I can't remember what the hell it was called.
It was the power slave tour.

1303
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:48.320
And I saw Nico Mcbrain and uh,

1304
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.280
they actually were behind him and I saw all four limbs going and he had those

1305
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:56.600
drums totally surrounding him.
And I just thought it was the coolest fucking,

1306
01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:59.450
what I liked about it because I grew up playing sports.

1307
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:00.800
It looked really physical.

1308
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:04.850
The fact that every limb was involved and uh,

1309
01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.410
you know,
the drummer is always seemed crazy.
They always fucking Badass.

1310
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.480
So that started me wanting to get into it.
And then I discovered led Zeppelin,

1311
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:15.350
I discovered led Zepplin really late.
Okay.
Um,

1312
01:20:15.351 --> 01:20:19.930
I started working in a warehouse 1920,
right around the same time,
I guess 18.

1313
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.640
It took me two years.
And then I finally,

1314
01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:26.810
I got totally into John Bonham and,
um,

1315
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.333
I dunno,

1316
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.960
I remember Bonnie Raitt of all fucking people described okay.

1317
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.100
<v 9>Why people play instruments.</v>

1318
01:20:35.101 --> 01:20:39.030
And it was basically because watching someone play an instrument isn't enough

1319
01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:41.250
for you.
You,
you have to know how to fucking do it.

1320
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:43.170
And obviously someone at her level,

1321
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:43.930
<v 8>yeah.</v>

1322
01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:46.380
<v 9>Takes it to an on,
you know,
actually learns how to write songs.
I'm Marla,</v>

1323
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:47.820
I'm at the total geek level.

1324
01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:49.203
<v 8>MMM.</v>

1325
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:52.500
<v 9>So that,
that's basically why I learned how to play.
And I just,</v>

1326
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:58.250
I started out like every other fucking,
uh,
white rock drummer.

1327
01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.030
We all listened to ACDC.
It's the most basic beat and,

1328
01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:03.920
and in

1329
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.090
<v 8>learn how to play with those things.</v>

1330
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:09.840
And then I moved on to who that was the next guy,
I think.

1331
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:12.600
Then I moved on to Steven Adler,
guns and roses,

1332
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:16.860
and then I went onto John Bonham and that was like the three levels that I kinda

1333
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:18.830
went to.
Then I started,
yes,
I took lessons,

1334
01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:20.090
but you don't even need to take lessons.

1335
01:21:20.091 --> 01:21:23.540
You could literally go onto youtube and um,

1336
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.010
just type in beginner drum lessons.

1337
01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:31.030
I mean you can learn in six months what it took me five years to learn.

1338
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:35.560
And a,
if there's a song you're trying to figure out,
just type,
type in the song,

1339
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.590
kickstart my heart,
um,
drum lesson.
No,
there is no drum lesson.

1340
01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:44.960
Just write drum cover and you can watch somebody play it.
And um,

1341
01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.620
a guy that I loved is something called down Mike's lessons.com.

1342
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.510
<v 9>This guy out of Sacramento who's just,</v>

1343
01:21:52.511 --> 01:21:57.511
he's a fucking beast and he's not afraid of other drummers who are beasts and he

1344
01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:01.550
brings him in.
He actually does live drum lessons.
MMM.

1345
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.450
I actually signed up for him and I forgot my fucking password.

1346
01:22:04.451 --> 01:22:08.280
So I've never been able to,
I haven't been able to watch one in forever.
Um,

1347
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:13.020
but he's got a ton of,
uh,
drummer videos,
every,
everything from beginner,

1348
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:15.750
intermediate,
all that shit.
And right now I'm fucking with something.

1349
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.690
Do you want to see if even if you guys aren't into this drummer shit,

1350
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.320
I know this might be kind of boring until you selfish cunt out there.

1351
01:22:22.321 --> 01:22:26.970
Who I'm not on a topic that you want me to talk about.
Dude,
love to podcast,

1352
01:22:26.971 --> 01:22:30.390
but enough about the drum and shit.
Um,

1353
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.410
check out this Youtube Video Search Sha Gospel Chops.

1354
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.180
Nice drum fill to help you out.
I've actually been a,

1355
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:43.230
<v 8>I can play that.
I just don't,
I don't understand.</v>

1356
01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.400
I think he's playing six to any other drummers out there.
Can help me out.

1357
01:22:47.401 --> 01:22:49.950
Is he playing it like a 32nd note?
I can't remember.

1358
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:54.220
It sounds like he starts at the end of four and ends on the end of one.

1359
01:22:54.221 --> 01:22:57.070
He starts it in a weird place and ends it in a weird place.

1360
01:22:57.071 --> 01:23:01.420
And then it seems like he plays the lick and then he plays the second half,

1361
01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.800
half of the lick over again.
Am I right?

1362
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.070
<v 9>I can't remember.
I actually,
I sat here for like fucking 20 minutes.</v>

1363
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.230
I just kept playing it over and over again.

1364
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:16.270
Like fucking Jack Nicholson in a whatever that movie is,

1365
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:19.030
where he fucking chops.

1366
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:21.460
That guy scat man Crothers with the fucking ax.

1367
01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.050
The hell is that movie called Red Rum.
The shining.

1368
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.550
I just sat there with that look on my face.
Just watching this kid over and over.

1369
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.040
The,
I dunno,
there's so many talented fucking people.
So that's what I would do.

1370
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:35.800
Just go out and get a drum kit.
If you live in an apartment,

1371
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:39.460
I'd get those electronic drum kits,
uh,
go on Ebay.

1372
01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:45.160
Um,
and,
and get an electronic drum kit,
get the v drums,
they're the best,

1373
01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.490
and set them up in your apartment basically,
and then go to,

1374
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:50.140
I'm gonna break the whole fucking thing down to you.

1375
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:54.520
Go to toys r us and get those little,
those,
those little foam,
you know,

1376
01:23:54.521 --> 01:23:57.640
people who are like so paranoid that their kids actually going to fall down at

1377
01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:01.210
some point in discover that gravity exists.
And if you fall down,

1378
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:04.840
it actually hurts for some reason.
They don't want them to learn that lesson.

1379
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.500
They want them to feel like when you fall down on a hardwood floor,

1380
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:11.800
it feels like you're in one of those fucking inflatable castles that they have

1381
01:24:11.801 --> 01:24:14.920
at their little birthday parties.
They got these little foam rubber things,

1382
01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:17.950
they're about a half inch thick and they fit together like jigsaw puzzles.

1383
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.350
And these over-protective psycho fucking parents of today were literally by him

1384
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:26.830
and fill up their entire play room with them.
So every time they fall down,

1385
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.880
you know,

1386
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.420
they bounce right back up and then shit into their diaper without missing a

1387
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:36.100
fucking step.
You get those?
I actually get to levels of them.

1388
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:39.890
And if you have somebody who lives underneath you,
um,

1389
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.420
and you just get them big enough with a whole drum kit fits on it.

1390
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:45.490
So all the vibration goes right into those things.

1391
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.280
And if you want to be a total solid guy,

1392
01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.440
what I used to do in New York was I would,

1393
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.550
I would knock on the door of the neighbor beneath me,
introduce myself,

1394
01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.010
tell them that it played drums.
Um,

1395
01:24:57.011 --> 01:24:59.530
if they just asked him what is your work schedule?

1396
01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:02.470
And most of them worked nine to five.
I say I play two hours a day.

1397
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:07.090
I'll only play between nine hours of nine and five.
Here is my home phone number.

1398
01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:08.590
If you're ever home when I play,

1399
01:25:08.591 --> 01:25:12.940
call me up and I will stop immediately and then you won't have any,

1400
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.770
if you have fucking problems after that,

1401
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.050
you live over the biggest country ever and you need to download that ringtone.

1402
01:25:20.051 --> 01:25:22.570
And every time they go to call you,
you got to have o g,

1403
01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:26.860
G and then don't answer it and continue fucking plank.
All right,
there we go.

1404
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:30.910
I know Jesus Christ.
I'm explaining Labor Day and explaining drum shit.

1405
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:33.160
Any and that goes for any instrument to you guys.

1406
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:36.490
If you guys want to learn how to play any fucking instrument,
basically,
guitar,

1407
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:41.290
Bass,
drums,
any of that shit,
piano,
anything.
Just go out,

1408
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.760
buy a buy a cheap version of the instrument just so you make sure you're going

1409
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:49.300
to stick with it and just go on youtube and start learning how to play songs

1410
01:25:49.301 --> 01:25:51.130
that you like.
And next thing you know,

1411
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:56.010
you'll be the hit at your Christmas party plane journey songs.
Um,

1412
01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.150
this is actually making me want to go play,
go play drums right now.

1413
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.980
Check out those Gospel Chop Drummers,
those guys,

1414
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.770
<v 8>they're fucking unreal like that.
The stuff that they've come up with,</v>

1415
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:11.270
then it's really,
I dunno when you,
it's absolutely brilliant,

1416
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:12.410
but it's also like,

1417
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:16.100
it's kind of simple after a while when you kind of figure out what they're
doing.

1418
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.660
If you could just hear,

1419
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:21.680
what if it's 30 seconds or 16th note triplets and then kind of,

1420
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.640
it's just broken up between the hands and feet and it just sounds like they're

1421
01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:28.490
going 9 million miles an hour,
but it's because they add the bass drum.

1422
01:26:28.491 --> 01:26:33.350
I don't know.
It's fucking genius.
Um,
all right,
enough about that shit.
All right,

1423
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:35.190
let's get to,
somebody wrote me a a,

1424
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:39.590
an email this week and evidently they got a little bit offended by something

1425
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:41.150
that I said,
said,
Bill,

1426
01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:43.970
I've listened to your podcast for three years now religiously.

1427
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:49.940
I've also come to see many of your live shows many times and brought your DVDs

1428
01:26:49.941 --> 01:26:52.880
and your cds.
Okay,
so this person,
as always,

1429
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:57.590
is establishing what a big fan they are and how much they've supported me.

1430
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:58.881
However,

1431
01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:03.080
I was listening to your podcast from the 28th of August and I have to say that I

1432
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:05.750
am completely and utterly disgusted.

1433
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.790
I could not believe that you could say something.
This disgraceful,
this,

1434
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.110
this disgraceful.

1435
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:17.650
The comment said was even Rick flair couldn't do fake kicks better than Robert

1436
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:24.140
Deniro.
Oh,
that's when I was talking about when he was kicking Bob,
Billy batts.

1437
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.830
How dare you criticize the way the nature boy kicked someone.

1438
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.240
How you're really going to call out the greatest wrestler of all time and the

1439
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:35.990
leader of the four horsemen from this day forth forth.

1440
01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:39.170
I will never listen to your podcast or buy a ticket to see,

1441
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.260
see you or by one of your DVDs.
Again,

1442
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.000
I hope ric flair sees you and flare chops you write in that pasty chest of
yours.

1443
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:53.420
I could only imagine how long the mark would be ingrained into your chest.

1444
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.190
And then he gives a ric flair quote.
I'm a limousine riding jet flying kiss,

1445
01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:02.360
stealing wheel the wheel and deal in son of a gun.
Woo.
Thanks.

1446
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:05.000
From a former listener,
of course that guy was just fucking around.

1447
01:28:05.001 --> 01:28:08.540
I had to read that because that was textbook.
Um,

1448
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:13.340
that almost followed exactly along the lines of when somebody is actually truly

1449
01:28:13.341 --> 01:28:14.570
offended and not fucking around.

1450
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:18.800
The only thing that you didn't put in the beginning of it is you need to

1451
01:28:18.801 --> 01:28:21.200
demonstrate what a big sense of humor you have.

1452
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:26.390
And then everyone around you says,
you know
what a big fun.

1453
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:28.490
You know what a great fucking sense of humor you have.

1454
01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:31.790
I've actually had a couple of these.
I had mock people being offended with me.

1455
01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:36.680
I think that this is maybe a new,
uh,
a new segment here on the podcast.

1456
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.090
Here's one out.
Dear Mr. Burn.

1457
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.470
I guess I should state upfront that I'm a huge comedy fan who likes all sorts of

1458
01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:47.360
comedy and nothing ever offends me.
Classic,
classic intro.

1459
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:50.420
You stuck the landing sir.
Um,

1460
01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.130
and he goes,
he goes,
since that's how a whiny bitch complaints start.

1461
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:58.760
Whiny bitch complaint things starts,
isn't it?
People,

1462
01:28:58.761 --> 01:29:02.700
I have to apologize how boring this fucking podcast is and how much I'm

1463
01:29:02.701 --> 01:29:06.470
stuttering.
Okay.
I'm a little fucking burned out.
Last week,
um,

1464
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:09.960
I shot my pilot for comedy central with,
uh,

1465
01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.140
that costars Kevin Hart,
who if you don't know who he is,

1466
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:14.070
you got to check him out.

1467
01:29:14.071 --> 01:29:17.520
He's one of the funniest fucking dudes I've ever met at a,

1468
01:29:17.521 --> 01:29:19.740
after working with him for a week,

1469
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:24.310
just watching him act and all this stuff that he brings,
he is really with,

1470
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:28.890
he's the real deal man.
Just to fucking a,
he's a fucking star man.

1471
01:29:28.890 --> 01:29:32.470
So I'm really psyched to be doing this show and we were working 12 hour days,

1472
01:29:32.471 --> 01:29:35.070
so I'm a little burned out here.
Um,

1473
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.850
I basically want to be sitting in a bar right now,
getting shit faced.

1474
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:44.210
That's what I want to do in celebration of all you guys out there actually have

1475
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:46.710
real jobs as opposed to mine,
which is a fucking joke.

1476
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.190
But last week I actually got to feel what it feels like to work a 12 hour

1477
01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:54.960
workday,
like most of you people.
And um,
as much fun as it is,
you know,

1478
01:29:55.550 --> 01:30:00.420
I'm,
I'm out of shape.
I am not in working shape.
I have to admit

1479
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:05.640
I do whatever the fuck it is I want to do.

1480
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:09.540
My life is ridiculously awesome and I really don't take it for granted.

1481
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.940
You know,
I don't,

1482
01:30:11.941 --> 01:30:15.570
but for some reason I'm still busy every day because you know,

1483
01:30:15.571 --> 01:30:18.510
it's one of those deals when you work for yourself,
you still have to,
uh,

1484
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:23.460
you still have to,
you know,
you're the only one rowing the boat.

1485
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.010
That's the only way to put it.
So you gotta you gotta keep rolling.

1486
01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.730
You got to row a couple of miles every day or else you just fucking sick.
But,
uh,

1487
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.410
the great thing is,
is,
you know,
any day that I do feel like just fucking,
I can,

1488
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:37.110
I decide when I have a fucking day off.

1489
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.910
That's what I like about it rather than when I worked for people and they,

1490
01:30:41.911 --> 01:30:42.721
and they were like,
you know,

1491
01:30:42.721 --> 01:30:45.600
wanted me to get all excited that I had a three day fucking weekend,

1492
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:50.250
which I did back in the day.
But now I get to be like,

1493
01:30:50.251 --> 01:30:50.671
you know what,

1494
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:55.000
I think I'm going to fucking go out this afternoon and go see my check.

1495
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.260
I saw that movie.
You guys see it yet.
You got to go see machete,

1496
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:03.120
machete a machete.
You got to go see that fucking thing.
Uh,

1497
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.200
I absolutely loved it over the top violence and,
um,

1498
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:10.830
they have one of the great over the top violence scenes I've ever fucking seen.

1499
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:15.760
I'm not going to ruin it,
but I give it a thumbs up.
I recommend it.
Um,

1500
01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:17.220
go there to have fun,

1501
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:21.770
to see over the top violence and to go see a great tribute to a B

1502
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.690
slasher slash like fucking action movie to Goddamn great movie.

1503
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:30.330
Um,
anyways,

1504
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:35.550
let's continue here with the mediocre podcast.
Whatever.
It's a day off,
right?

1505
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:37.200
You don't give a shit.
I,
you know,

1506
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:39.330
I bet a lot of you guys wanting to complain about this podcast.

1507
01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:40.950
She just psyched you have the fucking day off.

1508
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:44.100
I'm probably going to get more complaints from people overseas.
You know,

1509
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:48.720
we have to go to work with they're crooked teeth.
Um,

1510
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:52.080
that's my view of a lot of other other countries.
They have fucked up teeth,

1511
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:54.840
they have great healthcare,
but they're teeth are fucked up.
You know,

1512
01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:00.040
we have nationwide healthcare really?
Well,
why don't you go use it,
you know,
at

1513
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.040
<v 9>the very least,
why don't you brush your teeth like fucking twice a day?</v>

1514
01:32:03.041 --> 01:32:05.740
Like a normal person.
You know,

1515
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.040
she's didn't a walking around here looking like Dracula,

1516
01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:13.720
drank too much fucking coffee.
Um,
um,

1517
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.290
so I was listening to the podcast a couple of weeks ago on my,
on my way to work,

1518
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:21.430
laughing away.
It's something astoundingly racist or sexist.
You had said,

1519
01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.020
um,
really?
I'll definitely say something sexist.

1520
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:29.290
I probably said something racial,
but I don't think it was racist.

1521
01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.470
I would've gotten more or less unless I was defending Dr Laura.

1522
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:37.030
My timing could not be any worse this fucking week.

1523
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.160
I want us because if I,
I didn't do standup all last week.

1524
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:43.150
Maybe that's what it is.

1525
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:47.110
It's like going to the gym and been in the gym for a while,
whatever,

1526
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:51.670
you know what I mean?
Pick a great fucking,
let's look at ACDC.

1527
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.130
You know what I mean?
Blow up your video.
Fly on the wall there.

1528
01:32:55.131 --> 01:32:58.810
They had some stinkers out there.
This is my,
uh,

1529
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.770
yeah.
This is my blow up your video podcast.

1530
01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:10.690
What are we 31 minutes.
Jesus Christ.
This is hilarious.
Labor Day.

1531
01:33:10.691 --> 01:33:15.010
Everybody has a fucking day off and here I am staring at the clock like I'm at

1532
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:18.460
work.
Anyways,
Bill,
let me try and see if I,
if I read this slower,

1533
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:20.950
if I can actually make this mildly amusing.

1534
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:26.250
You mentioned you received an email from New Zealand and said you would start,

1535
01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:27.483
uh,

1536
01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:31.600
stating your favorite people from different countries starting with New Zealand,

1537
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:32.463
New Zealand.

1538
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:37.560
Imagine my anticipation is I waited to see what awesome Kiwi you are about to

1539
01:33:38.501 --> 01:33:39.760
give a shout out to.

1540
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.870
I'm a proud Kiwi who has lived out of the country

1541
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.700
for work reasons.
Oh for nearly 10 years.

1542
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:53.290
So every little piece of home means something to me.
And then you say Phil Rudd,

1543
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:58.050
I guess I said Phil Run is the coolest guy from New Zealand.
Um,

1544
01:33:58.210 --> 01:33:59.320
because I knew he lived there,

1545
01:33:59.321 --> 01:34:04.030
so I assumed that he actually was from New Zealand.
So the guy said Phil Rudd.

1546
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.520
Phil Rudd is from Melbourne,
Australia.

1547
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:11.140
While we here from New Zealand would be incredibly happy to have been

1548
01:34:11.141 --> 01:34:14.830
responsible for the creators of some of the greatest rock and roll of all time.

1549
01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.160
I couldn't in good conscious take that away from the city I lived in for the

1550
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:23.050
last nine and a half a year.
Oh,
so you live in Melbourne.
Okay.

1551
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:27.190
Where they are so proud of that band.
They named a street after them.
Seriously.

1552
01:34:27.191 --> 01:34:28.540
ACDC lane.

1553
01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:33.370
It's a dodgy little lane right in the center of the city.
I went to Melbourne.

1554
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:34.630
When the fuck did they do that?

1555
01:34:35.290 --> 01:34:38.710
I would've got a touristy picture in front of that.
I told you guys that shit.

1556
01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:43.480
When I went to Australia,
I bought every,
um,
only available in Australia.

1557
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:47.590
Um,
ACDC album.
They had the original TNT album,

1558
01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:50.860
which was the original high voltage that had dirty deeds on it.

1559
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.690
I bought another one album that was called let there be rock.
Um,

1560
01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:00.590
I'll wait a minute.
They had an album called that there be rock,
right?
Yeah,

1561
01:35:00.591 --> 01:35:00.891
they did.

1562
01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:03.800
But this one had the different album cover and a couple of different tracks on

1563
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:07.010
it.
The Australian version.
Anyways,
let's continue.
Uh,

1564
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:09.530
the real problem I have with the mistake isn't that,
um,
uh,

1565
01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.610
I'd be ashamed to call Phil Rudd a Kiwi.
Look.
First of all,

1566
01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:18.140
I had to look up Kiwi to figure out what the fuck is a kiwi and to Kiwi,

1567
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:23.170
evidently Kiwis are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand.

1568
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:29.530
I don't know what endemic means.
Is that the uh,

1569
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.250
animal version of indigenous or does endemic means some fucking douche bag was

1570
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:37.520
trying to get pussy and brought that bird back to New Zealand?

1571
01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.790
I have no idea.
Anyways,
Kiwi are flightless birds and Demec to New Zealand.
Um,

1572
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:49.790
had around the sides.
There are about the size of a domestic chicken,
um,

1573
01:35:49.890 --> 01:35:50.100
uh,

1574
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:54.950
an organic chicken or one of those Barry bonds roided out ones that Purdue makes

1575
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:57.260
because people love chicken breasts so much.

1576
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:02.570
Did you guys ever see that food inc and they fucking hopped those chicken so

1577
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:07.260
much on,
on steroids that they can't even walk.
They fucking do the ric flair.

1578
01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:12.230
Do the flare flop.
Their fucking chest are so goddamn big.

1579
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:13.580
Like,
like,
uh,

1580
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:17.540
like those fucking roided out guys muscle heads from the 80s who didn't do

1581
01:36:17.541 --> 01:36:22.520
squats.
That's what they look like.
Oh,
I got on my z cavalry cheese,
right?

1582
01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:26.090
And they had the big chest and a little fucking pencil legs and they'd have like

1583
01:36:26.091 --> 01:36:29.150
two bears and they fall face first into the sand.

1584
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:32.300
That's what these birds,
that's what the,
uh,

1585
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:36.380
the ones with the horse tranquilizers in their fucking titties look like.

1586
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:41.960
This one actually looks like the size of a,
uh,
of an organic chicken.

1587
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:44.240
Um,
have you guys done that by the way?

1588
01:36:44.241 --> 01:36:47.250
If you're going into like an organic food store and see what an apple is

1589
01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:52.160
supposed to look like as opposed to the,
the,
uh,
the Sammy Sosa Mark McGuire one,

1590
01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.740
the Roger Clemens one,

1591
01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:57.650
and it's like you get halfway through and you're like full,

1592
01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.620
you have to put it down.
Hey,
you want to split this apple?

1593
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.920
You never said that as a kid,
did you?
Um,
anyways,

1594
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:08.720
there are flightless bird endemic to New Zealand.
And so I was like,
all right,

1595
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:11.150
a kiwi.
Now is that offensive?

1596
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:16.430
Like can like only someone from New Zealand say that they're a kiwi,

1597
01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:20.870
but me not being from New Zealand say that you're a kiwi.
Is that offensive?

1598
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:23.900
Um,
so then I looked that up.
Um,

1599
01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:27.020
it says originates from the Kiwi Bird people live in New Zealand,

1600
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:30.800
the country right next to,
or pretty close to Australia.
Jesus,

1601
01:37:30.801 --> 01:37:34.430
could they dumb it down anymore?
Uh,
it's not an offensive term,

1602
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:39.670
but can be offensive if a nasty word is before or after it.

1603
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:43.640
Well,
Jesus Christ doesn't that,

1604
01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:46.640
that pretty much sums up every God damn word out there.

1605
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.550
You know,
this is my girlfriend.
This is my fucking girlfriend.

1606
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:56.040
All of a sudden have that becomes offensive.
What honey?

1607
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.580
<v 8>I just said you're my girlfriend.
No use.
It's the way you said it.</v>

1608
01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.880
You will all like,
this is my fucking girlfriend.

1609
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:07.230
And you had this look of of just utter,
just resentment.

1610
01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.420
No,
you did.
I just told her to stand.
Werewell went wrong.

1611
01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:13.890
Everything was going great.

1612
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:17.550
And the second that fucking bitch came,

1613
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:21.360
started working where you work,
all of a sudden you're always working late

1614
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:27.720
lady,
will you just shut up?
Sorry,

1615
01:38:27.721 --> 01:38:30.720
I don't even know where the fuck I was going with that.
But yeah,
every basically,

1616
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.920
so basically if

1617
01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:38.980
they're trying to say a kiwi is usually a good bloke and as a big rivalry to

1618
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:44.270
Australia when it comes to sports,
uh,

1619
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.400
you defend a New Zealand Zealander by calling him an Aussie,

1620
01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:50.130
but they don't hate each other that much.

1621
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.540
I'd hope this is what this person wrote and would stick up for each other if it

1622
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:58.710
came to an arc.
If it came to arguments with America,
for example,

1623
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:03.660
do not shag sheep.
I don't know what that means.
Is that,

1624
01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:07.410
is that an offensive term to us?
You calling us sheep?
We sheep.
What?
Cause we uh,

1625
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.540
couldn't stop George Bush.
Is that what you're saying?
The fuck's going on?

1626
01:39:12.541 --> 01:39:16.080
Everybody is against America right now.
Like they never did any dirty shit.

1627
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.510
Go read a history book.
You guys are all fucked.
You know what it is?

1628
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.440
America right now is like what the Patriots were like three years ago when we

1629
01:39:22.441 --> 01:39:25.230
were in the middle or four or five years ago when in the middle of the dynasty

1630
01:39:25.231 --> 01:39:27.480
everybody fucking hated us because we were winning.

1631
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.610
Now I don't get it cause we're not even winning.
We're like fucking broken.

1632
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.090
You guys still hate us,
you know,

1633
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.600
you know at least we got a fucking point of view up here in New Zealand and

1634
01:39:39.601 --> 01:39:43.590
Australia.
You know,
you know what,

1635
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:47.310
you guys are like New Zealand and fucking Australia as far as when it comes to

1636
01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:48.300
world politics.

1637
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:52.920
You like that like non-offensive comedian who just goes up there with a sweater

1638
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.700
and works totally clean.
You know,
never walks.

1639
01:39:56.701 --> 01:40:01.650
Anyone in the crowd has not one fucking offensive goddamn opinion.
You know,

1640
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:05.940
hey,
you know,
it's just,
what's the deal with like lamps?

1641
01:40:05.941 --> 01:40:10.290
What's up with though?
Why do I always say lamps?
We try to pick something.

1642
01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:13.470
Let me try to update that.
Coffee tables.

1643
01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.140
What's the deal with Labor Day?

1644
01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.860
Nobody goes to work.
Um,

1645
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.400
that's what you guys are like just observational.

1646
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.240
It's weird because you go down to Australia and they're fucking angry.

1647
01:40:27.241 --> 01:40:31.620
Sons of bitches,
they really are.
Don't head bunch of teeth.

1648
01:40:31.621 --> 01:40:35.950
You fucking cunt.
I never heard that until I went to Melbourne,
Australia.
Um,

1649
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:40.410
but whatever,
continue the trashing of America.
I actually know something.

1650
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:43.250
I watched the youtube clip and a,

1651
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:48.270
there was a comedian evidently who was from America and he was on a game show

1652
01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.280
and uh,
you know,
one of those English game that's kind,

1653
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:58.990
Kinda more clever than funny.
And uh,
there's,

1654
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:00.910
there's other comedians on there.

1655
01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:03.910
One of them I guess was English and at some point he,

1656
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.710
he fucking trashes America.
The whole crowd goes fucking nuts.

1657
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:13.450
And then the guy looks at the American comedian and just goes like,
you know,

1658
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:18.550
it must be hard for,
you know,
everybody just talking about what Shite America is.

1659
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:20.200
And uh,

1660
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.290
the fucking dude just sat there and took it and I just wished I could have

1661
01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:28.291
fucking walked over like Whoopi Goldberg second time making that reference.

1662
01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.770
Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost and just fucking,
you know,

1663
01:41:32.771 --> 01:41:33.940
I don't know Patrick Swayze,

1664
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:37.310
when he sat down on Whoopi Goldberg and just inhabited a black,

1665
01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:40.720
I wish I could've done then at that point and just been like,

1666
01:41:40.721 --> 01:41:45.721
wait a fuck does England get off trashing anybody's foreign fucking policy?

1667
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:47.201
You know,

1668
01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:51.220
why don't you guys go home collectively as a country and brush your teeth?

1669
01:41:51.221 --> 01:41:55.690
Why don't you fucking start with that?
So fucking annoying.

1670
01:41:57.610 --> 01:42:01.030
All the,
you know,
it'd be,
if it comes from a fucking country that never did shit,

1671
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.040
then I don't have a problem with it.
And I get it and I even still get it,

1672
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.670
but it's just,
you know,
it's one of those things,
it's like,

1673
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.190
only I can kick the shit out of my little brother.
You can't,

1674
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:16.720
I guess it's like that Kiwi thing,
you know?
So whenever that comic was,

1675
01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:20.290
who said that stuff going for the cheap fucking laugh.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1676
01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.270
All right,
you fucking hack.

1677
01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:26.380
I hope the rest of your teeth fall out and you spend the rest of your career

1678
01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:29.620
working at Goddamn game show.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,

1679
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:31.650
so there's that happy part of the podcast.
Uh,

1680
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:33.310
we've learned some things this week,
haven't we?

1681
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.380
Grover Cleveland is the only president.
Do what?
Serve two terms.

1682
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:39.820
Nonconsecutive Lee,

1683
01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:45.240
he's the 22nd and 24th President Labor Day started in what city?

1684
01:42:45.851 --> 01:42:50.560
Everybody.
New York City.
And it became a national holiday when,

1685
01:42:50.561 --> 01:42:51.370
what?

1686
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:56.370
When the United States military shut up some fucking guys who wanted to get a

1687
01:42:56.891 --> 01:43:00.370
eight bucks an hour over at ups,
unloading trucks

1688
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:07.330
and Kiwi Kiwi's of flightless bird.
That is a

1689
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:13.660
egg nematic and ego maniac of fucking Louisiana with I,
you know,
whatever.

1690
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:17.620
Two out of three,
two out of fucking three.
There we go.

1691
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:20.350
Um,
so right now actually,
you know what,
you know,

1692
01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.890
my screensaver is if I can just let you guys way too far into my life.

1693
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.970
And it used to be,
there's this picture of Paul Newman and uh,

1694
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.710
Jackie Gleason from the movie,
the Hustler and a now I actually,

1695
01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:37.150
I got a 65 Oldsmobile cutlass convertible white,

1696
01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:41.560
black top black interior with the factory fucking hubcaps.

1697
01:43:41.561 --> 01:43:45.400
Looks like a little old lady drove it.
And um,
I would put some rims on it.

1698
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:48.340
But like that's the kind of thing that I'm thinking about getting out here.

1699
01:43:48.341 --> 01:43:53.341
Now after my experience with just having a v six dodge challenger in la trying

1700
01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:59.410
to drive it.
Oh,
pull,

1701
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:02.670
pull,
pull,
pull,
pull,
pull,
pull,
pull,
pull.
That's it.
You know,

1702
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:04.020
why does anybody out there,

1703
01:44:04.021 --> 01:44:08.380
somebody from Oregon told me that they actually bought the dodge challenger with

1704
01:44:08.381 --> 01:44:12.250
the stick shift in the Hemi,
the one that I want.
And they actually,

1705
01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.620
can you please send me video of what I,

1706
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:18.400
the dream I could be living if I was up in Portland,
Oregon.

1707
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.220
Um,
I would just,
and I can,
I live vicariously through that.

1708
01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:24.970
Cause other than that I actually get,
why am I,

1709
01:44:24.971 --> 01:44:29.300
I really think back to all those gangster rap videos and all those low rider

1710
01:44:29.301 --> 01:44:33.300
videos,
the Latinos and black dudes out here.
MMM.

1711
01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:38.520
There was a lot of Chevelles.
Yes.
A lot of impalas.
You know,

1712
01:44:38.610 --> 01:44:42.420
a lot of those kinds of just cruising around kind of cars and,
and you know what?

1713
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:46.110
Now that I live out here,
I get it.
I totally fucking get it.

1714
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:51.170
Having a muscle car out here,
it's fucking stupid.
So frustrating.

1715
01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:54.310
But uh,
it's not going to prevent me from getting a,
uh,

1716
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:59.400
from getting an old car.
I gotta do it,
man.
I fucking love those things.
All right,

1717
01:44:59.401 --> 01:45:02.100
close tabs.
Let's move on to the next thing.
Let's get onto the,
uh,

1718
01:45:02.101 --> 01:45:06.820
youtube videos for the week,
everybody.
MMM.
Okay.

1719
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.811
Let's see here.

1720
01:45:07.811 --> 01:45:11.110
Youtube actually had the urge to fucking crack open of labor day beer.

1721
01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.780
Why don't I do that and fucking drink with you guys.

1722
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:16.570
I'm going to hit pause right here and we're going to ride it out.

1723
01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.900
Ride it out here.
Hang on.
Wait,
hang on.
One second.
Hitting pause.

1724
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.490
All right,
and I'm back.

1725
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:29.360
Magic of hitting pause on back drinking a bud light.
It's a pussy beer.

1726
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:31.970
How do you know how the bud light's ended up in there?

1727
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:36.510
Nia had some people over and came home,
you know,
the usual,

1728
01:45:36.511 --> 01:45:38.550
some brought 12 pack over and no one was drinking.

1729
01:45:38.551 --> 01:45:42.530
So I had this mechanic killing these all week and I got to MIT for a light beer.

1730
01:45:42.531 --> 01:45:46.270
It's very tasty.
I a underrated bud light.

1731
01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:49.210
I think it's very underrated.
Lot of light beers.
I'm not,
I'm not a fan of,

1732
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:53.350
you know,
I don't do that shit.
You know,
if I'm going to get ice cream,

1733
01:45:53.351 --> 01:45:57.130
I don't get low fat ice cream.
I don't get yogurt.
I fuck,
I'm getting ice cream.

1734
01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.060
You know,
I'll get on the treadmill.
I don't give a fuck.
Hey,
speaking of which,

1735
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.880
how's a,
how you doing out there?
Uh,
what did they say?

1736
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.170
A fucking pasty hips sachet and across the White House.

1737
01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:13.850
You still on your fucking treadmill.
You've got to do it up.
Don't quit.

1738
01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.010
Don't fucking quit.
Um,
you know,
what's funny man,

1739
01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:20.320
I really realized like a,

1740
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:24.720
you guys suffer from depression or at least negative thought the way I do.

1741
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.530
Um,

1742
01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:30.530
I've really found out that my diet and working out can really keep me out of

1743
01:46:30.681 --> 01:46:35.270
those funks like,
um,
this whole week when I was shooting the pilot,
you know,

1744
01:46:35.271 --> 01:46:38.230
rather than letting you know,
thoughts of doubt creep in.

1745
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:42.380
Like I've really figured out how my brain works.
Like when it,
when you know,

1746
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:45.270
like just the way I'm wired because of my childhood,

1747
01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:48.870
I will walk up to a set and rather than be like,
wow,
this is what you worked,

1748
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.040
you're on the

1749
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.440
<v 9>set of a,</v>

1750
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:55.680
of a TV show that actually,
you know,

1751
01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:59.910
you're going to be one of the stars of isn't this great.
My first thought,

1752
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:02.120
the first thing my brain says is,

1753
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:07.260
what if you fuck up and they fire you and everybody finds out about it and

1754
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:11.760
everybody laughs at you and then you never get work again and you have to move

1755
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.790
back in with your parents.
That's the first thought that my brain says.

1756
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:16.260
So I am conscious of it.

1757
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.260
I let it happen and I just think like really,
Bill,

1758
01:47:20.261 --> 01:47:24.000
do you want to spoon with that fucking thought in your head as you go in and try

1759
01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:27.090
and do these scenes or do you want to think something else?
Send A,

1760
01:47:27.091 --> 01:47:31.950
one of the big things that has helped me asides from being aware of negative

1761
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:36.150
thought and just making the choice to not fucking,
you know,

1762
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:41.570
jump on that slide down to depression is how I eat and I go over to the craft

1763
01:47:42.931 --> 01:47:47.910
service and I got a bowl of oatmeal with raisins to total healthy breakfast.

1764
01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:51.960
Totally skipped a big fucking breakfast burritos and all that.
I'm telling you,

1765
01:47:51.961 --> 01:47:55.740
man,
you have an order set shit.
When you're in a depressed depression,

1766
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:59.280
all of a sudden you're at Mcdonald's and you just go eat a double fucking

1767
01:47:59.281 --> 01:48:03.870
cheeseburger and it sends you a salt through the roof.
You're like,
hi,
like yeah,

1768
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.161
this is great.

1769
01:48:05.161 --> 01:48:09.660
And then then you just crash and then you feel even fucking worse.

1770
01:48:09.661 --> 01:48:13.230
I'm telling you,
go to what God damn juice store,

1771
01:48:13.231 --> 01:48:16.770
drink a juice and go on a hike or go get on a fucking treadmill.

1772
01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:20.520
And just actually eat a healthy meal and it'll,
I'm telling you,

1773
01:48:20.970 --> 01:48:23.570
at least it works for me.
I don't think we've ever,

1774
01:48:23.610 --> 01:48:27.990
we've never really talk about depression,
you know,
that curl up in a ball.

1775
01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:30.840
I didn't want to move,
um,
type of shit,

1776
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.090
so I don't even know I got on that Goddamn topic.
But,
um,
anyways,

1777
01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:39.390
I've lived a very happy life for the last three,
four years.
You wouldn't know it,

1778
01:48:39.391 --> 01:48:42.930
listened to the podcast,
but I obviously ramp up shit.
But,
um,

1779
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.500
just by figuring out how my brain works and then making the decision to not,

1780
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.600
um,
I dunno,

1781
01:48:51.630 --> 01:48:55.950
just not hang out with negative thought and not hang around people either.

1782
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:59.220
Who think like that,
you know,
sell.
There you go.
There's my little,

1783
01:48:59.221 --> 01:49:01.230
for now I'm feeling like a fucking fucking fag.

1784
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:04.230
We'll be here like I'm giving you actually good advice here.

1785
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:08.760
I usually give you more ronic advice.
Um,
all right,
let's get on with the,
uh,

1786
01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.190
soil underrated,
overweight rated for the week.

1787
01:49:11.191 --> 01:49:13.230
I actually didn't have time because I was shooting that thing,

1788
01:49:13.231 --> 01:49:16.710
so I'll give you a couple.
A underrated,
a bud lite beer.

1789
01:49:17.370 --> 01:49:19.560
Uh,
underrated,
uh,

1790
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:24.270
getting to do was show tape a pilot for comedy central with one of your great

1791
01:49:24.271 --> 01:49:27.500
friends in the business.
It,
uh,

1792
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:31.140
overrated driving a muscle car in Los Angeles.

1793
01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:35.770
There you go.
That's the underrated overrated for the week.
And uh,

1794
01:49:35.771 --> 01:49:39.660
here's some youtube videos for the week.
Um,
and here also,
by the way,

1795
01:49:39.661 --> 01:49:43.170
you guys and I really stress somebody out there,
one of my listeners,

1796
01:49:43.171 --> 01:49:48.171
please try and come up with an idea where you can make a fuck load of money here

1797
01:49:49.871 --> 01:49:54.520
because this guy is making a zillion dollars with this youtube video.
Um,

1798
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:58.360
it's called the I renew bracelet.
It's,

1799
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:01.000
I like Ipod,
renew all one word,

1800
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.240
no dash capital I renew bracelet.

1801
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:08.290
All these are on the [inaudible] podcast.com by the way.

1802
01:50:08.291 --> 01:50:10.540
So you can just watch all these if you don't want to write these things down.

1803
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:13.410
I the I renew bracelet,
uh,

1804
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:16.480
and it's and get more energy with IRA knew.

1805
01:50:16.481 --> 01:50:21.481
And it's basically you just have to watch what this product is in the

1806
01:50:22.901 --> 01:50:27.901
unbelievable bullshit video that they put with it and just know that somebody is

1807
01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:31.270
a fucking millionaire because of this idea.
All right,

1808
01:50:31.271 --> 01:50:34.120
you guys want to get out of your cubicles?
All right,

1809
01:50:34.121 --> 01:50:37.600
why don't we take the podcast in the next level rather than me making you laugh

1810
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:42.400
in your fucking cubicle when I try and help you get out of it.
I'm telling you,

1811
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.420
just come up with some stupid bullshit idea.

1812
01:50:47.050 --> 01:50:50.680
For 1995 I saw one today,

1813
01:50:50.681 --> 01:50:54.250
I was actually walking down the street and I saw this old,

1814
01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:58.960
a Ford Ranger two wheel drive pickup.
That was my first car.
So I was like,
Oh wow,

1815
01:50:58.961 --> 01:51:00.970
look at that.
And it had the cleats on the side.

1816
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.120
And the thing is when you have cleats on the side of your,
your your pickup bed,

1817
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:06.490
the worst thing about them is like when you walk by,

1818
01:51:06.491 --> 01:51:09.950
they snag your clothes or even the worst,
they scrape your fucking skin off.
Well,

1819
01:51:09.951 --> 01:51:13.240
somebody came up with retractable ones.
You know,

1820
01:51:13.330 --> 01:51:16.510
I must have scraped my fucking arm a zillion time on the cleats I had on the

1821
01:51:16.511 --> 01:51:21.370
side of my truck.
And it never dawned on me how to fix that,
you know,
I mean,

1822
01:51:21.371 --> 01:51:23.110
maybe that'll help you out.
I have no idea.

1823
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.220
I'd wish we'd love to see one of you guys become a fucking millionaire and,
uh,

1824
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:33.160
you know,
and get out of the Goddamn cubicle life.
Um,
next,
next one.
Um,

1825
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:37.410
and this actually goes along the lines of the kid learning how to play drums
and,

1826
01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:40.690
or just learning how to play an instrument or just in general.
If you like music,

1827
01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:44.590
look up the dead weather to Jack White Blend Brant,

1828
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:49.360
Jack White Band.
Fuck.
Can't talk this week.

1829
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:54.430
Check white band.
Uh,
look up the dead weather Letterman,

1830
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:56.830
their performance on Letterman.
It's just,
it's,

1831
01:51:57.490 --> 01:52:01.600
it's everything that fucking music should be because the second I saw it,

1832
01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:06.100
I got the fucking chills and I was like,
I want to be Jack White.

1833
01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:09.010
And that's when you know you're watching a real rock star.

1834
01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:13.450
You get the chills and you want to be that fucking guy.
And after you watch it,

1835
01:52:13.451 --> 01:52:17.290
you watch it again and then you watch it again and then you download it and then

1836
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:22.291
you put it on your iPod and then you go on a fucking hike and you're listening

1837
01:52:22.301 --> 01:52:25.330
to it and you're fantasizing that you were actually Jack White.

1838
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:28.510
And that I actually took the fantasy to that level,

1839
01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:33.280
like I killed doing standup and then let them and said,
great job.
Hey,

1840
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:37.510
I heard you also have a band.
And then I went out.
Oh yeah,
I just mess around.

1841
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:40.000
You know,
like that's the level,

1842
01:52:40.001 --> 01:52:45.001
that's how good that fucking song is that I took the delusional fantasy to that

1843
01:52:45.901 --> 01:52:47.100
level.
Do you guys ever have any of those,

1844
01:52:47.101 --> 01:52:50.610
those delusional fantasies when you see something so cool that you then walk

1845
01:52:50.611 --> 01:52:54.090
around talking to yourself,
inserting yourself into that situation?

1846
01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:57.390
Or Am I just completely out of my mind?
Huh?
All right.

1847
01:52:57.391 --> 01:53:00.600
Let me take another Swig of my Labor Day beer here.

1848
01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.390
Um,
all right.
Oh,
this is,
this is,
this is a great youtube video here.
Uh,

1849
01:53:07.590 --> 01:53:11.580
it's funny.
Fake floorboard hotwater prank.

1850
01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:15.060
And I know a lot of you guys are aware of these,
but I gotta tell you something.

1851
01:53:15.061 --> 01:53:17.190
When it comes to prank shows,

1852
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:22.430
the Jimi Hendrix of prank shows,
uh,
the Japanese people,

1853
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:26.030
um,
I don't know if it's Chinese too.
I have no,
I fucking idea,

1854
01:53:26.031 --> 01:53:27.350
but I think it's pretty much Japan.

1855
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:31.980
These dudes take practical jokes to a level where you just like the,

1856
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:34.940
even the person who sent me the email,
it's like,
obviously there's no lawyers,

1857
01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:37.970
there's no lawsuits.
The shit that you can do to people.

1858
01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.660
Funny fake floorboard hotwater prank,

1859
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:45.440
just not to totally give it away.
It's a fake floorboard.

1860
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:48.890
Not only does the person fall through the floorboard,

1861
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:54.230
not only did they go into water with their street clothes on,
it's hot water,

1862
01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:58.780
and then there's like this pile of ice that you then have to get out and jump

1863
01:53:58.820 --> 01:53:59.653
onto

1864
01:54:01.450 --> 01:54:05.080
and you look at these people's face that the prank happens to the,

1865
01:54:05.081 --> 01:54:09.620
they're like tortured animals.
It's brutal,
but it's fucking hilarious.

1866
01:54:09.621 --> 01:54:11.900
So check that out if you guys can find some more of those.

1867
01:54:11.901 --> 01:54:15.380
I know there was a classic one where they had one with this guy was walking

1868
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.570
around and he would pretend to sneeze.

1869
01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:21.530
He walked up right behind a complete stranger,
be like chew and he would,

1870
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.770
he had a water bottle room temperature water and he would spray it on the back

1871
01:54:25.771 --> 01:54:29.930
of the guy's neck and just see what the person would do like they're out of

1872
01:54:29.931 --> 01:54:33.600
their fucking minds.
Anyways,
last youtube video the week.

1873
01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.140
Um,
oh,

1874
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.200
a gangsta with an a with gun gets beaten by skaters and um,

1875
01:54:43.770 --> 01:54:45.900
I love,
I,
you know,
I don't like watching those,
those,

1876
01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.190
<v 8>you know,
I like watching a fight as much as anybody,</v>

1877
01:54:48.191 --> 01:54:51.220
but I don't really don't like watching somebody just completely get pounded to

1878
01:54:51.221 --> 01:54:52.720
the ground is something that's just,

1879
01:54:53.230 --> 01:54:55.230
that's a little too animalistic after a while,

1880
01:54:55.231 --> 01:54:59.580
if there's not a ref there to kind of stop it,
I can't get into it.
But,
um,

1881
01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:03.880
I do like the videos if you guys can find videos.
I love the fight,

1882
01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.870
the street fight videos where somebody talking shit and then they get knocked

1883
01:55:07.871 --> 01:55:12.120
out like that pimp who talks shit to the martial artists.
This is one,

1884
01:55:12.121 --> 01:55:16.130
this is like some gang banger takes out a gun.
I don't know what happened,

1885
01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.080
but somehow he gets beaten down by like three other skateboarders.
Um,

1886
01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.470
and please don't read the comments because it all just becomes this racist,

1887
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:27.980
depressing horseshit.
But,
um,
if you just watched the video,

1888
01:55:27.981 --> 01:55:29.630
it's actually funny in an,
actually,

1889
01:55:30.670 --> 01:55:34.420
if you look closely when you watch the video,

1890
01:55:34.421 --> 01:55:39.421
it presents a question I've had for a long time is why when you get not just

1891
01:55:41.131 --> 01:55:43.710
beat down,
when you get beat down,
beat down.

1892
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.350
<v 9>This is the question I've had.
Why do you always lose a shoe?
You know,</v>

1893
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:53.130
it's fucking unbelievable.
And it's like one of the deals when the smoke clears,

1894
01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:57.180
the dude always has,
one shoe was on and one shoe is off.

1895
01:55:57.181 --> 01:56:00.990
And you would think that you would see the shoe fly off,
but you never do.

1896
01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.570
I'm sure if you go back and you watch the video and you just look at the

1897
01:56:03.571 --> 01:56:06.030
person's feet,
you're going to see when it comes off.

1898
01:56:06.031 --> 01:56:08.340
But this dude in the end of it is missing a shoe.

1899
01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:12.570
You always see that one white gym shock the guy's hairs all over the place.

1900
01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:16.260
Your fucking ears are hot and you're just always missing a fucking shoe.

1901
01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:19.290
Do I have any scientists who listened to this thing?

1902
01:56:19.291 --> 01:56:24.291
Could explain if you guys have any theory as to why you lose a fucking shoe,

1903
01:56:24.331 --> 01:56:28.110
I am all ears.
I'm all right with that.

1904
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:31.790
I'm going to start to wrap up this podcast and like I said,
uh,

1905
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.040
we got the 99 cent ring tone on the,
uh,
the mm podcast,
the Oh gee,

1906
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:41.040
use fucking ringtone.
Um,
please check it out and please donate.

1907
01:56:41.041 --> 01:56:45.480
And um,
you know,
if I can somehow get 700 fucking people to do it,

1908
01:56:45.481 --> 01:56:49.110
I'm going to go out and go buy that recorder and start driving around doing

1909
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:51.770
these things again at some point.
Um,

1910
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.110
and with that we will end with this thing here for the podcast.
A bill.

1911
01:56:55.111 --> 01:56:59.040
This is under women in diamonds.
Um,
so bill,

1912
01:56:59.041 --> 01:57:02.610
I'm at a party last night and I see a guy I haven't seen in a long time.

1913
01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:06.350
He's got his girl with them.
She's pretty hot,
but she's got this Puss,

1914
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:10.560
a look on her face.
Uh,
we,
we were introduced earlier,
so I say,

1915
01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:15.120
so I say hey to her and uh,
and ask her what's wrong?

1916
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:19.170
Turns out she's had a few,
a few drinks and is throwing around the,

1917
01:57:19.171 --> 01:57:21.630
I want to get married.
Shit.
Um,

1918
01:57:21.631 --> 01:57:26.040
I don't think my buddies having any of it or at the very least plans to go down

1919
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:28.550
swinging.
Um,
so anyways,

1920
01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:31.080
nothing like a party to bring that shit up anyway.

1921
01:57:31.081 --> 01:57:35.640
So I figured this is the perfect opportunity to test out a new theory I have

1922
01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:38.430
about diamonds.
I'm not really a theory,

1923
01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:41.940
but a great question that allows women to show their true colors.

1924
01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.620
Why do I do this?
Because I'm a smart ass jerk when I have a few whiskeys.

1925
01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.200
I liked this guy.
This guy sounds like me.
Right?

1926
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:52.800
Why would you actually try to get the girl on your side and well actually you

1927
01:57:52.801 --> 01:57:54.630
wouldn't hook up at your buddy's girl,
but you know what I mean?

1928
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:58.260
Why would you put out a good vibe when you can actually piss people off?

1929
01:57:58.290 --> 01:58:02.970
I totally relate to that.
Um,
anyways,
second half here.
Anyway,

1930
01:58:03.090 --> 01:58:06.090
from what I understand,
you can basically,
now,

1931
01:58:06.091 --> 01:58:07.110
I don't know if this is true or not,

1932
01:58:07.111 --> 01:58:08.790
but this guy's claiming from what I understand,

1933
01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:13.290
you can basically buy a real diamond created in a lab.

1934
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.371
Um,

1935
01:58:14.371 --> 01:58:17.910
eventually they will be much cheaper than the ones they have to dig out of the

1936
01:58:17.911 --> 01:58:22.260
ground and they will also be flawless.
A fucking perfect diamond.

1937
01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.190
So I asked this girl,
I say if she,
if she would rather have a perfect,

1938
01:58:26.191 --> 01:58:31.191
flawless diamond created in a lab that costs a lot less or insist on a real dug

1939
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:37.920
out of the ground diamond by some poor person in Africa,

1940
01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.040
nearly perfect,
but ultimately flawed more than

1941
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.960
<v 8>it's an expensive one.
Um,
he,
he said you can pretty much guess her answer.</v>

1942
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:52.120
Once again,
women are fucking stupid about diamonds.
Uh,

1943
01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:53.260
all right.
My first question is,

1944
01:58:53.261 --> 01:58:57.820
can they really create one in a lab that's much cheaper and if they,

1945
01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:02.740
if they can for the love of God,
shut the fuck up about it.

1946
01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:07.120
That should be some low like Guy Shit,

1947
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:12.800
you know,
and,
and,
and this is what,
this is what we would do like you,

1948
01:59:12.810 --> 01:59:15.970
this is that this is the level that you organize it too.
All right?

1949
01:59:15.971 --> 01:59:18.190
Just so they don't catch on,
you know,

1950
01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:22.630
because some guy who fucking stock shelves at seven 11 is able to buy the hope

1951
01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:25.930
fucking diamond,
the broads,
we'll be able to figure it out quickly.

1952
01:59:25.931 --> 01:59:29.710
So we should do is organize his shit like the beginning of the warriors,

1953
01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.470
except nobody shoots Cyrus.
Okay,

1954
01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.840
we organize this shit and this is what we say.

1955
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:39.190
You come in with your w two for the fucking year.
All right?

1956
01:59:39.191 --> 01:59:40.210
We see what you make.

1957
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:44.680
And then we give you an unbelievable fucking diamond from making that amount of

1958
01:59:44.681 --> 01:59:48.940
money.
Whatever we rather than,
what's it supposed to cost?
Six weeks' pay.

1959
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:52.300
We give you one that costs like 10 weeks,
you know,

1960
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:56.860
put some fake beads of sweat on your fucking brow when you give it to her and

1961
01:59:56.861 --> 02:00:01.360
the whole thing's going to look legit and me while we take that money to go buy

1962
02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:04.150
a new flat screen.
All right.

1963
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:08.320
And that's when you make the fucking move or after you give it the diamond.
Okay.

1964
02:00:08.321 --> 02:00:12.340
Say I bought that diamond for you.
Now I want to buy something for me.
Actually,

1965
02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:15.910
why don't you help me out on this?
Just throw me a hundred,

1966
02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:18.970
200 bucks in this thing.
You go out and get a big fucking flat screen TV.

1967
02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:23.470
You get the fucking dish just in time for NFL football.

1968
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.083
You know,

1969
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:28.930
and I'm sure they offer a college football fucking package and then you just

1970
02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:32.620
spend the rest of the football season Saturday and Sunday and total fucking

1971
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:36.730
bliss.
And anytime she gives you shit,
just be like,
I'm sorry honey,

1972
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.690
I couldn't hear you over the glare of the fucking diamond I put on your goddamn

1973
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:44.740
finger.
That's what.
Well that's what should have happened.
If I had half a brain,

1974
02:00:44.741 --> 02:00:49.150
I wouldn't have read that part over the Goddamn a podcast.
But,
um,

1975
02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.860
I actually get that on some level.
Why she would want the other one.

1976
02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:57.700
I don't get it because I don't want to think about some poor kid digging that

1977
02:00:57.701 --> 02:01:02.080
out of the ground.
That's the part where it goes off the rails.
But they want,

1978
02:01:03.210 --> 02:01:07.990
you know,
they want something of value,
you know,
and they,
they,

1979
02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:11.290
I dunno if they want to show that they married a provider.

1980
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:16.260
I get it on some level.
They want to make their friends jealous.
Like,
um,

1981
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.960
I think their obsession with diamonds,
you know,

1982
02:01:19.961 --> 02:01:24.961
generally speaking is as dumb is our obsession with sports because when you

1983
02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:28.660
really think about it,
our obsession with sports is really fucking stupid.

1984
02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:30.573
You know,

1985
02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:34.720
sitting on your couch like a God damn cheerleader wearing the Jersey of your

1986
02:01:34.721 --> 02:01:37.540
favorite player.
I mean,
not everybody does that,
but there,
you know,

1987
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.250
fantasy football,

1988
02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:40.501
<v 9>I mean,</v>

1989
02:01:40.501 --> 02:01:45.501
fantasy football to me is the male version of sex in the city of women watching

1990
02:01:45.521 --> 02:01:46.390
sex in the city.

1991
02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:50.260
For you to sit around and play fantasy football and get together with your

1992
02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:53.770
friends and have a fucking draft.
I mean,

1993
02:01:53.771 --> 02:01:56.080
you might as well do it in a Goddamn tree fort.

1994
02:01:56.110 --> 02:01:59.980
It's really one of the gayest fucking things you could possibly do.

1995
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.330
And of course I am saying this,

1996
02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:05.230
having never tried it and I know God damn well fight tried it.
I'd be like,

1997
02:02:05.231 --> 02:02:10.060
this is fucking awesome.
You know,
past the dip or whatever you fucking guys do.

1998
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:14.370
Um,
but anyways,
I dunno,

1999
02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:20.150
I just,
I,
you know,
it's book.
If I've learned anything in life,

2000
02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:23.620
women are crazy and guys are fucking idiots and uh,

2001
02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:27.600
it's not straight across the board,
but generally speaking,
yeah,

2002
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.610
they're fucking nuts.
They're out of their minds and we're morons.
I mean,

2003
02:02:31.611 --> 02:02:34.730
when you,
if you go on youtube and you just look up those fail videos,

2004
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.710
most of them are guys trying to do something and they fucking get hit in the

2005
02:02:39.711 --> 02:02:43.400
balls,
land on the back of their head,
wreck their car.

2006
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:47.780
How many women are driving down the street on a fucking motorcycle going 90

2007
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:51.290
miles an hour,
trying to stand up on the seat.

2008
02:02:51.291 --> 02:02:55.960
Doing the karate kid pose is they point at the fucking camera and then fucking

2009
02:02:55.961 --> 02:03:00.200
skin,
get skin their fucking asses.
I mean,
how many,
you know what I mean?

2010
02:03:01.610 --> 02:03:03.950
How many,
how many fucking women are,
are,

2011
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:08.150
are fucking whatever that move that Asian dude does or whatever,

2012
02:03:08.151 --> 02:03:11.960
where he fucking somehow gets his car to be doing donuts and he actually gets

2013
02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:16.560
out of the car and is holding onto the steering wheel and it's still spinning

2014
02:03:16.561 --> 02:03:21.260
around.
Somehow he's got the gas pedal
pushed all the way down.

2015
02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.620
Basically in the end he gets run over by his own fucking car.
I mean,

2016
02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:26.570
we're idiots.
All right.

2017
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:31.030
Women on the other hand go to movies and start crying like they actually know

2018
02:03:31.031 --> 02:03:34.660
the fucking people on screen get all excited about shiny shit.

2019
02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:39.700
And uh,
I gotta be honest,
I don't even know what the fuck they get excited about.

2020
02:03:39.701 --> 02:03:41.710
I have such a difficult time listening to them

2021
02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.470
out of such a great chauvinist Dick thing to say as I fucking took a slug of

2022
02:03:47.471 --> 02:03:51.690
beer here.
Um Wow.
You know I'm going to get shit faced.

2023
02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:54.540
That's what I'm doing.
I gotta,
I gotta upload this thing.
That's what I'm doing.

2024
02:03:54.541 --> 02:03:56.310
I'm going out on my little balcony.

2025
02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:59.940
I don't have a porch and I'm gonna sit there in the fucking breeze and I'm going

2026
02:03:59.941 --> 02:04:04.360
to get hammered with my girl because um,
cause that's cause it's America,

2027
02:04:05.290 --> 02:04:09.250
you know?
I'm sure in England you're doing something smart,
right?

2028
02:04:09.550 --> 02:04:13.440
What are you guys doing over there?
Huh?
Eat some Indian food.

2029
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:18.050
Why are you guys teeth the color of curry?

2030
02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:21.690
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2031
02:04:21.690 --> 02:04:24.150
<v 9>Why am I shitting on England?
It was one fucking comedian for all.</v>

2032
02:04:24.151 --> 02:04:27.030
I know that guy was from Ireland.
I'm just breaking balls.
I'm just,
I'm,

2033
02:04:27.031 --> 02:04:29.630
I'm really whatever.
I'm like you guys.

2034
02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:32.060
I'm fucking defensive of my own goddamn country.
I know we're,

2035
02:04:32.061 --> 02:04:35.990
we're really in a bad place right now as a country,
but I say it not you.

2036
02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:39.240
I say it.
You got death.
All right.
Happy Labor Day.

2037
02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:44.460
Happy a fucking trails.
And,
uh,
come on,
man.
99 cents,

2038
02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:49.960
99 fucking sense.
Look into your heart and a downloaded,

2039
02:04:49.961 --> 02:04:54.200
it'd be fucking riot.
You'll be at work and your phone and be going,
oh gee.

2040
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:58.040
It's going to be great.
All right.
That's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

I hope you guys have a great week.
