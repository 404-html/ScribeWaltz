00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.550
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.860
November 17th,
2014.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
I am going to be talking at this volume throughout the whole podcast because

4
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.290
it's seven 24 in the morning.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm doing it at my fucking house and I got along fucking day in front of me.

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.230
Okay,
so that's the deal.
That's how it's going down.

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
Already recorded for 20 minutes,
found out the batteries were dead and uh,

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.720
I got to start all over again.
Okay.
I got to start all over again.

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.690
This close to thanksgiving,
thanksgiving,

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.430
everybody a day to give thanks.
It's such a wonderful holiday,
judge.

11
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.790
Your thick,
you know,

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.650
you don't have to buy gifts for everybody.

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.030
It's just getting together with other people.

14
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.460
I like it so much more than I like Christmas.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.500
It was people always trash Christmas since become this corporate holiday,

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.700
very raise gifts.
Got It.
God just by,

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760
by all his stuff and we've totally lost what it really used to be about.

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.870
It was about a woman who had never had sex in,

19
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:10.871
somehow was impregnated by a large being that built everything up in the sky.

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.290
She had no say in the matter,

21
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.020
none whatsoever.
She was walking around,

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
she was in her twenties she was in a relationship with a man and she wasn't

23
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.620
ready.
She wasn't ready.

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.750
She wasn't ready for any sort of dicks there.
I set it.

25
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.840
Forget about the biggest dick in the fucking world.

26
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210
The guy who created everything

27
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.700
somehow puts it in there.
How did he get it in there?
Yo,

28
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.930
I didn't get it in there.
You have to think about that.
How did that work?

29
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.260
That's like a,
that's one of those things like when you see a ship in a bottle,

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.510
like how did that get in there?

31
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.930
The build at first and then the bottles of fake and you glue both halves

32
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:59.580
together,
you know?

33
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.090
Or is there some pirates sitting there with some glue and a pair of fucking

34
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.540
tweezers?
How do you do it?
Nobody knows.

35
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.280
Right?
And she had to go to her man,
right?

36
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
That fucking guy yet listen.
Uh,
and I ain't going to blame me.
You know,

37
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.520
this has all been done a zillion times,
but every fucking comic on the planet,

38
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.450
you know what I'm saying?
But anyways,
um,
yeah,

39
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:26.100
so I'm up here early and I got to knock this thing out because today I got the

40
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:29.920
sixth and final table read forF is for family,
the,
the uh,

41
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:34.050
animated show that I'm doing for Netflix that I will be promoting for the next

42
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.210
13 months until it comes out.

43
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.010
Um,
I've been having a great time doing it.
And,
uh,
we're at episode number six.

44
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:48.180
We do the table read today we're going to record it to Mara.
And,

45
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.080
uh,

46
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.800
then I was thinking I had a little breathing room between I'm doing this one and

47
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.250
then doing another one,
a different show.

48
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.290
But I'm actually,
you are,

49
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:02.620
we got to an actor to sign on who does not live in Los Angeles and we have to

50
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:07.540
fly to where they're,
wherever he or she lives,
keeping it vague deliberately.

51
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.390
And we're going to knock out all the,
uh,
all the recordings.

52
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.360
So that's what I have to do for the rest of this week,
whatever.

53
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.910
Then I get a week off and make some fucking pumpkin pie and shit.

54
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.810
And there's your thanksgiving,
right?
Dasia,
thanksgiving,
whatever.

55
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:24.130
Let's get down to what the fuck I did this week.
So this week I actually,
uh,

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.223
<v 2>mmm.</v>

57
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.770
<v 1>You know,
I go to one big college football game a year and I wanted to go to the,</v>

58
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.640
you know,
we decided,
me and my buddies,
the hurricanes,
Miami Dolphins,

59
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.510
Miami Dolphins,
the hurricanes fucking Florida state game.

60
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.810
And then the Miami Dolphins,
buffalo bills had a game Thursday.
So we're like,

61
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:42.190
why don't we knock them both out?

62
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.330
And then Friday night I'll work the fucking Improv and West Palm Beach,

63
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.980
which is exactly what,
what we did.
And a dude,
I got to tell you,

64
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.090
we fucking did it up right,
man.
We bought,
we all,

65
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.370
we rented this fucking house right on the fucking water.

66
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.440
You know,
beautiful house,

67
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.150
beautiful fucking house that you can afford to rent but could never afford to

68
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
live there.

69
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.723
<v 2>MMM.</v>

70
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.820
<v 1>I'll tell you what was nuts was having now bought a house that I thought was a</v>

71
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:14.070
beautiful house and then found out all the problems that had.

72
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

73
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560
<v 1>I actually walked around and all the guys they would loan.</v>

74
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.620
It was a beautiful fucking house and I just,
just looking at it now,
it isn't,
no,

75
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.520
I saw all kinds of fucking issues.
All right.
The hot tub.

76
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.600
<v 1>The water was having a difficult time getting hot.
All right.</v>

78
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.340
I'd say that's about 4,500 bucks right there.
Figuring out what that is.
You know,

79
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.390
you had a bunch of loose tile over near the shallow end and the pool,

80
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.710
I don't know what was going on there.

81
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:45.600
It seems like there was some sort of a water seepage into the ground,

82
00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:49.120
Ej that caused the concrete underneath the tiles to fail.

83
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.330
That's at least three fucking grant.

84
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Then they had a steam shower and the door didn't close properly and the steam

85
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.230
when you turned it on with just keep coming out until you shut it off.

86
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:05.160
It didn't have any sort of shut off on it.
So all of that right there.

87
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.970
I just saw 12 grand with the fucking problems and I'm not even in the house yet,

88
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.950
so I can only imagine what is inside the walls.
See,

89
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.290
that's what owning a home is,
has done for me.
Now.

90
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.720
I don't even look at the overall layout of it.
Now.

91
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.430
I'm looking for fucking watermarks in the ceilings or the walls.
You know,

92
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.760
I'm looking to see if windows closed flush or not.
Any of that type of shit.

93
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.930
I'm completely jaded.
So anyways,
let me get 'em.
Let's get to the story here.

94
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.220
So anyways,
yeah,
me and uh,
you know,

95
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.450
Paul Versey and a couple other buddies,
vice starting,
you know,

96
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.360
go to these big college games every year.
So we assumed,
you know,

97
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.930
we went to the house that it was just going to be the four of us,
right?

98
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.420
Four or five,
that's what I thought it was going to be.

99
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:53.500
And we show up to this house and it was the four or five of us plus like,

100
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.150
I don't know,
I don't even know how many other guys were staying there.

101
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.190
It turns this place like this beer company rented it out.

102
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.320
So we didn't have to kick any money in,

103
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:06.550
and then they stock the fridge with all their beer and then all their bullshit

104
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:10.810
that doesn't sell like all those ciders and all that fucking horse shit.
Um,

105
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.760
so,

106
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.390
and then all those other guys that we didn't know also invited some other people

107
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.440
and it was like fucking,
I don't know,
like 12 people in the house.

108
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.240
It was fucking hilarious.
Like I would literally went in there,

109
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.200
I had no idea who was,
who,
who was staying,
who was friends with people staying,

110
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.460
right.
Sort of that shady type of thing.
There's not a lock on your door.

111
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:36.040
You're like,
thank God I got a computer in there.
The sunglasses.

112
00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:38.680
What the fuck are these people cool?
You have no idea who anybody is.

113
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.480
I felt like I was on like the fucking,

114
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.040
like if the real world did like an over 40 episode of their show,

115
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.870
like that's what it felt like.
Um,

116
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.190
fortunately everybody turned out to be a like,
totally cool.
But um,

117
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.570
I gotta tell you there was one fucking morning though,

118
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:59.330
if that was so god damn hilarious.
Uh,
what's his face?
Paul Versey.

119
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.570
As I've told you before,

120
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.660
I've told you this shit before on other podcasts that Paul Versey

121
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.410
not only is not a morning person,

122
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.780
he might be like the biggest like non morning person.

123
00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:15.030
I think I've ever met in my life.

124
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.360
Like the fucking look on his face when,

125
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.500
when he gets woken up before he feels he should be woken up.
I swear to God,

126
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.390
I can't even describe the,

127
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.450
it's like he looks like he's walking out of court and he just lost the case and

128
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.070
he was 100% right.

129
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.930
And He's already mental ease mentally getting past that and thinking about how

130
00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:40.200
he's going to take justice into his own hands.
You know,

131
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.750
like he's going to fucking kneecap somebody.

132
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.960
That's if you wake them up 20 minutes early,
right.

133
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.860
So we're in this fucking house.
All right.

134
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.820
And everybody in there is a married guy.
All right.

135
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.550
And for you youngsters out there,
I don't know if you've ever party,

136
00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:02.100
but like married guys,
like truly married guys like me and Versie are married.

137
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.550
But like,
you know,
we go on the road like every other week,
every other week.

138
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.550
You know,
you get some rnr,
you'll walk away from it.

139
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.210
But these guys truly married guys,

140
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.010
those guys that fucking wake up,
wife and kids,
right?

141
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.390
Get in the car,
go to work,
come back home,

142
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.750
wife and kids wake up the next day,

143
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.300
wife and kids and all this shit that comes with that.
Right?

144
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:31.860
Susie chipped a tooth on the coffee table and don't forget my keys.

145
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.450
Teeball game and a,
there's a dance recital.
I,
I a Jesus Christ,

146
00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:40.500
right fucking get in the car,
go to work,

147
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.030
coming home.
Can you pick up some more fucking yeast,
whatever.

148
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.430
Fuck you gotta do come home wife and kids,
you get the deal.

149
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.870
Those fucking guys

150
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.870
when they go go away and they get three days like you'll never see somebody go

151
00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:57.704
fucking

152
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.970
<v 3>okay,</v>

153
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.420
<v 1>they'll drink college kids under the table.
These guys will fucking animals.</v>

154
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.960
I almost gave him a standing ovation,
the level with which that they would,

155
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.090
they would like drinking until like three,

156
00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:12.020
four o'clock in the morning and then they would be up again at like 9:00 AM the

157
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:13.280
same fucking guys.

158
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

159
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.460
<v 1>Which is no big deal if you're a youngster.
But these guys were in their forties,</v>

160
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.863
that's not done.

161
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.980
That's like Darrell Green still running a four 40 when he was like 41 years old.

162
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.590
This is the alcoholic version of it.
Right.

163
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.390
So what was hilarious was they had surround sound in that house.

164
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.700
So like,
you know,
late at night when they had the music on,

165
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.460
like I want to go to bed and it's fucking cranked in my room.

166
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.860
But fortunately there's a volume that you have.
You go when you're turning,

167
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.460
you shut it off.
So anyway,
so we all go to bed at like three,

168
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:48.120
four o'clock in the fucking morning,
the first night.
All right.
And um,

169
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.340
I gotta be up early cause I got a punch up this script for this week.
I got two,

170
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.080
three hours of work that I have to do,
so I'm going to be up at nine anyway,

171
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.170
so I didn't go too hard the first night.
Um,

172
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.720
but these fucking guys like eight 30 in the morning,

173
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.030
all of a sudden the stereo just fucking comes on.

174
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.680
And I had my speaker turned off,
but you know,
it's just,
you know,
the,
the,

175
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.910
the living room area they had that,
you know,
there was no

176
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.270
<v 3>okay.</v>

177
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.700
<v 1>Uh,
the ceiling when all the way up to the second force floor ceiling.</v>

178
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:18.470
So when you walked in the hallway upstairs,

179
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.100
you looked off the balcony and you looked out through these windows out to the

180
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:25.490
pool,
onto the water,
it was fucking amazing.
Right?
But,
um,

181
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.160
you start cranking a fucking stereo.

182
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

183
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.360
<v 1>With all of that,
that space for all the sounds to bounce off the fucking wall,</v>

184
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:36.570
dude,
it sounded like a goddamn constant.
Right?
And they're crank in this shit.

185
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.780
I'm hating it.
Make that making Margaritas,

186
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.150
that fucking the Shane,
right.
Crush it up the ice.

187
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.640
And all I'm thinking of is Versie.

188
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.910
So I'm laying in bed laughing my fucking ass off because I know first he's going

189
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:54.960
to come down those stairs with the look on his face,

190
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:59.550
like he's going to fucking murder everybody,
right?
Um,
and then on top of that,

191
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:02.760
there was a couple hurricane fans there and they started doing those chairs.

192
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:05.490
They're out by the pool doing that.

193
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.520
It's great to be me,
hurricane or oh,

194
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.570
you guys cage,
right?
Screaming.
Uh,

195
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.210
sure enough,
about three minutes into this shit,

196
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.910
I get a text from [inaudible] all in capital letters.
He goes,
dude,

197
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.660
when did the fucking orchestra start?
What the fuck?

198
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.490
A question mark.
20 exclamation points.

199
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:36.390
So I'm fucking dying laughing and uh,
and I'm trying to punch up the script.

200
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:39.540
I'm just this,
you know,
don't want the best I can.
You know,
this is what happens.

201
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.590
You stay with a bunch of other guys,

202
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:43.410
you've got to fucking deal with other people,
right?
So,

203
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.770
<v 3>okay,</v>

204
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.490
<v 1>that doing this shift for like an hour and a half,
just getting fucking loaded.</v>

205
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.880
Um,
I'm trying to punch up the script and verse.
He's losing fucking mind.

206
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.600
And then at of right around 11 o'clock in the morning and granted it's 11

207
00:11:57.601 --> 00:11:59.490
o'clock in the morning,
but we had been drinking to like three,

208
00:11:59.491 --> 00:12:00.360
four o'clock in the morning.

209
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.470
There was a guitar in the House and one of these married dudes picks this

210
00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:07.590
fucking thing up.
He had a great voice.
But what the fuck,
right.

211
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.450
He starts playing this thing.

212
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.230
<v 4>Okay.</v>

213
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.450
<v 1>He's,</v>

214
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.450
he played like he was playing a Bon Jovi's wanted dead or alive just sitting out

215
00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:19.840
there.

216
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.190
He just starts banging on the guitar and I'll send you just like singing right

217
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:24.780
in that area where you've got,
you know,

218
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:27.420
it goes all the way up to the second floor ceiling sitting right in the family

219
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:30.870
room.
They all of a sudden you just hear this guy going,
it's all the say.

220
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.280
Oh Jay age.
Right.

221
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.820
And then when he got to the chorus,

222
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.990
somebody else was singing the Richie Sambora part.
So He'd be like,

223
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.680
cause I'm walnut.
Did he hit somebody else by the pool?
Whoa.

224
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.353
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

225
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.160
<v 1>And all of a sudden I get a text,
some version he just likes,</v>

226
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.010
he writes really all capital letters.

227
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.680
And then like 20 explanation points of Eh,

228
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.300
exclamation points and fucking question marks.
Oh my God,
Dude.

229
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.250
I was laying in this bed,
fucking crying,

230
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.300
laughing in every song was getting more annoying if you were trying to sleep

231
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.400
this dude,
you fucking sank Paul.

232
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:21.490
Simon's 50 ways to leave your lover,

233
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.960
which is a fucking hilarious song because the like the verse is like whispered

234
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.800
and then it gets fucking loud during the course,
like a Nirvana Song,
you know?

235
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.590
So he's just sitting there and in the living room,
you know,

236
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.470
the problem is all inside your head.
She said to me,
Andrew is easy.
If you take a,

237
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.350
I don't have the data,
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover,

238
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.770
50 ways to leave your lover.
Then he just screams,
come on everybody.

239
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.660
He just slipped back to back.
Jack just fucking wailing on this guitar.

240
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.760
Um,
and the Margarita Margarita machine was going,
I just,

241
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:56.380
I was just fucking laughing the whole time,

242
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.080
punching up this fucking script or whatever.
And uh,

243
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:00.580
<v 4>okay.</v>

244
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.690
<v 1>So then we get out there and I'm telling you,
dude,
like,
nope,
nope.</v>

245
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.980
Like nobody fucking drinks like that.
College kids,
I guess we'll drink like that,

246
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.040
but it's understandable.
He's like,
Oh my God,
I'm a wait for my parents.
Right.

247
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.630
There's a different kind of desperation that a married guy who's just fucking

248
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:21.190
locked in a married guy that doesn't cheat,
doesn't fuck around.

249
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.383
You know what I mean?

250
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.770
His only outlet is this three days that he's out there and he is drinking every

251
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:29.670
drop of fucking alcohol do this.

252
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.020
I don't want fucking cannon balls into the pool.

253
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.510
<v 4>Okay.</v>

254
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.070
<v 1>Was Insane.
It was fucking funny.
I already miss it.
That's so much fun.
I had um,</v>

255
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.440
so many ways.
Uh,
so that night we ended up going to the uh

256
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:44.750
<v 4>yeah</v>

257
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.340
<v 1>to the Miami Dolphin Buffalo Bill game and uh,</v>

258
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.560
we had a hookup.
We got to go down onto the field right before,
uh,

259
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.340
you know the game watching those guys working out duty can't fucking believe how

260
00:14:57.341 --> 00:15:01.150
big they are.
You just looking at a guy like go on that,
that's a running back.

261
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.690
That's not a linebacker,
that's a running back gigantic.

262
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.880
And you sit there and you remember their numbers,
which is cool.

263
00:15:06.881 --> 00:15:08.770
Cause then when you get up there and you see him on the field,

264
00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:12.310
they look small again next to a defensive lineman or a linebacker.

265
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.980
They actually look like a running back.
But when they're standing next to you,

266
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.320
it's like a,
you know,
they look like fucking iron man.
You know,

267
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.160
you know whenever you go to those fucking places with those stores where they

268
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:27.980
have the hours,
the actual alphabet worn by an actor,
it was six what floor?

269
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.940
And it's made all of metal.
That's what the fuck these guys look like.
So,
um,

270
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.290
we ended up going up there and a dude,
I got to tell you something.

271
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

272
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.060
<v 1>In all my years going to a sporting events that Miami dolphins game might have</v>

273
00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:48.720
been the biggest collection of fucking animals I've ever been around.

274
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

275
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.780
<v 1>It was doing,
it was unfucking believable.
Do Florida is,</v>

276
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.160
I dunno what the deal is with Florida and I know there's a lot of beautiful

277
00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:03.060
people down there and there's a lot of beautiful people and they got money and

278
00:16:03.061 --> 00:16:08.020
all of that type of shit,
but they do not go to a dolphins game.
Fucking animals.

279
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.810
You combine that with the bills fans,

280
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.340
bunch of married guys who got away for three days and they were drinking at the

281
00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:18.000
level that they were drinking do we were in this,
we were sitting in our row.

282
00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:18.834
Right,

283
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

284
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.560
<v 1>And there was like four or five different people who just either stepped over a</v>

285
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:28.550
row to go up or down and sat in different seats.
It was like a free for all.

286
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.530
Anybody could sit wherever they wanted.

287
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.680
There was a guy next to me eating a fucking hammered like 50 something years

288
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:40.010
old,
just absolutely fucking wasted eating this fucking hot dog.

289
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

290
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.120
<v 1>With ketchup and onions on it.
I swear to God it looks like he was,</v>

291
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.930
he was doing the David Hasselhoff video when he fucking hate it.
The hamburger,

292
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.030
he was getting it all over his face.
His hands.
He had onions with ketchup.

293
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.920
<v 1>You don't think that when they dice them up,
just like,</v>

295
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.780
like snow flakes all over his fucking pants and then he's leaning into me to

296
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:03.240
talk to me covering and onions and ketchup.
God,

297
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.790
I love how I can I go for a ride down fucking complete animals.

298
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.800
Um,
and then the worst part was littered within that.
You'd see some older fans,

299
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.260
like older couples,
cute older people,
you know,

300
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:19.130
with Bob Greasy and Jim Lange or fucking jerseys sitting there and you're trying

301
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:22.970
to think like,
are they thinking like what happened?
But then again,

302
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:26.060
they also went to football games during the 70s so God knows what the hell they

303
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.850
saw.
I don't know.
All I know it was so fucked up.

304
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

305
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:35.120
<v 1>At halftime we actually left and went inside and kind of just fucking regrouped</v>

306
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.890
and just tried to find an area where we could sit where you could just be away

307
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:42.860
from that do I had like fucking like three beers spilled on me.

308
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.780
We were in the lower level two and I expect that the upper level of any fucking

309
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.850
stadium,
you expect that behavior.
But I was like down here I was like,
wait,

310
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.650
where's the corporate people?
Where's the Illuminati Illuminati money,
you know,

311
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.700
where's the people who are profiting off the war?
Right.

312
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.070
Where are those for nowhere to be found.

313
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.700
Just a bunch of fucking animals.
So,
uh,
so here's the funny thing.

314
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.320
As I'm sitting there fucking judge in them.
Um,
I mean,
dude,

315
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.220
these people were so fucking drunk and so fucking gross,
like in,

316
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:17.220
it made me feel like,
dude,

317
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.410
I don't think I ever want to go to another live sporting event.

318
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.180
I would rather be home.
Having said all of that,

319
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.130
uh,
we go to the fucking Miami Hurricane,
f Mari,

320
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:33.900
Miami Hurricane Fsu game,
and I literally became that guy.

321
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.160
I became that dolphins fan.
I minus the fucking food all over me.

322
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.440
I don't know what happened,
Dude.
I just fucking,
I drank way too much.
Uh,

323
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.450
yeah.
Jesus.

324
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.310
I'm still thinking about things that I said at that game and just kind of gone.

325
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.620
You know,
like when you think of dumb shit you do,
you just kind of,

326
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.560
I always make noise when I think of shit that I did

327
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.070

Um,
all right,

433
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.210
I'll save your fucking ears.
I'll read another couple later.
Um,
oh,

434
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:28.210
I've got to promote some two things I've got to promote.
Uh,

435
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.340
for those of you who worked a lot this past week,
you might have missed it.

436
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:35.800
I did a very special episode of the Monday morning podcast with the,

437
00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:36.634
um,

438
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.770
<v 0>okay,</v>

439
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.760
<v 1>I'm sorry the fucking battery went between the Goddamn cushion,
God dammit.</v>

440
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.013
Uh,

441
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.270
set these down and we go with Joe Perry from Aerosmith,

442
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.630
everyone the one and only Joe Perry,

443
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.080
part of one of the greatest lead singer lead guitar to Tara's Tandems in rock

444
00:25:58.751 --> 00:26:02.770
music histories.
Tyler Perry,
right?
Holy Shit.
Tyler Perry.

445
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.770
I hadn't even thought about that.
Tyler Perry presents an Aerosmith albums,

446
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.990
Jagger,
Richards,
Tyler Perry.
I never even thought of that.
Um,
anyways,

447
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.830
it was a great interview and I had a great time with him and I deliberately did

448
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:20.360
not go into all of the stupid fucking,
you know,
so what's it like to,

449
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:24.410
uh,
get on stage and play?
Good.

450
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:28.190
I asked a couple of Music Geek questions,
but I've always found with those guys,

451
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.600
you know,
just to give them a break.
If you talk about a bunch of other shit,

452
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.600
they really can have a good time.
And uh,
you know,

453
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:38.960
so we talked about rather than talking about rock music and what was it like in

454
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:43.510
the 70s and all that,
I did a little bit of that shit.
I tried to do it in a way.

455
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.710
Um,
I uh,
I don't know.

456
00:26:48.711 --> 00:26:51.920
We talked about home invasion owning a gun,

457
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.350
some of the worst torture,

458
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.030
like ways to die and I'm,
and he was right there,

459
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.990
right there with it.
Very well read man.
And uh,

460
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.290
we had a great time and actually somebody uh,
sent me a question about,

461
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.800
it was like a Joe Perry,
dear bill,
dear Billy.

462
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.670
It was a blind man.
Uh,

463
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.540
then I guess that's an Aerosmith song reference in case you missed it that late

464
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.490
nineties hit while dude,
they have like 9 million hits.

465
00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:21.080
You got to get a little more specific than that.

466
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.600
I said I love the Perry podcasts so much.

467
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.960
I heard him on Rogan and opion Jimmy and he sounds like the coolest guy ever.

468
00:27:26.961 --> 00:27:29.960
He is the coolest guy ever considering.

469
00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:32.450
I showed up with my little bullshit apparatus,

470
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.890
two microphones and I forgot a Mike Cord and he goes,
Oh yeah,

471
00:27:36.891 --> 00:27:40.520
my neighbors got one and he got up and ran over there to go get one.

472
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.410
He came back,
it was the wrong thing,
didn't fit.

473
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:45.680
He ran back over again and I'm sitting alone in his frigging house going,

474
00:27:45.681 --> 00:27:49.850
Joe Perry is going to get me a Mike Court.
Like,
like it's no biggie.

475
00:27:49.851 --> 00:27:53.720
That's how fucking cool that guy,
he's,
I was so fucking embarrassed.
Listen to it.

476
00:27:53.721 --> 00:27:57.920
You'll hear,
you'll hear it.
Um,
all of that on there anyways.

477
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.270
Uh,
he goes,
no excuses.
You have to have him back on.
Oh good.

478
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.000
I'm glad you liked the interview.
I don't do a lot of those.

479
00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:09.590
I said next time block off two hours so we can get our feel.

480
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:14.450
How surreal is it that you know him and that he's a fan of yours?

481
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.200
I know you're not the biggest name dropper,
no names.
He says,
uh,

482
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.400
but who else have you befriended since becoming the famous stud you are,

483
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.610
that blows your mind every time you think about it.
Sincerely,

484
00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:30.600
no name from East Boston Kid East Boston kid.
All right.
Well,
um,

485
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.440
I wouldn't say,
uh,
I have,
um,

486
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.300
a cult following.
I am at a very cool level of notoriety.
Right.

487
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:46.070
Which is a good thing considering my behavior at the fucking Florida State Miami

488
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:49.700
hurricane game.
Oh my God.
Did I get fucking hammered?

489
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.690
I woke up so fucking hung over that I wasn't really,
um,
you know,

490
00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.570
I wasn't really a
keen on drinking,

491
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:03.030
so I started slow because the night before.
Oh,

492
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.500
well let me back up here for a second.

493
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.990
Or should I ask answer the Joe Perry question?

494
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.200
I'll answer the Joe Perry question first and then I'll tell the whole fucking

495
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:14.670
story of my,
my last weekend out there in Fort Lauderdale.

496
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.570
Um,
all right.
So what is your question?

497
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.430
Who else have I befriended since people started to know me?
Um,

498
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.320
you know,
and I don't know people,
few people here or there,
you know?
Yeah,
it does,

499
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:30.420
you know,
blows your mates more like people.
Um,

500
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.830
<v 0>yeah,</v>

501
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:33.581
<v 1>you don't,
it really is.</v>

502
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:36.640
It's people who were famous before I got into this business,

503
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.760
you know what I mean?
As opposed to like,
you know,

504
00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:42.710
a lot of people will come famous now,
like 20 years younger than I am.

505
00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:46.790
So I just look at him and I just see,
I just see some kid,
you know,

506
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.300
driving around in a Ferrari and I just think,
uh,

507
00:29:50.301 --> 00:29:53.470
I hope that person saves them money because this Oh till his proof,

508
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:56.540
his business is a rough on,
you know,
and that's all I think,
you know,

509
00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.070
so I don't really go like,
you know,
I,
I guess it's,
yeah,

510
00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:03.520
it's people that,
um,
athletes and um,

511
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.540
and entertainers that when I was a kid and they were bigger than life.

512
00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:13.130
Like if I meet anybody who played football,
hockey,
basketball,
baseball,

513
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.730
um,
when I was a kid,
uh,

514
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.830
like,
oh,
well when I was down on the sidelines,
I ended up meeting a nat more,
uh,

515
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.770
put that video up.

516
00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:27.860
But he was famous when he got hit and he helicoptered around is still held onto

517
00:30:27.861 --> 00:30:32.600
the ball.
Um,
to me that's fucking cooler than meeting.

518
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.780
Uh,
I dunno,
kid rock or something like that.
Nothing against kid rock.

519
00:30:35.781 --> 00:30:38.890
He just was in knowledge kid to me.

520
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.330
And I don't mean that in a disrespectful way.

521
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.220
I mean I'm happy for him and all that type of stuff,

522
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:48.520
but it was just like I didn't grow up on his music by the time that guy hit,

523
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.040
I was well into my thirties fucking up my 20th goddamn relationships.

524
00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:54.700
So I was just in a different place.

525
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.720
Like music means so much to you when you're in your teenage years.
So,
um,

526
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.640
obviously Joe Perry is a big name,
but I don't name names and I don't.

527
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.600
Um,

528
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.110
<v 3>okay.</v>

529
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.440
<v 1>I Dunno,</v>

530
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.100
I just always feel like those people are completely inundated with that shit.

531
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.440
Last thing they need is somebody else talking about them.
Uh,

532
00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:17.441
so I will say as far as like the etiquette when you do meet somebody like that

533
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.340
is you don't ask for a picture.
You don't ask for an autograph.

534
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.590
And if you have any fucking sorta sense is you don't talk about all the shit

535
00:31:27.591 --> 00:31:32.300
that they've done because they've talked about it to death.
And the last thing,

536
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.850
the last thing,
like,
I dunno a fuck egg.

537
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:40.660
If you met somebody who landed on the moon,
do you met one of those guys?

538
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.900
The last thing they want to talk about is what it was like to land on the

539
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:44.531
fucking moon.

540
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:49.531
They'd been talking about it since 1969 if he can somehow find out what their

541
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:53.100
hobby is
like,

542
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.460
say you got a fucking astronaut and he's into gardening and you actually know a

543
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:58.260
little bit about growing fruits and vegetables.

544
00:31:58.261 --> 00:32:01.590
If you actually talk to that guy about that at a fucking party,

545
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.830
that guy's eyes would fucking lock in on you like a laser.

546
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.510
Cause he finally gets to talk about something else.
That's a theory.

547
00:32:11.511 --> 00:32:15.280
I have some people like talking about the shit that they do.
Um,

548
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.880
but anyways,
you asked me a yeah,
like Joe Perry.

549
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:22.070
That is definitely someone you know,
uh,

550
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.530
that I still,
you know,
you just looking at him going like,
yeah,

551
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:30.070
that's fucking Joe Perry.
It's fucking Joe Perry.

552
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:33.430
And he's sitting here and I'm interviewing him and he's right next to a guitar.

553
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.840
And despite the fact I want to ask him to pick it up and show me how to play

554
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:40.050
toys in the attic,
I'm going to fucking do it.

555
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.033
<v 2>MMM.</v>

556
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.020
<v 1>But anyways,
yeah.
Well it would also helps too if you,</v>

557
00:32:49.021 --> 00:32:50.030
if you're doing the interview,

558
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:52.520
if you've got to know the person a little bit and you find out all the other

559
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:55.760
shit that they're into.
But I,
I figured that out a long time ago.

560
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.430
<v 2>Uh,
I did,
uh,
um,</v>

561
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.030
<v 1>I helped us isn't coming off like an arrogant ass.</v>

562
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:03.290
It's another reason why I know fucking drop any names because,
oh,

563
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:06.480
what was doing this?
And I was hanging out with this guy.
Um,

564
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.290
I was doing this thing for,
uh,

565
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.340
the baseball awards where they like give out the cy young award and all that.

566
00:33:11.341 --> 00:33:14.160
And they have,
we wanted to have a comedian there just in case the,
uh,

567
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.510
the baseball players weren't being funny and what killed me was not only they

568
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.321
were they funny,

569
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:23.520
they will fucking hilarious and they told great stories and then I felt like I

570
00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:25.020
wasn't even worthy of being there.

571
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:26.523
<v 2>MMM.</v>

572
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.760
<v 1>I remember Willie Randolph in particular was fucking hilarious cause he had just</v>

573
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.030
left the Yankees to,
to manage the mets.

574
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:36.663
<v 2>MMM.</v>

575
00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.880
<v 1>And he was really funny,
you know,</v>

576
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.360
talking shit to the Yankees and Joe Torry and all those guys.
So,
uh,

577
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.221
anyways,

578
00:33:44.221 --> 00:33:48.120
I'm standing backstage waiting to go on and Bernie Williams is there and I was

579
00:33:48.121 --> 00:33:48.954
like,

580
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:49.590
<v 4>okay.</v>

581
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.300
<v 1>And I just went through the Rolodex.
Alright,</v>

582
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.600
last thing you want to say is what's it like to play center field for the

583
00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:57.300
Yankees?
Because he,
he'll answer it,
he'll just glaze over.

584
00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:59.970
But I had seen on the yes network,
you know,

585
00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:02.040
that he was a musician and he played with his band.

586
00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:03.930
He was actually really fucking good.

587
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.760
So I just started talking music to the guy.
Oh wait,

588
00:34:08.761 --> 00:34:13.380
this was afterwards,
this was afterwards I started talking music with them.

589
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:17.370
And he just totally fucking that glazed over.
I'm super famous,
look,

590
00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:21.270
went away and it was just talking to him and then all of a sudden this other

591
00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:24.480
baseball player who I think was pissed because the red sox had just beat the

592
00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:25.560
Yankees.
Okay.

593
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.530
<v 4>Okay.</v>

594
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.070
<v 1>For the first time ever when we were down three games to none and I gave him a</v>

595
00:34:30.071 --> 00:34:32.200
little bit of shit like just to crowd in general.

596
00:34:32.201 --> 00:34:35.260
And I think he was mad at me and he came walking up and just like put this

597
00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:40.261
fucking ridiculous energy was just ignoring me and staring at the side of Bernie

598
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.140
Williams head.
And it kind of was like,
all right guys,
see you later.

599
00:34:44.141 --> 00:34:48.010
And I walked away.
To this day,
I wish,
I wish they said something,

600
00:34:48.011 --> 00:34:52.150
but he seemed like he was fucking pissed.
Um,
tell what happened.

601
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.560
I'm just some punk comedian,
so I fucking walked away.
So anyways,
yeah.

602
00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:00.340
So anybody famous,
I've done a couple of table reads where,

603
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:01.720
<v 4>okay.</v>

604
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.190
<v 1>You know,
uh,</v>

605
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.190
actually I did a table read with one of the guy or you made a reference to him

606
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.770
eating a fucking hamburger.

607
00:35:10.771 --> 00:35:14.850
I did a table read with him and he was the coolest fucking dude ever and looked

608
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:15.331
great.

609
00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:18.030
Like you just looked at the guys like that guy had to be a fucking movie star.

610
00:35:18.031 --> 00:35:20.400
Look at him,
look at them.
It's fucking ridiculous looking.

611
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.530
And I was totally cool and a funny son of a bitch,
but,
uh,

612
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.850
I don't really name names or anything like that.
Um,
but yeah,

613
00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:29.160
that answers the question.
If,
if they were famous and they,

614
00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:33.630
I love what they did when I was a kid.
It's fucking over.
You know what I mean?

615
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:39.520
Like if I met Tom Brady,
you know,
hey,
all right,
whatever.

616
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.560
But if I met Steve Grogan,

617
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.120
a Mac Cavenaugh was Sam Cunningham,

618
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.410
dawn Calhoun,
right?
John Hannah,

619
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.930
Raymond Clayborne,
those guys.
Cedric Maxwell,
Terry O'Reilly,

620
00:35:56.931 --> 00:36:00.880
Stan,
Jonathan.
If I meet those fucking guys,
I,
I turned into a little schoolgirl.

621
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.393
<v 4>Uh,</v>

622
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.531
<v 1>yeah,
I meet Tom Brady.</v>

623
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:07.710
I just feel old and I'm reminded that I never made it to the NFL.

624
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.560
No disrespect.
That's all.

625
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.950
I'm speaking a Tom Brady.

626
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.650
How about that can huge when I'm starting to become a fucking believer.

627
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.480
<v 4>Okay,</v>

628
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.240
<v 1>I can,
can you even,
can you believe anything this year in the NFL?</v>

629
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:29.310
I hope you're not gambling this year.
And if you,

630
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:32.820
if you're gambling this year and you're actually making money,

631
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.010
there's no way you're,

632
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.400
you're actually looking at the information and making any sort of intelligent

633
00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:41.740
gas because there's nothing to even like the analyst on TV sitting there going

634
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.100
like,
well,
what,
what do you do with this?

635
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.600
What do you do with this information here?
Um,

636
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.800
<v 4>okay.</v>

637
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.650
<v 1>Every other week,
like some team that looks like they're,</v>

638
00:36:51.651 --> 00:36:54.560
the team completely falls apart and then another team comes on.

639
00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:57.770
So now all of a sudden the patriots,
after looking like they were finished,

640
00:36:57.771 --> 00:37:01.310
they had written them off.
They'd beaten the Broncos and the colts.

641
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:06.650
Now the dumb football fan goes,
yeah,
that's it.

642
00:37:06.651 --> 00:37:10.370
That means we're the best team in the AFC rather than just going like,

643
00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:14.360
that was just a fucking regular season game in October or November.

644
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.793
Um,

645
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:16.980
<v 4>okay.</v>

646
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.750
<v 1>I love that we beat those teams,
but,
uh,</v>

647
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.230
sometimes I actually wish you lose those ones because I think it's easier when

648
00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:25.260
you get into the playoffs and you're already lost.
For some reason.

649
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:29.050
It always seems like the team that lost comes back and when,
so,
um,

650
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.000
I don't see us getting to the big dance there without having to play the colts

651
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.650
and the Broncos,
at least one of them,
if not both of them again.

652
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.450
Um,

653
00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.200
<v 4>okay.</v>

654
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.000
<v 1>You know,
and as my buddy Keith Robinson,
okay,</v>

655
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.840
the always sunshiny Keith Robinson was saying is that if the Broncos go out and

656
00:37:49.841 --> 00:37:52.290
they sign,
um,

657
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.370
<v 4>okay,</v>

658
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:58.370
<v 1>the guy who fucking with this kid with a tree branch on his ball bag,</v>

659
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.010
if they sign him or the guy who dropped the chicken,
the fucking elevator Fisa,

660
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.880
if they signed one of them,
you know,

661
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.260
they signed one of them,

662
00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:10.600
then all of a sudden they have a running game and we suck against the run.

663
00:38:10.601 --> 00:38:13.930
Although we looked pretty good last night.
Uh,
I'll tell you right now,

664
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:15.740
that's a completely different blog posts.

665
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.620
Chaman achievement showed up back in October.
Um,
dude,

666
00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:25.260
how annoying are those?
No more commercials.
Fucking unbelieved that.

667
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:28.590
Just the whole tone of those within they,
they're talking to you like,
you know,

668
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:32.490
a woman that's been beaten that's being beaten and you're not saying anything.

669
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.680
It's like,
dude,
that's what you guys did.

670
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.550
Why don't you show that video to yourself?

671
00:38:37.551 --> 00:38:40.520
Do you realize how debt the fucking mind?
Fuck the fuck on that thing.

672
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:47.700
They did the thing that then they did the thing right now and now they're

673
00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:51.150
yelling at you like you did it no more.

674
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.770
<v 3>Okay,</v>

675
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.520
<v 1>no more.</v>

676
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.210
She closed the refrigerator door and forgot to take her fucking head out,
right?

677
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.860
<v 1>Stop looking the other way.</v>

679
00:39:00.861 --> 00:39:05.861
Can you fucking believe the balls of the NFL to come at their fan base with that

680
00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:11.411
fucking tone sitting there watching your product so you're making money and all

681
00:39:12.441 --> 00:39:15.170
of a sudden you're going to start yelling at me for this shit.
You did.

682
00:39:15.171 --> 00:39:18.980
You fucking stuffed suit.
Cont unfucking believable.

683
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.340
You watch that fucking video.
Um,

684
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:23.720
<v 3>okay.</v>

685
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.000
<v 1>I would only get me started on all of that shit.
All of this debt,</v>

686
00:39:27.001 --> 00:39:28.420
that whole getting offended thing.

687
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:32.160
Can you believe that scientists had to apologize for that comic con fucking

688
00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:37.161
shirt he was wearing after landing and unmanned fucking drone on a comet that's

689
00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:38.460
hurling through space.

690
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

691
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.460
<v 1>He had to apologize.
Who the fuck are they apologizing to?</v>

692
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.010
I don't know anybody who's a member of a group.

693
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.260
I don't know anybody who sends in complaints.

694
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.190
I don't know anybody who gets offended.
I don't know anybody.
It's fucking unreal,

695
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:58.000
dude.
It's like getting offended now.
It's like a,
yeah,
it's not even,

696
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.210
it's not even truly being offended anymore.
It's just,
it's like a,

697
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:05.790
it's like a marketing move.
It's like,
okay,

698
00:40:05.791 --> 00:40:10.590
everybody tweet in three,
two,
one,
boom,
and then you have 500 tweets,

699
00:40:10.591 --> 00:40:12.540
the same fucking thing and then it starts trending.

700
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.720
We do that at all things comedy,
like we have a big,

701
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.020
we're trying to raise money here for our,
uh,

702
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.300
for our new studios to get some high quality equipment in there and we just

703
00:40:24.301 --> 00:40:25.850
don't tweet out at the same time.

704
00:40:25.851 --> 00:40:27.590
And then all of a sudden it becomes a little movement there.

705
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:30.620
But that doesn't mean the whole world is thinking what all things comedy is

706
00:40:30.621 --> 00:40:34.250
thinking.
Right?
That Jesus,
what am I talking?
All right,

707
00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:39.070
let's get to the fucking game.
So anyways,
so after we,
uh,
we did,
uh,

708
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.420
the show out in West Palm Beach.
Um,

709
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:45.860
we came back and I bought probably the greatest assortment of cumin Cuban cigars

710
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.020
ever amassed

711
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.310
by a redheaded balding freckled guy,

712
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:58.020
46 years of age in the fucking West Palm beach area,
whatever.

713
00:40:58.021 --> 00:41:00.720
I brought a great selection of cigars,
but like 25 fucking cigars,

714
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.590
I brought enough cigars so everybody,
the,

715
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.490
the four people that I thought were going to be there,

716
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.760
so we all could smoke three a day if we want it to.

717
00:41:08.761 --> 00:41:12.330
I knew I would have some leftover.
So we're hopping away late at night,

718
00:41:12.331 --> 00:41:13.440
laughing our balls off.

719
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.060
Me and Versie for the 9000000th time had the Matt Cassel fucking argument.

720
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.570
Um,
you know,

721
00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:24.640
where he said the Patriots made a big mistake and getting rid of the guy ain't

722
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.480
Keiji Dude,
the,

723
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:30.480
he won 11 games and I kept going with the team that won 16.

724
00:41:30.751 --> 00:41:34.580
Paul,
that's a five e one less fucking games.

725
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.100
That's like 30% less games.
So if that team was nine and seven,

726
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.480
30% less of fucking nine games,
three games,

727
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:49.010
now that team goes six and 10.
Do you understand that?

728
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.550
You just keep looking at 11 games.
A fucking drove me nuts.

729
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.670
All right.
Then he goes out to Casey,
he gets hurt and they fucking cheer.

730
00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.810
Midwestern,
classy fucking people.
They cheer.
So anyways,

731
00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:03.730
we had that fight till like four in the mall.
It's just a great,

732
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.250
just a great hang.
You know,

733
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.260
just sitting there smoking cigars out by the pool right near the fucking water

734
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.510
is the greatest goddamn thing ever.
And then we go to bed,

735
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.190
we wake up the next day,
the fucking blenders going.
The Guitar Guy had gone home.

736
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.870
I missed the guy,
man.

737
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:22.870
I wanted him to fucking wake up for z again cause it was just too fucking funny.

738
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.940
Um,
he had already gone home.
Great Dude.
And then,
um,

739
00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.160
we fucking,
uh,

740
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:36.570
these guys start drinking and I'm drinking waters for like the first two hours

741
00:42:36.581 --> 00:42:40.960
I'm up,
I'm drinking waters,
I'm doing the right thing.
And then,
uh,

742
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.190
I cracked open my first beer and then I didn't want to get a beer belly.

743
00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:49.410
I started drinking fucking crown royal and uh,

744
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:55.320
still sober,
took a cab to the game.
Everything's going great.

745
00:42:55.321 --> 00:42:56.760
We get out there and this is funny thing,

746
00:42:56.761 --> 00:43:01.110
now we go to the exact same fucking stadium where we went and we saw those

747
00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:01.944
dolphin fans,

748
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.460
all of them looking like they just dress like they just survived a fucking

749
00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:08.850
hurricane and grabbed whatever they could put on before they walked out.

750
00:43:08.851 --> 00:43:12.450
Honestly,
one of the most depressing fan bases I've ever seen in my fucking life.

751
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:17.460
The Miami Dolphin fans.
Then you go to the Miami Hurricane Fsu game,

752
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.290
completely night and day.

753
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.780
Unbelievably festive fucking atmosphere.
Bunch of young people,

754
00:43:24.781 --> 00:43:28.920
they get their lives ahead of them.
All right,
good looking people.

755
00:43:28.921 --> 00:43:33.830
It was just a great,
that college football spirit,
people singing songs,

756
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.860
doing the chin.
It was fucking awesome.
And,
um,
I dunno,

757
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.770
I started with the whiskeys and I just kept going.
And,
uh,

758
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.800
Jesus Christ,
dude,
I don't know what happens to me.

759
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.910
I don't even like the hurricanes,
but I get when I go to these games every year,

760
00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:53.850
I root for the fucking home team and they've yet to win.

761
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.880
All right.
I went to a and M Alabama law last year

762
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.040
in college station,
Alabama wins

763
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.260
the year before that,
Lsu,
Alabama

764
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.860
in Baton Rouge,
Alabama wins year before that I went to fucking Texas,
Oklahoma,

765
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.050
the Red River game.
I know that they play at the cotton bowl neutral site,

766
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:22.490
but it's in Texas,
Oklahoma wins.
And now this year,

767
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:28.150
Miami hurricanes in Miami and Fsu wins [inaudible] amount of fucking Fsu fans

768
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:31.860
that I fucking was given shit too.
Like I cared.

769
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:37.170
I didn't even care as they were doing that Tomahawk Chop.
Whoa.

770
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.850
I was singing at the top of my lungs aside,

771
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.820
you fat.
Fuck it was fucking brutal.

772
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.720
Made a complete spectacle of myself,
you know,

773
00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:52.500
and the hurricanes came out just fucking killing them in the first half.

774
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:56.340
And he just knew you saw it,
you saw it,
you just saw it.
Too much time left.

775
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.600
They had to come out and score and they fucking didn't.

776
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:04.610
Their field goal kicker missed an extra point and a fucking field goal.

777
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.890
And I keep living in adversity shit cause he wants to get rid of the extra
point.

778
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.780
Did it fucking 99% of them the mic.
Yeah.

779
00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:16.640
There's that 1% that adds the goddamn drama.
So anyways,
um,

780
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.060
I apologize to anybody who saw me at that game.
And uh,
once again,

781
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.320
I'm on the wagon.

782
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.910
I still had like five Cuban cigars left and I just left him at the house.

783
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:30.540
I just said I got to walk away from that habit.
Um,

784
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.590
and I'm not going to drink or smoke until a new year's day one,

785
00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:40.020
I'm at the Rose Bowl and then I'll make another spectacle.
And Myself,
I guess,

786
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:43.830
you know,
some that guy earlier when he was trying to say that,
uh,
you know,

787
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:47.490
when I was telling him I just had a certain level of notoriety,
um,

788
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.380
I am right about that because my behavior at these football games,

789
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:55.810
the fact that there's no cell phone video of it,
um,

790
00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.000
let you know where I'm at in this,
this,
this business of show.

791
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.090
Um,
all right,
let's read some of this stuff.
Oh Man.
Hey,

792
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:10.140
did anybody watch real sports with Bryant Gumbel this week and see,

793
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.970
saw the absolute genius Joe Rogan,

794
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:14.690
one of my favorite comics of all time was on there.
Um,

795
00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.110
I didn't even know what he was on there.

796
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.560
And then we'll talking about a city people who are going out and hunting their

797
00:46:21.931 --> 00:46:26.640
own meat,
you know,
killing deer and wild pigs in shit.

798
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.490
Um,
so this is a little suffering as possible,

799
00:46:29.491 --> 00:46:34.020
so there's no drugs or that type of thing.
Hopefully,
you know,

800
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.220
um,
really,
really interesting thing.
And I wanted,

801
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.100
they were watching them slaughter in the cows and the pigs and all,

802
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:44.970
and the chickens and shit.
Every time I see that,
I always think,
man,
I,
I can't,

803
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:46.080
I can't be a part of that.

804
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.320
I got to learn how to be a fucking vegetarian or,
or find out where the fucking,

805
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.440
you know,
the one where they just wa I dunno.
It's just fucking awful.

806
00:46:58.890 --> 00:46:59.460
<v 3>Okay.</v>

807
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.390
<v 1>Fucking awful.
I mean,
but then it's weird like,
you know,
out in the wild,</v>

808
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:06.870
they all die fucking horrific deaths as all the wilderness is.

809
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.990
It's just murder going on all the fucking time out there.

810
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

811
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.790
<v 1>I Dunno,
but there's gotta be a better fucking way.</v>

812
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:16.930
I hate when they sit there and then,
I don't know,

813
00:47:16.931 --> 00:47:19.500
there's just something about it.
I Dunno.
I like animals,

814
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.940
but also like a good steak,
you know?
Maybe you know what I'll do.

815
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.510
I'll sell fucking knock it down.
The consumption of it a lot.

816
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.010
I don't know why it's fucking bad.

817
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:32.980
I am actually excited that watching Bryant Gumbel in them and they're talking

818
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:33.814
about,

819
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.350
they really openly talking about all the shit that's in food now and what the

820
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:41.440
fuck they doing to animals because the food lobby was so strong.

821
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:42.910
They actually had a thing where they,

822
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.880
it was actually illegal to even say what was in the food.

823
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:46.950
<v 3>Okay?</v>

824
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.730
<v 1>That's what kills me is what fucking sitting here going over to the Middle East,</v>

825
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:55.020
fucking with these little pussy ass terrorist groups that have maybe 30,000

826
00:47:55.021 --> 00:47:59.040
fucking members.
Isis,
let me tell you something,
right?

827
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.280
I would love to see isis attack Alabama and see how far is sure they could get

828
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:09.120
with their complete lack of planes and boats and all of this shit to fucking sit

829
00:48:09.121 --> 00:48:13.170
there and act like these concert or any sort of a threat to us over here.

830
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:18.330
It's so fucking ridiculous and meanwhile you've got these people poisoning the

831
00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:23.180
food supply.
That's not an act of terrorism.
It's fucking,
I don't know.

832
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.790
I'm on my soapbox now,
mom.
I fucking soapbox.

833
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.583
<v 3>Okay.</v>

834
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.270
<v 1>It's dumb.</v>

835
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:34.270
[inaudible] I could end the fucking terrorist groups over and fucking the Middle

836
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.480
East without firing a fucking shot.

837
00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:43.810
All you do is just gradually get us on to electric and solar power over here.

838
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.700
Now granted,
this takes everybody following along and buying into it,
all right?

839
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.550
You know these Tesla cars and all that type of shit,

840
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.160
they don't need any fucking oil.

841
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.650
And then you just drill foil over here.
But whatever oil do you need,

842
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:06.310
you just gradually wean yourself off like Brazil did.

843
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:07.540
<v 3>Okay.</v>

844
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.300
<v 1>Brazil did the same thing.
They don't have to give them any money.</v>

845
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:15.100
And then what happens is they'll just go bankrupt all the money.

846
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.420
How do you think terrorists get fucking money?
They get,
they get money.

847
00:49:18.421 --> 00:49:22.390
It's oil money that they fucking send it through the mosque through donations to

848
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:26.230
the religion and then they fucking break 'em off some.
It's a fucking joke.

849
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.640
So if we're not buying their oil,
they don't have any fucking money.

850
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.670
And then they go bankrupt and then you know what?

851
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.280
Then they got to go out and get a real fucking job and then that's it.

852
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:37.900
And then you know something,
we're also not over.

853
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:41.710
They're accidentally killing the wrong fucking people breeding more fucking

854
00:49:41.711 --> 00:49:44.590
terrorists will be simple as shit.
Right.

855
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.950
Then maybe we come over here and focus on these carts that are feeding cows to

856
00:49:48.951 --> 00:49:53.300
other cows.
Right.
When that makes sense.
Yeah.
You can have do it.

857
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.970
All he had to do is go to the Miami Dolphin game and look at the looks on the

858
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:57.020
fucking people's faces.

859
00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:01.340
There's no way you could ever get that across to people because there's too much

860
00:50:01.341 --> 00:50:04.400
money on the other side lying to people.
And they would just fucking buy into it.

861
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.410
And I know I completely oversimplified it,

862
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.280
but the biggest point in that all of that is Brazil did that.

863
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.150
Brazil does,
what do they go?
What do they run it on?
Cane sugar or whatever.

864
00:50:15.151 --> 00:50:18.510
They just fucking used their own natural fucking resource over there and you

865
00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:23.100
know what the hell they run their cars on.
Um,
but I read it at one point.

866
00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:28.120
All right.
So anyways,
um,
Joe on there and there,

867
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.190
they're showing him a going out hunting and uh,

868
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.820
and these other people and it looked really,
uh,
I don't know.

869
00:50:35.821 --> 00:50:40.500
It was really fucking amazing.
Um,
the see that type of angle.
I mean,

870
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.610
if you've got the fucking time and the money to go boar hunting,

871
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:48.280
I dunno.
It was interesting to me.

872
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.980
I just looked completely lost my train of thought as I'm sitting here looking at

873
00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:54.820
this.
Oh,
I got to correct something that I said wrong on the Joe Perry podcast.

874
00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.270
I thought the Paradise Club clothes like 20 years ago,

875
00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.160
I actually fucked up what it was,

876
00:51:00.161 --> 00:51:05.080
was they used to do these to do the WBCN um,
comedy riot there,

877
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:10.310
which was for the best up and coming comedian.
And um,

878
00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.470
they stopped doing it there and then they started doing it.
It stitches,

879
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:18.160
stitches closed.
So I think that that's what I was thinking about.

880
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:21.400
I tried to say the Paradise Club closed and a,
it did not.

881
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.970
That's the same club that you two and the police is some really big bands and

882
00:51:24.971 --> 00:51:27.550
what some of their first live gigs in the states.
They came over here.
Yeah.

883
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.330
Played.
And uh,
there we go.

884
00:51:31.331 --> 00:51:33.380
Let's get into some more of the questions that this week.
Oh wait,

885
00:51:33.381 --> 00:51:35.410
I got to read a couple more advertising things here.

886
00:51:35.411 --> 00:51:38.790
We'll fucking blow through this year.
Um,

887
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.710
dollar shave club,
everybody,
big shape companies think,

888
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.550
must think we're a bunch of scumbag criminal swales.

889
00:51:45.551 --> 00:51:50.080
Do they lock their razors up in that maximum security plastic razor fortress in

890
00:51:50.081 --> 00:51:52.240
the shaving aisle?
Uh,

891
00:51:52.241 --> 00:51:55.480
you have to stand around like a convict waiting for the guy to come and unlock

892
00:51:55.481 --> 00:51:59.710
the razor case.
Do they think you're some kind of a jewel thief?
Next thing.

893
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.260
Oh.
Oh God.
Yeah.
God,

894
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.290
that's my fucking,
I didn't want to deal with that guy.
Yeah.
Below.

895
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.340
We found some more shit downstairs.
It's going to cost more fucking money.
Um,

896
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.340
you have to stand around like a convict waiting for the,

897
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.990
the guy to come unlock the razor case.

898
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.940
Do they think just some kind of a jewel thief?

899
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.020
Next thing there'll be a security guard who tasers you.

900
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.820
If you get too close to the razors,

901
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.360
you're not a criminal and you shouldn't get treated like one just because you

902
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:31.880
need a pack of razors.
Um,

903
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:35.510
if you're sick of getting humiliated every time you need razors,

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:45.914
wild bill.

942
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.790
Contrary to popular belief to Paradise Rock Club is still alive and well.

943
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:53.180
I'm only 21,
so I wasn't alive for the golden age of music,

944
00:54:53.181 --> 00:54:55.640
but I've seen some good shit there.
Uh,

945
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.120
have you ever gone to see a band at a small venue than ended up being huge

946
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.920
anyways?
Love your show.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Did I ever see um,

947
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.100
no.
Jesus Christ fucking cigars?
No.
No it didn't.

948
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:16.330
Um,
no I didn't.
I have seen people that are now dead though.

949
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:20.410
You know,
um,
who died tragically,
I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan.

950
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.380
Um,
and then I've seen,
you know,

951
00:55:23.381 --> 00:55:27.700
some of those heavy metals shows where guys live the life and died too young.

952
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.120
Uh,
but as far as that other stuff,
no,
I,
I,
no,
I haven't,

953
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.360
I would never went to the small venues.
I was really mainstream Billy back then.

954
00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.300
I was listening to hair metal.
I mean,
what do you want from me?
All right.

955
00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:42.770
Home purchase situation.
Billy,
my girlfriend and I just purchased our first home.

956
00:55:42.771 --> 00:55:45.530
Congratulations.
I hope you don't run into the problems that I've run into.

957
00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.460
He said,
I'm brand new from a builder.

958
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.350
During the upgrade selection session,
our sales woman was aloof,

959
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:59.600
dropping tiles,
dropping her computer,
slurring,
et cetera.

960
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:04.010
She didn't give any firm prices and wouldn't provide a written price list of

961
00:56:04.011 --> 00:56:07.640
optional upgrades.
Oo,
that's all.
It's all a major red flag.

962
00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.220
She's on some sort of drugs.

963
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.210
She's aloof and she's not giving you the information you need to make an

964
00:56:14.211 --> 00:56:18.080
intelligent decision.
I hate this.
I hate how this is going.
So far.

965
00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.310
After our visit,
we emailed her upgrades that we might be interested in,

966
00:56:22.311 --> 00:56:26.670
but asked her to from prices so we could decide.
Three days pass,

967
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.450
no response.
So we emailed the build a directly to ask for a few,
uh,

968
00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.400
for a new sales rep.
In the email.

969
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:36.930
We of course speculate that she may have been boozing.
Boy,
were we wrong.

970
00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:41.610
He tells us that she is in fact the survivor of a traumatic brain injury.

971
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.390
Even worse,
about a day later,
I get an email to connect with her.

972
00:56:45.391 --> 00:56:49.650
On linkedin and she shares the same last name is the builder.

973
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.573
Oh God.

974
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.860
So basically we called his wife a drunk after something clearly terrible happen.

975
00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:01.110
Is this guy going to build us a piece of Shit House or do you trust that we will

976
00:57:01.111 --> 00:57:05.100
be okay?
Would you wash your hands of this and buy something else?

977
00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.100
Thanks for all that you do and go fuck yourself.

978
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:09.743
<v 2>MMM.</v>

979
00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:15.200
<v 1>I Dunno.
Is He deliberately going to build it like shit and risk getting sued?</v>

980
00:57:15.201 --> 00:57:19.640
Probably not,
but uh,
you know,
uh,

981
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.290
you definitely got to try to clear the air there,
but you know,
I mean,

982
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.440
what the fuck brain injury and not,
I mean,

983
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:28.450
you've got to give us what we're asking for here.

984
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:34.860
Um,
AH,
Jesus.
That's God.
Blimey.
I can't even make any comedy out of that.

985
00:57:34.861 --> 00:57:35.960
That's just fucking tragic.

986
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:37.973
<v 4>Uh,</v>

987
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.170
<v 1>I mean,
yeah,
you could always just,
I mean,
if he hasn't started the job,</v>

988
00:57:44.171 --> 00:57:45.310
you could always move on.

989
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.413
<v 2>MMM.</v>

990
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.990
<v 1>But you know,
they should say so they should fucking say something to you.</v>

991
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.510
Somebody's gonna be slurring and drop and shit on the floor.

992
00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.950
Just give me a heads up.

993
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.290
<v 4>Okay.</v>

994
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.240
<v 1>You know what,
you,
you got a,</v>

995
00:57:59.140 --> 00:57:59.590
<v 4>yeah,</v>

996
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:03.520
<v 1>you got hoodwinked there.
That right there would not hold up in a court of law.</v>

997
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:07.540
What,
what dad?
That was entrapment.
You can't do that to people.
So yeah,

998
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:10.120
I wouldn't feel that.
I mean you feel bad a human to human level,

999
00:58:10.121 --> 00:58:12.640
but don't feel bad like you,
you,
it's like you knew that.

1000
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.900
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1001
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.600
<v 1>You know with all these fucking shows on TV,
but interventions.</v>

1002
00:58:16.601 --> 00:58:21.100
How did you know that she wasn't drunk on the fucking job?
All right,

1003
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:23.320
I got to get running here.
Let me just blow through these last two.

1004
00:58:23.321 --> 00:58:28.150
Transcending meditation.
Dare Bill Bergen stock.
Loved the show.
What?
Blah,

1005
00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:30.490
blah,
blah.
Um,
I want,

1006
00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:33.760
wanted to hear your opinion pinion on something called transcendence,

1007
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:38.620
trans transcendental meditation.
I can't even say it.

1008
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:41.080
I don't know what that is.
Is that the one where you,
you're laying on the floor,

1009
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:44.230
but you flew up.
Feel like you've floated out of the room.
Very quick story.

1010
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:45.880
I'm 21 year old film store,

1011
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.290
a student and I fell in love with David Lynch films ever since I found out about

1012
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.340
them six months ago.
I've always wanted to make stories like this,

1013
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:56.710
but never found that creative spark.

1014
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.750
I looked up more about him and found out it was a big advocate.
Advocate of TM.

1015
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:03.250
Thank you for abbreviating that.

1016
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.180
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1017
00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:09.800
<v 1>Transcendental,
transcendental meditation.
Actually,
in fact,</v>

1018
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.240
he created a whole organization dedicated to teaching poverty schools,

1019
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:15.140
uh,

1020
00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:20.140
TM and also claims most of his creativity to it sounds pretty good so far.

1021
00:59:20.511 --> 00:59:23.770
I really believe that meditation can benefit people very much.
However,

1022
00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:27.670
here is where it starts to sound odd.
In order to learn TM,

1023
00:59:27.671 --> 00:59:32.671
you must have a certified TM instructor teach you how to do it over a week for

1024
00:59:32.711 --> 00:59:34.300
around 1500 bucks.

1025
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.290
They say you need an instructor because he gives you a personal mantra,

1026
00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.620
which is the core of t m I'm very concerned.

1027
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.050
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:45.180
<v 1>I'm very conflicted about TM because on one hand,</v>

1029
00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:49.950
many people I look up to and respect,
support TM such as Jerry Seinfeld,

1030
00:59:49.951 --> 00:59:54.150
Martin Scorsese,
Clint Eastwood,
and a ton more,
uh,

1031
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:58.290
celebrity TM list.
However,
on the other hand,

1032
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:02.820
something doesn't feel right about charging $1,500 for something that they claim

1033
01:00:02.821 --> 01:00:06.300
is very simple to understand.
If it was so helpful and simple,

1034
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:09.390
why don't they just make a youtube tutorial about it?

1035
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:14.730
Somebody probably did is a lot more that I left out because I didn't want to

1036
01:00:14.731 --> 01:00:19.650
bore anyone not interested.
A TM counter argument,

1037
01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:23.460
TM benefits.
Just wanted to hear your op,
uh,
your your option.

1038
01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.330
Have a blessed day and go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
I mean I would just go on youtube.

1039
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:29.640
I would learn how to do it,
you know,

1040
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.440
I used to actually be able to meditate,
you know,

1041
01:00:34.441 --> 01:00:37.830
and get that feeling where I felt like,
you know,

1042
01:00:37.831 --> 01:00:41.370
as I was laying on the floor and just picture my stomach going up and down,

1043
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.510
focusing on the breath,

1044
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.050
all of a sudden my stomach would feel like it was like 30 feet away from my head

1045
01:00:46.051 --> 01:00:49.410
all of a sudden.
And I felt like I was floating in my head and it was awesome.

1046
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:54.900
And then somewhere along the line as I was meditating,

1047
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.590
I would start to get to that place and I would be started to think like,
oh good,

1048
01:00:58.591 --> 01:01:01.770
it's happening here.
Here we go.
I'm going to start feeling like I'm floating.

1049
01:01:01.771 --> 01:01:04.620
And then it makes it go away.
And,
uh,

1050
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.950
I haven't been able to get past that block cause you have to not give a shit

1051
01:01:07.951 --> 01:01:10.650
cause it got really fucking frustrating.
So,
um,

1052
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:17.890
you know,
um,
I would,
I dunno,

1053
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.350
I would just keep talking about it to people and eventually you'll,

1054
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.140
you'll fucking meet somebody and they could give you some tips,
you know?

1055
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:25.960
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1056
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.670
<v 1>Mega teach you how to do some shit.</v>

1057
01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:31.240
I don't think you need to pay $1,500 to learn how to meditate.

1058
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.070
I would imagine that this is something that throughout I,

1059
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.050
it's not something we learned how to do within the last 20 years.

1060
01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.080
This would probably have been done for centuries and parents probably just

1061
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:48.680
taught it to their kids.
So I don't think that you need something like that.
Um,

1062
01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.770
I bet this,
there's gotta be another way to do it.
All right.

1063
01:01:50.771 --> 01:01:55.330
I gotta wrap this thing up.
Uh,
all right.
Real quick.
Got kicked out of Mcdonald's.

1064
01:01:55.331 --> 01:01:57.910
Drive Thru.
Dear Billy red ticks this past,

1065
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:04.270
this past week,
four of my friends came over to my house to drink some beers.

1066
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.710
Uh,
well we got drunk and like most drunk people,
we started that we were hungry.

1067
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:13.690
So we asked our sober friend Bull Shit,
you did a don't drink and drive.
Fuck you.

1068
01:02:13.691 --> 01:02:17.050
Y'all jumped in the car,
hammered.
Uh,
if he can take us to Mcdonald's,

1069
01:02:17.051 --> 01:02:19.060
we hopped in his car and get to the drive through a,

1070
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.270
welcomes us and asked for our order.

1071
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.050
My F my other friend being drunk in the back seat said,
dude,

1072
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.900
you should get a number.
I sober friend who was driving,

1073
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:30.630
asked the girl working the drive through if he could get her number.

1074
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:33.990
Now keep in mind that we don't even know what this lady looks like.

1075
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.640
Immediately the lady flips out and says,

1076
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:38.670
if you're going to do that then you should just leave after that.

1077
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:43.671
She said that all of us in the car start after she said that all of us in the

1078
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:47.710
car start pleading,
telling her we just want some mic chickens.
Uh,

1079
01:02:47.711 --> 01:02:50.490
she is still not having it and it says that we need to leave.

1080
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.760
We leave and ended up going to Jack in the box.
So my question for you is,

1081
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:58.680
did we deserve to get kicked out or was it a cunt move from this girl.
Thanks.

1082
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:01.680
And Go fuck yourself.
Well,
I wasn't there so I didn't hear how you asked.

1083
01:03:01.681 --> 01:03:04.980
But the way that you guys tell the story,
no you shouldn't have.

1084
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.400
But um,
you know,

1085
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:12.180
we live in a world right now where anything,

1086
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.200
anything that a man does in the direction of a woman is some sort of a sexist

1087
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:24.750
thing.
Rape.
Um,
no more.
It's just,
I mean,

1088
01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:29.040
I dunno why.
I Dunno.
Like the last year and a half,

1089
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:32.170
all of a sudden it's just like you just sitting at home and a,

1090
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.440
as a guy at this point,
at least I do.
It's like,

1091
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.380
do we do anything right ladies?

1092
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:42.300
Is there anything that we do that doesn't make you feel like a second class

1093
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:46.290
citizen that could be violated physically or sexually?

1094
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.400
You know,
there's a bunch of sweetheart guys out there.
You wouldn't know it.

1095
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:55.500
You wouldn't know it by watching these fucking Goddamn fucking they,

1096
01:03:55.690 --> 01:04:00.690
they drive me nuts after a while after like the 2000 commercial them talking

1097
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:05.010
about how difficult it is for them to do something because they have a vagina.

1098
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:07.650
You just want to be like duty.
Do you think my life's a cakewalk?

1099
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.570
Is that what you think it is?

1100
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:15.330
That's like sort of the whole basis behind so much of that complaining.

1101
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:16.381
You know,

1102
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:20.460
my life is harder than yours and despite the fact I've never been you and

1103
01:04:20.461 --> 01:04:24.870
attempted to achieve something,
I somehow know exactly how easy your life is.

1104
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.420
Even though if you ever tried to,
to,

1105
01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:31.140
to suggest that you realized anything about my life,

1106
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:34.650
I would flip out on you for speaking for me as a woman.

1107
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:37.170
But I will speak for you as a man all fucking day long.

1108
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.180
It's all a bunch of fucking horse shit.
All right.

1109
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.300
You know they should make the same amount an hour.

1110
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.660
And you know the amount of people actually out there hitting women,

1111
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.860
I mean the fucking commercials on that.
You would think that it was fucking,

1112
01:04:49.861 --> 01:04:53.640
you'd walk down the street and it's just women land littering the fucking

1113
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.730
sidewalk from getting dropped.
You know what I mean?

1114
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:01.590
And then what's funny is the fucking guys who actually,
you know,

1115
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.320
tried to cover it up or now yelling at people like me who don't do it with their

1116
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:11.820
commercial,
trying to get the dirt off of them.
I,
I've had it,

1117
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:15.630
I've fucking had it with all of them even.
And I hate,
I'll fucking,

1118
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:19.140
sports is just becoming like this for your cause.

1119
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1120
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 1>They're not even sports fans.</v>

1121
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:24.670
He's fucking people who aren't sports fans going in with their fucking,

1122
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.211
because you know,

1123
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:28.300
those stand up for cancer things that they were doing during the world series.

1124
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.100
I have friends who die of cancer,

1125
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:34.210
but I would never fucking do that to somebody in the middle of a baseball game.

1126
01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:37.570
Or are you going to a movie and just tap somebody on the shoulder?
Hey,

1127
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.310
hit pause in the movie eight.
By the way,

1128
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:41.980
just let you know there's people suffering from cancer and a good friend of mine

1129
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:44.950
died of cancer and by the end of it I could picked him off the bed sheet with

1130
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:47.620
two fingers.
All right.
Go back to the movie and enjoy yourself.

1131
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:52.360
I think it's unbelievably intrusive and it's fucking rude,
you know what I mean?

1132
01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:57.810
I don't know.
That's just my fucking thought.
All right,
everybody knows this.

1133
01:05:57.811 --> 01:06:00.810
Cancer.
Everybody knows it's awful and everybody's fucking giving money to it.

1134
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.650
All right?
Again,
not getting enough fucking money.
And this is what kills me.

1135
01:06:04.651 --> 01:06:07.110
So many of those fucking groups will you give him the money,

1136
01:06:07.111 --> 01:06:10.920
the amount of money that actually goes to the people with,
with uh,
cancer,

1137
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:13.680
the amount of money that actually goes to the women that are being beaten.

1138
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:17.070
The actual money that actually trickles down after you get through that fucking

1139
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:22.800
Mesh corporate fucking structure is a joke.
And I'm telling you,

1140
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:26.660
the NFL with that pink lady,
they were about ready to get busted.

1141
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.430
If you notice there was way less pink this year.

1142
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.330
And you know that wasn't because fans were bitching cause they don't give a fuck

1143
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:34.920
cause they're all about the fucking bottom line.

1144
01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:38.090
I'm telling you this shit was about ready to hit the fan and they're going to

1145
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.810
slowly walk away from each other and I guarantee you in 10 years,
seven,
10 years,

1146
01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:47.340
the real story will come out.
The NFL will pay a little bit of a fine,

1147
01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:50.640
but most people who perpetrated the fine will not be there anymore.

1148
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:54.030
And they'll just be like,
well you know,
we're looking into that.

1149
01:06:54.031 --> 01:06:58.560
That was definitely something we wished didn't happen.
Um,
all right,

1150
01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:01.350
that's my negative shift for this fucking week.
All right,
that's the podcast.

1151
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.670
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
And uh,

1152
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:10.720
oh dude,
I didn't even bring up the Bruins dude.
I just didn't have the time.

1153
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:14.060
This week to fucking brutal loss is five to one against a maple leafs.

1154
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.590
Five to one against the Canadians.
Canadians rolling along looking good.

1155
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.880
We got back on track beat and the hurricanes.
Yeah,

1156
01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.030
that was definitely a bad fucking week.
So whatever,
it's still only November.

1157
01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:30.590
What are you going to do?
But,
um,
I dunno.
Canadians are looking good man.

1158
01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.590
I hate to Canadians so much.
I actually follow them on my phone.

1159
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:36.800
I actually have their app just so I can keep up to see if they're winning or

1160
01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:40.070
losing and just sit there rooting against them.
It's fucking hilarious.

1161
01:07:40.071 --> 01:07:43.310
I'm rooting against him and they're leaving me texts.
Like,
second period,

1162
01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:47.210
we're up to one go habs go.
And I'm like,
fuck dude.
To my phone.

1163
01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.570
That's not that bad.
But you know what I mean.
All right,
that's it.

1164
01:07:50.571 --> 01:07:52.130
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
