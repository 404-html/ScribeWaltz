1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.530
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.493
<v 2>What's going on?</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.940
<v 1>You'd spill burn.
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.550
August 22nd,
2016 what's going on?
I why?

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.270
Yeah,
Nigga.
What's going on with the ashes on these fucking divers?

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.770
What?
You got it on fucking TV?
I'm supposed to ignore that.

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.270
There's no reason the suits have to be cut like that,
so obviously I made that.

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.950
They want to show their answers.
Huh?
Maybe it creates less of a splash.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.570
If the bottom of your bathing suit as up over your ass cheek.
I have no idea.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.400
Is this synchronized diving?

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.410
Did I ever tell you how much I don't like synchronize shit,
man.

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.410
Synchronized swimming is both unbelievably difficult and the stupidest fucking

13
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.010
thing.
Human beings a engaging.

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.400
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.260
<v 1>Let me come up out of the water and they do the dumb shit and they got the song</v>

16
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:05.000
playing.
Is that athletic?
Sure.
I mean,
yeah.

17
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.600
I mean then dancing is athletic,
right?
Which I would agree with,

18
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.200
but it's not a sport.
You have to be in the water.
It's dancing in the water.

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.160
You run the Water Olympics.
The Olympic Committee has a sign that it's a sport.

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.760
Yeah.
But they've also gotten rid of like baseball and shit.
You know,

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.990
they've taken actual sports in.
They've been like,
yeah,
no,

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.470
but then all of a sudden you,
you,
you show up and uh,

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.220
you and your friend get in the water and you're like five,
six,
seven,
eight,

24
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.150
Charleston,
Charleston.
Right.

25
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.740
<v 2>Ooh,
boo boo.</v>

26
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.580
<v 1>Right.
And all of a sudden that's a sport.</v>

27
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.670
You can have your fucking headphones off.
Honestly,
this whole thing.

28
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.040
And then on the buckets,
you're not on the podcast,
so you're not participating.

29
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.350
So all those other times when you wanted to participate,

30
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.410
you want to talk Conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz,
you didn't see him.

31
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.200
We both didn't see it.
You know why?

32
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.020
Because we try to be honest when it comes to downloading shit.
Yeah.
We were here,

33
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.790
uh,
say night.

34
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.120
The fucking fight didn't first of all come on until like four in the morning or

35
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:07.470
something.
Italy time,
three in the morning.
And um,

36
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.340
I actually searched how to legally watch the UFC on the internet.

37
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.150
And for,
for the life of me,
I couldn't find a place.

38
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.470
God knows there was 58 websites telling me how to do it illegally.

39
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.300
I couldn't do that.
Right.

40
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440
<v 1>What kind of an asshole when I be shitting on people for downloading my specials</v>

42
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:33.210
for free.
And then I watched Conor McGregor first,
Nate Diaz for free.

43
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.160
Um,
so I've taped the fight,
but of course I went online and I had to see,

44
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.390
I had to find out who won.
So congratulations to Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz.

45
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:46.440
Cause I heard it was one of the,
uh,
one of the best UFC fights ever.

46
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.580
Five fucking rounds.
And,
um,

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.070
this is the conspiracy theories and theorists in me.
Um,

48
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.310
you knew that if it was going to the judge's Conor McGregor was going to win.

49
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.490
Okay?
And I'm not shitting on Conor.
I'm not shitting on it.

50
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.670
I'm just saying at the end of the fucking day,

51
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.490
all right,
UFC is show business,
all right?

52
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.860
And there's no fucking way that after you made back to the future part one and

53
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:21.130
back to the future,
part two and you see the ticket sales,

54
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.220
you know everybody's going to pay a ticket to back to the future part three.

55
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.293
However,

56
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.750
nobody's going to fucking watch it if McFly wins the first fucking two times.

57
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.280
Although we did didn't Ania did Marty McFly when the,

58
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.870
they all have happy endings,
right?

59
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.871
There's no empire strikes back in the back to the future.

60
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.183
Nia,

61
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
Nia does take you off your headphones.
If you gotta be in the room,

62
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:55.090
I'm going to interact with you.
Yes.
So is this,

63
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.820
Marty McFly wins all of the back to the futures,
right?

64
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.840
There's no empire strikes back one where the,
where the,
the uh,

65
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.550
hello McFly guy.
The guy knocks on his head,
comes back and no.

66
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:10.630
Does he ever win one?
No.
To justify part three.

67
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.190
I don't know.
Was that the one with the,
that was the western?
Yeah.

68
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.030
All I'm saying isn't it?
You knew,
okay.
If it went to the judges,

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.290
they got to give it to Conor McGregor so they can justify fucking part three.

70
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.720
Because if Nate,
when's the first two?
What the fuck?

71
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.490
Then Connor fights him again and then goes one and two.

72
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.030
Nate's still wins two out of three,
right?
Sure.
Yeah,
exactly.

73
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.340
Boy,
you go see you agree with me every once in a while.
Oh yeah.
Oh Jesus.

74
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.510
Um,
what does that have to do?

75
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.430
And actually the future is far as like,

76
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.300
<v 0>yeah,</v>

77
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.080
<v 1>if I was watching the fight and it went to the cards and went to the judges,</v>

78
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:53.630
I'm sorry.
Okay.
And it was going to be a decision.

79
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.180
You have to think that they're going to give it to Connor,

80
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.750
so then it's one to one,
so then they can fucking make more money on part three.

81
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.700
Right.
Oh,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
All right.

82
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.190
I'm going to be,
I'm being a Douche right now cause I didn't see the fight.

83
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.410
I'm not trying to take anything away from Conor Mcgregor.

84
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.480
How great was that press conference,
by the way?
Did you watch it?
No.
Uh,

85
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.590
I love the press conference.
First of all,
Nate Diaz,

86
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.700
one of the great fucking people ever in,
in a,
in a press conference.

87
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.520
I love that dude does not suffer fools.

88
00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:28.820
And if you don't fight for a fucking living and you ask a dumb question,

89
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.980
he's not going to energy his way through it.

90
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:33.170
He's just going to let the question fucking die.

91
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.380
Like when they asked those dumb questions going on.
Right.

92
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.810
<v 3>You all,
we've been hearing things [inaudible] is going to be,</v>

93
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.430
<v 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 3>try to keep it standing up.
Whoa.
What do you think about it?</v>

95
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.730
<v 1>Just pauses and goes,
well,
you know,
we'll uh,</v>

96
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.790
we'll see when the fight happens and then that's it.

97
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.590
I love that he does that to people.

98
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.260
And I also hate the fact that was talking to this about the other night that

99
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.590
people think Nate Diaz,

100
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.880
there's like something wrong with them or that he's dumb or anything like that.

101
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.180
Like that you could achieve,

102
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.320
you could become a champion and be stupid and people think it's all like fucking

103
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.750
natural ability.
You don't want to do any,

104
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.750
I'm going to stop talking to you because I can clearly see they're looking at
me.

105
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.750
You just put your sunglasses on.
It's the last day of her vacation.

106
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.540
You want to go outside.
All right,
I'll see you later.
Um,

107
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.280
he also,
he also got busted smoking weed through a vaporizer Assam ship.

108
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.600
It isn't after he just went through all the,
the,

109
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.310
that level of physical trauma,
you know what I mean?

110
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.000
That's probably the best thing he could've done.
Right.

111
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.930
All right.
Do you need any help with that?
Nia?

112
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.810
Opening the door there because if you're going to leave,

113
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:49.580
I'd appreciate it if you'd do it now.
Oh,
Jesus.
Hey,
yeah,
go.

114
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.120
Yeah,
you've got to watch out for the,
uh,
for the curtain rod there

115
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.490
and it's threatening manner.
Cause I felt like somebody hit me with a club.

116
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.040
Oh,
oh my God.
The other night.
Let's stay focused here.

117
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.520
So Jesus,
Nia,

118
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.790
um,
all these people that think Nate Diaz is dumb.

119
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.180
You think I love how I hit my head and you laughed at me after I get done saying

120
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.420
that Nate Diaz is not fucking dumb.
I hate people keep saying that.

121
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.340
The guy is fucking hilarious.

122
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.420
He's one of the greatest fighters of all fucking time.

123
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.260
You don't become a champion.
Just,
you know what it is.
There's two types of smart.

124
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.690
Okay.
You got like book smart,

125
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:45.650
which is respected and then you've got other people that are that fucking tap

126
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:50.060
into the matrix and they could feel vibes and they have instinct and all that,

127
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:54.140
and those fucking nerds who write all the newspapers.
Who are the journalists?

128
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:58.250
Those unathletic cons.
They're the ones who sit there.
They can't read anybody.

129
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.450
They'll walk up to a fucking serial killer and have no idea they were about

130
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:05.980
ready to get the old fucking right there.
Fred get thrown into a trunk.
Right?
Huh?

131
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.190
I know that killed me.
That was that.
Yeah.
All my life,

132
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:15.191
I've seen amazing champions get labeled as that by fucking nerds who would

133
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:23.240
strike out playing fucking kickball because they don't understand.

134
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.140
They don't understand.
They just don't fucking get it.
You know what I mean?

135
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.400
I swear to God.
This is why I respect all professional fighters.

136
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.390
As I've said this before,

137
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.990
you could literally tell a toddler what punch to throw at me.

138
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.650
You could then tell me what punched the toddler was going to throw me and I

139
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.620
still couldn't slip it.
I still,
I don't get where you look.

140
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.730
I don't know how the fuck you tell.
It's common.
The hand is quicker than the I.

141
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.560
My head is the size of a Macy's Day fucking float.
I get hit every fucking time.

142
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.260
Every fucking time.
I remember growing up,

143
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.130
like they used to think Henderson was dumb

144
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.230
<v 4>because he had a couple of crazy fucking stories.</v>

145
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.920
He spoke about himself in the third person.
Oh,
by the way,

146
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.420
he had more lead off home runs than anybody in the history of baseball.

147
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.200
More stolen bases than anybody in the history of the baseball.

148
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.210
The baseball of baseball,
sorry,
had a couple of fucking drinks or eight today.
Um,

149
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.790
<v 5>okay.</v>

150
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.990
<v 4>To the ability to lead off a first at a professional level,
read the Pitcher,</v>

151
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.000
figure out his corpse is,
tell his timing,
whatever,

152
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.660
and decide when he's going to the plate and when he isn't with a national

153
00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:32.270
audience.
Millions of people are watching during the fucking world series to,

154
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.570
to think that somebody can do that and they just think like,
oh,

155
00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:36.340
it's just instinct.
He's just born that way.

156
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.300
Like it's the same way people look at fucking,
I dunno,

157
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.990
anything they don't understand,
they just try to overly simplify it.
Um,

158
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.910
I fucking love the press conference that Nate Diaz had and that Conor McGregor

159
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:54.650
had both of their styles.
Conor McGregor obviously showing up late on purpose,

160
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.610
trying to do some psych out thing.
And then Nate's like,
I,

161
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.170
you're going to show up late and I'm going to leave early.

162
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.690
I already answered my questions.
Go Fuck Yourself.

163
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.930
Then they start throwing water bottles of water at each other.

164
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.170
All that was doing was selling the last fucking whatever fucking 10 million pay

165
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:16.280
per views that they needed.
It was perfect.
Both of them did a great fucking job.

166
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:18.160
I'm going to actually going to watch it when I get back

167
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.123
<v 5>on a,</v>

168
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.830
<v 4>I fly back tomorrow.
It's the end of the vacation,
right?</v>

169
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.733
<v 5>MMM.</v>

170
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.790
<v 4>I can't wait to watch it,</v>

171
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.380
<v 5>but uh,</v>

172
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.550
<v 4>I'm actually,
I'm this vacation.
Yeah.
But so fucking amazing.</v>

173
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:35.810
But I'm ready to go back.
I was ready to go back two days ago.
Um,
you know,

174
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.560
there is a point when you're on vacation where you got to take off the Mickey

175
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:43.640
mouse ears and be like,
alright,
I need to function as a fucking human,

176
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.250
a productive human being again.

177
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.233
<v 5>MMM.</v>

178
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.940
<v 4>I gotta tell you man,
the greatest fucking time I've had in a while.</v>

179
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.703
<v 5>MMM.</v>

180
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.520
<v 4>The Amalfi coast,
I'm telling you,
it's touristy is shit.
It's fucking,</v>

181
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:04.080
there's a lot of bad food for Italy here because it's so fucking touristy.

182
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.720
But if you go on the Internet and you talked to some people,

183
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:11.310
you find the good places,
but I have to tell you,
as far as scenery goes,

184
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.610
it's,
um,
it doesn't even look real.

185
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.030
<v 5>And um,</v>

186
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.740
<v 4>the other day we took a boat out to the island of Capri</v>

187
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.740
<v 5>and uh,
I dunno,</v>

188
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.530
<v 4>they pulled the boat over,
they let us swim in the Mediterranean.</v>

189
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.740
Obviously something I'm terrified to do cause I'm afraid of sharks.

190
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:34.010
But I finally believed them that there was no sharks.

191
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.570
I had my swimming goggles every five seconds I would look underneath to see if

192
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:43.460
there was a shark.
There is,
if I,
if I saw one,
I could somehow out swim it.

193
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.500
I just,
that's the part of,

194
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.790
of swimming in a sea or an ocean that I cannot handle.

195
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:54.310
It's my head above the water not seeing what the fuck is at me.
You know,

196
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.050
I reserve the right to at least see the shark coming at me so I can just scream,

197
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.000
you know,
underwater fuck.
You know,
maybe give it a little bit of a fucking,

198
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.050
you know,
a little fist bump,

199
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.450
something to it's fucking knows whatever the hell you supposed to do.

200
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.770
Maybe feed it one arm is they come over the top and smash it with another.

201
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.790
I always felt like that's the move.
Like if an attack dog is coming at you,

202
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.110
you just,
your feed the whatever arm you don't jerk off with and write with,

203
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:21.280
you feed them that arm,

204
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.270
just shove it right back into its fucking molders.

205
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.800
And then you come over the top,

206
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.210
you slammed down on its neck as you fucking lift up its head and you snap it's

207
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:35.080
fucking neck.
You know,
it's just an idea.
People,

208
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:37.720
I don't pretend to understand things.

209
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.860
So speaking of a physical harm,

210
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.480
the lovely Nia,
um,
last night she,

211
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.010
uh,
she,

212
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.600
she like bent down to get something out of her bag and this is little fucking

213
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:57.010
ledge above it that you can stick like a couple of glasses and a bottle of
water.

214
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.680
And she was underneath it,
bent down,

215
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:03.250
came up full speed in the corner of it,

216
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.050
hit the fucking top of,
she hit the top of her head right on the corner of it,

217
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.890
like brutally hard.

218
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.600
And um,
I gotta tell you,

219
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.140
I feel bad that she's not part of this fucking

220
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.690
little story here.

221
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.430
See if I'll bring her in because I failed miserably as a human being.
Yeah.
Nia,

222
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:30.760
do you want to be in on this story of you hitting your head?
Okay.

223
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.620
I okay.
I'm setting it up now.
So anyways,
she fucking hits her head.

224
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.430
I like fucking Bam.
All right.

225
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.670
Sounded like somebody dropped a suitcase on the floor

226
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.820
and then I swear to God,
she hit her head.
She goes,

227
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.950
she grabbed her head and then I swear to God,
she just started crying

228
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.500
like a goddamn toddler.
And I have to be honest with you.

229
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

230
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.350
<v 4>I didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

231
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.350
I just got to the point near where you hit your head and you started crying like

232
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:15.410
a toddler.
That'd be like,

233
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:18.620
it's hard because that's what it reminded me of.
It's like when a little kid,

234
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.280
like if an adult hits there,
you know,
stubs,

235
00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:25.560
their toe hits the for this God damn mother fucker.
Yeah.

236
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:29.540
And you blame your whole family live in Rome,
you know,
that's what you do.

237
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.410
You started crying.
I did.

238
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.640
It was really painful balling.
Yeah.

239
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.860
And I was honest,
Israel myself.
On a scale of one to five,
five being the best,

240
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.540
how would you know know?
How would you rate my reaction to Oh,
zero

241
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.980
weeks I went in and I get you some

242
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.960
<v 6>tissues.
That's what bill did.</v>

243
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.540
I didn't know what to do it for him.
Mad Boom.

244
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.490
I was shocked at first because it really did feel like someone had just come up

245
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:08.600
and just walk me on the Noggin.
So I was shots.

246
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.260
Then the pain started kicking in and it was really,

247
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.210
really like,
it was like that little,
it was,
it was that corner,
no ledge.

248
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.320
And it went right into my scalp and I didn't know if I was bleeding or what.

249
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.690
And I,
I think he had,
normally I'd be like,
like most people,

250
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.730
but it's just,
I don't know what happened,

251
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:33.731
just the flood gates open and it felt better to cry than to pretend like it was

252
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.870
just like,
aw,
like a nuisance.
Like it really,
really hurt.
So bill's like,

253
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.250
oh no,
are you okay?
So we're good.

254
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:47.410
So what else was I supposed to do?
So we're good so far with that.
Okay.

255
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.340
So I'm just sitting there crying and he goes,
oh,

256
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.050
and he runs into the bathroom.

257
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.990
<v 7>He doesn't even get me a tissue like a proper clean.
He gets me Twitter,</v>

258
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.390
Neymar.
Okay.

259
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.400
If there is a choice between tissue,
paper and toilet paper to comfort someone,

260
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.740
please find the Kleenex.
It's softer.
It's just,

261
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.230
you know,
it's just,
it's a little thing,
but it makes a big difference.

262
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.920
So then he starts wiping my away.

263
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:25.830
Okay.

264
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.663
<v 6>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.490
<v 7>Rubbing it on.
He's a white man.
My Shit.</v>

266
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.200
You shape for my eye to the other I using my chin.

267
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.560
They were huge.
I never seen anybody cry.

268
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.820
Wasn't big tears,
tears.
It wasn't like,
oh baby,

269
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:14.700
you know,
it was,
he was just scraping my funny,
I gotta be honest with,

270
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.020
with this toilet paper going been tears.

271
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.890
I gotta be honest with you.
It was fucking,
it freaked me out.

272
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:28.550
And what's the worst oh moment of comfort and you've ever heard in your life,

273
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.030
Hey,
loss for what to do.

274
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.480
Cause it was like you stopped being like a woman and you became like this two

275
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:39.090
year old and it was just like,
boom.
You're just like,
damn,

276
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.260
I didn't know what to do.
We were at home and when it got you in Popsicle,

277
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.980
Oh and then you said,
do you want some water?
I'm like,
what the fuck?
Water had to

278
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.830
<v 4>do with anything.
That's what my parents always did.</v>

279
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:54.200
If you hurt yourself and you cry,

280
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.970
they went and they got your water right out of there and then you sat down and

281
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.780
your face was all dry.
Salting.
They said,
oh,
I come back on site again.

282
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.900
And so I spent most of my childhood outside this with parents.

283
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:09.300
Did all right guys,
site,
Hey,
your kids,
you driving me.

284
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:12.210
That's get outside and you just them outside.

285
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.040
That's what you wanted to do with me in that moment.

286
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
You wanted to send me away so you wouldn't have to deal with it anymore.

287
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.090
I just wanted you to stop fucking crying.
I don't mean that in a bad way,

288
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:23.760
but it's just like to see another adult.
Nick,
can you imagine if I,

289
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:27.870
if I ever hit my fucking head and started crying the way you did?
I mean,

290
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.410
what would you know what would be coming out of your mouth?
I don't know.

291
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:32.240
I'd be like,
Oh,

292
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.060
a baby and I hold it to my chest or whatever and I'd rub your back.

293
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.200
You're full of shit.

294
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:40.650
If I fucking hit my head and started crying like a little girl

295
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.130
wasn't really that like,
it was like a little,
it was like a little,
uh,
it was,

296
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.350
we went to style it.
I have,
I'm fucking spammer here.
He's stammering jackets.

297
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.150
You for 12 years.
I've never seen you.
I've seen you like you see me cry before.

298
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.630
A couple times in the kitchen you fucking cut yourself with a knife and even

299
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:03.750
then you didn't cry as much.
That was like,
you know,

300
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:08.250
you had a balloon in the thing,
went off your wrist and float it up in the air.

301
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.130
There was just no comfort in your,
it was a,
yeah,
I haven't read.
I will admit.
Um,

302
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.770
not only did I drop the ball in that moment,

303
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.550
it's been 24 hours and I still don't have a better approach.

304
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.930
It was so fucking bizarre.
Don't ever do that again.
Yeah.
All right.

305
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.390
<v 6>The thing is the really sort of horrible thing about it,</v>

306
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.000
the biggest injustice of it all,

307
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.660
the fact that you weren't able to come from me is that I was trying to plug in

308
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.130
your fucking computer.

309
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.210
<v 4>Isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?</v>

310
00:19:41.211 --> 00:19:46.211
I knew somehow it would come back to me and it'd be my fault that your dumb ass

311
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.760
ducked underneath the legend then lifted your head up.

312
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:52.240
Ric flair wouldn't have done it.
That hard to sell a fucking,

313
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.550
<v 6>I didn't realize it was there.
I was plugging in your computer and you,</v>

314
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.600
you'll be on Udacity to be the worst comforting person in that moment.

315
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.680
Ever scratching my face.

316
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:08.840
Would that when one ply toilet paper while say big tears,
big team,

317
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.590
what's his like what does that even mean?

318
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.510
<v 4>So it was me.
I would feel the little league again.
No bad,
no bad.</v>

319
00:20:16.511 --> 00:20:17.830
A big tears but tears.

320
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.660
<v 6>So when
big tears over and over again,</v>

321
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.530
what did that mean?
You were just commenting on it.

322
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.860
<v 4>I,
I didn't,
I didn't know what to do.</v>

323
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.420
I mean you won't crying at a fucking level like I made.

324
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.380
I've been at funerals and seeing people cry to what the fuck you were doing.

325
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:43.180
I didn't know what to do.
Okay.
I'm sorry you caught me off guard.
Well tell me,

326
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:48.070
what am I supposed to say?
Just give me a fucking supposed to like,

327
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.371
you know,

328
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:52.780
take me into your arms and like hold me and like rub my back or something.

329
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.710
That sounds like a commercial for one of those love songs,

330
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:58.300
like time life presents.

331
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.340
It doesn't seem like a real thing that people do to what [inaudible] telling
you.

332
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.700
That's what I would like.
You asked me,
so I'm telling you what I would like.

333
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.440
I'd like your sunglasses to not be so big about that.

334
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.470
I'm showing Jackie O on this trip,
Jackie o g shit

335
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.010
as my part of the podcast and I'm going back outside.
Oh,

336
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:24.610
can we talk about the lady at the airport?
But Lady,

337
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.510
the fucking lady at the Union meeting for the lady pilots,

338
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:33.511
The New York Times article article about the lady pilots.

339
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.880
Ladies need,
we had zero fights.
10 days high.

340
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:41.620
Five high five high five right?
Zero fucking fights.

341
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:46.390
We had one moment.
Yeah,
we're down at the fucking pool.
Okay.

342
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.430
Obviously one of us wants to be there.
One of us doesn't take a guess.

343
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:55.660
Who doesn't want to be in the blazing fucking son?
Me.

344
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.920
So I'm down there and everybody is all can fucking concerned.

345
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:04.090
All these beautiful olive skin people running around trying to find enough

346
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:08.700
umbrella to cover my body.
That's white light.
The Mozzarella,
right,
like the,

347
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.140
that like the Mozzarella,
um,

348
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.130
like the Buddha but sweaty like the [inaudible].

349
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.290
So she hands me this abridged version of the New York Times.

350
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.090
And I read this thing and it's about,
um,
pilots.
So I was like,
I got to see the,

351
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.550
see what's going on here.
This is interesting to me.
And it was about how all the,

352
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.570
there's very few female pilots and not only the very few of them when they get

353
00:22:38.261 --> 00:22:39.094
pregnant,

354
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.340
there is just this completely archaic system involved to try and help them,

355
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.410
you know,
during that time when they have an a kid and part of it had to do with,

356
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.520
you know,
using that breast pump so that,
you know,

357
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.180
if they want to breastfeed their kid naturally,
which is totally the way to go,

358
00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:01.840
I would think,
you know,
the way God made you,
um,

359
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.930
I don't know if they didn't have the time or whatever.

360
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.930
So I'm reading this fucking article.
So in protests,
wait a

361
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.130
<v 8>second.
So this is really quickly.
So the thing is,
yeah,
you breastfeed a kid,</v>

362
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.910
some people breastfeed for,
you know,
ridiculous amount of time.

363
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.940
But gender is how old the kid gets.
Yeah.

364
00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:24.941
Cause at some point it's like four and all this other crazy that's all people

365
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.730
made about.

366
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.730
But the typical thing from what I understand is that you breastfeed them on the

367
00:23:31.311 --> 00:23:31.651
breath,

368
00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:35.570
so about six months and then six months you ween them off the breast and you

369
00:23:35.571 --> 00:23:39.320
give them the bottle,
but you still want to give them breastmilk.
Right?

370
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.140
So you got to use that breast pump,

371
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.970
the apparatus to get the milk out.
Cause if you don't your breast becoming gorge,

372
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.720
it's really painful,
you know,
leaking all over the place,
et cetera.

373
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.000
So the idea is that,
you know,

374
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:57.860
these female pilots have had children,
they're going back to work,

375
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.460
but they still want to give their kids breast milk,
but they need time,

376
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.670
approximately 20 minutes to pump.
Right.

377
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.290
And so what they're fighting for is the time and the resources and

378
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.920
<v 1>the time off and all of that.</v>

379
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.830
<v 8>Or is it time off or just a way so that they can,</v>

380
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.270
I'm not exactly sure.

381
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.670
<v 1>Right.
What I'm,
we were both in the Sunbury and this article.
So yeah.</v>

382
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:21.470
So that's the whole point.

383
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:26.240
Of course the upper management is not listening because they're also in the

384
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:30.740
meantime from what I've read on websites are beginning to cut corners in the

385
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:35.720
airline safety and having these weird fucking flight plans to try to get the

386
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:39.830
planes.
They're quicker to,
uh,
maybe have a few more flights or whatever,

387
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:43.190
save a little bit of fuel.
And the pilots are starting to be like,
you know,

388
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:46.400
one guy in particular and you know,
you're fucking with your career,

389
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.680
wrote a letter saying that they were doing that.

390
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:51.950
And of course the cooperation gave their basic fucking response.
So anyways,

391
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.340
not only are they not listening to the ladies,
they're not even listening to,

392
00:24:55.341 --> 00:25:00.290
according to some pilots,
you know,
the basic safety rules of the FAA.
Right.

393
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.700
So anyway,
so this woman has a problem and she wants to protest,

394
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.940
you know,
their treatment of female pilots,
particularly pregnant female pilots,

395
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.500
nursing,
nursing.

396
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.960
So they're in a fucking meeting and some conference room and the woman takes her

397
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:18.860
breast out.

398
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:24.250
It hooks up the pump to it and starts pumping breast milk out of her fucking

399
00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:29.570
breasts in front of everybody there and they say that the guys shifted

400
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:33.890
uncomfortably and stared at the floor and the way they presented it was like

401
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:36.710
there was something wrong with that behavior by the guys.

402
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.530
I mean that's fucking insane.
She just took a body part out.
You're not supposed,

403
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.010
it wasn't our elbow.
It was a breast and she starts pumping milk out of it

404
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.170
<v 6>does.
She really did.
I can't remember that part.
Like she just,</v>

405
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.180
I thought she just took it out and load was like,

406
00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:55.080
this is what a breast pump looked like,
bellows and that sort of thing.

407
00:25:55.081 --> 00:25:58.320
But she actually hooked it up.
I don't remember.
That's it.

408
00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:00.720
They've got to remember.
See,
I thought,

409
00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:03.720
I thought she just took it out and was just like,
this is what you do when you,

410
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.120
<v 8>you pump breast milk people.
Yeah.</v>

411
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.600
<v 6>I didn't think that she,
she took it out.
I,
that's me.
Yeah.</v>

412
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:16.160
I don't think that she actually took it out and bid the physical pumping.

413
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.090
<v 1>All right.
Well she didn't take it out then.
I don't have a problem.</v>

414
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.680
<v 6>I think she just demonstrating,
but it's,</v>

415
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.960
but it's still made people uncomfortable because they were like,

416
00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:29.670
what are you doing right now?
And she,
her whole thing was like,
yeah,

417
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.310
this is what I gotta do to feed my kid.

418
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.310
Why don't you allow me the time and the resources to do it?

419
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.250
<v 1>No,
but that's why I gotta be honest with you,
aside from being sexist,</v>

420
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:43.800
that's why corporate doesn't want to hire women

421
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.550
<v 4>is because that they don't want to deal with that</v>

422
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.800
<v 1>this,
yeah,
no,
they definitely,
they definitely don't want to do it.</v>

423
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.890
<v 4>Yeah.
They underpay.
The men forget about,</v>

424
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.980
they don't want to fucking pay women and they certainly don't have to pay for

425
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:56.814
time off.

426
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.230
And also a lot times they're trying to get these peak the guys to fly faster,

427
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.960
taking unsafe fucking roots and whatnot and like,
oh,
okay.

428
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.320
I thought she took a titty out.
Okay.
She didn't take it.

429
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.940
<v 1>I don't think she took her city,</v>

430
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.840
took the breast pump out.
Oh,

431
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.540
I was sitting there going like,
I know,

432
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.820
I know that we're cave man.
And I'm like,
how the fuck?
It's like,

433
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.020
I really don't think so.

434
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.140
<v 4>Like that.
That would be kidding.
What would they go?
Oh,</v>

435
00:27:33.141 --> 00:27:34.550
allude in a something.

436
00:27:34.551 --> 00:27:39.500
Act like if you took your balls out through your zipper or you shook your
ticket,

437
00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:42.700
somebody or you even move somebody.
I mate you.

438
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.510
<v 1>Unless you're in the sales,</v>

439
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.120
unless you're in sales and you're bringing it in such a ridiculous,

440
00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.290
<v 4>this amount of money,
like you're not only you done,
you're blackballed.</v>

441
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.570
And that interest industry.

442
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.530
Well that was what the fight was about because I was looking over at you and I

443
00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.970
was going to be like,
she took a fucking,

444
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.740
and you immediately rolled your eyes like,
Oh God,
here he goes again.

445
00:28:03.741 --> 00:28:06.380
He's going to go off on some fucking rent,
trash and women.

446
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.040
And you rolled your eyes.
And in that moment I was just like,
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.790
Are we on the fucking Amalfi coast?
And you're rolling your eyes at me and I,

448
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:16.800
you know,
granted,
I ain't going,
I had a couple of fucking Johnny Walker said me.

449
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:19.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.240
<v 4>And I fucking stormed off.
And what did I do?
Where did I go near to the gym?</v>

451
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.420
That's right.
Where have I gone to every fucking day to the gym.

452
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.860
I go to the gym every day unless you're giving me shit about it.
Um,

453
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:37.240
<v 1>giving you shit about it.
You can take a day off because bill,
you know,</v>

454
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:40.360
you have a tendency to overdo things and then you're like,

455
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.030
ha ha ha my hamstrings.

456
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.110
So it's like go,
go,
go.
And I'm just like,

457
00:28:47.111 --> 00:28:50.380
you're allowed to have a day off from working out.
You just watched.

458
00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.280
You really want to get a special coming up and you can't be a fat fuck despite

459
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.710
what all these fucking actresses say out there,
that that's only a female thing.

460
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.540
It may act like guys could just show up as a bloated booze headed.
Fuck,

461
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.220
you can't,
oh,
you can do it.

462
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.900
It certainly does not help your fucking career.

463
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.080
And I hate actress is trying to act like the fucking heart.

464
00:29:14.081 --> 00:29:17.230
Throbs aren't these chiseled guys was square jaws,

465
00:29:17.231 --> 00:29:22.210
full heads of hair and fucking abs.
They all are people magazine's 50,

466
00:29:22.211 --> 00:29:26.830
famous,
50 beautiful fucking people every goddamn year.
It's never stayed there.

467
00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:30.490
We still want a couple of fatties to act like they're actually down to earth.

468
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.740
But at the end of the fucking,

469
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.240
even then they make them wear like a Santa Claus suit.
Right.

470
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.160
And everybody else is absolutely fucking now they're not putting Jonah Hill on

471
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:42.800
that list or something like this.
Yeah,
no,
this is this thing.

472
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.540
And whatever they say,
they say a guy is,
is,
is a fat fuck.
They call it.

473
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:50.830
He's an every man.
He's an every man.
He's relatable.
That's what they're saying.

474
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.850
You're a dumb fat fuck who married above.
He plays the dad.

475
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:59.620
Normally the every man that shabby,
every man plays like a dad on a sitcom.
Yup.

476
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.670
Don In his,
uh,
in his friend and his chubby friend.
Dom is fucking hell.

477
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.550
So they have that fucking guy.
So,
I dunno what,

478
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:09.880
so you guys can sit there and be like,
oh,
there's an an easy guy to manipulate.

479
00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.490
All right.
I then they have the woman they give,

480
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:15.220
they give the guy something to fucking jerk off to.

481
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.290
I'm pretty big man.
Do you think I jerk off to sitcoms?

482
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.040
I'm just saying they give him a fucking hardy from day one.
That's what they did.

483
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.330
This is what it is.
I wrote [inaudible]

484
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.960
<v 6>no,
I always thought it was adorable though.
Even though he's a little chubby.</v>

485
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.340
Tom Bosley,
who's that?
He played from happy days with,
no,

486
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.770
I know,
again,

487
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.840
I always thought Kevin and James kind of adorable on king of kings queens.

488
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.820
Especially that episode where Kerry,
his wife is trying to learn how to code.

489
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.350
He's on the stripper pole.
She's trying to learn how to dance,
you know,
cause she,

490
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:47.830
you know,

491
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.910
wants to beat sexy and do something cool and he ends up teaching her how to pole

492
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:53.990
dance and he's great at it.
Yeah.

493
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.920
Oh my heart with that episode.
That's what he had to do.
Yeah.

494
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.760
Basically give an Olympic level performance.
No.

495
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.280
The fact that he was just agile,

496
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.020
it's got that Jack Black thing where they're like a heavy guy but they fucking

497
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:12.490
can outrun anybody and they can do like handstands and shit.
Yeah,

498
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.830
they just like a sandwich.
I like that.
Yeah.

499
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:17.980
I think that's cool because it's like you don't have to be,

500
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:21.450
you don't have to look like Zac Efron to be like a physical person.

501
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.370
<v 1>I know,
but at the end of the fucking day,</v>

502
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.420
like there's a pressure on everybody in Hollywood to be in shape.

503
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.920
And I remember that when I watched one of those meet the parents and there's

504
00:31:31.921 --> 00:31:36.310
that swimming pool scene and and remote Ben Stiller throws the,

505
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.870
goes up to spike the ball and he hits the deniros daughter.

506
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.710
I remember looking at go like Ben Stiller.
Head abs.
Yeah.

507
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:49.050
Comedians never had abs.
Yeah,
he got more in shape.

508
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.620
The more movies the movies he did.
That's,
yeah,
you got it.
Cause what?
Ha No,

509
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:56.640
cause what happens is,
is the tree they pick away at you.

510
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.890
They trash out.
You're fucking look,
I told you that.

511
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:03.090
How critics work is you could have the most perfect show ever and then they'll

512
00:32:03.091 --> 00:32:04.830
just stay.
Just pick it.
How you look.

513
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.140
<v 6>When,
did you ever do a shirtless scene in a movie?</v>

514
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.670
Yeah.
You would?
Yeah.
What if it was like tomorrow?

515
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.510
When do you like panic or would you just go with it?
No,
I do.
Yeah,

516
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.000
<v 1>I do.
But what you gotta do is stare into it.</v>

517
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.430
<v 6>Like will Ferrell.</v>

518
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.900
<v 1>Yeah,
you can't go into that.
If you had a belly you can't do,</v>

519
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.910
you can't stand this sucking and then it would actually push it out and then you

520
00:32:30.931 --> 00:32:34.830
just,
then it,
it's everything in life is,
if you try,

521
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.430
anytime you start covering up,
people just sense it.

522
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.690
It's like a comic on stage.
The second you go on your heels,

523
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:46.691
the crowd without even talking to one another senses that they were in control

524
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:48.080
and then the heckles come,

525
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.490
<v 6>well what are your,</v>

526
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.580
so you're working out like crazy because you're trying to prepare for your

527
00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:56.660
special,
but like what are your goals?
Like,
what's your,
what do you,

528
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.920
one of my goals?
Like are you trying to no,
I

529
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.030
<v 1>one 72 is the way I have to be with,
with fucking HD TV.</v>

530
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.950
<v 6>Oh,
that's how you feel comfortable on camera.
That's your camera on camera.
Wait.</v>

531
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:10.110
Okay.

532
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.280
<v 1>Yeah.
There's one 71 72 that's basically it isn't,</v>

533
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.180
everybody in Hollywood knows what fucking wait this supposed to anybody.

534
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.580
People will make youtube videos.
You make enough of them,

535
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.840
you know there's a tipping point,
right?
Yeah.

536
00:33:24.841 --> 00:33:27.120
You can get away with it where all of a sudden,
yeah,

537
00:33:27.121 --> 00:33:31.020
you start looking like you're walking into you getting carried and it's not that

538
00:33:31.021 --> 00:33:34.140
much like one 72 was actually underweight for me,

539
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.440
but on camera it looks good.
So you have to do that.
So let's,
I'm saying like I,

540
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.690
I have empathy for,
you know,

541
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.260
people talking about,
you know,
the pressures of it,
but,
but my,

542
00:33:46.261 --> 00:33:47.760
it kind of goes out the window where it was like,

543
00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:52.710
well everybody in that business is on a treadmill eating a fucking apple.

544
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.620
Everybody fucking works out.
Everybody does.
You have to,

545
00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:00.360
you have because you do look bigger on cameras and you're also in,

546
00:34:00.361 --> 00:34:01.194
this is the thing,

547
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.500
the thing that I find fucking hilarious about social media is like just every

548
00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:12.321
day I get trashed every fucking day by somebody on Twitter or Facebook.

549
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:18.030
I mean I've been able to find the humor in it and all you got to get outside of

550
00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:20.760
it and be like,
all right.
I mean I just got an eight good ones.
One bad ones,

551
00:34:20.761 --> 00:34:25.760
I'll take that 80% 80 90% good.
I'll take that.
But like especially everyone,

552
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.770
so if somebody gets moved to a really good one,
well you always,

553
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.500
you hear me laugh,
I read it to you like it's a really fucking good one.

554
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.350
I I got to give it up,
but just

555
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:40.160
<v 6>I did.
I tell you that I'm very concerned about like that share that I did that's</v>

556
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.610
coming out next year.
What's it called?
I'm concerned about things.

557
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.590
I'm concerned about things.
No,
I did an episode.
I did two episodes of a TV show,

558
00:34:49.591 --> 00:34:54.591
a guest starring role on a Netflix show that's coming out next year.

559
00:34:54.631 --> 00:34:59.310
I don't know when it's coming on next year,
what node is called.
It's on Netflix.

560
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.140
Oh.
And it's got,
it's called Santa Clarita Diet.

561
00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:05.070
And I have a small part,

562
00:35:05.071 --> 00:35:10.071
but I'm in two episodes and I'm very concerned about how I'm going to look

563
00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:14.340
weight wise.
Well,
cause it just kind of happened.
It was

564
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.360
<v 1>put it out there.
You just put it out there.</v>

565
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:20.990
There's people who hate their lives and are licking their chops to fucking
trash.

566
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.860
<v 6>So now they're going to watch it and be like,</v>

567
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:26.580
you remember when you said back in August?
They won't say that.
Yeah,

568
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.420
<v 1>because then you'll understand like they want it.
They want to be mean.</v>

569
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:33.500
They just want to be like,
what the fuck,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah is yes,

570
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.980
<v 6>it's what they do.
I look,
yeah.
You know it's funny,
I don't get at it because</v>

571
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v 4>I used to do that and if I was just doing what I fucking trashed everything I</v>

572
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:48.120
still do.
But like when I was,
when I was younger,
there was no internet.

573
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.650
But believe me,
if there was an internet,
I would have trashed fucking,

574
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.940
you know,
Jesus Christ.

575
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.530
Half of those new wave bands because I thought I was listening to the real shit

576
00:35:58.531 --> 00:35:59.550
and you know,
have people,

577
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.730
I was listening to a bunch of guys were fucking lipstick.

578
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.000
I've got motley Crue was better than fucking boy George and they had the same

579
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:14.001
fucking waiver backstage writer with the lip gloss and makeup artist.

580
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.900
But these guys were singing about the devil and the other guy was thinking about

581
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.760
his failings.
Although what's his face one time?
Yeah.

582
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.660
Mommy crosser came around,
you know,
you know I'm a dreamer,

583
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.640
but my underwears pink.
That was such a Vince Neil,
right?
Yep.

584
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.980
Is that Tommy Lee on piano piano?
I thought he played,

585
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.740
he played the beginning part.
You played at the beginning part of that.

586
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.540
Vince Neil had to run away high so he didn't come home low.
Okay.

587
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.440
See his heart was like an open book for the whole world to read.
All right.

588
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:54.140
Spaces in that band is Nikki Sixx and this man.
Oh,

589
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.630
he's maximize.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

590
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.510
Those guys are super duper famous,

591
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.780
super duper famous and they had their last show last year,
the same night.

592
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:06.400
I was always working in La and they will run around the corner at the staple

593
00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:10.470
center and that was the final one ever.
If they signed a contract,
Mia.

594
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.040
So if they ever come back then they're going to have to sue themselves.

595
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.980
Do you understand that?
No,
I know.
I don't understand that either.

596
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:18.630
I don't know why they signed a contract.

597
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.160
I think it was because all those people like Cher and fucking uh,

598
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:28.490
Nipsey Russell.
I forget who else.
Somebody else will always say that this is,

599
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.960
this is the final tour.
The WHO,

600
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.670
the WHO said a bunch of final fucking tour.
All those farewell tour where,

601
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:37.830
well this is the last one.
Yeah.

602
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.280
It's a really cheesy way for some people to just get your ticket sales up.

603
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:46.080
Alright.
I gotta read this.
Thank you for being on the podcast.
Yeah.

604
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.090
Thank you for having me.
Hey Mia.
Hey,
great vacation,
great vacation,

605
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:54.300
honey.
If you ever hit your head again and start crying like a two year olds,

606
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.950
<v 7>just give me Kleenex.
Okay.
That's all I ask.
They'll give me toilet paper</v>

607
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.460
<v 4>deal.
I don't have to say anything.</v>

608
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.270
<v 7>What do you mean?
You don't have to say anything.
You have to come from me.
Jerk.</v>

609
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.590
Give me three things to say.
Are you okay?
Come here.

610
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.760
It's going to be all right.

611
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.950
<v 4>You cried way longer than that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
and you just have to like,</v>

612
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:23.910
come here,
come here.

613
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.510
It's going to be all right.

614
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:26.571
<v 7>Disconnected.</v>

615
00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:30.770
Are you from human emotion that I have to teach you how to comfort somebody?

616
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.340
<v 4>Crying was a sign of weakness where I came from.
Okay,</v>

617
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.160
well fuck was a long time man.

618
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.780
<v 6>The fuck up.
Well man or a woman you did.
You know?</v>

619
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.310
I don't know

620
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:46.030
<v 4>what happened to my I fry.
All right.
You know what happened?
No,</v>

621
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.180
I'm just really tired of hearing about your slapped in the face of and a bud

622
00:38:50.181 --> 00:38:51.014
light

623
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.770
Rockwellian childhood or whatever it is that you're always describing.

624
00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.000
They stuck your head under the water of an above ground.

625
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.000
I totally stopped seeing bubbles call you back up again.

626
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:11.690
<v 6>Like you really like paint a picture like you grew up in like this hard scrabble</v>

627
00:39:11.691 --> 00:39:13.940
kind of fucking environment.
It didn't,

628
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.290
<v 4>you don't think so?
You fell out of a tree and your parents are like,</v>

629
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.090
shake it off.

630
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.140
<v 6>Okay.
That is what happened though,
right?</v>

631
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.110
What was it you that fell out of history?

632
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.540
<v 4>No,
I got hit by a car.
Oh,
you poor baby.</v>

633
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:34.500
And my parents set away the ambulance cause they didn't like the hospital they

634
00:39:34.501 --> 00:39:39.430
will taking us to,
and I got in a cab and they took,
took us to the hospital.

635
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:42.160
They want it to remember my mother kept telling me,
don't go to sleep,

636
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:46.860
don't go to sleep.
Oh no wonder.
Okay.
All right.
Well I get it now.
No.
Yeah.

637
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.780
I'm not saying I fucking grew up in a,
in a,
in a,
in a slump.

638
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.440
I'm just saying that it was,
it was different back then.

639
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:59.080
<v 6>It was,
yeah,
it was different.
All right.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

640
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.100
<v 4>That's all I'm saying.
I'm not saying I'm a fucking bad ass,
but like I,</v>

641
00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:08.250
I'm not gonna lie.
Apologize for having a fucked up world view.
Okay.

642
00:40:08.251 --> 00:40:12.340
Adults taught me this shit,
so,
all right.
Yeah,
go talk to them.

643
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.040
Talk to your parents about,
Hey Chris.

644
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.570
I know just anybody in roughly there in big with the Mr. Yeah,

645
00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:22.090
but you know something yet there wasn't overcorrection

646
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.090
<v 6>meaning one dead.</v>

647
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.620
<v 4>There's a reason why it went from fucking walled up.</v>

648
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:32.310
Douche is like me who only know how to go.
Oh,
big tears.
Big Tears.

649
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:37.320
I grab toilet paper and make a u shape fucking sign around your face that we

650
00:40:37.321 --> 00:40:42.180
went from that to those fucking hipster.
Who Do you wearing beard?

651
00:40:42.181 --> 00:40:44.010
Fuck bearded.
Fucking pussies.

652
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:48.240
Who Act like they're 40 10 years old and awkward non their first fucking day

653
00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.950
<v 6>generation thing that they're tougher than the like the next generation.</v>

654
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.970
Is that just what happens?
I don't think I'm tough

655
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.943
<v 4>than anybody.</v>

656
00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.960
Pretty much to me and I don't feel like I'm tougher than anybody like anybody

657
00:41:01.561 --> 00:41:05.040
now that there's so many fucking places in just the United States,

658
00:41:05.041 --> 00:41:07.110
a law where kids grow up way tougher than I did,

659
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.400
but what I'm doing is I'm defending the fact that I don't know what to do.

660
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:15.430
One or the adults.
All right,
so fucking head in prize like a two year old.

661
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.850
I'm not trying to have something like a Olympic backstory here before you watch

662
00:41:20.851 --> 00:41:21.010
me.
Yeah.

663
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.450
We play ping pong or some other stupid fucking sport that nobody cares about.

664
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.950
I got to tell you,
the pink pong is pretty cool.
And I did watch the,
uh,
I think,

665
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:34.460
watch a little bit of the,
uh,
the,
uh,
the volleyball.

666
00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.720
I have watched the United States unfortunately lost to Italy.
I did watch that.

667
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:45.580
You fucking slippers that loud.
Um,

668
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.040
you guys know what I'm saying?

669
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.650
What the Fuck God damn adults starts crying like a two year old.

670
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:55.510
What are you supposed to do with Jesus Christ other than beat?

671
00:41:55.511 --> 00:41:58.040
Like for the love of God,
can you get your shit together?

672
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.240
I felt like being like Barnes and not to just grabbing dia,
it'd be like,

673
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.850
all right,
dollar shave club.
Okay.

674
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:12.380
A dollar shave club wants to thank everybody for subscribing and they also want

675
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:14.180
to try to get new people to subscribe.

676
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:18.980
So right now they're going to give new members a month of the executive razor

677
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:24.440
for fucking fleet it just for buying it too.
But Dr cabbies,

678
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:29.060
easy shave butter.
Uh,
we're super excited.

679
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.750
Evidently,
uh,
they're doing it for you.
Now,

680
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:37.250
let me remind you why millions of others have joined as proud members of the

681
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:37.761
club.

682
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:41.900
Dollar Shave club.com delivers amazing razors right to your door for a third of

683
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:44.690
the price of what the greedy razor corporations charge.

684
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.060
That means when you joined dollar Shave Club,

685
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:50.150
you can afford to shave with a fresh blade anytime you want,

686
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:54.380
which feels fantastic.
I get a first class shave when I use the exam.

687
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.530
I don't cause I don't fucking use the thing cause they already had a fucking

688
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:01.040
razor and I got enough fucking bullshit in my life.
Okay?

689
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.210
It doesn't mean it doesn't work.
I hate out this fucking,
this ad shit.

690
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:08.810
They always have to act like you're using it and not using it.
All right.

691
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.840
I think it's a great fucking idea and I think it's useful for my listeners for

692
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:15.920
fuck sakes.
All right.

693
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.780
When you guys use the executive with Dr Carver's shave butter,

694
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.560
the blade just gently glides for the smoothest shave ever.

695
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.470

00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:49.940
make a poster and I want to whore myself out afterwards and meet people with

750
00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:54.770
sweaty fucking hands.
Um,
do you know somebody recently came to his show and said,

751
00:46:54.771 --> 00:46:57.380
Bill,
I know you don't like sweaty hands.
And they gave me the fist one.
Oh.

752
00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:58.460
I was like,
thank God.

753
00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.550
And then we went to take the picture and they put their arm,

754
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.620
they put their hand on my back and I felt their hand drying into my shirt.

755
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:10.290
Is it stuck to my back?

Going to do the reeds here for this week.

East Coast road trip.

763
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:43.780
A Billy the red kid.
I'm from Chile.
Yup.
It's a country.

764
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.800
I know.
It's a country.
It's in South America.
It's on the fucking west coast.

765
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:50.920
You can't.
Um,
he says,

766
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:54.850
I'm not going to tell you to come and do your show here because nobody knows you

767
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.470
in this inside of this world.
All right.
I have a four year old son and a lovely,

768
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:04.471
lovely lady and we're hoping to go to you go on vacation to the USA next year.

769
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.450
So it would be great if you could tell me what city,
uh,
we have to see.

770
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.430
And he says,
thanks.
I'm going to try to say,
uh,

771
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.270
I'm trying to translate.
I can't translate this.
It's thanks Ian.

772
00:48:20.271 --> 00:48:24.440
Abrazo Dossetti el Otro Lado del Mundo.

773
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.450
The fuck does that mean if he insulted me?
I want to know what he said.

774
00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.660
Hang on a second.
I got to write this up.
All right.

775
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.840
Let me hit pause.
Hang on.
Ah,
Jesus.

776
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.080
It means thanks.
A hug from the other side of the world,
right?
Yeah.

777
00:48:42.081 --> 00:48:46.310
The other side of the world.
I wasn't that Nice.
Um,
well,

778
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:53.380
I know what to suggest for adults,
but you have a four year old son,

779
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:57.130
so I got to take that into account.
Um,

780
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:05.000
I would suggest possibly Florida and doing Disney world,

781
00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.800
but uh,
you know,
they got the fucking,
those mosquitoes down there that,

782
00:49:09.801 --> 00:49:12.380
but they're also in Brazil.
So I don't know if they'd come in your way.

783
00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:15.650
I have no fucking idea.
What I would do is if you want to do,

784
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.320
don't do Disney world,
I would do Disneyland.

785
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

786
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:25.550
<v 4>Uh,
Jesus Christ.
What the hell does a four year olds want to do?
All right,</v>

787
00:49:25.551 --> 00:49:28.220
I'm just going to tell,
I can only speak for someone who doesn't have kids.

788
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.970
I loved San Francisco,
Seattle,
uh,

789
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.460
Boston,
New York.

790
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:35.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

791
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.390
<v 4>I mean,
if you're going to start,
I would go with one of those.
Chicago,</v>

792
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:44.180
Chicago is such a great,
if you want to get a vibe of the United States,
you know,

793
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:49.130
get a big city vibe with people who were also kind of fucking,
you know,

794
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.940
a little bit of that kind of rubes in Chicago.
You know,

795
00:49:52.941 --> 00:49:56.240
it's sort of a weird thing.
It's like it's a city,
but it's still country.

796
00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.420
It's still farmland around it.
You know what I mean?

797
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.490
You see people who were in shape,

798
00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:04.730
you've seen people who are going to have a heart attack in about three steps.

799
00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.240
They got great fucking food.
Uh,

800
00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:11.270
there's sports crazy.
They're great people.

801
00:50:11.271 --> 00:50:15.620
They're overtly fucking racist.
It's beautiful summers.

802
00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:19.460
It's ungodly cold and he get the whole fucking,
they get the whole thing,

803
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.810
the whole thing.

804
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:24.920
You'll find Trump supporters and Hillary supporters and all of that fucking
shit.

805
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.060
Um,
it's right in the of the country.
I Dunno,
you guys live,

806
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.670
you live near the water in Chile.

807
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.050
Christ the fucking is only like what,
30 miles wide.

808
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.360
If you've had enough of that,
I go to Chicago,
I guess.

809
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.330
Depends on what you guys do.
If you like to eat here in the barbecue,

810
00:50:44.331 --> 00:50:46.910
I'd go down south,
don't sleep on the south.

811
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.830
There's a bunch of great places to go to.

812
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.980
Maybe you can build it around a sporting event,
you know,

813
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:53.900
some auto racing or baseball.

814
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.280
Maybe the football that's coming up is a bunch of things that you could do.
Um,

815
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.030
but if you just want to go to like just a really cool city with great places to

816
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:06.160
eat and stuff to see,
uh,
San Francisco,
Seattle,
Boston.
Yeah,

817
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:09.680
New York are amazing.
Um,

818
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.840
I dunno if those would be mine that I would pick.
All right.
But no matter what,

819
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:19.570
you're going to have a good time.
Alright.
Mussolini.
Hey Bill.
While in Italy,

820
00:51:19.571 --> 00:51:22.930
did you happen to notice any Mussolini souvenirs for sale?

821
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.000
I was in Rome a few years ago and they seem to be in most do stands bunch of

822
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:31.830
fastest fascist.
Sorry.
Um,

823
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:37.000
no,
actually I didn't,
but you know,
I dunno.

824
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.570
I think it's funny that like Americans like to do that fascist shit.
I liked the,

825
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.070
you know,
say that shit too.
But who's kidding,
who,

826
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.940
we don't exactly have the greatest track record with our foreign policy,

827
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:52.290
certainly over the last 16 fucking years,
wouldn't you say?
You know what I mean?

828
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.250
And if you're really going to get a tentacle over,
since we won World War II,

829
00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:57.691
you know,

830
00:51:57.691 --> 00:52:01.440
and certainly since Russia fell and there was no one really to keep us in check,

831
00:52:01.441 --> 00:52:03.150
we've kind of been,
you know,

832
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.200
the way corporations sort of dictate a foreign policy.

833
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:12.230
We've been quite the clients for the last at least fucking 30 years,

834
00:52:12.601 --> 00:52:17.320
2026 sites sick.
Um,
so yeah,

835
00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:20.200
I wouldn't judge anybody.
Mousseline he is a part of their fucking history.

836
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.440
If I saw Muesli a souvenir,
I buy one.

837
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.980
If they had a Hitler badge,
I'd fuck it by that.
Just,
I mean,

838
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.670
I'm fascinated with World War II.
What data stolen one.

839
00:52:30.671 --> 00:52:35.470
I'd get that if they had an ice and higher one or a fucking,
uh,
William h Macy,

840
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.700
who's the fucking guy from Winston Churchill?
Yeah,
I buy all of those.

841
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:44.410
That's the Mount Rushmore or World War Two.
And then you got to have a,

842
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:47.740
what's his face there?
A Arnold from happy days.

843
00:52:47.741 --> 00:52:52.440
What's the fucking guy from Japan?
He never,
he doesn't get enough love that guy.

844
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.950
You know,
he did just as much horrific shit.

845
00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:01.470
What the fuck was his name?
Leader in Japan.
Was He an emperor?

846
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.620
I mean right there,
dude.
That's like some crazy,
I'm sorry.
Right?

847
00:53:04.621 --> 00:53:09.180
That's a great Breslin character right there.
All right.
World War Two

848
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.143
emperor

849
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.530
tiger star.
No.
What the fuck?
That's not it.
Hang on a second.

850
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.210
Here we go.
Here.
We hope though.
He re Hodo.

851
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.480
Yeah,
by any of that shit.
Nia.
Either close the fucking curtain or leave it open.

852
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:37.680
You're killing me with my eyes over here.
Alright.
Bogus chocolate.

853
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:40.470
What do you think about this Nia?
Hey there Billy.
Sweet nuts.

854
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.460
Did you hear about this brother in New York who started a chocolate company

855
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:52.440
selling chocolate bars for $10 under the false pretenses that it was premium

856
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:53.274
chocolate.

857
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.240
It turns out it was shitting chocolate and they were using the cheapest of

858
00:53:57.241 --> 00:54:02.220
ingredients while simultaneously trashing all over all other chocolate
companies.

859
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:03.510
Here's the link to the article.

860
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.110
What's your policy and buying niche products that are full of hype.

861
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.060
I actually did her about that and I think it's fucking hilarious.
You know,

862
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:13.740
I don't like,
you know,

863
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.180
Exxon Mobil finding out about global warming 30 years ago,
allegedly,

864
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:20.190
and then completely blowing it off.
But you know,

865
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:24.270
if somebody does the emperor's new clothes and like Brooklyn with some fucking

866
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:26.940
chocolate and sells it to a bunch of dopes,
I think it's funny.

867
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.810
They should definitely be panelized.
It's like when those,

868
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.240
they used to catch those people,
right?

869
00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:35.000
<v 7>Where was he selling it?
Like on the street?
On the subway,
on the,</v>

870
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.760
like how they go about solving it.

871
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:38.960
<v 4>MMM.</v>

872
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.240
<v 7>Comes up to you on the street and it's like trying to sell you a Rolex,
like,</v>

873
00:54:43.241 --> 00:54:43.811
you know,

874
00:54:43.811 --> 00:54:48.811
pretty much any kind of street smarts that the shifts either fake or it's hot.

875
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:49.990
Right?

876
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:54.550
So if someone comes up to you and says this premium chocolate,

877
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.220
<v 4>no,
no,
no,
no.
They went all out.
They had a whole book like this.
How the mass,</v>

878
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.660
<v 7>yeah,
I read about that.
They had all the packages</v>

879
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.190
<v 4>and I think it's fucking hilarious.</v>

880
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.840
I thought they were talking about someone just sell it.

881
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.680
You know what that reminds me of?
It's like when they would,

882
00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:15.850
they'll bust somebody like,
uh,
you know,
they'll have this premium tap water,

883
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.160
not tap water,
I'm sorry,
bottled water,
and then make the name.

884
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:22.750
Like in one month they have a $50,000 water bill because they're just taking it

885
00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:26.380
out of their tap.
That shit is always been hilarious to me.

886
00:55:26.381 --> 00:55:27.940
It's like the guy who figured out how to,

887
00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:33.030
how to pick the lock or the parking meters was allegedly impossible to do when

888
00:55:33.051 --> 00:55:34.660
some guys figured out how to do it,

889
00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:36.850
but of course he got greedy and then ended up getting caught.

890
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.240
Just people who do shit like that.
It's just funny to me.
You know what I mean?

891
00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.670
I know you rob a bank,
you don't use a gun.
It's funny to me.
All right.

892
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.690
You don't hurt anybody.
You just scare people.
You put,
you just hand them a note.

893
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.890
Yeah.
He had him a note with the money in a bag and you got whipped cream on your

894
00:55:53.891 --> 00:55:56.740
face.
You didn't really plan it out.
It was an impulsive thing.
You know,

895
00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.350
you decided you wanted a little better lunch.

896
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.790
If you don't stop opening and closing that motherfucker,

897
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.720
fuck her up of God damn going.
Yeah.

898
00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.150
When are you going to close it and you can't close the,
the,
the,
the,
the curtain.

899
00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.330
Yeah.
You can't close the curtain and close the door.

900
00:56:13.331 --> 00:56:17.100
Please don't make me watch you do this.
Oh Gosh.

901
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:24.220
By Mia.
Why?
Alright.
Seeing x advice.

902
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.830
Hey Bill for Bill Flynn.

903
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:31.810
I'm a 20 year old guy and my girlfriend have a year broke up with me a couple of

904
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.350
months ago.
I'm starting to get over her and we go to different colleges.

905
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:37.420
So I think it will be easier to move on.

906
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:42.750
But we have the same friends and I know we will go to the same hangouts.

907
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:47.650
For example,
my buddy's birthday is in two weeks and she's going,

908
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.890
should I go up to her first and talk to her?

909
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:55.210
Like she didn't kick my heart in the ass or should I just say hi and sort of

910
00:56:55.211 --> 00:57:00.190
ignore her for the rest of the party.
Thanks.
And have a nice day now.
Um,

911
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.080
this is what she gotta do.

912
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:04.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

913
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.550
<v 4>All right.
She dumped you so you didn't want it to end.
She did.</v>

914
00:57:07.551 --> 00:57:11.690
So you're hurting more than her is how I would probably guess how this is going

915
00:57:11.691 --> 00:57:13.640
down.
So

916
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.233
<v 0>mmm.</v>

917
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.890
<v 4>I would just,
first thing I would do is,
and my friends,</v>

918
00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:23.730
enough with this person who's having the birthday than I did,

919
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.320
it's worth putting myself into the position.
Okay.
If it isn't,

920
00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:30.230
then just don't go to the party.
If it is,

921
00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:34.250
if the person is important enough,
then when you go there,

922
00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:38.360
I would absolutely say hello to her first.
You know,

923
00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:43.460
just say good to see you.
Hope you're doing all right,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

924
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.090
Um,
no need to be weird around me,
whatever.
All right.

925
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.420
And then I would just go about and have a great fucking time.

926
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.700
I would limit my drinking that night.

927
00:57:52.701 --> 00:57:56.120
Cause you don't want to make a dumb decision because if you go there and you say

928
00:57:56.121 --> 00:57:59.690
hello to her first and you're totally fucking cool.
Um,

929
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:04.990
for whatever fucking reason how people work when they break up with people,

930
00:58:06.591 --> 00:58:11.450
they,
if the person is,
if they're that set thing,
if,
if the person's clinging,

931
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:15.710
the other person is is goes,
oh my God,
thank God I'm out of it.

932
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.990
But if they look like that getting on with their life,

933
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.840
even if the person just got done dumping them for some reason,

934
00:58:20.841 --> 00:58:21.890
they'll try and hook up with them.

935
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:25.160
You don't want to hook up with this person again.
All right.

936
00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.810
She made the decision and just,
I don't,
I don't,

937
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.080
I don't get how that works,
but men and women both do that shit.

938
00:58:33.081 --> 00:58:36.800
So I would just be totally cool.
Go to the birthday party.

939
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:41.660
I would not drink at this thing.
That would be a great move.
You stay sober.

940
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:44.900
This is what you want to be.
You don't want to be fast.
Eddie.

941
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:47.300
All right from the hustler.

942
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:52.280
Remember that when he gets all shit faced and Jackie Gleason stays fucking
sober,

943
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:54.530
Minnesota fats and he goes,
all right,

944
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:59.830
let's shoot some pool after fucking fast eddy down the whole bottle of fucking

945
00:59:00.471 --> 00:59:03.680
bourbon that he kicks his ass and gives all the money back plus another fucking

946
00:59:03.681 --> 00:59:06.800
10 grand.
I would,
if you're going to go to one,
I would,

947
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:10.880
I wouldn't be totally nice to her.
Say hello,
be totally cool.

948
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.950
Walk the fuck away.
And then just drink club soda is the whole night.
And then,
uh,

949
00:59:15.951 --> 00:59:17.960
when it feels like the time is right,

950
00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:21.080
it's starting to get to that point where everybody's getting fucking wasted

951
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.600
leave and then that's it.
That's how I would play it.

952
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.353
<v 0>MMM.</v>

953
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.180
<v 4>God Damn it.
I wish somebody gave me that advice a long fucking time ago.</v>

954
00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:31.420
All right.

955
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.760
Let me pat myself on my back from my own fucking advice and seen it sounded good

956
00:59:35.761 --> 00:59:40.080
to me.
Anyways,
here we go.
All right,
Bill,
my girlfriend is addicted to sex.

957
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:44.840
All right.
Collectively,
every guy listening to this.
Awe.
Um,

958
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:48.630
hey bill,
just wanted to let you know if you had an,
uh,

959
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.240
just want to know if he had any advice related to my relationship with my

960
00:59:51.241 --> 00:59:55.380
girlfriend.
Uh,
as you probably read in the subject of this,
on this message,

961
00:59:55.381 --> 00:59:59.160
there doesn't seem to be a downsize to the situation,
but there is,

962
00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:00.840
since she can't control herself.

963
01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:05.160
Recently my girlfriend visited me from California for a month and every day we

964
01:00:05.161 --> 01:00:07.910
banged on the kitchen floor,
shower,
bedroom,
backyard.

965
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:12.000
It's set from up until the last day.
It was great until we got into an argument.

966
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.900
She kept trying to walk away and break up with me without a real reason until

967
01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:20.340
she told me why.
Apparently,
uh,

968
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:25.370
apparently my girlfriend can't wait more than eight months without sex and after

969
01:00:25.471 --> 01:00:27.630
eight months she doesn't care who she gets it from,

970
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:32.460
this word me and Piss me off at the same time we ended up staying together,

971
01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:35.220
but I won't see her for a good while.
No idea.
When.

972
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.970
Now my worry is that she will cheat on me with other people during the time we

973
01:00:38.971 --> 01:00:43.150
are apart.
Uh Oh.
And by the way,
I live in Texas.
Uh,

974
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.160
I would love some advice from my favorite comedian.
Um,

975
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.700
I would trust your instincts here.
Yeah.
Listen,

976
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.410
you can't get mad at her for the fact she told you what her deal is.

977
01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.420
Okay.
She needs it.
She needs it all the fucking time.
She lives in California.

978
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.890
You live in Texas.

979
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.300
She actually was doing you a fucking favor by trying to break up with Dick cause

980
01:01:06.301 --> 01:01:09.360
she doesn't want to cheat on you.
And um,

981
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.830
I dunno if this is just naturally how she's wired.
If,

982
01:01:13.831 --> 01:01:16.770
I don't know if it's as an issue,
I don't know what the fucking deal is,

983
01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:18.990
but all I know is the way she is.

984
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

985
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.320
<v 4>And she lives in California and you live in Texas and you don't know when she,</v>

986
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.720
you're going to see her again.
Yeah.
You got to let this one go.
All right.

987
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.010
You don't need that anytime.

988
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

989
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.260
<v 4>You know,
you're with somebody,</v>

990
01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:33.470
you're trying to have a series fucking relationship and uh,
you know,

991
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.440
you can't be away from him for a certain amount of time or they're going to fuck

992
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:37.520
somebody else.
I mean,

993
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.720
I don't think man or woman a fantasizes is that for a,

994
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:46.640
any sort of significant serious or lifetime partners.
So I would,

995
01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:50.180
um,
hey,
you know what,
you had a good time with her

996
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:55.130
and uh,
I let her go.
She's out in California.
Let her,

997
01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.580
let her go do whatever the fuck she's going to do when,
uh,

998
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:03.130
I would try to find someone that's a little more wired like yourself and see if

999
01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:07.730
that works.
All right?
Okay.
That's the podcast.
Uh,
okay.

1000
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.460
I'm going to enjoy my last day here.
Hey,

1001
01:02:09.461 --> 01:02:13.670
thank you to the beautiful country of Italy and everybody,
uh,

1002
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.210

1003
01:02:16.211 --> 01:02:18.640
We'll definitely get to come back once again.

1004
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:22.490
Thank you everybody who came out to,

England,
Scotland,
Amsterdam,
Belgium and Germany.
Um,

1006
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.920
could not have had more fun on this trip.
I definitely ready to get home.

1007
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:37.100

1008
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.190
Um,
yeah,
I have not been in the United States since July,

1009
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:46.191
so I got to get back before they fucking just cancel my God damn visa or

1010
01:02:46.641 --> 01:02:49.560
whatever the fuck it is.
All right.

1019
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:18.210
United States,
I will be in Reno on August 27th,

1020
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:23.630
which with the absolutely fucking hilarious Todd wrecks,

1021
01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:27.780
one of the funniest fucking people I've ever met in my life.
He's the guy.

1022
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:30.420
What are you saying?
Hey handsome.
One of the,

1023
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.590
he said that to a cop one time that pulled us over when the guy was walking up

1024
01:03:34.591 --> 01:03:35.180
to the current.

1025
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:39.780
What was so funny was he was a young baby face look at comp and we pulled this

1026
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:44.460
over.
We were underneath a bridge.
So it echoed and think it was me,

1027
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:46.980
him and law head.
And uh,

1028
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:50.610
I think I lost six months of my life trying not to laugh when the cop walked up

1029
01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:52.770
and he said that he's one of the funniest guys I know.

1030
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.250
And he is not going to be easy to follow.
So if you come out to the show,

1031
01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.920
do not show up late because Todd is,
every bit is funny as I'll ever fucking be.

1032
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:04.080
All right,
that's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you on Thursday.
