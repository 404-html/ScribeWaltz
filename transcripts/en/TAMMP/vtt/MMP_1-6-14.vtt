1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.500
January six 2014

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.863
wow.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.490
Can you believe we're already 14 years into this century.

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.620
Can you believe that you're going to die this century unless they come up with

6
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.770
some Rogaine for you?
Fucking hot.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
Yes you are.
You are going to die.
Let's try to call it right now.

8
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:36.321
I was born in the year of our Lord 1968 so my goal in life is I'd like to see

9
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:42.660
the 70s again.
All right.

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
Cause the first time was just so groovy man.
Sorry I'm fucking punched drunk.

11
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.700
Uh,
getting back.
Anyways,
stay focused this week bill.
Stay fucking focused.

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.800
Um,
yeah,

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.660
I'd like to make it to about 2072 I'll be 104 years old.

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.950
You know,
it'll be right before the fair.
Dead Getting Ready.

15
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.100
They're getting geared up for another fucking bicentennial.

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.740
Tricentennial is that what it's going to be?

17
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
The tricentennial everybody and they'll come wheeling me out.
He's so old.

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.110
He remembers this second one,
the bicentennial and I'd be like,
wow.

19
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.110
Right.
Salad brains.

20
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:30.111
There was a hundred years ago today that Richard Nixon resigned from office,

21
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.990
or I get to watch that ship,

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.620
the hundredth anniversary of the assassination of a fucking John F.

23
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.640
Kennedy Guy.
Suddenly dumber fucking and uh,

24
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.760
what else would I see?
The hundredth anniversary of,
of uh,

25
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.950
the Philadelphia Eagles win in a fucking championship.
You assholes.

26
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.710
I have held is you lose yesterday.
I like to sinks.

27
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.670
I like when they go march and then,
but you know,

28
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.630
something Versie got me all hyped up that like the eagles were probably the best

29
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.440
match up for the Seahawks.
And to me,

30
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.450
I think the Seahawks are going to win the whole thing,

31
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.690
but there would be nothing funnier if they didn't.

32
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.090
I got money on him to win it,

33
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.880
but it would just be fucking hilarious if they didn't.

34
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.580
And then their fans had to go home to 12 men,
12 minute.

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.920
They have to go fucking home again with that little fucking piece of paper on

36
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.890
the wall for their world record.

37
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.860
The loudest crowd ever.
Really?

38
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.230
You don't think the Arab spring was a little louder?

39
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.380
You don't think that that crowd was a little bit louder.

40
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.080
We're running for their lives,
um,

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.450
after being dispersed anyways.
What the fuck am I talking about here?

42
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.540
Um,
you know,

43
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.140
I'm really getting tired of people who don't live in the United States of

44
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.210
America talking about it and then going,
you know,
and did it.

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.170
This is happening and this is happening and I just feel like people aren't even

46
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.930
aware of it.
You stupid,

47
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.770
arrogant fucking consequent of what a fuck do you get off thinking you know more

48
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.880
about my country then I fucking live here.

49
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.930
Why do I tell somebody in Greece what the fight?

50
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.760
Don't think anybody in Greece realized what's going on in their country.
Listen,

51
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.720
fuck.
Heads from around the world.
World,
world,
world.

52
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.220
We know what's going on here.
What would you have us do?

53
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Protestors in this country are treated the exact same fucking way they are

54
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.810
around the world.
If you're lucky,
all you get is the water cannon.

55
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.340
If you lucky,
only for a year,
die from the rubber bullets.

56
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.920
<v 1>Okay?</v>

57
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.470
<v 0>All right.
That's what happens.
All right,
Mister fucking big mouths out there.</v>

58
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.670
All right.
You want to start the fucking revolution?
I'll,
I'll join it.

59
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.330
You started,
you get on point.
All right there.
Gandy,

60
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.880
you fucking take the sheet off your goddamn bed.

61
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.370
Put on your fucking sandals and you walk down the street.

62
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.130
I'll be right behind you in the masses.
It's just,

63
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.420
and I don't think they were aware of it.
Ah,
with one more fucking douchebag.

64
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.480
Oh,
really?
Is it really corrupt?
Like you're fucking country also.

65
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.380
Rarely are we starting wars because of x,
Y and Z.

66
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:26.170
Always that why were over there?
I couldn't figure it out.

67
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.750
I thought we were over there making a fucking dairy queen.

68
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.530
Thank you for explaining it to me.
Person from somewhere else.

69
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.530
<v 0>With your fucking perspective from Nova Scotia.</v>

71
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.380
Speaking of Nova Scotia.

80
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:16.640
country and then say to my face that you're surprised that I'm not aware of it.

81
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.590
You don't like,

All right.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.510

So there you go.
All right.

98
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.450
And I'm going to go up there and ask you guys if you're,

99
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:37.370
if you're aware of what's going on in your country.
Um,
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.080
I know,
uh,
I know I've,

101
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.320
I know I've been doing a lot of yelling on this podcast and I,

102
00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:47.660
I apologize.
I apologize for my mood.
I apologize too.
Um,

103
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.340
oh,
I don't even fucking know.
Isn't that what you have to do now as a comedian?

104
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:54.950
You make a fucking joke and then you have to go out and apologize.

105
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.800
Every God damn week,
somebody said something,

106
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.540
somebody decides to take it seriously,

107
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:03.740
then all of a sudden the person has to apologize.
You know,

108
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.410
like they meant it.
Oh,
you took it seriously.

109
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:10.010
So I guess now I meant it once.
You're like,
no,

110
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.760
why doesn't everybody just collectively grow a tougher skin?

111
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.790
Why don't you do that?
What Bell?
Why did you stop being such a cunt?
Well,
hey,

112
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.970
that's a decent point.
That's a decent point.
Um,

113
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.750
somebody asked was talking to me about fat shaming this week once again,

114
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:29.390
talking about how it's a terrible thing to do.
I got to tell you something.

115
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:32.960
If you guys want,
I love fat shaming.
I absolutely love it.

116
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.670
That's how I stay in shape.

117
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.130
<v 1>Okay?</v>

118
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.820
<v 0>I fat shame myself.
Damn.</v>

119
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.300
I get out of shape.
I just stand in the mirror luggage.
You look what you did.

120
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:49.980
You fucking God damn pink pig.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

121
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.740
And I just trashed myself.
I just yell at myself.
It's,

122
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.330
it's the weirdest thing to yell at yourself in the mirror because you getting in

123
00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:00.780
your grill and you're looking away at the same time.
It's fucking tremendous.

124
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.670
It's like that movie face off,
except it's,
it's all you,
right?

125
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.880
Isn't that what happened in that movie?
Um,
anyways,

126
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:13.770
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,
I do one of these every sort of Monday.

127
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.360
I like putting them out late,

128
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:18.330
just watching people cause they take the fucking name.
So literally,

129
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.120
<v 2>who'd you go to?
Where'd you go to you?
Tuesday?</v>

130
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:24.490
I have to do a podcast.

131
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

133
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.490
When you went to the movie theater to go see Saturday night fever on a Thursday.

134
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:31.324
What did you

135
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.030
<v 2>Bidwell Asia call this Thursday night fever cause it takes Thursday.</v>

136
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.370
You can listen to them whenever you want to.

137
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.590
I have years of these fucking things years and years.

138
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.970
<v 0>Lawrence,
I have recorded,

First of all.</v>

139
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.760
It's fucking Monday.
Shouldn't you be at work?
You asshole.

140
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.850
Oh,
I'm on my soapbox this week.
Um,

141
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
anyways,

142
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.420
so I was flying back from Pittsburgh this weekend and uh,

143
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.630
I had basically the greatest weekend of my life.
Um,

144
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.690
this is,
this is,
why do I even start this fucking way?

145
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.560
I guess I've got to start at the beginning of the week,
right?

146
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.190
What do I work my way backwards?
Where do you,
what do you guys want to hear?

147
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.960
You want to hear this shit show into the greatest fucking weekend in my life

148
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.990
where you want to hear about the greatest weekend of my life and then I'll

149
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:29.340
backtrack into the shit show.
Would that make you feel better?

150
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.940
I think it would judge him by the tone on the Internet that,
Oh wow,

151
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:37.050
bill had a great fucking time.
I should lead with that and then go back to my,

152
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.520
and I should end with my embarrassments.
All right,

153
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.720
so it lands softly and you can feel okay at your plastic fucking desk that they

154
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:51.330
got it.
Office Max.
All right?

155
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.710
That's when you know you're not making it in life when your desk is made out of

156
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.660
plastic,
all right?

157
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.140
Nobody ever sat behind a plastic desk chomping on a nice cigar after making some

158
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.821
fucking zillion dollar deal that caused one arm diamond diggers to be a little

159
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:14.550
further down in the mud.
Nobody's ever done that,
okay?

160
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.140
You want a fucking wood desk desks?

161
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.460
We had a wood case.
I confused you.

162
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.150
All right?
And if you're sitting in a plastic desks right now,

163
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.680
I'm not saying you're a bad person,

164
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.450
but I'm saying that you need to now desk shame yourself,
right?

165
00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:37.930
Once you take out your little compact or maybe look into your little Zippo

166
00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:41.410
lighter,
look into your eyes and I want you to find the sadness.

167
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.140
I want you to look a little deeper and I want you to see the dream way in the

168
00:10:47.141 --> 00:10:51.730
back of your eyes and I want to know where it went and when you're going to

169
00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:54.760
bring it back up to the fucking front row.
All right?

170
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.030
Now that might've sound country,
but that was supposed to inspire you.

171
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.110
So right now I want you to slam your fist down on your plastic desk until it

172
00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:09.690
fucking shed is.
And I don't know what else the rest of the planets,

173
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.450
maybe you can get everybody else to start doing it like a bunch of monkeys.

174
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.790
You just start doing it and start throwing your shit around the room.

175
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.210
I Dunno what tip over your cubicles.
I want that for.

176
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.720
Alia isn't as fun to scare people in suits.

177
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.920
So you know some Joe Rosen never picks up his phone and now he's calling me a

178
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.940
Joey roses.

179
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.730
I'm doing my podcast.
And unlike you,
I actually pick up my phone.

180
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.100
You fucking pencil shaped cunt.

181
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.090
Hey,
let me call you after this.
Hey,
this is a great time,
Joe.

182
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.080
Now that we're both living on the same coast to maybe,
oh,
uh,

183
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.640
let the listeners know that,

184
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.290
that there's a lot of rumors that uh,
that the,

185
00:11:57.291 --> 00:12:00.100
the uh,
uninformed,
show my come back together again.

186
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.710
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

187
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.210
<v 0>Landon and McCarthy.
Mike finally bury the hatchet.
Right.</v>

188
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.840
Help.
You guys can hear that.
All right.
Fuck it.
I'll call you later,
right?

189
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.400
All right Joe.
Um,
anyways,
fuck head.
Geez.

190
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:32.180
Did I pull that out of fourth grade recess?
Hey Dick face.
Um,

191
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.330
anyways,
I don't know where to start.
All right,
fuck it.

192
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.610
I'm going to go with the most vivid memory this weekend.

193
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:43.720
I had the greatest weekend in my life,
uh,
about,
I don't know how many months ago.

194
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.690
The wonderful,
the generous,

195
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.260
the always classy and sometimes sassy Randy Bauman from wd VIII in Pittsburgh,

196
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:59.500
Pennsylvania.
Um,
who,
who basically he helped build me in that market.

197
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.660
You know,
I wasn't selling shit.
I wasn't selling any tickets in Pittsburgh.

198
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.740
And um,
I think Billy guard Dell told me about him.

199
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:10.690
I can't remember how the hell the thing went down,

200
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:15.370
but he has got this great morning radio show and he said,

201
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:19.000
listen,
next time you come to Pittsburgh,
come in,

202
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.500
fly in on a Monday night,
I'll have you on the radio Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,

203
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.310
Friday you run your freckled face for the four days and we'll,
we'll,

204
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.630
we'll get you going in this market.

205
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.560
He helped build me up and all that type of stays.
If that wasn't enough.

206
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.360
So he turned that weak market into one of my strongest cities to go to.

207
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.260
And it is such a great city to go to is if that wasn't enough,

208
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.940
all Randy Baume and called me up,
I don't know how many months ago.
And he says,

209
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:46.774
listen,

210
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.650
would you be interested in doing stand up at the,
uh,

211
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.200
you know,
Mario Lemieux has a,
a,
a,

212
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.340
a fantasy camp and it raises money for cancer research and all this type of

213
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:06.670
stuff.
It's just this great thing.
He come in,
you do stand up,

214
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.440
you meet some of the guys.

215
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.990
He always has some of the guys he played with their hanging out,
blah,
blah.

216
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:14.290
And I was just like,
yeah.
It was like,
absolutely.
That's all it started.

217
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.800
This was just this little thing.
And then he calls me back,
he goes,
Hey,

218
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:20.680
don't you play hockey a little bit?
I'm like,
yeah,
you know,
I try,
I try.

219
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:24.310
He goes away.
They have a,
you know the camp that,
you know,
the,

220
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.550
everybody plays hockey.
They have like four teams,

221
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:29.170
they play each other and all that type of stuff.

222
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:33.040
If you want to come on and play with one of the teams one day you play with the

223
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.400
penguins play and all that,
would you like to do that?
I'm like,
absolutely.

224
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.060
Of course I would.
So long story short,

225
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.780
I show up and uh,

226
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.780
I bring my pads and I bring all this stuff cause I think,

227
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:51.530
I just think it's just going to be a pickup game,
a hockey and um,
I don't know,

228
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:53.850
without getting like tacky and just say,
and

229
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.540
<v 1>yeah,</v>

230
00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.430
<v 0>all the stuff that they gave everybody who it's,
it's ridiculous.
You show up,</v>

231
00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:04.060
they give you a frigging hockey bag with you,
God damn name on it.

232
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.580
And inside there is all,
all the,
all the stuff,

233
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.470
the socks,
the gloves,
the jersey,
a helmet,
the whole thing.

234
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.900
Then all you have to do is just bring your pads,

235
00:15:16.901 --> 00:15:20.230
you're good in a stick and you find,
and next thing you know

236
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.460
you're,
you're playing hockey weight with the penguins play.

237
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.400
Oh and you also go to the hockey game.
If it was I,

238
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.390
it's too much to even try to describe.
So anyways,
we do the standup show.

239
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.630
I don't know who's in the crowd other than Mario Lemieux and I don't want to

240
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:39.490
know,
I don't want to fucking know who's there because,
because they are legends.

241
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.130
And of course I go on stage.

242
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.230
I looked to the right and is Mario Lemieux sitting there?

243
00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:47.560
It's like he can hide when you're six foot six and uh,

244
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.000
thank God I saw him smiling and he was laughing.
Long story short at the end,

245
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.870
at the end of it I met like seven or eight guys that I grew up watching.

246
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.790
I Dunno.
It was just,
it was the sickest thing ever.

247
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.840
I Dunno.
It was unbelievable.
Paul coffee,

248
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.190
you know,
other than Bobby,
your the greatest frigging defense men of all time.

249
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.840
Theo Fleury,
Brian,
Traci,
Aa.

250
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.390
It was,
it was insane.
It was fucking insane.
The whole tie Domi

251
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.840
that they were all in the crowd.
Thank God I didn't know.

252
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.340
Thank God I didn't know Jesus Christ.

253
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.340
It was my head's spinning right now.
And,
and we end up going out.

254
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:41.121
We're playing on the ice.

255
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:46.121
Traci as our coach Lemieux's on the other team with Paul Coffee.

256
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.060
Mark recky was on my team two years removed from winning a Stanley Cup on play

257
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:54.320
with this guy.
And I was,
it was insane.

258
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.070
And then a bunch of regular people,
actually,

259
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:01.310
everybody else was better than I was.
But I mean,
just were all skating with them.

260
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.060
It was insane.
It was fucking insane.

261
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.430
I'm speechless.
I,
I don't,
I,
you know,

262
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.240
I don't even have the only funny story I can think of for the weekend cause I

263
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:17.240
was in a daze the whole weekend.
It was so awesome.
Was,
uh,

264
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.790
how awful I played

265
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.470
at Jesus Christ.
Fucking brutal.
Um,

266
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.440
I really wanted to play a lot better than I did.

267
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.620
I'm not gonna lie to you and everyone's doing it,
then,
hey,
you know,

268
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:37.250
you were good for three years and you were good.
I don't sugarcoat it.
I sucked.

269
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.940
So I'm motivated to,
um,

270
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.300
I'm motivated to fucking,
uh,
to get better at that game.

271
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:47.950
So if I ever get to do a play again,

272
00:17:47.951 --> 00:17:51.480
I can actually maybe the puck from wasn't two seconds without getting taken away

273
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.850
from me,
but,
uh,
it was just the best,

274
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.270
the best fucking time I ever had.
And uh,

275
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.910
I still can't believe it happened.

276
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.990
I was actually sitting there and Steve Byrne was the other con comic on it.

277
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:08.991
I'm sitting on the bench and he's playing defense with Paul Coffee and I'm

278
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:14.091
watching Paul Coffee Pass the puck to my buddy was the sickest thing was the

279
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:19.140
sickest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
Um,

280
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.420
yeah,
so that happened.
And uh,

281
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:25.500
so that was the great,
okay.

282
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:29.130
So that was the great thing this weekend to tie domi showed us how he,

283
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.400
how he would beat up a guy a foot taller.

284
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.460
He showed us his technique.
I'm not going to get into it.

285
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:38.670
Ask him about it someday if you ever run into him.
It was fucking unbelievable.

286
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.340
And they were all hilarious.
They were all great guys.
Um,

287
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.660
who else ready?
Hilliard played for the Bruins for awhile.

288
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.600
Early on when I first started watching the Bruins.
It was,
it was,

289
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.590
it was insane.
It was absolutely insane.

290
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.260
Um,
I'm trying,
I'm trying to make sure I don't forget anybody.

291
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.550
Rick talking.
Jesus Christ.
He was skating by

292
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.950
Eddie Johnston,
the Bruins goalie who will one,

293
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.110
it's 70 and 72 and I was going to us like star struck on,

294
00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:23.890
I just read Bobby always book turn to like an eight year old kid and he goes,

295
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.290
I talked to on this morning,
I'll tell him you liked it.
And I was like,
Oh,

296
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.170
you are.
It was just,
it was insane.
The greatest thing ever,

297
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.370
if you're ever gonna do a fantasy camp,
there's no way.

298
00:19:36.371 --> 00:19:38.830
There's one out there that's better than the Mario Lemieux one.

299
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:42.430
I got to tell you,
they,
it was 100% first class.

300
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.020
It was just the greatest thing ever.
All right.
So that's that.

301
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.420
All right now

302

Bill,

303

And you know what?

304

You're right.

Um,
all right,

386
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:07.130
so backing up a little bit earlier this week,
um,

387
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.410
I did the new years eve Gig at the Wiltern theater and um,

388
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.390
right here in Los Angeles and a that's a theater that I've been wanting to do

389
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:21.500
for years.
It's just a art deco building.
It's just awesome.

390
00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:25.520
I've seen a bunch of great rock shows there.
So,
uh,
them crooked vultures.

391
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.650
I saw when the last shows of velvet revolver.

392
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.990
Um,
I just saw a bunch of great things there.
I saw a cup,

393
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:40.530
I saw modern drummer drum off there.
What else?

394
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.860
I know I've seen like 10 shows there.
I can't really think of anything else.

395
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.460
Maybe some of them were like Nia shows,
who knows?
Anyways,

396
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.190
so I finally got to go down.
I went down there went,
oh,
I know,

397
00:25:50.191 --> 00:25:54.510
I went down there when Rogan is Stan hope we're down there knocking it out of

398
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:54.991
the park.

399
00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:59.970
We had the Greg Geraldo benefit down there was just one that I always wanted to,

400
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.910
to uh,
to headlines Someday and I got to do it.
And I did it with Andrew families.

401
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.430
Jason lie hadn't Joe Bart,
nick and it was just,

402
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.160
it was just such an awesome night.
Fucking great crowd.

403
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.550
Everybody seemed to have a great time.
And um,

404
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.560
all my friends had great sets in Barton.

405
00:26:17.561 --> 00:26:22.440
Nick went on in front of me and was in rare phone was in rare form.
He,
he,

406
00:26:22.441 --> 00:26:26.100
he brought the fucking lumber that night.
Um,

407
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.240
it was just an unreal night and then we had a DJ come out in the end.

408
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.440
I got to do the countdown,
took some pictures with some fans afterwards.

409
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.130
It was just a great way to start the new year.
So,
uh,
the next day,

410
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.430
um,
actually later on that day cause we'd left one,
two o'clock in the morning,

411
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.910
we went over to the Rose Bowl and uh,

412
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.260
I was an absolute shit show this year.
I am embarrassed at myself.

413
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.940
I drank so much.

414
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.800
Usually I pass out during the game for like five minutes and somebody nudges me

415
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:01.380
and I wake up,
I drank so much,

416
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.350
I fucking passed out at the tailgate

417
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.040
fucking,
I don't know what happened.
I started hitting the hard stuff.

418
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.300
I shotgun a beer all right.
For the first time in my life,
by the way,

419
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.030
I never did it.
I never did it cause I was too afraid.

420
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:19.410
There was always girls around.
I was like,

421
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:22.620
I'm going to do it and it's going to go all over me and then nobody's going to

422
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:26.190
like me and I'm going to have to switch schools because that's the way my brain

423
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:30.150
would work rather than maybe they'd laugh and he'd say something funny and next

424
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:35.010
thing you know you're having a good time with one of low
that's not on my brain.

425
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.830
Looked,
it goes,

426
00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:41.400
smashed me over there with the beer can throw me off a fucking cliff.

427
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:44.340
Like that's how my fucking,
that's how my brain still works.

428
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:48.690
But I am aware of it now and as it starts screaming and wine and I just,

429
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:51.240
there's another voice in my head going now.
It's not,
it's a night.

430
00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:52.860
It's not going to happen.
It's going to be fine.

431
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.830
The light's going to turn green and you're going to get down the road.

432
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:58.980
There's going to be something to eat.
You'll be fine.
Um,

433
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.710
fucking Jason Law head smoked a pork shoulder

434
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.800
and uh,
I have no recollection of eating it.

435
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.210
<v 0>I don't even remember it.
I was,
I was,</v>

437
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.940
I blacked out.

438
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.010
Eight a pork shoulder sandwich and then I passed out somewhere in there.

439
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:26.120
I shotgun to beer and then walking in

440
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.010
to the fucking Roseville,

441
00:28:30.011 --> 00:28:34.660
I started screaming at this girl was like 23 and cowboy boots screaming,

442
00:28:34.661 --> 00:28:38.380
you're not as hot as you think you are to the point it got uncomfortable.

443
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.330
It's just fucking,
I vaguely remember that.

444
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.920
Vaguely remember that.
And they reminded me afterwards and I have been

445
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.430
so fucking embarrassed,
so fucking embarrassed this whole,

446
00:28:54.431 --> 00:28:57.460
I just,
you know,
like when you do something horrible like that,

447
00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.210
I don't know about you guys,
but when I think about it,
I like in my head,

448
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.590
I just start talking out loud,
making noises to kind of drown out the thought.

449
00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.560
I would just think about,
I'd be like,
ah,
Jesus is just,

450
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.100
and I would do it like standing in line at security at an airport and people

451
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.440
looking at me like,
now I'm like a fucking terrorist.
And it's like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

452
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.080
I was a scary drunk older man.
To what,

453
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:25.420
2124 year old woman.
It was just awful.

454
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.290
So as always,
I uh,

455
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.690
I am on the wagon again.

456
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.080
I was on the wagon until the fucking hockey thing this weekend.
Okay.

457
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:36.610
It's not like,
you know,

458
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.010
<v 1>okay.</v>

459
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.200
<v 0>When guys you grew up,
grew up watching,
start buying beers and shit,</v>

460
00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:45.640
you're going to be like Clark fucking Gillies.
Sorry.

461
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.560
I met Clark Gillies last night,

462
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.900
talk to him about his fist fights with Dave Schultz.
I got to do that.

463
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.590
Did I get to do it?
Is it all a fucking dream?
I don't even remember.
So anyway,

464
00:29:58.591 --> 00:30:02.160
so I am on the wagon,
but I took two days off.

465
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.930
So,
um,
it was insane.

466
00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:09.510
And I had like fucking three of those sandwiches,

467
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.500
you know where they have the French fries in the Coleslaw and I'm on the fucking

468
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:17.250
bread week.
We closed down that place one night.
Me,

469
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.860
Steve Byrne and fucking bomb and a couple other,

470
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.070
a couple other people.
I just close that place down.

471
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.590
Fucking burn was an animal man.
Every time we went we went to the penguins game,

472
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:36.730
he ordered two of them and then we went to the fucking place.

473
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.660
Like the next day after our show,

474
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.510
I should really know the name of the place.
It's like famous.

475
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:48.130
I never remember the names of the restaurants.
He fucking,
he ate two more.

476
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.220
He ordered two when I eat half of his,
a Pastrami,

477
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:54.130
one with French fries and fucking Cole slaw.

478
00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.893
It was insane.

479
00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:02.410
And then last night they had catering and it was more of him and he just kept,

480
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.660
he can't not eat them.
They're delicious.

481
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.370
They make you obese,
they're awesome.
They're Pittsburgh.
It's everything.

482
00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:14.460
Pittsburgh,
if he could make Pittsburgh and do a fucking sandwich,

483
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.290
this is the God damn sandwich.

484
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.890
Some of the best heart attack food you'll ever have.

485
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.970
I would actually say that Pittsburgh rivals,
Chicago,

486
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.010
Chicago,
phenomenal,
phenomenal fucking heart attack food.

487
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.110
Just like,

488
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.660
<v 1>okay,</v>

489
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.990
<v 0>just that,
that city is just all,
you know,
it starts tomorrow,</v>

490
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.380
the Diet starts tomorrow.
I'm quitting drinking tomorrow.
Like,

491
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.560
like the,
I,

492
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.570
if I lived in Chicago or if I lived in Pittsburgh,

493
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.100
I would be about 260 pounds,
you know,

494
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.790
and at that point you have to grow a mustache,
some sort of facial hair.

495
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.943
Do you know?

496
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.380
<v 1>Okay</v>

497
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.260
<v 0>to to,
to just hide your big fucking face.</v>

498
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.050
What a fucking weekend man.
Now all this shit's coming back to me.

499
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.040
Traci told the story of how he scored the fastest goal ever.

500
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:15.200
I actually watched it on youtube when I was looking up his highlights when I was

501
00:32:15.201 --> 00:32:18.680
going to go there to do the show and I knew that he was going to be there and

502
00:32:18.681 --> 00:32:19.101
next thing you know,

503
00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:22.820
he was talking about it and was standing in on a phone watching it.

504
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
He scored in five seconds and he's just graciously standing there like he hasn't

505
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:32.330
won six Stanley cups talking to meet.

506
00:32:32.331 --> 00:32:36.980
Like I like I'm fucking remotely on his level.

507
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.620
Greatest fucking guys ever this weekend.

508
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.320
He's telling me breaking down the whole play

509
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.660
of how we scored in five seconds and how it's only been tied.

510
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.710
He did it against the Bruins then it was just a what?
A what?

511
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:55.730
A fucking weekend man.
Ah,
Christ.
I'm floating here.

512
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.270
Um,
so anyways,

513
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.200
<v 1>okay.</v>

514
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.080
<v 0>Despite all of that.
You know,
it was funny as I was eating those French fries,</v>

515
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.760
Cole slaw,
fucking,
I almost said tuberculosis sandwiches,

516
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.410
um,
meat sandwiches and the whole weekend though,

517
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:18.060
I was also doing yoga every day because I was not going to have my back give out

518
00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:21.930
on me while I was out on the ice because I already knew what my performance

519
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:26.790
level was going to be like.
So I kind of like offset it a little bit.

520
00:33:26.791 --> 00:33:31.200
But uh,
I'm looking pretty doe in these days,
not liking myself whatsoever.

521
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.780
Um,
so anyways,
that,

522
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:38.490
that was basically my weekend and then the rose bowl was an absolute,

523
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.960
it was awesome and I'm so pissed at myself that I got that fucking drunk.

524
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

525
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.780
<v 0>And that was belligerent.
And then also that,</v>

526
00:33:46.781 --> 00:33:50.500
I forget some of the best part in the tailgate flew by and then I have to wait a

527
00:33:50.501 --> 00:33:55.030
whole nother year.
Next year I'm drinking fucking,
I'm drinking Miller.

528
00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.420
That's it.
Champagne of beer.
I'm doing that.

529
00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.940
They go down nice and easy at fucking seven in the morning.

530
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.260
Kick a couple of those back when I have an Omelet,
throw the football around.

531
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.030
Fucking tailgate like you've been there before,
Bill.
You know,

532
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.340
I'm like at these fucking Rosebowl tailgates.

533
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:16.090
I'm like Charlie Brown every fucking year trying to kick the football and Lucy

534
00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:20.200
pulls it away.
How many fucking years bill?
One of them.

535
00:34:20.201 --> 00:34:24.490
I was stone sober.
You know what's funny?
I don't even remember that one either.

536
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.080
Um,
anyways,
but as always,
Jason,

537
00:34:29.081 --> 00:34:32.500
law head Rosebowl tailgate legend,

538
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:36.220
if you ever are around that man,
when he's near a fucking grill,

539
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.180
grab yourself a paper plate in.
Wait,
you fucking turned just that dude.

540
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:42.580
He just keeps getting better at cooking.
It's fucking insane.

541
00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.870
I remember at one point some woman walked by and she looked at the fucking,

542
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:52.510
the uh,
the pork shoulder that he was,
he was smoking and she said,
oh,

543
00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:53.344
that's nice.

544
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:54.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

545
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.800
<v 0>Can I swear to God if I had a couple more beers I would have tackled her.</v>

546
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.340
That's a nice fucking kind of understatement is that I vaguely remember talking

547
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:10.850
into a camera shit face going.
Did you grow up in a city of gold?
You know,

548
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.500
it's fucking Nice.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sure your mom was swell.

549
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.670
Um,
alright,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

550
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.800
what else did I want to talk about?

551
00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:24.440
I didn't even have a chance to watch any of the football.
Um,

552
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.480
and I apologize what I said about the eagles.

553
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:29.270
I'm not trying to rub your face and it,
did anybody see the video with that guy,

554
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.200
that Eagle fan spitting that saints fans face?

555
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.320
Um,
I don't condone that behavior,

556
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.540
but you're a fucking asshole.

557
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.060
The other guy was a fucking asshole jumping up.
But you don't do that there.

558
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.510
There's,
there's an etiquette when you go into another stadium,

559
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.570
when you,
okay,
you want to show up wearing your,
your,
your fucking colors.

560
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.900
All right?
You know everybody's going to break your balls.
You'd go in,

561
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.420
you fucking roll with it.
You laugh,

562
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.920
you take the shit and then you show that you're not going to be an asshole.

563
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:10.950
And usually that works other than like in Oakland,

564
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.550
San Francisco,
San Diego of Philly for some reason,

565
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.510
I dunno out here that you get stabbed or shot or just it just,

566
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:24.580
it gets really ugly.
Um,
and in Philly,
you know,

567
00:36:24.581 --> 00:36:25.630
I guess it gets ugly too,

568
00:36:25.631 --> 00:36:28.270
but it's not like there hasn't been a bunch of stories about it.

569
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.930
Their team just lost in the playoffs and people are like,

570
00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:34.570
well he doesn't have a right to chair.
He isn't sharing.

571
00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:40.060
He's turning around Filming Sad Eagle Fans walking out of the stadium,

572
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.430
screaming who day,
who they are and all this type of shit.

573
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.520
And I guess the dude,
right?
Listen to it at the airport,
it was really loud,

574
00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:51.320
I guess he said,
I'm going to spit in your face.

575
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.420
And he kept doing it and this dude just fucking effortlessly,
you know,

576
00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.110
fluidly as he was exiting the stadium spit,
right.
This guy's face and a,

577
00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:01.790
which is a terrible fucking thing to do.

578
00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.530
<v 0>You shouldn't do it,
but it's one of those,</v>

580
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.810
that guy literally should just go to central park.

581
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.980
It's three in the morning dress like Liberace,
jumping up and down,

582
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.570
holding a Satchel of money.
Go and look at all the money I got right.

583
00:37:16.571 --> 00:37:19.680
And then when he gets hit over the head and,
and mugged,
alright,
that,

584
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.050
that's still wrong.
It shouldn't happen.
But what?
What are you doing?

585
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:24.860
<v 1>Okay?</v>

586
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.240
<v 0>Why don't you tie a big fat steak?</v>

587
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:30.190
Do Your fucking stomach and bloody steak and go jump in an alligator infested

588
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.700
fucking lake.
Why don't you do that?

589
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.570
And then it's supposed to feel bad for you when the alligator fucking eat you.

590
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.800
All right?
Uh,
that Eagle Fan was wrong.

591
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.570
He shouldn't have done that shit.
But the saints fan was,

592
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.010
was reckless with his own wellbeing.

593
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.870
Careless.
Sloppy.
All right.

594
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.790
If you were driving a fucking boat,

595
00:37:55.791 --> 00:37:58.760
you would have run at a ground because you weren't paying attention.

596
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.920
You had no respect for yourself or your own safety or the dryness of your face

597
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.990
in that moment,
sir.
All right.
And he was not sharing.
He was taunting.

598
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.560
He was filming Eagle Fans leaving,

599
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.780
screaming that who day?
All right.
He's lucky he didn't get a bucket,

600
00:38:18.781 --> 00:38:22.260
a urine dumped over his head.
You do that in Philly.
I'm surprised you lived.

601
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.130
So there you go.
So look up that video.
And like I said,

602
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.780
I don't condone that behavior obviously,

603
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.280
but I can't judge it considering I yelled at a,
a young lady,
young lady,

604
00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:36.520
and cowboy boots because I was drunk.
So now I am back on the wagon.

605
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.710
All right.
Then I reserve the right that if I'm a,
you know,

606
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.510
<v 1>okay.</v>

607
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.910
<v 0>If anything else like that happens,
I'm going to,</v>

608
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.090
I'm going to start drinking again,
but I'm not,
I'm not,
you know,

609
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.063
like that fucking,

610
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.160
<v 1>yeah.</v>

611
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.320
<v 0>You know,
I that
I give a fuck how long you were,
so,</v>

612
00:38:55.321 --> 00:38:56.470
but you would have started drinking too

613
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.290
anyways.
Uh,
what else in Jesus Christ.

614
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

615
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:07.541
<v 0>Oh my God.
I,</v>

616
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:11.820
I would say if I ever see somebody with Kansas City Jersey on or something,

617
00:39:11.821 --> 00:39:12.890
I just give him a hug,

618
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.620
but I wouldn't do that because that would actually make it worse.

619
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.100
That would be some sort of pandering,
uh,

620
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.240
what happened to Kansas City chiefs fan should not happen to anybody.

621
00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.220
And I that includes Yankee fans.

622
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.110
Nobody should have to fucking go through that.

623
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.510
Uh,
but that is today's NFL with the rule changes.
You are never out of it.

624
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.410
That was absolutely fucking insane.

625
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.610
I feel bad for chief fence and uh,

626
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.910
I feel great for Andrew Luck because I liked that guy,
man.

627
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.090
I really think that that guy is a,
uh,
obviously,
I mean,

628
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.860
I'm not going out on live.
That guy is showing he's got that Elway thing.

629
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.230
He's got that fucking Elway thing.
He's got a cannon he can run.

630
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.040
He's never better than when the game's on the fucking line.

631
00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:09.880
He showing hints of that and uh,

632
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.830
it's fucking scary.
The potential of that guy.

633
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.500
Um,
it's anywhere.
All these guys,
Cam Newton's having an unbelievable year.

634
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

635
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:27.030
<v 0>Um,
did they play this weekend?
I missed everything.
I missed everything.</v>

636
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.890
I was too busy fucking,
uh,
having the weekend of my life,

637
00:40:31.891 --> 00:40:34.260
I still cannot fucking believe that happened.

638
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.270
I still cannot believe how nice all the players were,

639
00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:43.400
how gracious all of them were.
They would just,

640
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.050
they will fucking hilarious.
Just standing around drinking beers,
breaking balls,

641
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:49.880
and then you went out and you played hockey with it was just,

642
00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:53.930
it was fucking unbelievable.
Um,

643
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.740
unfucking believable.
I'll never get over it.
It's great.

644
00:40:58.741 --> 00:41:03.540
It's fucking weekend of my life.
Um,
anyways,
so now yeah,

645
00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:04.290
that's my thing.

646
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:07.860
I'm officially fucking oldest health 45 [inaudible] 46 this year,

647
00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:08.760
so I'm doing the,

648
00:41:08.761 --> 00:41:12.930
I'm hitting the yoga hard this year because I was starting to have like,
I like,

649
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.020
I'm so old,
I like throw out my back sleeping.

650
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.720
It's so fucking humbling.
You sit there and you lie to yourself,
you know,

651
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:29.140
I look good for my age.
I can still run around and shit and it just,

652
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:31.750
you just can't,
after a while I don't know what it is.

653
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.450
How do you throw your back out?
Sleeping.

654
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.400
Don't even fucking say it's the mattress.
I've been sleeping on this mattress.

655
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.790
It's a newer one.
I've been sleeping on it for a couple of years.

656
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:43.480
It's still got years left in it.
It's me.

657
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

658
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.480
<v 0>Oh Jesus Christ.
I wake up in the morning and my dog,</v>

659
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:56.190
she does two stretches up dog down dog and she is shakes herself and she is

660
00:41:57.071 --> 00:41:58.720
ready to go.

661
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.640
She gets a yawn in there somewhere else and she's ready to go.

662
00:42:02.641 --> 00:42:05.010
And then she's staring at me and at this point,

663
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.620
<v 1>yeah,</v>

664
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.210
<v 0>she knows not to get too excited because she knows the entire stretching routine</v>

665
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.080
that I have to go through.
Just a walker down the street.

666
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.810
She gets excited.

667
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

668
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.110
<v 0>But then she just knows I have to,
I got to do like this whole,</v>

669
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.690
like this six minutes stretch routine

670
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.081
and it drives,

671
00:42:28.081 --> 00:42:31.130
it drives her nuts trying to fucking remain calm because she wants,

672
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.100
cause she loves going outside like every dog.
So God damn bed.
Um,

673
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.770
I dunno.
I guess I just,
I just have to,
uh,
I just have to accept it.
I end up,
oh,

674
00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:44.190
I forgot to mention that during the new year's Gig,
we've got a bunch of emails.

675
00:42:44.191 --> 00:42:48.510
People,
some people came in from New Mexico,
Phoenix,
Salt Lake City,

676
00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:52.770
San Francisco,
Portland,
Sacramento,
Chicago,

677
00:42:52.771 --> 00:42:56.880
San Diego,
New York City at Vancouver.
Man,
that's just,

678
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.480
that's fucking awesome.
Man.
I,
I've,

679
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:04.230
and I've got to tell you that that was a great show that night that really was a

680
00:43:04.231 --> 00:43:07.290
great show.
I'm not even gonna lie.
I was,
uh,
I was on my game.

681
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:11.510
Everybody was on their game.
She came that night.
You definitely got a,
uh,

682
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.590
definitely get your money's worth.

683
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:18.591
And I'm actually thinking about maybe doing new year's in la every other year

684
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.910
because I,
you know,

685
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.620
I got the new hour going where it's supposed to be and it's worth the money

686
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.380
every other year as far as like,
uh,
if,

687
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:34.500
if I just did you fucking city,
you know what I mean?
If I come back a year later,

688
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:37.890
like half my ax still can be the same and I,
I fucked you over.

689
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:43.290
So I do it like every other year.
Um,
whatever,

690
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:44.820
I don't need to break down my fucking promise.

691
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:49.620
I don't want to you guys an explanation.
Do I?
I don't fucking know.
Anyways.

692
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.360
Uh,
where are we?
Where are we in the podcast here?
43 minutes flying by here.

693
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.690
All right,
let's get to,
uh,
oh,
here's an email right here.

694
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.490
Conveniently enough about the,
uh,
the Wiltern.
Uh,
Billy would,

695
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:08.220
I was at the Wiltern last night for your show.
My girlfriend and I drove,

696
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.130
drove down from Portland.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

697
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.900
take the five south the whole fucking way.
Uh,

698
00:44:15.901 --> 00:44:19.470
we got tickets right when you announced it because we knew we wouldn't want to

699
00:44:19.471 --> 00:44:21.990
do any of the traditional new year plans,

700
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.560
dinner and parties and all that bullshit.
They are all mediocre at best.

701
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.890
But last night's show was hilarious.
Thank you.
Everyone was hilarious.

702
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.990
Up and down,
the funniest show I've ever,

703
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.340
we stayed for the countdown and you didn't disappoint.
Oh,
it was great.

704
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:39.510
We had a DJ and I got to do the countdown and sing that depressing song.

705
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.770
It was fucking awesome.
Uh,
he said,
if ever the end of the world is coming,

706
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.670
I'd want you to do the final countdown before we all burst into oblivion.

707
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.390
Thanks again for the labs to come to Portland Christ.
It's been forever.
Yeah.

708
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:52.800
I haven't been there in a while.
Thank you.

709
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:54.600
That isn't even like a question or anything.

710
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:59.250
That was just a nice email and I appreciate it.
All right.
Australia.

711
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.710
Uh,
hi.
I was wondering if bill,
we'll return to Australia.

712
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.610
I have a group of friends who would appreciate seeing a standup show.
Thank you.

713
00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:11.610
And kind regards.
Let's click out.
Nice emails are this week.

714
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:15.210
I think everybody made a new year's resolution to be a little nicer to me in the

715
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:19.860
emails.
You know,
maybe for once think about my feelings.

716
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:24.080
Ah,
yes.
I was talking to my agent today about,
uh,

717
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.980
putting together a run through a Australia and uh,

718
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.890
oh my fucking God.
Damn.
Phone never stops.
Um,
I'm definitely gonna do it.
I mean,

719
00:45:35.891 --> 00:45:40.210
I'm hoping to tour the entire country.
If not,
I am at the very least.

720
00:45:40.211 --> 00:45:45.160
I'm going to do a number of cities.
That is the game plan.

721
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.130
I'm hoping to go from Perth all the way across.

722
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.430
We'll see what it looks like.
You never know what I'm,

723
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.070
<v 1>okay.</v>

724
00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.900
<v 0>You know,
when you're going to cities,
you never been to,</v>

725
00:45:55.901 --> 00:45:57.610
you don't know if people are going to show up.

726
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:00.310
You gotta get a promoter who's going to believe in you.

727
00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:03.460
You've got to get people going to hype the show,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
But,
uh,

728
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.930
I really hope that,
uh,

729
00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:07.750
we can put something together and maybe tack on New Zealand while I'm at it.

730
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.890
We shall see.
We shall see.
But it's nice to know that people are asking.

731
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.540
All right.
Long distance hiking.

732
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.370
The last week I mentioned that I went on a hike and we just kept going and going

733
00:46:18.371 --> 00:46:21.400
like assholes,
not realizing that we had to walk back.

734
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.000
Hiking is not like a treadmill.
You don't just get to step off and be like,
oh,

735
00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:29.380
I'm still,
despite the fact I walked for an hour,
I am still only,

736
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.880
you know,
10 paces from my phone,
the parking lot,
my car.
Um,

737
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.170
we ended up going on like an 11 mile hike and uh,

738
00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.190
it was a exhausting to say the least.

739
00:46:42.191 --> 00:46:44.800
So this person is writing about long distance hiking.

740
00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:50.230
Another great old man thing to do yoga,
hockey,

741
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.110
ice hockey,
and a hiking.

742
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

743
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.920
<v 0>You know?
Um,
all right.
Hey Bill,</v>

744
00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.790
I've been listening to your podcasts long enough to know that you love hiking,

745
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.980
you hate getting fat and you get easily annoyed by day to day bullshit.

746
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.370
I really think you'd enjoy backpacking at Jesus

747
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.030
backpacking.
I know it's awesome,

748
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:18.080
but can you call it something else?
Backpacking.

749
00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.070
I just feel like I'm fucking waiting for a bus,

750
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:24.270
picking my nose by ready to get the shit kicked out of me.
Hey,

751
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:29.271
you guys want to go backpacking to pack you put on your back and go backpacking

752
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.010
or long distance hiking.
Okay.
Let's call it that.
It's a really,

753
00:47:36.011 --> 00:47:39.490
I don't have long distance hiking freaks me out because I figured at that point

754
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:43.750
you've walked long enough to run into something that can mall you to death slash

755
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:48.370
rip your face off or at the very least just sort of bite your throat until it

756
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:51.010
stops feeling the pulse,
you know,

757
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.880
start getting into that next weight class of animals.

758
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.440
I don't know.
You know,
mountain lions,
black bear,

759
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.090
grizzly bear,
fucking Anaconda,
whatever.

760
00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:08.560
Exotic pet that somebody let loose that has no natural enemy that is now taking

761
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:11.110
over the forest.
Um,

762
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.160
long days or long distance hiking.
It's really,

763
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.560
it's really freeing to walk away from civilization for a week or more with the

764
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.180
solid pair of boots and everything you need strapped to your back.
Dude.

765
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:29.560
Fuck that.
You're more man or woman that I am.
I can't fucking deal with that.

766
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.180
I get scared.
I get,
I get freaked the fuck out.

767
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.480
I'd have to be out there with somebody who knew what they were doing,

768
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.340
who had a gun.
Uh,

769
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.390
automatic to not even semiautomatic.

770
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.620
I need something that I could spray and the general direction of the sound I

771
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:50.650
just heard and you know,
if we kill a couple of backpackers,

772
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:55.390
there's no one else around burying them as optional.

773
00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.940
I would say leave them above ground cause they'll get picked away a lot quicker

774
00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:03.390
than people will find their clothes.
I guess the bones would be there.

775
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.500
That's creepy.
See what happens when you go out in the wilderness.

776
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:12.420
You start fucking talking about shit like that.
I live in a suburb.

777
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.150
Okay.
There's plenty of people to shoot and I never think of donut.

778
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.450
They're right out there.
Right fucking out there.

779
00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:19.470
And I never think of shooting them.

780
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.250
All of a sudden you get me backpacking or long distance hiking and I'm trying to

781
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:26.010
think out of bury bodies.
All right.

782
00:49:26.011 --> 00:49:31.011
Every time I finish a long hike I come back looking healthier and leaner and

783
00:49:32.911 --> 00:49:35.550
feeling refreshed.
Yeah.
Cause you were out there eating berries,

784
00:49:35.551 --> 00:49:39.510
wiping your ass with fucking pine cones.
That's it.

785
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.610
That's why you have that peculiar look on your face.
Um,

786
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.260
no matter how much you eat on the trail,
you're guaranteed to lose weight.

787
00:49:46.261 --> 00:49:50.700
If you spend six hours a day hiking with the 35 pound backpack,

788
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.300
there's no need to limit yourself to salads and juice.

789
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:59.540
I can't tell you how many times I've had older day hikers look at my backpack

790
00:50:00.271 --> 00:50:04.350
and tell me they wished they had done more backpacking when they were able to.

791
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:08.400
It's a really unique experience.
Experience out there on your own.
Yeah,

792
00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:09.360
I bet it is.
Well,

793
00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:14.250
what can you please write back and tell me what you do about animals,
man,

794
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.050
because I'm telling you right now,
I'm not doing this.
You know,

795
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:23.410
the only way I would do this is that I was in a fucking platoon and we all had

796
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.980
machine guns.
Just in case I missed.
Um,
anyways.

797
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:29.511
Oh,
here he goes.

798
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:32.900
He's going to calm me down and it isn't nearly as dangerous or as difficult as

799
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:35.510
people make it out to be.
If you stay on the trail,

800
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.800
you'll usually run across another hiker every few hours.
Oh,
that's comforting.

801
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:43.820
That's comforting.
Every couple hours I can run into Johnny Appleseed,

802
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.540
but during the other hour and 50 minutes minutes,
I'm on my own.

803
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.533
<v 1>All right.</v>

804
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:50.491
<v 0>Ah,</v>

805
00:50:50.491 --> 00:50:53.670
you're running usually run into another hiker or every few hours that can help

806
00:50:53.671 --> 00:50:57.030
you.
If you get hurt at bears,

807
00:50:57.031 --> 00:51:02.031
mountain lions and all those other bees kill a lot fewer people than Los

808
00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.660
Angeles.
Traffic accidents do.
Well,
I used to do a bit on that.
Well,
obviously,

809
00:51:06.661 --> 00:51:07.620
because the fucking,

810
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:14.890
you know that you're running into one person every two hours.
Sir.

811
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.570
Let's do the math here.
Okay?

812
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:18.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

813
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:19.993
<v 0>Here's the deal.</v>

814
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.530
There's like 7 million people in Los Angeles.

815
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

816
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.023
<v 0>Okay.</v>

817
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:32.740
You can't fucking go anywhere without running into like a thousand fucking

818
00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:33.574
people out here.

819
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.410
You're somewhere where you walk every two hours and run into one human being.

820
00:51:38.411 --> 00:51:42.100
So obviously I can guarantee you if those lines and mountain lions were down

821
00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:45.040
here,
the death rate would be through the fucking roof.

822
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:46.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

823
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.610
<v 0>All right.
This is the guy,
this is what he says too.
He goes,</v>

824
00:51:48.611 --> 00:51:51.940
just keep your food away from your tent and you'll be fine.

825
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

826
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:55.581
<v 0>Do you understand,
sir,</v>

827
00:51:55.581 --> 00:52:00.410
that you're telling me to do something where if up to near my food supply,

828
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:05.330
I could possibly get eaten to death.
You want me to leave my living room?

829
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:12.030
You know,
why can't I just sit on my back porch?
Well,
listen,

830
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:17.080
I would love,
I,
I would love to too.

831
00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.940
Go hiking like that.
I really would,
but I cannot get past.

832
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.183
<v 1>MMM,</v>

833
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.490
<v 0>no.
And I don't think you should be able to get past it.
That there's,</v>

834
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.490
that type of shit is out there.
All right.

835
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.870
And if you get mauled to death as a standup comedian,

836
00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.860
yeah.
You really would just looking for trouble,
aren't you?

837
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.560
I,
I,
that's,
you know,

838
00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:48.670
somebody just asked me to do a cruise to do standup on a cruise and I,

839
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:53.110
I told them I wasn't going to do it and they said,
why not?
And I said,

840
00:52:53.111 --> 00:52:57.070
because I'm terrified of the ocean.
Okay?

841
00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.760
That's why I don't,
I,

842
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:04.360
I respected the ocean is not the ocean.
It is the ocean,

843
00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:06.460
but it's,
it's literally

844
00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:07.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

845
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.120
<v 0>You're talking about</v>

846
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.400
it's outer space on earth.

847
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:19.760
That's what it is,
okay?
You can't breathe in it.

848
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:26.540
You're not.
You can't be in it.
If you're in it too long.
You,

849
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:29.850
you're either going to get hypothermia or something's going to come up and take

850
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:31.800
a bite out of yet to see if your edible,

851
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.880
<v 1>okay</v>

852
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.360
<v 0>or you're going to drown.
Those are your three fucking options.</v>

853
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.530
And I know what you're thinking,
dude is just safe,
man.

854
00:53:41.531 --> 00:53:45.220
You're out there on this big fucking boat yet.
And until you're not,

855
00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.530
until you're not

856
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.960
<v 1>okay,</v>

857
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.190
<v 0>and then you proceed to die.
One of the slowest,</v>

858
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.220
most terrifying fucking deaths that there is treading water in the middle of

859
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:02.520
fucking nowhere and somebody is to die.

860
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.420
No matter how fast they can fucking get you out that somebody is going to die

861
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:11.070
and people follow.
I fucking,
we did one cruise in my life and I could not,

862
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:15.810
I couldn't get past the fact that I was on something that the second it fucking

863
00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:18.540
shits the bed.
And I know you guys think that you go,

864
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:21.330
I've been on cruises and go fuck yourself.

865
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:26.450
I talked to the band that was on this cruise ship for fucking years and they

866
00:54:26.851 --> 00:54:31.851
told me stories over a little fucking played a Jello late at night.

867
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.800
Those awful cruise desserts.
So poor excuse for fucking,

868
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.641
I also,

869
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:42.090
I don't like fucking going out there and all of a sudden it's maritime laws and

870
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:46.590
this Douche bag who didn't even run for office is now telling me what the

871
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:51.680
[inaudible] it's whatever he says goes with his stupid ass fucking outfit.

872
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:58.440
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
they told me stories.

873
00:54:59.480 --> 00:54:59.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.130
<v 0>Okay.
They told me,</v>

875
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:05.250
they told me enough fucking stories about food poisoning,

876
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:08.310
about shit back and up about,
uh,

877
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:13.230
one engine not working and now they're going half speed and then they don't make

878
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:14.190
it to all the cities.

879
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:17.940
And then they make up shit about hurricanes and then they have,
fuck it.
Trust me.

880
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.660
People have medical issues and having to be fucking helicoptered off and flown

881
00:55:24.091 --> 00:55:26.520
is quickly,
is human possibly possible.

882
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.060
Not to the best possible hospital to the nearest one.

883
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:33.240
All right.
And you're going on a cruise.

884
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:38.340
They go all over the fucking world and they go buy a bunch of fucking countries

885
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:41.970
that you wouldn't want to fucking get have.
I've have a Goddamn hangnail in,

886
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.800
but all of a sudden they're the closest one.

887
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:48.120
And that's where the fuck you're going.
Dole.
Hey Doctor Harry,

888
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:52.440
hack it off.
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

889
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:54.523
All right.

890
00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:01.210
Fucking combined standup comedy in waterworld.
I'm not doing it.

891
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.220
All right.
So that's the thing of it.
I would absolutely love to go backpacking.

892
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.890
I would love to do that.
I would love to go up fucking mountains.

893
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.320
I would love to do that.
It's way better than going to the gym.

894
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:16.510
I understand 100% what you're talking about,

895
00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:21.511
but do that shit where you run into a bear mama bear and it,

896
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:25.060
<v 1>okay.</v>

897
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.500
<v 0>Turns around and just runs it.
You 35 40 miles an hour,</v>

898
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.200
you basically,
and you're sitting there hearing this,

899
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.480
this beast

900
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:43.780
like trees getting out of the fucking way.
It's this thing is just coming,

901
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:47.170
flying down the fucking hill at you and you're running,

902
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.640
knowing you're going to get caught and you're here and you're stupid.

903
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.660
Pots and pans,

904
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.460
click clank and together and all you're trying to do is just get out in front of

905
00:56:57.461 --> 00:57:00.370
your friend.
So he's the one that goes down.

906
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:05.580
And so you can live knowing for the rest of your life what your strategy did.

907
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:10.440
Killed your friends here in his cries.
Boom,

908
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.710
whatever the F,
what is the sound of having your face ripped off?

909
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

910
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.800
<v 0>I like to lose weight like the next guy,
Jesus guy.</v>

911
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:25.450
Go out there with the a beer.
We have fucking bear mace.
Fuck all of that.

912
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:30.310
Bears.
Mountain lions,
poisonous snakes.

913
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.710
What about if you just,
and then all the fucking varmints out there.

914
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.350
I love that word because you sent him,
he,

915
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:40.140
Sam's the only person I ever heard use it.
And I,

916
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.870
when I found out it was actually a credible word and not something made up.

917
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.950
I absolutely love that word farm.
It's,

918
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.180
<v 1>yeah.</v>

919
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.530
<v 0>You know,
badgers,
wolverines,</v>

920
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:56.050
bobcat's people look at bobcat's like they no big deal.

921
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.770
If it got scratched by a fucking house cat,
how bad that,

922
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:02.530
that thing can fuck you up with its little ass.
Fucking pause.

923
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:04.723
<v 1>All right.</v>

924
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.590
<v 0>You want a goddamn links jumping on.</v>

925
00:58:08.591 --> 00:58:13.470
You don't want to fucking town cause it's board.
Oh,
you're freaked out.

926
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.080
Oh you came near to near something that had peed on and you have no fucking

927
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:23.200
idea.
That's another thing,
dude,
you're,
you're in their world.

928
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.100
This guy actually actually respected the fact that I said I'm not doing it,

929
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:30.120
but I honestly,
he,
I think he thought it was pretty peculiar that I,

930
00:58:30.121 --> 00:58:34.930
I wouldn't do a stand up on a cruise.
I just jumped subject.
Sorry.
And,
uh,

931
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.500
and I was waiting for him to ask me why and I would just be like,
well,
you know,

932
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:40.000
would you do a podcast?

933
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:41.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

934
00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.990
<v 0>You know,
and,
and,
and on a,
on a boat in a lake that's full of fucking alligators,</v>

935
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:51.580
I mean,
you can,
okay,
we're on the boat,
everything's fucking fine,
but it's really,

936
00:58:51.581 --> 00:58:54.670
it's just an unnecessary risk that you take.

937
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.440
Goes all the way back to that fucking saints fan.
He got off easy.

938
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:05.350
That same fucking guy put that guy with his Jersey with his video cam camera

939
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.010
walking up to a mama bear screaming who day,
who day and all that type of shit.

940
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:10.600
And he's worried about getting spit on his face.

941
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:14.140
He would have bare saliva all around his fucking neck.

942
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.470
Oh Jesus Christ.
I've actually thought about that.
Like,

943
00:59:23.471 --> 00:59:25.300
what did I have do if a bear was running right at me?

944
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.280
I just wished that I would have the wherewithal to run right at it.

945
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.020
Like,
you know,
if a shark was coming at me,

946
00:59:34.021 --> 00:59:37.320
swim right at it and it as quickly as you can,

947
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.830
shove your fucking head in there and get it over with.

948
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.920
That is the only fucking strategy.
What are you going to climb a tree?

949
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:50.540
Things going to go right up that tree.

950
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.560
Did you ever see that youtube video of those guys sitting in the tree hunting

951
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:58.570
that bear and all of a sudden the bear just literally runs up the tree next to

952
00:59:58.721 --> 01:00:01.440
them
and is like,

953
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:04.760
like I dunno,

954
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.640
seven feet above them on the tree next to him leaning out,

955
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.451
sniffing at them,

956
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.570
trying to figure out what the fuck they are and I love how the bears just

957
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:19.160
instinctually,
it's thankfully,
no,
it's just like,
like what?

958
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.530
That bear eight feet above you.

959
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:24.650
That's like when you're in the upper deck of a stadium,

960
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.570
you know and you shit faced and you get into it with somebody two rows behind

961
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:34.040
you,
they automatically have the advantage because they're punching down,
right?

962
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.440
You're going to lose that fight.
You're going to fall on your back.

963
01:00:36.441 --> 01:00:38.030
You probably going to break your ankle.

964
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.140
Something's going to get twisted as this guy's punching down at,
you're not.

965
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:45.500
Just imagine it was a bear.
That was the situation these people are,

966
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.530
and you got to check out that video,
this fucking bear.

967
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.720
It was on the ground and they're whispering in their little fatigues looking at

968
01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:57.020
this thing and then this thing,
I don't know how it found them.

969
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.550
You just heard and that was it.
Over this thing was all of a sudden,

970
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:05.360
not on the floor of the forest,
20 feet down.
It was now eight feet above them,

971
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.940
sniffing up them like,
Ooh,
is that a food source?

972
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

973
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:10.931
<v 0>Jesus.</v>

974
01:01:10.931 --> 01:01:14.080
Do you really just hit on like two people today hit on two tremendous fears.

975
01:01:14.081 --> 01:01:18.520
I have been alone in the fucking wilderness and and,
and being out to sea.

976
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.650
Fuck both of those,
although I want to hear the stories.
If you do it,

977
01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.870
not if you went on a cruise.

978
01:01:25.871 --> 01:01:29.740
I don't give a shit going out there eating Jello with the date rape drug,

979
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.350
fucking Weirdo,
you know,

980
01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.580
to go see the reunion of Wham Cindy Lopper cruise.

981
01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:40.300
Whatever the fuck you doing.
I don't know.
All right.
Advice on college selection.

982
01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.330
Oh wait,
let me,
let me read the last couple of fucking ads here.
All right.

983
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.410
All the classic.
Here we go.
Take it to this street,

984
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.060
stamps.com everybody,
one great resolution you can make for this new year.

985
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:58.210
Maximize every minute and every dollar for your small business.

986
01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:02.320
And you know what?
I know an easy way to do that.
And easy,
simple way.
What is it?

987
01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:06.130
It's stamps.com think about how much time you've wasted going to the post
office.

988
01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:10.630
I get done thinking about it.
Driving,
they're finding parking standard,

989
01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:12.280
but the homeless guy,
old and the door.

990
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.880
You got to fish for a dollar pain in the ass.
Uh,

991
01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:20.600
just use what you already have.
The weight stamps.com is a way to get posted.

992
01:02:20.601 --> 01:02:21.780
It's just use what you already,

993
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.950
you already have your computer and your printer to get official us postage for

994
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.540
any letter or package.

995
01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:32.340
Then the mailman comes by and picks it up with stamps.com everything you would

996
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:34.470
do with the post office.
You can do it right from your desk.

997
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.600

1036
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:01.080
All right.
Advice on college selection.
Uh,
dear billion bourbon.

1037
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.910
I'm an 18 year old senior,

1038
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.360
headed into my final high school semester and I'm conflicted as to what school I

1039
01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:12.870
want to attend after high school.
I've narrowed it down to two colleges.

1040
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.480
I wonder what extent each polar opposites.
Jesus.
Dude,

1041
01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.080
this is like one

1042
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.080
of the biggest decisions of your young life and you just heard me trying to read

1043
01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:28.550
out loud.
Okay,
so take everything that I say with a grain of salt.

1044
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:28.881
All right.

1045
01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:33.680
The first this person is considering is the University University of Arizona.

1046
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.950
This safe,
cheap a choice.
We're all,

1047
01:05:36.951 --> 01:05:39.260
my buddies are going to go and it's in,

1048
01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:42.890
it's in state with about 40,000 enrolled students.

1049
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.500
I got to tell you right off the bat,
that sounds fun cause I don't like to read.

1050
01:05:48.501 --> 01:05:49.490
I don't like to study.

1051
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.390
I like to drink with my friends and I like talking to the lady.

1052
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.610
So I'm already liking university Arizona.
Goddamn.

1053
01:05:56.670 --> 01:06:00.500
But that sounds like a nightclub to me.
Uh,
they off.
Okay.

1054
01:06:00.501 --> 01:06:03.290
They offer my first choice for a major,

1055
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.310
what they offer my first choice for a major.
Oh,

1056
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.140
they offer my first choice for a major,

1057
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:14.350
which is nutrition and it's a two hour drive from home,

1058
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:18.760
which is nice considering my family is still mourning the loss of my dad at

1059
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:22.300
Jesus.
Dude,
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow.

1060
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.120
All of a sudden that takes all the fun out of this.
Uh,

1061
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:29.470
the downside is that everyone from my high school goes there and I feel like

1062
01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:33.540
it's a cop out choice.
I have a good,
Eh,

1063
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.970
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
You know,

1064
01:06:38.971 --> 01:06:41.190
plus you want to meet all bunch of,
a bunch of new women.

1065
01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.153
<v 1>You know,</v>

1066
01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.340
<v 0>possibly get some shady pasts.
That's always great to go to a new college.</v>

1067
01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:48.660
You just fucking reinvent yourself.

1068
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.373
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1069
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.750
<v 0>Like hipsters tried to do,</v>

1070
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.560
they try to act like they were the cool guy in high school that fuck the

1071
01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:57.800
cheerleaders,
you know,

1072
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.030
as they sit there dress like Robert Fulton for no fucking apparent reason.

1073
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.330
Anyways,
I had a good jeep,
a good GPA,

1074
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:08.620
fantastic test scores and enough extra curriculars to get me into some pretty

1075
01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:13.360
selective schools.
So I feel like you have a isn't enough of a challenge.

1076
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.980
I don't really have much incentive to go there.
Then I fear I'll be unhappy.

1077
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.030
I'll be unhappy there due to the lack of risk taking.
All right dude,

1078
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:24.190
you sound like you make,
you're already making the choice.

1079
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:29.110
I feel Eulene um,
you jumping offsides here.

1080
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:34.100
Uh,
the other is Lewis and Clark College.
Ah,

1081
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.290
Jesus Christ,

1082
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.730
a liberal arts college in a beautiful part of Portland.
Dude,

1083
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:44.731
you just went from blondes in Bikini's to uncontrolled bushes were in Bergen

1084
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:51.130
stocks.
Now I know.
I'm stereotyping.
All right.
Yeah.

1085
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.930
Jesus Christ.
You really are a smart one,

1086
01:07:55.931 --> 01:07:58.900
aren't you?
Nah.
You know what?
Okay,
wait a minute,

1087
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:00.790
I'm going to stop being an asshole.

1088
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.060
You don't university going to the fucking University of Arizona.

1089
01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:05.560
From what I've heard.
That's just like,

1090
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:10.300
remember that guy used to take those creepy videos of the girls gone wild.

1091
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.860
You know cause girls got roof feed was a little too

1092
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.263
on the nose.

1093
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.510
That's what air those Arizona college is sound like.
Um,

1094
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:24.800
I had a buddy of mine from high school.

1095
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.680
He went out there and he got all fucked up.
It was,
it was too much.

1096
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.590
Girls came to fucking classes and bikini tops.

1097
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.050
What are we supposed to do anyways?
He goes,

1098
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.780
the other is Lewis and Clark cause at least they did back in the 80s.

1099
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:37.400
The other is Lewis and Clark College.

1100
01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:41.450
It's a liberal arts college in a beautiful part of Portland.
Portland,

1101
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:45.140
Oregon is fucking gorgeous with about 2000 kids.

1102
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:50.570
It'd be a nice distance away from home and it's the college where my heart lies.

1103
01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:54.530
What do this,
is it right here?
2000 kids is great man.

1104
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.200
Going to a school where it's a fucking city,

1105
01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:01.670
that they all have their own bus system.
Man,
that's insane.
Uh,

1106
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.750
just personally speaking,

1107
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:06.440
he said it'd be a nice distance away from home and it's the college where my

1108
01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:11.150
heart lies.
Yeah.
Dude.
And you grew up in Arizona.
Go see something different.

1109
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:16.280
Uh,
the campus is absolutely incredible and we have family up there in case

1110
01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:20.810
something goes wrong.
It's a tad more pricey.
But my family set up is my,

1111
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:25.811
sent my family set up to where I have the option to spend a lot on college.

1112
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:29.660
The downside is that it's such a change for me.
A new city.

1113
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.530
I have visited it,
but it's far away from home now.
You know,

1114
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:35.960
high school friends and I'm a natural pessimist.

1115
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:40.040
So I wonder what the gloomy grey winters will do to me mentally.
I'll do,

1116
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:44.060
fuck this man,
man up.
You want to go?

1117
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.020
You're scared.
You should be scared.
You're 18 but it's good.

1118
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.140
This is a good thing to be scared of and to get over.
You got to go out there,

1119
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:55.070
dude.
Jesus Christ.
You live in Arizona.

1120
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:59.960
You can fucking come there anytime you want to fuck that.
Go Away to school,
man.

1121
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:05.160
Portland is this shit.
Oregon's beautiful all the way up into Washington.

1122
01:10:05.161 --> 01:10:08.720
It's fucking gorgeous,
man.
Cruise down to Coosbay Bay.

1123
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:12.860
I've been all over that fucking state.
It's awesome.
And not only that,
you know,

1124
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:17.780
they got great college football up there.
Now
if you're in that type of shit,

1125
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:23.030
go to one of those Oregon Games.
I'd fucking do that in a second.
Um,
anyways,

1126
01:10:23.031 --> 01:10:23.511
I'll keep going.

1127
01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:27.590
He says the Portland weather is almost the polar opposite of Arizona weather and

1128
01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:32.060
that spooks me at it.
Don't rain doesn't hurt.

1129
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:37.130
All right,
you'll be fine.
You know.
All right.
Still,

1130
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:40.580
I feel like Lewis and Clark is the opportunity that had been waiting for a plus.

1131
01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:43.700
I'm a relative,
relatively solitary person,

1132
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:48.910
so I think I'd fit in with the more mellow campus that a fraternity runs school.

1133
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:50.930
Like you have a,
it sounds like you would,

1134
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:55.730
essentially it comes down to huge party school versus beautiful small liberal

1135
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:57.140
arts school.
Uh,

1136
01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.830
the thought of being alone with no one I know in a new school scares me and

1137
01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:04.780
excites me at the same time.
Let me know.
Thanks in advance.
Go Fuck Yourself,
dude.

1138
01:11:04.781 --> 01:11:09.230
Give out.
You've already made your rod decision.
You want to challenge yourself.

1139
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.710
It's exciting.
You're going to meet new people.
It's going to be awesome dude.

1140
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:17.020
It's got to be fucking awesome.
Go up there and have a great time.
And uh,

1141
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:21.390
as far as I know,
if there's a party going on,
you basically have a party school.

1142
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.790
Okay?
Don't want to,

1143
01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:27.640
all you want to do is just fucking party the whole God damn time cause you're

1144
01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:28.720
not gonna learn anything.

1145
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.380
It's going to go by like that tailgate I went to and you gotta be drunk and

1146
01:11:32.381 --> 01:11:35.470
belligerent and act like a fucking moron and come out of there with a big booze

1147
01:11:35.471 --> 01:11:40.300
head.
You don't want to do that either.
Um,
believe me,
believe me,

1148
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:44.200
if you think that people aren't partying in Portland,
first of all,

1149
01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.400
if I had the guests,

1150
01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:50.260
they probably make insane fucking weed in that state.

1151
01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.340
I don't know if it's legal,
but by the time fucking November rolls around,

1152
01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:58.700
it probably will be.
Oh,
Jesus.
I mean,

1153
01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:03.680
I would live there.
I would live in Seattle.

1154
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.590
I would live in Portland.
I would live in any either,
well,

1155
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.150
either one of those states,
more northern Oregon or I would live on the coast.

1156
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:16.750
It's just some of the most lush land you're ever going to see with all of that

1157
01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:21.470
rain.
I'm telling you,
it's absolutely fucking gorgeous,
man.

1158
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:25.460
It's fucking gorgeous.
You know when the People Bullis,
Matt,

1159
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.890
you know rains all the time.
They got nothing to do was sit around and read.
Um,

1160
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:35.070
all right advice.
Dear Bill.
Fagens.
Oh Jesus.

1161
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:36.600
He went home a phobic.

1162
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.790
I am taking an anatomy class before I start the med school shit show.

1163
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:46.890
Oh Jesus.
All right.
There's this hot chick that I've been doing.

1164
01:12:46.891 --> 01:12:48.690
This sounds like the beginning of a porno.

1165
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.680
You're going to be a doctor in medical school.
You taken an anatomy class.

1166
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.270
Here comes this hot chick,

1167
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.930
and what she wants you to help her out with the anatomy is you take out your

1168
01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:02.760
fucking Dick.
There.
He goes,
says hot chick that I've been talking to,

1169
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:04.430
but I feel creepy about asking,

1170
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.860
asking her out while we were digging out

1171
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.660
a dead grandmothers Fallopian tube together who was probably a peach

1172
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:24.200
dude.
I'm gonna tell you right now,
you're,
you're,
you're in the game.

1173
01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.360
You are so in the game.
You don't even fucking understand it.
All right?
You're,

1174
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.730
you're smart enough to be in medical school.
You've got to be a doctor.

1175
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:36.070
So right there,
you're a fucking rock star to women.

1176
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.450
They all,
who doesn't want to bring him?
He's in medical school.

1177
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:44.270
He's got a mom and dad.
I am I dating of fucking guy in medical school.

1178
01:13:44.271 --> 01:13:48.840
Not Top of that.
You're fucking hilarious.
That's it.
One,
two punch.

1179
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:49.674
It's over.

1180
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1181
01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:55.440
<v 0>Upper cut to the fucking snatch over there.
Um,</v>

1182
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:58.720
he said,
how should I approach this?

1183
01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1184
01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:04.470
<v 0>By the way,
when are you going to come to San Francisco with gingerly love?</v>

1185
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:12.430
Um,
let's see here.
How do you approach it?
Well,

1186
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:15.760
do it.
Yeah.
Well,

1187
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:20.020
you don't have to hit on her while you're working.
How about you're in the,

1188
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:24.790
when you were in the lunch room?
I like,

1189
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.600
dude,
you're already,
you're so fucking in there.
It's ridiculous.

1190
01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:31.690
You're already funniest fucking hell.
So I have total faith in you all.

1191
01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:35.270
You all you need is the location,
I would say.
Yeah,
when you're not standing next,

1192
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:40.090
you know,
digging into a cadaver.
Other than that,
you know,

1193
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:45.700
just start working on him,
working on,
you know,

1194
01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:50.250
make her laugh at work.
Ask her about her background,
but Baba Ba,
you know?

1195
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:52.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1196
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.410
<v 0>but don't fucking,
you know,
talk to her too long before asking her out.</v>

1197
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.000
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1198
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.110
<v 0>You don't work the body a little bit.
A,
where'd you grow up?
How many brothers,</v>

1199
01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.970
sisters,
you got blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And
you know,
I don't know asking you,

1200
01:15:04.971 --> 01:15:09.720
you seen anybody?
Boy,
did you like to fucking see me?
And then you fucking open.

1201
01:15:09.721 --> 01:15:12.270
Yeah,
your lab coat with nothing underneath it.

1202
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:17.490
You flasher so you could get away with it.
You're in anatomy class.
Bang.

1203
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.640
That's how you do it now.
Um,
dude,
you're going to be fine.

1204
01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:22.980
You don't need my fucking help.
All right.

1205
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:29.010
Just don't do it when you're dissecting shit.
All right.

1206
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.160
Jesus Christ.
Is that guy fucking killing it or what?

1207
01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.740
Don't you wish you had his life?
He could do it over again.

1208
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:39.330
He was smart enough to get into medical school and there's some hot chicken.

1209
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:43.420
You're fucking class
Jesus.
I can tell you this search.

1210
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:47.470
She's going to be the first of many.
All right,
you motherfucker.

1211
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.520
All you gotta do is walk around with that stethoscope around your fucking lab

1212
01:15:51.521 --> 01:15:54.250
coat with the scrubs on.
Forget it.

1213
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.760
It's going to be raining,
hailing.

1214
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.300
Fucking Johnny blue top shelf fucking pussy for you.

1215
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:07.120
Good.
Good on you.
Good on you,
sir.
You study,

1216
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:11.510
you study the Nice School.
You deserve it,
or you fucking a,

1217
01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:16.330
you were born with the AA brain.
You got the a brain
ever tell you about that.

1218
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:19.990
My philosophy,
some people get the a brain.
Some people get the be brain.

1219
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.140
Some people get to see brain and then after that,
I don't,

1220
01:16:23.141 --> 01:16:27.850
I don't make fun of people.
All right?
I Make Fun of the the sea brain.

1221
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:29.990
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1222
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:32.410
<v 0>See,
brain is,
is that person that you know,</v>

1223
01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

1224
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.170
<v 0>You know,
you know those mouth breathing fucking morons,
those people all right.</v>

1225
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:41.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1226
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.600
<v 0>They got to see brain that one where they can get a driver's license,</v>

1227
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.633
you know?

1228
01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:48.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1229
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:52.620
<v 0>They can pour themselves a bowl of cereal,
but,
and they can get to work on time.</v>

1230
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:58.070
Yeah.
You know those people,
like when you ask them a question,

1231
01:16:58.071 --> 01:17:00.380
they get a look on their face,
almost like they're going to start crying.

1232
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.650
That would be the sea bright.
The Bee brain

1233
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:09.830
would be,
would be me.
You're smart,
but you're a fucking idiot.

1234
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:13.263
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1235
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:20.390
<v 0>And then the a brain is you just,
you know,</v>

1236
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:25.370
just straight across the board.
You're a number one draft pick.
All right.

1237
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:30.500
I would go late in the third round,
but I got a lot of hot.
All right.

1238
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:34.060
The campaign voice bill,
uh,

1239
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:38.150
we're going to get America back to work and it's time we give tax cuts to people

1240
01:17:38.151 --> 01:17:42.120
who,
who really need them.
Had me rolling.

1241
01:17:42.121 --> 01:17:45.810
When I first heard you do that stereotypical campaign voice,
you know,
it's funny,

1242
01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:48.990
I don't even know what voice said is,

1243
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.770
I remember saying that stuff.
I do what?

1244
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.410
I don't.
I'm thinking like I don't yell do I don't even fucking know.

1245
01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:58.640
I can't remember.
Anyways.

1246
01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:03.020
I've heard you do the campaign voice a few times on Conan,
opie and Anthony,

1247
01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:03.854
et cetera.

1248
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.700
Do you do that in your act or was that just something you did during the

1249
01:18:07.701 --> 01:18:09.500
presidential election season?

1250
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.440
It must've been because I can't remember how to do it.

1251
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.400
I was just fucking killing me.
Do I do it?
My Am I do.
I do.

1252
01:18:18.401 --> 01:18:20.910
I have a funny voice and I'm not utilizing that.

1253
01:18:20.911 --> 01:18:24.910
Could get me another fucking desperate six minutes to my act.
Uh,

1254
01:18:24.911 --> 01:18:28.390
would you do a few minutes of it on your next podcast?

1255
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:33.570
Well,
what am I a fucking jukebox?
Listen,
I'll do it for you,

1256
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:37.170
but you got to send the audio of you doing your impression of it.
All right?

1257
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:42.060
You got to make an ass of yourself and then I'll fucking tap dance for you.
Um,

1258
01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.380
thanks.
He says,
thanks.

1259
01:18:43.381 --> 01:18:46.350
I've been paying attention to your comedy since I caught your half hour special

1260
01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:50.900
when I was in middle school and I'm now 47 off kitty.
Uh,

1261
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.480
I'm really happy for all your success and I wish you continued success.

1262
01:18:54.481 --> 01:18:58.350
Jesus Christ.
People are coming out of the gate and 2014 really nice.

1263
01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:03.650
Thank you very much,
sir.
How do I do that thing?

1264
01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.320
How did we do the campaign voice?

1265
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:11.080
That's not the one that absolutely purple ball pump pump pump.
They just like,

1266
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.580
what was it?
That one.
Now you've got me in my head.

1267
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.530
See I'm,
I'm uh,
I'm,
I'm smart but I'm a fucking idiot.

1268
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:23.180
I can't even remember the shit that I do.
Ah,
fuck.

1269
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:27.440

And,
um,

1277
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.550
once again from the bottom of my heart,

1278
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.290
thank you to Randy Bauman for hooking me up with the,

1279
01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:08.100
uh,
the Gig.

1280
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.870
Thank you to Mario Lemieux and all everybody at the camp,

1281
01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:15.420
everybody that I played with,
everybody who laughed at the joke,

1282
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:18.540
so me and Steve Byrne told them,
um,
I don't want to speak for Steve,

1283
01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:23.250
but I think I can.
That was a,
we would just shaking our heads today.
Uh,

1284
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:28.220
we flew back,
we connected in Dallas and we got,
uh,
um,

1285
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.620
they would d ice in our planes.

1286
01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:32.690
We missed the connecting flight and we got stuck there for a couple hours.

1287
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:35.000
Those you follow me on Twitter?

1288
01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.830
I was twittering my fucking misery when I was there until I saw the guy with the

1289
01:20:39.831 --> 01:20:42.410
neck brace sneeze.
That fucking killed me.

1290
01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.320
The look of panic on his face because he knew he was going to sneeze and he knew

1291
01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:52.580
it was going to hurt.
I,
if I could ever,
if I could do that face on cue,

1292
01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:56.330
I swear to God I could win a fucking Oscar.
Um,
but anyways,

1293
01:20:56.331 --> 01:20:59.960
we were sitting there in the,
uh,
in the airport just talking about

1294
01:21:02.050 --> 01:21:06.310
just talking about how
just shaking our head,

1295
01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:08.680
it was unbelievable.
But as always,
you know,

1296
01:21:08.681 --> 01:21:13.600
I'm not going to name names and all that type of shit.
Um,
but uh,

1297
01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.830
it was,
it was fucking amazing,
man.
Fucking amazing.
So,
uh,
that's it man.

1298
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:22.250
That's my,
that's how my 2014 started and um,

1299
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:26.920
people actually have pictures of me now wearing Pittsburgh,
penguin,
jersey.

1300
01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:32.570
That's the only thing.
But I was willing to pay that price.
Uh,

1301
01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.060
I got to thank ty Domi for punching off Samson in the face.

1302
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:42.720
It's just how do you fucking beat that?
How,
what,
where does 2014 gold from here?

1303
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.060
