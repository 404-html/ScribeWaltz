00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.730
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
July 29th,
2013.
How you doing?
Um,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm on the road right now.

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.830
I'm currently in New Orleans and I brought all my podcast stuff with me,

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.030
but of course I was kidding who I went to summer school,

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.840
I should have gone three out of the four years I went to high school.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.310
I should actually go on all four years.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.410
But a one year my math teacher gave me the d minus and then my senior year was

10
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.230
kind of like,
well what's the fucking point?
But um,

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.170
for the record I should have gone four times,
um,

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.810
all four years and feed those of you listening overseas,

13
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
basically summer school if you don't have it over there is basically you fucked

14
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.121
up so bad.

15
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.980
They gave you 10 months to get your shit together and evidently that wasn't

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.310
enough for you.
So no swimming,
no biking,

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
no experimental drugs for you and you have to go to fucking summer school.

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860
So,
um,
next week I will have a power cord.

19
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.660
Here I am in New Orleans right now and I'm starting my acting gig.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.460
I'm going to be here for the next couple,
two,
three weeks.
So,

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.100
uh,
yeah,

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.400
I hope these levels are all right.

23
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.550
I don't know how to fucking adjust them on this garage band thing.

24
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.930
That's what I'm recording it.
Um,
yeah.
You know,
it's,
it's the usual bullshit.

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
I just,
I just don't get along with technology.
Um,

26
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.060
I like to think I didn't start it.
Maybe I did.
Maybe I did start it by just,

27
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:37.650
you know,
you know what my problem was?
I thought it was just a fad,

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.450
you know,
I thought computers in this new technology and shit.

29
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.650
I just thought it was some,
I just,
I looked at it as an extension to video games.

30
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.850
I looked at it and it was just a time sponge.
I don't want to do that shit.

31
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.650
I want to go out and go fucking do something,
you know?
And uh,

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.820
you know,
I think we can say at this point that I was wrong.

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.560
I remember when I was living with Bobby Kelly,

34
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.000
it weighs 47 times kid.
Um,

35
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.060
back in 1995 or 96 or whatever the fuck we lived together and he was,
he,

36
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.510
he just jumped all over that ship.

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.960
And what was funny is I was smarter than Bobby Kelly in 1995 and

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.320
18 years later,

39
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
he is way smarter than I am because my just,

40
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.660
I just,
there was just something right out right out,

41
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.260
right out of the gate that I just did not like about computers.

42
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.300
I just didn't like it.
You know,

43
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.410
I remember back in high school when they had like the fucking piece of paper was

44
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.940
coming out of the things and you know,
you had,
you know,
what,

45
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.610
what the fuck computer programming,
I was just sitting there like,

46
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.470
I would rather dig for fossils than fucking sit here another minute,

47
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.040
typing in,
run,
enter whatever the fuck we were doing.
And it was,

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.850
it was not fun on any fucking level.
So anyways,

49
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.860
I'm not going to lie to you.
I mean,
I wasn't ever really that smart,

50
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:13.690
but I wasn't a fucking moron.
But my lack of embracing computers,

51
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.850
I feel like in an odd way,

52
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.600
I've gone from being literate to completely fucking illiterate.
Uh,

53
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.230
I get unbelievably frustrated with them.
And,
uh,
you know what I do?

54
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.510
You know what I do with my computer a lot?
I grab it,

55
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.570
I pick the fucking thing up and I,

56
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.500
and I hold it over my head like fucking Hulk Hogan when he's going to slam a

57
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:37.270
chair,
get somebody fucking sweaty back,
bite my bottom lip.

58
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.810
Now I never do it because it costs so much fucking money,
but I swear to God,

59
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.280
<v 1>okay,</v>

60
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.760
<v 0>one of these times I just want to do it once,
just one time,</v>

61
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.820
but I know instantly I'll regret it.
But,
um,
I just,

62
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.170
I apologize for the poor quality of this podcast.

63
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.410
So I'm going to try to speak in regular speaking tones.

64
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.660
I won't do my usual fucking with the microphone,

65
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.560
which is my crutch to make this podcast remotely entertaining.
And also I'm in a,

66
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.630
I'm in a hotel room.

67
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.780
If those of you who is listened to my podcast for a long time,

68
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.740
remember when I was stuck in New Jersey during that fucking hurricane or

69
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.650
whatever the hell was going on,
I was a little too loud and security came.

70
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.030
I don't feel like doing that.
All right?

71
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.940
It's one thing if I'm out on the road and I'm just doing a comedy Gig,

72
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.520
who gives a fuck,
right?
I'm on,

73
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.670
I'm a made guy and strip mall comedy clubs so I can piss off the front desk.

74
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.450
But as far as this act and shit goes,
I'm a Newbie.
So I don't feel like,
uh,

75
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.290
I don't feel like a,
you know,
screwing things up right out of the gate.

76
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.270
So I'm going to try to behave myself as much as humanly possible.
Um,

77
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.750
but I was also thinking,
you know,
I,

78
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:45.580
I want to get better computers and I also want to visit.
Is it,

79
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.610
does that sound dumb?
Am I even saying that wrong?

80
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.750
I want to all be good computers.
I will do to come to bear,

81
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.310
um,
complete shit head.
You know,
something.

82
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.590
What does it say about you that you're actually fucking listening to this?

83
00:04:58.591 --> 00:04:59.040
You know,

84
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.130
I don't know why you're listening to why at this point you really should hit

85
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:05.190
stop and fucking delete it or whatever.
But you know,

86
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.910
I'm not here to tell you what the dope.
So anyways,
uh,

87
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.440
I'd like to become more proficient when it comes to the computer sciences.

88
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.820
Is that a home source to say it gives a fuck?
Um,

89
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.150
and also I would,
I would like to quit dicking around on the computer.

90
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.730
I find that the other day you need like 40,
50 hours.
That's all you need.
40,

91
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:29.970
50 hours and you'll know how to fly a plane.
I mean,

92
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:31.110
you've got the classroom shit too,

93
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:33.990
but as far as just like learning how to fly the fucking thing.

94
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.360
Somebody told me the other day,
I don't know,

95
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.490
I was talking about the motorcycle license thing.
I would gloating.

96
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:42.560
Then I finally fucking got one.
And uh,
you know,
it's no,
it's fucking hilarious.

97
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.330
I'm actually afraid to go out and just go ride a bike down the street,

98
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.440
but whatever.
I got one,
I got him,
I got,
I got the fucking thing.

99
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:56.630
So this person was telling me that they,
uh,
that they had a pilot's license.

100
00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:58.070
Now it's fucking cool thing to do.

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 2>And I was like,
well,
how many hours?
And he said,
well,
buy 10 hours in,</v>

102
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.430
you can pretty much fly the fucking thing.
He goes,
obviously,
you know,

103
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.230
you could hurt [inaudible] screw up,

104
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.650
but you're proficient enough where you could get yourself up off the ground

105
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.570
before you flew into the side of somebody's silo.
But,
uh,
but I was just,

106
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.670
that just has been sticking with me all week.

107
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.190
That if I spent 10 hours doing that,
I would actually,
you know,
if,

108
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:25.160
God forbid I was ever on some fucking doing some hell Gig,

109
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.790
or I'm flying one of those fucking planes with,
you know,

110
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.400
in one of those planes would like the water skis and the guy has a fucking

111
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.000
aneurysm and I got 10 hours under my belt,
I could fucking crawl up there.

112
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.913
You know,

113
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.820
it'd be funny about that is you'd actually have to sit on the guy's lap.

114
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.290
If it was a really cramped little as plain with like the one seat and shit,

115
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.380
you'd have to do that.

116
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.400
You'd have to push through whatever your level of homophobia is,

117
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.260
you know,
depending,
you know,
depending if he had it on automatic pilot,

118
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:03.230
which I don't even know if they have that option on one of those little fucking

119
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.620
plates.
What's the deal with bleeds?

120
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.780
I mean they just like cars where you can buy the Ford escort of planes.

121
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.830
Why the fuck would you do that?
And you want the,

122
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.360
you want the rest proofing five.
Let's all just take it as,

123
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.380
I'll buy right off the lot.
Thank you.
Um,

124
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.110
vinyl interior.
Anyways,

125
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.330
so I was just a how much time I spend just wasting,
you know,

126
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.090
watching people getting kicked in the balls,

127
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.060
all the porn I have to sift through to find something that even remotely turns

128
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.080
me on at this point because I've watched so much of that fucking shit.

129
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.630
You know,
the last point,
oh,
I watched,

130
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:50.660
I actually apologize to the three women that were in it when I was done

131
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.140
sort of got,
you know,
I was just like,
God,
Jesus Christ,
what am I.
Dot.

132
00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:02.770
I'm sorry ladies.
I'm sorry your dad didn't stick around.
I,
uh,

133
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.440
it was just dreadful.
Yeah,
whatever.
You'll see it someday.

134
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.840
If I ever decide to run for president,
you know,

135
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.440
and I'm fine if I don't fall in line,
the fucking NSA.
Well,
Hey,

136
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.870
this is what he jerks off to.
Um,
anyway,
you know,
some,
uh,
you know,

137
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.820
it's pissing me off as the amount of people who aren't supporting that Snowden

138
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:21.920
guy.
I think there's a lot of people,

139
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.310
I'm going to go on a limb here and I'm going to say there's a lot of people that

140
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.680
don't like it and spied on,
you know,

141
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.200
think it's completely unnecessary and think that and view that Snowden guy as a

142
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.940
whistle blower,
not as some sort of trader,
but you,
you,

143
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.940
you just know that you can't say that.
You can't say that shit on TV.
And uh,

144
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.860
that's not a nine 11 thing.
That's a fucking post Vietnam thing.

145
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.740
I was thinking about that the other day where they had,

146
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:52.790
everybody was singing songs saying,
you know,
protesting against the war.

147
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.380
I'm not saying whether it was right or not,

148
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.470
but you could do that back then and you didn't get that Dixie chick treatment.

149
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.130
You know,
that shit where they will like,
well,

150
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.510
they had the right to sing it and we have the right to disapprove of it.

151
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.100
It's like,
yeah,
yeah,
you do say add an appreciate that,
fuck them.

152
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:12.570
But when you take it to the level,

153
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:17.220
you'd try to systematically destroy their ability to make her earn a living,

154
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.210
then,
uh,
you know,
that's not tit for tat.
That's like,
Hey,

155
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:25.590
I threw a rock at you and you'd drop the fucking bomb on me.
Hey Dell,

156
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.950
why don't you get to some topical material from this fucking decade?
All right,

157
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.420
sorry.
Um,
the hell was I talking?
I don't even what I was talking about,

158
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.430
I got so self conscious that I was somehow talking about the Dixie chicks.

159
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.700
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Back in the day,
you could,
you could fucking,

160
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.333
<v 3>you know,
you could</v>

161
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.140
<v 2>say,
uh,
you know,</v>

162
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.700
you could say things and it wasn't all tied into,
you know,

163
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:50.430
supporting troops and love and babies and,
uh,

164
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.120
being pro ice cream and against the terrorist.
It's like,
it's fucking a,

165
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.290
it's really childish,

166
00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.550
really childish era that we're living in and it's gradually seeping into what it

167
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.420
is that I do for a living where there's these complete,
uh,
nincompoops.

168
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.410
Can I use that word that are deciding to go to comedy shows and take jokes

169
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.310
seriously?
I mean,
how old are you?
I,

170
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:19.980
I can't,
I can't.
Um,
what are you going to do next?

171
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:23.700
Go to the circus and watch the clown hit another cloud with a rubber hammer and

172
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.540
God's promoting violence.
He could get a concussion.

173
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.750
No more rubber hammers at the SARC is,

174
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.620
and what the fuck is wrong when you grow up?
You know what I mean?

175
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.070
I love her.
They think that like,
comedians have this,

176
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.570
this fucking level of power that they're going to do a joke.
Okay.

177
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.340
And that people in the crowd are so fucking stupid that that's going to form

178
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.850
their worldview.
You know,

179
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.620
like if I did a joke that was like pro chopping somebody fucking handoff,

180
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.900
I are you really telling me that there's people out there that are so fucking

181
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:05.670
stupid
that they're going to walk into a comedy show before they walked in.

182
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:09.810
They had no desire to do it and felt that doing that the to another human being

183
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.410
was a terrible thing to do.
But then once I make a joke about it,

184
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.070
all of a sudden there's going to be a bunch of people walking around chopping

185
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:20.550
people's hands off because I joked about it.
It's,
it's,

186
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.280
it's unbelievably fucking childish and it's condescending and,
uh,

187
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.640
I dunno,
I just keep seeing more and more of that type of shit,

188
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.680
by the way,
for people to get up in arms about some of those jokes.
Uh,
that one,

189
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.020
because I don't want to feed the fire here,
but you know,

190
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:41.580
that one topic that you're talking about also could happen to a man,
you know?
So

191
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.650
I don't know why you feel like it's,
it's just yours.

192
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.630
I was actually joking about that on stage.
I'll burn the bit,
won't gives a fuck.

193
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.950
You know what it is,
at least when it happens to them,
people give a shit.

194
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.960
If it happens to a guy,
they,
people literally think it's funny.
They laugh.

195
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.670
You know,
I remember when that do get his dick cut off by his wife.

196
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.390
He was cheating on his wife and she cut his dick off and she threw it in the

197
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.220
garbage disposal and turned it on.

198
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.210
And there was one of those shows that was ripping off the view is the one that

199
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:23.260
has the Asian lady.
I don't even know if it's still on,

200
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.980
but they were talking about it and they were snickering.

201
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.440
You know what I mean?
It was fucking funny to them.
It's horrific.

202
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:36.720
Gives it was they found humor in it.
So I,

203
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.680
I dunno,
I ain't know the fuck I'm talking about anymore.
I let,
let's,

204
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.680
let's do a little little advertising here.
Uh,

205
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:49.420
I'm sorry about the clicking of the,
uh,
whatever this fucking buttons called.

206
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.330
I'm sure Bobby knows what it's called that,
but he's getting,
I bet he has some,

207
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.060
the latest one dad.

208
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:59.070
I got the lays fucking Steve Job fucking space by thing get um,

209
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.880
I said it.
Bobby Kelly smarter than me.

210
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.440
We're actually doing a two man comedy show off off Broadway called Bobby Kelly

211
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.690
smarter than me.
It's kind of like a George Burns,
a sunshine boys type of thing.

212
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.630
By the way,
Robert Kelly,
if you guys were up in Canada,

213
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.770
I heard he murdered it up at the Montreal comedy festival.
All right,

214
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:24.400
but enough about that content.
Let's talk about the dollar shave club.
Everybody,

215
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.020
they're all asleep shave club.
Um,
it's a cool brand.
I hate how they do.

216
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.620
This has made me so much happier about shaving.
No,
it hasn't.
Okay.

217
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:35.740
It's fucking convenient.
I totally recommend it.

218
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.850
Stop putting fucking words in my mouth.
Anyways,

219
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.310
dollar shave club,
everybody has made my life way more convenient.

220
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.110
Um,
it's a cool brand and they send you quality razors right to your door every

221
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.750
month.
You don't even have to think about it.
You don't even have to wait in line.

222
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.120
You don't have to get someone to unlock that cage for you,

223
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.040
like they've taken out a bar of gold.

224
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.070
You don't have to pay way too much money for a bunch of features that don't even

225
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:04.240
fit on your old handle.
Alright?
Shaving has become such a mess.
Okay?

226
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:08.380
It's a complete rip off.
All right,
the snake oil salesman,

227
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.640
it's a little plastic piece of crap with,
with like,

228
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.330
it's not even aluminum.
I don't even know what it is in there,
okay?

229
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.560
It's a piece of crap and they've been charging you an arm and a leg for it.
Well,

230
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:23.440
who's coming to the Rescue Dollar Shave Club?
All right.

231
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:24.580
I want you to go out and try it.

232
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.550
I dare you to try this product and tell me you're not satisfied with it.

233
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:29.500
Do you think about that?
See that advertisers,

234
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:33.070
I don't need you to write words for me.
Um,
well,

235
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:35.860
this part I do support the show.
Go to dollar shave club,

236
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.040
forward slash burr or click [inaudible].

237
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.410
Click or click on the dollar Shave Club banner on the podcast page at

238
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:44.320
[inaudible] dot com.
All right?
Then you don't have to deal with it.

239
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.790
You don't have to deal with it anymore.
No more standing in line for him.

240
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:52.970
Of those old people,
you know,
going some understaff,
cvs,

241
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.300
trying to find somebody who actually can walk away from the cash registers.

242
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.870
Stress Slash like ice cream.
You know,
it's funny.

243
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.430
Old people buy ice cream and like pharmacies,
you know,
they don't care.

244
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.710
They don't need it to be hugging.
Does.
Is there dairy in there?

245
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.640
Is it cold?
We'll put it on a cone.
You fucking cunt.
All right.

246
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.640
Ah,
sorry.

247
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.430
Most of this rage has to do with the fact that I feel like an idiot that I

248
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:22.120
didn't bring the power strip thing or whatever.
It's not a power strip.

249
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.540
The plugin thingy that goes into the back of the do Hickey.
Um,
all right,

250
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:28.010
so now you don't have to buy,
um,
you don't,

251
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.460
you don't have to worry about buying a shea.
Uh,

252
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.060
what do you call blades for your shaver?
Shaving blades.

253
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.230
Is that what they're called?
I don't know.

254
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.530
I wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to deal with that.

255
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.270
You also didn't have to go to the post office.
Well,

256
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.680
why don't you go to stamps.com you know,
quit staring at the lamp.

257
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.940
Grabbed the reins or your life.
All right?

258
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.330
Postage meter companies used to have a monopoly on printing postage.

259
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.320
They could charge you an arm and a leg to print postage from your own office.

260
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.720
But those days over,
oh,

261
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.950
not like Michael Corleone said Corleone.

262
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.993
Is that what he's planner.

263
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.080
Now you can use stamps.com instead with stamps.com get all the benefits of a

264
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:13.100
postage meter,
but at a fraction of the cost,
all you need is your computer,

265
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.590
your printer and stamps.com to get,
uh,

266
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.700
to get official US postage for any letter or package,
any class of mail.

267
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.020
It's so damn convenient.

268
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.560
Plus you'll never have to step foot inside of a crowded post office again.

269
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.120
All right?
This is your whole Saturday morning,
right?
Paying your bills,

270
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.160
driving down to the post office,
stand in line,

271
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:33.170
and then you go over to cvs to buy his shaving blades.

272
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:37.700
You don't need to do this anymore.
All right?
Get with the times,
man.

273
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.520
Everything you would do at the post office you can do right from your desk.

274
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.990
It's so convenient.
All right.

275
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.580
I use stamps.com they send out all my march for when I whore myself out after my

276
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:49.850
shows.
And you guys know how dumb I am.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.030
Go to stamps.com before you do anything else,

281
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.220
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in burpee.

282
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.630
You are that stamps.com enter burr.
All right,

283
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:16.280
back to the podcast and I apologize for the click.
Um,

284
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.540
all right,
where the hell am I here?
Um,
oh,

285
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.320
this is what I did before I came to New Orleans.
I um,

286
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.160
I did the first leg of the uh,

287
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.580
Billy red state tour with a limited edition tee shirts.

288
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.410
And these aren't limited edition.

289
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:37.700
They're only going to be sold on the red state tour unless I don't sell all of

290
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:42.140
them,
at which point they'll be available to everybody.
You see that?

291
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.180
That's called honesty in advertising.
Um,
but anyways,
I got,

292
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.100
I went to Boise,
Idaho and uh,
then I drove up

293
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.600
<v 0>to Bozeman,
Montana.
It was like a s unbelievably great like seven,</v>

294
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:56.490
eight hour drive could have done in six.
But you know,

295
00:17:56.491 --> 00:18:00.450
we were stopping along the way.
Me and Lucas Seely comedian,

296
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:02.820
I met back in the day when I used to do this guy's room.

297
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.630
My giggles comedy club that no longer exists,
exists,
sadly,

298
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.980
was such a great club.
And uh,
I loved that club owner,
man.

299
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.060
He was such a character.
You know,
the first weekend I worked with this guy,

300
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.953
<v 1>he came out</v>

301
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.580
<v 0>and gave me a shoe box full of like fives,</v>

302
00:18:21.581 --> 00:18:24.370
tens ones like was my money for the week.

303
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.280
It was thinking that I was just going to have that under my arm and go walk

304
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.870
through fucking airport security and not look like a fucking,

305
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.590
like I was dealing crack,
you know,
I still remember it was one of those,

306
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.140
one of those boxes that you put that baseball's in,
and he had all,

307
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.230
he had the piece of paper to say how many comps there were yet all the

308
00:18:44.231 --> 00:18:44.831
information.

309
00:18:44.831 --> 00:18:48.670
He had it in a shoe box and it looked like it looked like he was trying to raise

310
00:18:48.671 --> 00:18:52.000
money for kidney dialysis.
You know,

311
00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:55.330
or maybe he was playing the Banjo on the sidewalk and everybody just threw money

312
00:18:55.331 --> 00:18:57.250
in there every which way.

313
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.640
<v 1>And,
uh,
I don't know.</v>

314
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.930
<v 2>Back then,
I hadn't read about banks today.
I probably would have taken it.</v>

315
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.790
I would've counted it out.
I would have taken it.

316
00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:11.630
But then at the end of the day,
it's just a piece of fucking paper.
Um,
so anyways,

317
00:19:11.631 --> 00:19:13.460
I,
but,
uh,
it was such a great room

318
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.100
<v 0>and I had so many fun,
uh,
shows when I was there.
And I,
uh,
along the way,</v>

319
00:19:18.101 --> 00:19:21.040
I met a bunch of great comps.
They're great scene there in Seattle.

320
00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:21.874
I hope they still do.

321
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.870
<v 1>Um,
I haven't been there in a minute,
but,
uh,
I met this</v>

322
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.510
<v 0>do Luke Lucas Sealy.
So we did a Boise,
Idaho the first night,</v>

323
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.460
which was right on the campus of a Boise State University.

324
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:40.290
For some reason I didn't realize that that's where I was performing and uh,

325
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.160
it was phenomenal.
I took video,
um,
I could get into the stadium,

326
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:45.450
but I was in the corner of the end zone.

327
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:48.210
I saw a little bit of that iconic blue turf.

328
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.430
And I know a lot of people from the bigger schools will give me shit for calling

329
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:56.160
that iconic.
Well fuck you all right.

330
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.380
And yet god Damn fucking your,

331
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.500
your school songs that all sound the same.
You know,

332
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.710
<v 4>bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,</v>

333
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.310
bad,
bad,
bad,

334
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.820
<v 0>the same guy,
right.
All of those fucking songs.
Um,</v>

335
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:21.250
and that was the only three that,
you know,
right.
The Lsu,
when I recognize it,

336
00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:24.460
when I hear it,
um,
you know,
it's funny being down here in New Orleans,

337
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.110
I keep forgetting I'm here.
So every time I see an Lsu shirt,
I like light up.

338
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:33.160
<v 2>Hey,
Lsu,
Lsu.
I keep stopping myself from saying that.</v>

339
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.860
That'd be like in Boston.
Red Sox,
right?
Red Sox.
Oh,
by the way,

340
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:43.060
I'm slowly,
I'm back into baseball.
I don't know what happened.

341
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.080
I just been on the road and I'd been watching games and I've been watching like

342
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.100
the,

343
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.970
<v 0>uh,
I've been watching the half nots,
you know,</v>

344
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.230
been watching the royals and watching the Indians who actually are the haves.

345
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.030
They just can't ha ha,
like,
hang onto their guys.
Um,

346
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.060
I've already given you that theory of why they should have an honor.

347
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.970
Honor every world series.
Fucking trophy.

348
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.100
You know,
Philly's the Yankees,
the Red Sox,
we all stole all of that.

349
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:14.950
Fucking guys didn't stay on,
but whatever,
you know what it is.

350
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

351
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.090
<v 0>We use them as a farm team.
It's bullshit.
I liked them.
I liked the Indians.</v>

352
00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:25.380
I liked the royals.
I like the pirates.
I liked the,
uh,

353
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.140
the devil rays or they lost some points by calling themselves to raise.

354
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.320
That's another childish fucking thing.
How old are you

355
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.780
devil rays that either it's going to make kids evil,
you know,

356
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.310
why don't you just call the pussies?
How about that?
Would that be,
you know,
the,

357
00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.910
the,
the Tampa Bay,
uh,
after you,
why don't you just call it debt?

358
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.840
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You,
you,
you eat the last slice,
the,
the,

359
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.183
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

360
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.860
<v 0>The Tampa Bay.
It was a pleasure meeting.
Use,
use.
I'm sorry.</v>

361
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.690
Anyways,
let's get back to this shit.
So I,
um,
bull shows,

362
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:14.260
I don't know what was,
what got into me.
I,
I hadn't done standup in a minute.

363
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.290
I've been busy writing some other shit.

364
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.520
<v 1>And um,</v>

365
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.190
<v 0>I did two of the law,
I think the two longest sets I've ever done.</v>

366
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.260
I did like 90 minutes and I never do that,
you know,

367
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.170
cause I watched the comedian one time do two hours and I was sitting in the

368
00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:33.520
crowd and write it in an hour.

369
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:37.420
I started looking at my watch and by like an hour 25,
my ass was falling asleep.

370
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:39.760
So I apologize to people in Boise,
in Bozeman.

371
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.800
I was just having a great fucking time.

372
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.970
And I was really excited about coming up there and,
uh,

373
00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:50.650
it did not disappoint that drive from Boise to Bozeman,
Montana.

374
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:52.490
You owe it to yourself to do that and go through,

375
00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:54.910
I know in what killed me is I didn't have the time.

376
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.940
I didn't have the time to go see the evil Knievel thing and I didn't have the

377
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.620
time to go into Yellowstone.
But you know,

378
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:03.880
I kind of took this highway that went right along Yellowstone and it was

379
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:08.320
absolutely fucking beautiful.
I saw wild horses,

380
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.380
you know,
granted they were on a reserve.

381
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.990
I took a picture and you could see the fence,

382
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:18.760
but they had a completely different fucking attitude that knows horses that,

383
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:21.790
you know,
you go down and ride across the fucking street on,
you know,

384
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.500
they hadn't been broken.
They still had the light in their eyes.
You know,

385
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.740
those other ones.
I like the ones,
you know,

386
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:33.790
in the fucking cubicles there in the Matrix,
somebody on their fucking back,

387
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.660
you know,
the Mustang stuff,
you know,
those are the guys.
Those are the guys.
Uh,

388
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.960
they're off the grid.
So anyways,
I saw them and then there was,

389
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.920
there was some place we could look at bears.
I love bears,
but I'm,
you know,

390
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.810
I'm also not a moron.
So two things.
One,

391
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.200
I don't want to see one that's wild and I don't want to see one in a fucking

392
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:54.910
cage.
I'll just watch him on TV.
And they had this bad,

393
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.100
the place where you could actually look at them and it was the worst fucking

394
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:01.160
name.
What?
What would you do if you had a bear sanctuary?

395
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.790
Just just for me.
What would you call it?

396
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.050
I'll give you five seconds to come up with the name and I guarantee you it's

397
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:11.720
better than what the fuck they called it.
Bear world.

398
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.283
<v 3>You know</v>

399
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.300
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

400
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.850
<v 2>Is anybody creative in your fucking circle of business partners?
Partners.</v>

402
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.590
We'll call it bear world.

403
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.990
You know there's bears and you know,

404
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.810
then the world.
So bear world.

405
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:39.990
I own them over a business.
I sell yard down the street.

406
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.400
Yarn world,
yarn.
Galaxy was was a choice.

407
00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:47.280
I was going to make it fucking more,
I couldn't even stop there.

408
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.930
Bear world,
you know,
I should go in there and they should be,
should

409
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.610
<v 0>be somebody in a fucking bear suit,
you know,
except it's not a joke.</v>

410
00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:58.570
He's actually trying to fucking pull it off.
Like he really is a bear,

411
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.220
you know,
if you're dumb enough to stop off at a place called bear world.

412
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.910
But I did have a good time in other places.
I went to this uh,

413
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.410
stopped off at this diner,
was actually a driving diner,

414
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.130
like fucking happy day ship,
but they weren't on roller skates and a,

415
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:19.470
he could pull right up,
but I still want,
I went in,
I wanted to see the,
the,

416
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:21.940
the place,
you know,
um,

417
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.170
see the pictures on the walls and all that type of stuff and I got a double

418
00:25:26.171 --> 00:25:30.910
cheeseburger there with tater tots and a root beer and I have to tell you,

419
00:25:30.911 --> 00:25:35.410
set the man,
it was fucking delicious.
You know,
it was even better.

420
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.990
It was a high quality piece of greasy meat because I didn't feel sick

421
00:25:40.991 --> 00:25:45.070
afterwards.
I felt a little like,
why the fuck did I do that?
You know,

422
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.310
as you're Gunna,
when you do something like that.
But,
uh,

423
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.690
I feel like they had a better quality burger than you usually find in some,

424
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.810
you know,
a place like that.
I'm going to give them a shout out here.

425
00:25:55.811 --> 00:25:56.800
What the fuck was it called?

426
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.140
It was called frost top driving in Idaho.

427
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.250
Uh,

428
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.250
it's been open since 1965 and I don't know if you ever wanted to just drive up

429
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.000
and not have to get out of your car and consume 4,000 of the most delicious

430
00:26:13.001 --> 00:26:16.630
fucking calories you ever had in your life.
I highly recommend that.

431
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.130
It was tremendous.
And,
uh,
I'm a big fan of root beer.

432
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.900
I love it,
but I don't fuck with soda because,
uh,
you know,

433
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.570
I know what it does to you,
but that's the,
you know,

434
00:26:28.571 --> 00:26:30.880
every once in a while when I hit the crack pipe,
that's what I get.

435
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.040
I get one of those fuckers,
either get one of those or if I can get one of the,

436
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:39.700
uh,
out in la they have,
uh,
they have the,
the,

437
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.640
the orange crush that actually has real sugar in it.

438
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.830
And it tastes like the shit when it,

439
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.080
when it first came out in the late seventies,
orange crush,

440
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.430
like put,
make it like put you in a better mood.

441
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.040
That's how good it fucking tasted.
Ah,
Jeez.
It sounds with a fucking days,

442
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.270
you know,
no stress,
no bullshit.
I had a fucking paper route.

443
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.480
Right.
I've had a job since I was in the third grade.

444
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.710
I was just thinking that the other day I had that paper route from third grade

445
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.800
to ninth grade to the point it was getting weird,
you know,

446
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.900
like my voice was changing and I'm like,
I don't,
uh,
help me,
uh,

447
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.140
to 60 for the week.
Uh,
what was it for the week?

448
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:25.080
$7 seven 25?
No,
no,
no.

449
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:28.290
It was like to 60 for the week and then if it was three weeks,

450
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.420
I remember it'd be like $7 and something cents.

451
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.990
And I would be nervous that the dad was going to answer and be fucking pissed.

452
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.920
Um,
I still remember time this time,

453
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.720
this personal me 1125 or something.
I finally got them when they were home.

454
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.100
They would just never fucking home.

455
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.880
And I finally got him and the guy actually laughed.
I still remember it.

456
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.460
He had this woodstove and he had the fucking thing cranking and it was freezing

457
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:57.500
out.
I was collecting,
I always hated collecting.
I,
like I said,

458
00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.040
I've always been such a fucking loner.

459
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.810
It's probably why I do this podcast by myself.

460
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.950
I just like the delivering of the fucking papers.

461
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.180
I loved it riding my bike,
talking to myself,
you know,

462
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.620
I used to ride around on my bike and I would,

463
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.040
I would be doing fucking Carlin and prior bits that I had memorized,

464
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.550
pretending I was doing it in front of the class and I was still too fucking

465
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:20.910
stupid to realize that that meant that I wanted to be a comedian.
I was a moron.

466
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.320
Anyways,

467
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.060
I still remember that 1125 my bill for the week was like,
I dunno,

468
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.770
like 18 bucks maybe.

469
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:33.090
And I got 1125 off of this house and I had like 30 something customers,

470
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.010
so I was fucking roll in it.
You know,
I didn't have a mortgage.

471
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.540
You don't have a mortgage and you don't have rent and you don't have a woman in

472
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:47.130
your life and you got like 22 bucks,
right?

473
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.860
You're not gonna fucking cut.
Yeah,
you're,
you're a millionaire.

474
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.840
So I went up to the local store.
What did I do?
I invest my money.

475
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.370
Did I save it up now?

476
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.970
I went down there and I bought a bunch of football cards in a fucking giant

477
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:04.380
orange crush
and I sat right out of the store,
opened all of them,

478
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.670
stick in a fucking debt,
awful piece of gum that always tastes like shit,

479
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.030
but you just,
you had to put it in there.
It was more sugar.

480
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:15.220
Just shoved that thing in my fucking mouth.
It was like covered with like I,

481
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.570
it's like,
it's like someone was plastering a wall,

482
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.360
you know that shit when it comes down and it gets you your eyebrows and shit.

483
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.860
That's what was like on the gum.

484
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.353
<v 3>I just sat there.</v>

485
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.760
<v 0>That's all I did.
And it was like one of the great fucking days of my life.</v>

486
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.080
So every once in a while,

487
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:37.800
if I find an orange crush and it actually has the real sugar,
you know,

488
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.110
you know that sensory sense memories,
shit,
a fucking drink,
that goddamn

489
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.720
<v 2>thing.
And I'm back out in front of that store.</v>

490
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.820
Nobody's fucking with me to just me and my little bicycle.
Oh,

491
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.090
little Billy red freckle face.
Anyways,

492
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.160
the fuck am I talking about?
Oh,
you know what I did?

493
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:59.290
I came up with a good nickname for Lucas Sealy.
Everybody,
Lucas Siegel,
you know,

494
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.270
you're driving a car with somebody for fucking eight hours.

495
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:04.210
You just start talking about everything.
And uh,

496
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.630
he was talking about playing high school football and everything.

497
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:11.290
And I don't know why,
I just started thinking Chris Berman,

498
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.820
what Chris Berman would call them and I came up with is Chris Berman nickname of

499
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.390
<v 5>uh,
what was it,</v>

500
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.430
<v 2>Lucas?
Now you see Lee,
now you don't,
and I was doing,</v>

501
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:25.510
I know it's Corny,

502
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.340
but it was great in the car ride because I was doing the whole thing with Chris

503
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.730
Berman going now you see Lee and then I was doing Tom Jackson yelling,

504
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.230
now you don't,
and then I would do that.

505
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.960
Like he just made a fucking move and we will,

506
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.690
if we were having the time of our fucking lives,
I swear to God,
I wish you all,

507
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:44.950
you guys could just do something on the road once you got to fucking do it.

508
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:46.983
You know,

509
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.790
why don't you just accidentally like do something to the building that you work

510
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:53.830
in,
you know,
not in crazy.

511
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:58.420
Just fucking make big one of the shit pipes the pipe where the shit goes out.

512
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:01.870
Just fuck that thing up at some Osha Shit.
There's no way you'd have to come in.

513
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:08.200
And what could you do on a day though?
I Dunno,
I drove from Boise to Bozeman.
Hey,

514
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:10.480
you know what?
It's your fucking life.
I don't have time to figure it out.

515
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.490
You guys figure it out.
Um,
the hell am I talking about here?

516
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.550
So anyways,
trying to look here.
Oh,

517
00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:21.400
so I'm in New Orleans and I'm going to try and be a good boy when I'm down here.

518
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:22.780
I'm going to try and not drink,

519
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.590
staying away from Bourbon Street and all those fucking animals down there.

520
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.543
The tits out,

521
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.840
walking around with their sunburned fucking area was,

522
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.710
I don't want to look at that shit.
I'm too old for it.
I can't do it anymore,

523
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:38.860
you know?
Um,
I'll wait.
I didn't finish telling the story,

524
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.650
so I went all the way up.
I know.
I'm all over the map.
Fuck you.
All right.
Um,

525
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.250
once again,
sorry for the clicks here,
I have to see where I'm at.
31.

526
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:49.450
How can you hear those people in the hall?

527
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.140
<v 0>Oh,
you know,
I was staying when I was in a</v>

528
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.733
<v 5>Boise.</v>

529
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.680
<v 0>I was tired as shit and I was staying in this,
uh,
when I stayed,</v>

530
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:04.510
I stayed in the western or the best western.
I know the fuck it was.
And a,

531
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:07.650
it was one of those things that looks like a hotel,
but it's not a hotel,
but,

532
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.160
but it's not a motel.
It's kind of a little bit of both.
It's like you're inside,

533
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:16.870
but I dunno,
it's just kind of flimsy doors and like the other side went out,

534
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.970
you know,
one side goes to the hall,

535
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:23.950
the other side is a glass door that they had these flimsy curtains and you open

536
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:25.210
it up in the fucking pools there.

537
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.660
So I'm tired and I want to do is just take a nap before the fucking show and

538
00:32:28.661 --> 00:32:31.090
there's a bunch of kids in the pool,
you know,

539
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:33.610
playing games and screaming and yelling and shit and you know,

540
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.890
which I can tolerate.

541
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.793
<v 5>MMM.</v>

542
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.310
<v 0>What they started running up and down the halls.</v>

543
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.660
You know how you're excited as a kid,
hotel pool and all that shit.

544
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:49.370
You run every way you fucking go.
I swear to God,
by the time,

545
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:52.340
like the fucking ninth kid ran down the hall,

546
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:57.140
I was having these fantasies of quickly opened the door and just close lining

547
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.110
one of these kids.
And uh,
yeah.

548
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.710
So one of the reasons why it's probably should never be a father because I

549
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.070
really violent thoughts like that.
Um,
you know,

550
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.160
I had one at the airport and I'll sit there and flew Alaska Airlines up to Boise

551
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:17.300
and uh,
they didn't offer that skycap service,

552
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.640
you know,
so I had to go into the,
the airport with all the animals.
Okay.

553
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.110
Life is all about making enough money so you could buy your way out of the,

554
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.740
out of the pig pen.
Do you know when you go to the airport,

555
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:34.810
the pig pen is right in on the other side of that fucking glass.
If you have a,

556
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.230
if you have a bag that you're checking,
but even then,
even if you,

557
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.740
even if you just have a carry on,

558
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.910
you're going to have to deal with how fucking stupid people are.

559
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.070
You just going to have to do,

560
00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:49.040
you can be standing behind somebody and you just have to deal with how fucking

561
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:52.570
stupid they are.
So I would rather,
you know,

562
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.140
just fucking pay.
Just what stands in the fucking line outside.

563
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.130
Have this guy.
Hey,
how are you Mr [inaudible]?
How's it going?
I'm good.

564
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:03.800
It's going great.
Tip of the hat is fucking a bunch of,
you know,

565
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.030
here's some money.
Good for you.
Yeah,
no thank you.

566
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.470
He is a great fucking tip for keeping me out of the pig pen.

567
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.400
God bless you.
That's how I look at it,
right?
So I show up Alaska,
they don't have,

568
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.230
you know,
they don't offer that.
What's right there is a fucking red flight.

569
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.670
It's like do okay.
You can't afford to pay those guys.

570
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.820
You know you're going to have enough gas in the plane.

571
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.920
You're going to have it on half a tank the whole way up,

572
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:30.970
trying to make it up you fucking dicks.
So anyway,

573
00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:32.810
so I walk in there and it's just a complete,

574
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.490
I'm actually writing a blog about it.

575
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.850
It's really dark and evil and I'm going to put it up on all things comedy.
Um,

576
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.050
I'm going to finish it in the next couple of days or so.

577
00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:47.051
But long story fucking short is it's a complete clusterfuck when you go in there

578
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.670
and they have one employee,
they have two lines,
they one employee for every,

579
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.740
for two lines,
you know,

580
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.850
one employee work in like two lines and everybody's huffing and puffing looking

581
00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:01.130
at their watches,
wondering why it's taking so fucking long.

582
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.680
And then when they get up there and it's their fucking turn,

583
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.180
they're not ready to go.
They're like Thurman Thomas,

584
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.530
they don't have the fucking helmet.

585
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.790
They were in the huddle without their fucking helmet.
And I swear to fucking God,

586
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.910
I sweat.
And I then what I do is I just start muttering every fucking curse word,

587
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.870
every fucking curse word I can put them.
Someone is always looking at me like,

588
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:28.790
like I'm like,
I'm the fucking guy who has the problem.
These fucking idiots.

589
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.990
They'll stand,
they'll stand like in a security line,

590
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.600
shaking their heads about how fucking long it's taking.

591
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.530
And then when get up there,
when it's their moment,
they're not ready to go.

592
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.690
Let me help you guys out here.
Not all of you,
but just for the fucking morons.

593
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.140
Okay?
And you should really take that as an insult.

594
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.610
Someone is dumb as me calls you a fucking moron when you standing in line,

595
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.453
<v 5>okay?</v>

596
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.210
<v 0>You have all this fucking time to take off all the shit that you're going to</v>

597
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:04.530
have to take off.
If you've got a jacket,
just shove it in the pockets.
Zip 'em up.

598
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.170
You got your watch and there you got your loose change.

599
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:09.900
You've got all your fucking metals in there,
okay?

600
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.920
You can undo your belt that's ready to go.
You know,

601
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:18.030
have you shoes ready to slip off mentally?
Think,

602
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.400
how many bins do I need?
Okay?

603
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.810
Fucking have a game plan.
You get up there,

604
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.110
you grabbed the binge and eat your fucking,

605
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:30.240
put them flush up with the person in front of you.

606
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.690
You put all your shit in them and when the person moves up in front of you,

607
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.280
you fucking move your shit too.

608
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.300
All right?
And that would cut down so much eye rolling in your fucking life.

609
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.150
Standing in those lines.
You know,
and this is just a waste.
It's a waste of time.

610
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.840
It's a waste of fucking time because people aren't going to get it.

611
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.101
They're not going to get,

612
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:54.510
they stand in line and he's fucking Tsa guys go over and over and over.

613
00:36:54.511 --> 00:36:58.200
If you have any liquids,
if you have a laptop,
you have shows they have,

614
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:00.000
you have this dad does that Bob.

615
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.810
They'll bug and they say at 900 times and it drives me fucking nuts.

616
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.240
I used to hate them for saying it 50 times going,

617
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.190
why the fuck do you keep saying that?

618
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:13.140
And then I just watched people in front of me if it okay to have toothpaste and

619
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:17.850
a bed go up.
Why?
I took off one shoe.
Is that okay?

620
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.720
Like that shit.
I actually have empathy for them.
No.

621
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.540
Um,
this is another thing too.
When you go really small mom and pop airports,

622
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:32.400
like the one I flew out this morning in Bozeman,
Montana.
Um,
it was so small.

623
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.790
My fucking map app,
whatever the fuck you call it,

624
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.400
the Steve jobs map app,
it couldn't even find it.
It took me to somebody's house.

625
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.990
Oh,
you want to hear a cursing when the sun's coming up over those beautiful

626
00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:49.170
mountains.
You know,
people broke thought they had a bear in the front yard.

627
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:53.640
That's how fucking upset I was.
Um,
anyways,

628
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.540
let's,
let's just get back to some happy shit.
So I go are we drive up to Bozeman,

629
00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:01.380
Montana and it's fucking absolutely gorgeous

630
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.390
<v 5>and uh,</v>

631
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.040
<v 0>actually promised him that I wouldn't tell him how nice it was so people</v>

632
00:38:07.041 --> 00:38:11.180
wouldn't go up there.
So I broke my promise.

633
00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:14.300
They apologize to the people up there,
but it was fucking beautiful.
I'm so,

634
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:16.010
so I have to say it was fucking gorgeous.

635
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.580
And I ended up doing an hour and 40 minutes,
so if you're asked,

636
00:38:21.581 --> 00:38:24.500
fell asleep,
I apologize.
I won't be doing that.
Uh,

637
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.560
I usually try to keep it to about an hour,
an hour and 10 minutes.

638
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.760
I broke the cardinal rule of leaving them wanting more,
but I,

639
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.920
there was something about the crowds,
like I felt like,
uh,
you know,

640
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.970
<v 2>they was psyched that I,
I made the trek up there.
So I did an extra long shower</v>

641
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.290
<v 0>when I was psyched to be up there.
And I played two really,</v>

642
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:47.530
really cool theaters and I'm definitely going to come back.

643
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.320
It didn't sell out either one,

644
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:54.870
which of course I love because that motivates me now.

645
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.060
Right now I've got to get this area that's like what the south used to be for
me.

646
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:02.500
I couldn't fucking,
you know,
I couldn't sell any tickets down.

647
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:05.770
I just kept going and going and going and going.
So I'm hoping the word of mouth,

648
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.160
we'll,
uh,
we'll spread out that way.

649
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.400
The very least they'll look at the red state tour and be like,
you know,

650
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.500
the tee shirt,
wonder who the fuck that is.

651
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.110
And hopefully I can come back and do it again.
But,
um,

652
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.450
because right now I'm supposed to be in deadwood,
South Dakota,
and I was,

653
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:25.960
I would have had the experience of driving all the way across Montana and South

654
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.560
Dakota,
which is something I really want to do.
And,
uh,
Oh,
last week,

655
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:33.010
speaking of motorcycles,
evidently that's the fucking place to ride a motorcycle.

656
00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:37.180
I've never seen so many motorcycles in my life and pickup trucks and trailers.

657
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.710
Um,
I was saying the Lucas,
like basically that if,
uh,

658
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.620
I think up there,
if you,

659
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.070
if you don't have a four door pickup truck with a trailer and some sort of

660
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:52.210
fucking dirt bike or four wheeler on the back,
that you,
you know,

661
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.880
I think you get gay bashed up there,
right?
Isn't it?

662
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.910
<v 2>Anyways.
Um,
all right,
let's,
let's do a couple more ads.</v>

663
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:06.260
<v 0>Get into your letters for this week.
Um,
where the hell is it?</v>

664
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.870
Sorry about the clicking.
Sorry about the clicking.

665
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.230
<v 2>Okay.
Legal Zoom,
everybody.
Most Americans don't have a will,</v>

666
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.040
but why?
That's really stupid to not have a will.
Um,

667
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.650
because you know people,

668
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:23.500
you're going to have loved ones fighting over it and the government comes in and

669
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:25.570
takes your stuff.
Bill,
why don't you just read the copy?

670
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.880
You don't have a law degree.
You know what?
You're right.

671
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.640
I'll go with you on this one.
You don't want the government.

672
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.940
You don't want the government.
You don't want government rules.

673
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Jesus dictating what happens to your property and minor children of Jesus.

674
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.600
You've got to put your kids in there too.
I leave my seat.

675
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.680
My daughter to my sister.
So why procrastinate?

676
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.460
Most people say too expensive or too time consuming.
Uh,

677
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.240
my answer to that people is legal zoom.com too expensive.

678
00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:59.020

reasonable prices,

Time consuming.

we're not talking some fill in the blank form here.

681
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.660

zoom.com legal zoom can provide self help service but at your specific uh,

695
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.190
direction or connect you with an attorney but they are not a law firm.
Um,

696
00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.090
this is actually something that really isn't a joke.

697
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.350
<v 0>I got to unfortunately had,
uh,</v>

698
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.930
I've had so many friends die in and out of this uh,

699
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.640
business and obviously,
um,
you know,

700
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.960
they were too young to go so a lot of them didn't have wills,
some did,

701
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.310
some didn't.
And the ones that did it was one less thing to worry about.

702
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:21.890
So you know,
if you got people you care about,
you really should do it.
Okay,

703
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.420
that's the end of my little law left turn there.
Alright,
Hulu plus everybody,

704
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:29.300
I'm sure you've tried hulu.com but I want to tell you about Hulu Plus

705
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.900
<v 2>Hulu plus lets you watch thousands of hit shows anytime,</v>

706
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:37.520
anywhere streaming on your TV or goal or on the golf with your smart phone or

707
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:40.940
tablet.
Why stand in line or ride a train and just stare at your feet?

708
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.021
Why do that?

709
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:45.410
You could be watching your favorite shows on Hulu plus Google plus is a great

710
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:50.330
way to binge watch your favorite shows.
Um,
I missed,
what am I saying?

711
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.340
Didn't,
what are they doing here?

712
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.760
Why are you telling me that I'm going to catch up on this shit.

713
00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.350
Stop Writing Shit for me to say here.
I like Hulu plus.
Okay.

714
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:02.090
I think you should get it.
I want to get it.

715
00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:05.080
You don't really need to pepe makeup stuff about stuff I'm not watching

716
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.670
anyways.
Um,
that on Hulu plus if you ever decide to,

717
00:43:12.671 --> 00:43:17.410
if I ever decide to watch all of Lost Hulu plus is the place for all that you

718
00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:19.330
know,
I just realized I have to apologize.
The Google plus,

719
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.250
they're just using this as a jump off point.

720
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:24.730
I'm supposed to put in the shows that I'm watching on Hulu plus and like an

721
00:43:24.731 --> 00:43:26.410
idiot.
I'm taking this literally,

722
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.100
this is why I didn't come up with Hulu plus cause I'm a moron.

723
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.960
But the people at Hulu plus they are not,
it's only seven 99 a month,

724
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.680
seven 99 for all the shows and movies you can watch.
What more do you want?

725
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.920
Do they got to show up and just give you a TV or a smart phone?

726
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.200
Catch up on current shows.
Binge on all your old favorite favorites in our catch.

727
00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:49.660
A great movie.
You can do it all at Hulu plus right now.

728
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.680
You can try Hulu plus for a couple of weeks for free on me when you go to my

729
00:43:53.681 --> 00:43:57.580

trial.
And so that they know that I sent you.

733
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.390
It helps us get to want to do now instead of stuttering.

734
00:44:10.391 --> 00:44:13.690
I'll just slow down the sentence.
It helps us keep up the lights,

735
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.840
what it helps us keep the lights on and gives you a better deal.

736
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:20.170
One more time for the extended free trial.
Hulu plus.com/bill.
Cool.

737
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.710
<v 0>All right.
Is that it for the uh,
the reeds for this week?</v>

738
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.930
I think we got one more of this.
Space it out.
Okay.
Here we go.
Oh,
by the way,

739
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:33.000
I want to talk about something else here.
Uh,
people keep,
uh,

740
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.880
oh by the way,
that topic,
I actually,
I just write out topics.

741
00:44:37.881 --> 00:44:40.050
I can make an a setlist just shit I want to talk about.

742
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.480
And I tried to write down airport etiquette and uh,

743
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.130
before you laugh at me,

744
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.650
write it down on your post it there and it gets one of those words I've used a

745
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:56.280
zillion times and I've read it and that a zillion times it's,

746
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:59.190
you can tell I don't read that much.
I had probably read at least 500 times.

747
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.220
Do you think it would stick in my fucking hard drive at that point I tried to

748
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:04.680
spell etiquette.
I knew I didn't know how to spell it,
so I thought,
all right,

749
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:07.530
I'll just give it a shot and I'll be in the vicinity and the computer would be

750
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:10.450
like,
oh,
are you trying to spell this?
MMM.

751
00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.510
<v 2>I spelled etiquette e,
d.
I,
c,
a,
t,
e.</v>

752
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:19.840
<v 0>And,
uh,
other than underlining it and read the computer had nothing,
had no</v>

753
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.310
Noah [inaudible]

754
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.610
<v 2>didn't even say like eight a cat or something,
you know,
etiquette e.
T.
I.
Q.
U.
E.
T.</v>

755
00:45:28.611 --> 00:45:29.444
T.
E.

756
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.810
<v 0>All right.
Uh,
oh two things.
I had a question.</v>

757
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.921
I'm in New Orleans.

758
00:45:34.921 --> 00:45:38.160
Does anybody know of a rehearsal space out here where I could play drums?

759
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.150
You know,
they have drums already set up and I can just rent something,
you know,

760
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:45.900
something reasonable,
let me know.
Cause uh,

761
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.110
there's a lot of downtime when you do these things.
So,

762
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.080
and I don't want to be getting in trouble,
you know,

763
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.190
becoming belief Poeboy fat face down here because all the delicious seafood that

764
00:45:56.191 --> 00:46:00.840
they stick in a fry later and it tastes awesome.
This fucking city is great,

765
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.710
but it's going to give you a heart attack if you stay here for three weeks.

766
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:06.870
So I'm trying to,
you know,

767
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.200
<v 2>did the supermarket I bought,
so Nana's and apples,</v>

768
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:16.080
I'm trying to get a fridge in here.
I got to do something.
Oh by the way,
somebody,

769
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.120
uh,
you know,

770
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.610
somebody sent me something that was saying shaming fat people,

771
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.020
fat shame does not work.
Um,
but you know what,
I actually,

772
00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:28.450
I actually had a couple people that said I've actually motivated them.

773
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.730
I had this guy today but that she really made my day,
this guy say,

774
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:33.970
listen to the podcast,
you know,

775
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.540
and he took the good ribbing that I was given fatties out there and he started

776
00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:39.700
eating one giant salad a day and working out,

777
00:46:39.701 --> 00:46:40.710
doing whatever the hell he was doing.

778
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.890
The guy went from like two 20 something or to 30 something.

779
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.890
Dan,
he's down to one 69,

780
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.150
one 69.
So a bravo to you.
That made me feel great to read that tweet.

781
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.190
And uh,
you know,
who knows,
this could turn into a great show.
You know,

782
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:01.680
I'll do my biggest loser except I won't be nice.

783
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:04.190
I'll just sit there and I'll come out like a comedian now.

784
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.080
Just have a microphone.
I just trash it every day.

785
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:09.720
I'll just sit there and make it fun.
Are you on?
That would be two weeks.

786
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.110
I'd start off maker.
I do it in a,
in a,
in a,
in a tough love way.

787
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

788
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.450
<v 2>Jesus Christ.
What channel would that be?
How high up on the fucking dial.</v>

789
00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:18.284
Would that be?

790
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:19.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

791
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:23.050
<v 2>Right there.
That no network's going to touch that.
Nobody under channel 700.
Yeah.</v>

792
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.230
<v 0>Fuck with that Nigga.
I'll just do it on my,
I'll do a web series.
I'll do it.
I'm,</v>

793
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.400
I'm on my own website.
Oh.
Freckled face production.

794
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:36.470
<v 2>Um,
all right,
here we go.
Letters for the week.
Serbian love.</v>

795
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.440
Look at this.
See that you start learning capitals around the world.

796
00:47:39.441 --> 00:47:43.550
You start getting a,
you start getting letters from people.
This is great.

797
00:47:43.551 --> 00:47:46.700
I love when I get a letters from people from other countries.

798
00:47:46.701 --> 00:47:50.000
I've never been to Serbia.
Everybody.
Do you know what the is?

799
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.420
I knew it two weeks ago,
but I haven't done it in two weeks.
It's new knowledge.

800
00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.290
<v 5>What the fuck is it?
It's not bright,</v>

801
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:03.950
bright Bratislava.
Nah.
Is it?
I'm an asshole.
I'm sorry.

802
00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.470
Yeah.
The Serbs eat the Bronx.
That's how I remembered it brought a Slava,
I think.

803
00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:10.180
I Dunno.

804
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.850
<v 2>Hey Billy Hill.
I liked that Benny Hill.
We be beginning.
Um,</v>

805
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.740
this is girl who lives someplace around my place.
I like this guy.

806
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:22.510
He's being nice and vague.
This sounds scummy already go.
I like your sir.
Um,

807
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.410
I don't know where,
but I see her around every so often.
Oh,

808
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.210
you just don't know where she lives.
I thought you was saying,
Hey,

809
00:48:28.211 --> 00:48:30.400
this is this chick.
She lives somewhere around my place.

810
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:31.360
I don't want to get into it,

811
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:35.800
but let's just say she suck my Dick in an establishment that had a roof where

812
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:40.780
you wouldn't get wet if it rained.
Um,
the problems are number one,
I'm 15.

813
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.190
It's sucks.
No,
it doesn't do it.
It's great to be 15.
It's great to be 15.

814
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

815
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.260
<v 2>You know,
you got a lot of freedom.
Um,</v>

816
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.910
and so is she.
Okay,

817
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.990
so what's the problem?
Jesus Christ,
what do you want to do with this girl?

818
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.741
He goes,

819
00:48:58.741 --> 00:49:03.741
we just finished elementary school in Serbia and we used to go to separate

820
00:49:03.751 --> 00:49:07.680
grades and number two,
I think I love her.
She's really smart,

821
00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:12.480
beautiful and funny.
The usual and me looks wise.
On a scale of one to 10.

822
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.190
I'm slightly above five.
Jesus,
come on man.

823
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.660
All right.
First of all,

824
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:21.930
my first piece of advice is sit up straight when I'm reading this to you.

825
00:49:21.931 --> 00:49:25.660
Come on man.
We going to build you up by the end of this,
uh,

826
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:30.770
five feet out tall and I like to waste my time listening to a 40 year old pasty

827
00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:34.440
fellow who complains about his big head and overblown chelation.

828
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.200
My problem is we haven't ever had the chance to properly introduce ourselves to

829
00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:40.980
one another.

830
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.760
I sometimes see you're on the tram and wave to her just to make sure she

831
00:49:44.761 --> 00:49:47.430
acknowledges my existence.
That's good dude.
You're in the game.

832
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.210
You got your uniform on,
you got your foot on the top step of the dugout.

833
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.160
You're not in the batter's box yet.

834
00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.130
You're not even on the on deck circle swinging the two beds,
but you're there.

835
00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:00.480
All right.
I like this.
Okay.
You making positive moves here.

836
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.370
Okay,
so he goes,
I want to ask her.
I want to ask her on a date,

837
00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.370
but I don't know her yet.
Can you tell me what to do?

838
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.840
Greens from Serbia come over some time so that we can kidnap you.

839
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:21.530
Hey,
was that the place where uh,
did that place used to be?

840
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:22.880
Uh,
the,
the,
the,

841
00:50:22.881 --> 00:50:26.780
the country that Clinton bombed because he stuck that cigar in that girl's Twat.

842
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.570
Sorry about that.
You know,
whether that be fucking ridiculous.

843
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:37.190
I go over there and I take an ass kicking for Bill Clinton.
You know,

844
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.350
I just think the fact that my name is bill,
that that right there,

845
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.520
there would be enough for them then it was out.
So what is your prime,

846
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:46.760
you want to ask around on a date where you wave to her?
This is what I,
you know,

847
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:47.330
look,

848
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:51.620
you can't just wave to somebody on the tram and then just get in their grill and

849
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:55.670
ask 'em out.
You know,
this you got to like,
cause you kind of know her,

850
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.680
you know what I mean?
Look,
if you just meet a girl on a train,

851
00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:00.770
if you meet a girl on the train,
this is what you'd do.
This is what I used to do.

852
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.340
I would wait for somebody to do something like some crazy person to get on and

853
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:05.540
they would do something fucked up.

854
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.570
I would hope that that would happen because I didn't have game that would just

855
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:10.730
walk up and start talking to somebody.
But in New York,

856
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:12.590
somebody always did something fucking weird.

857
00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.493
<v 5>And then,</v>

858
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:16.390
<v 2>well,
you know,</v>

859
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.900
there's that moment where somebody doing something fucked up that strangers look

860
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:21.430
at each other like,
are you fucking kidding me?

861
00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.820
And that's like an opportunity to kind of maybe say something funny.

862
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.820
You sit next to him.
He sat across from them.

863
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:31.990
I didn't have sitting across from you gang,
who's getting hill?

864
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:36.010
I didn't have a lot of game.
Why the fuck are you asking me?
Um,
all right,

865
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.590
what would I do here?
All right,
so you're doing that.
Why don't you,
uh,

866
00:51:38.591 --> 00:51:42.700
why don't you properly introduce yourself,
start chatting with them,

867
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.870
you know,
and don't introduce yourself.
Tipping your hand.

868
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:51.250
Like you're going to ask her out.
Like,
Hello,
my name is Lourdes Serbia Jr uh,

869
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.990
you know,
getting down on one knee.

870
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.350
Just say what's up to a shoot the shit with her and make her fucking laugh.

871
00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:01.720
You know,
you gotta,
you gotta get yourself in our world.
You know,

872
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.850
who knows.
She could be on the other side of that train.
Go.

873
00:52:06.851 --> 00:52:11.170
Why is that con just waving to me?
You know,
why doesn't he come over here?

874
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.040
Doesn't he know that I'd like to,
uh,

875
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.380
go to the Serbian Cineplex if it still stands up.

876
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.690
I was just picturing a bombed out movie theater that's like sort of a drive in

877
00:52:22.691 --> 00:52:27.160
but also has seats.
Uh,
I'm sorry.
I am the ugly American right now.
You know what?

878
00:52:27.161 --> 00:52:28.420
Because you wrote me to me,

879
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:30.610
I'm going to try and learn a little bit more about your country.

880
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:35.950
Is that over there near a Bosnian Herzegovina

881
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:42.050
Slovenia,
Jubal Gang,
Jana,

882
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.060
whatever the fuck it is.
I don't know.
I'm not gonna lie to Ya.

883
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.860
I'm going to be honest or eastern Europe scares me for that exact reason.

884
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.810
There's,
there's uh,
I did,

885
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:54.010
you know what they should do rather than just showing you like they should in a,

886
00:52:54.011 --> 00:52:55.260
in a geographical way,

887
00:52:55.270 --> 00:53:00.160
show you where all the countries are and then also in everybody's country,

888
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:03.850
they should,
they should have kidnap countries,

889
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.110
cool countries,
cool.
But it's not worth going.

890
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.890
Uh,
and this place sucks or whatever.
You know what I mean?

891
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:16.360
They should group them up like that,
you know,
could get kidnapped here.

892
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.960
You could have a weed,
you know,

893
00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:22.870
you can have your boogie board stolen and replaced with weed and now you're

894
00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:26.700
going to get fucking put to death.
Was that in Bali?
Um,

895
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.980
I dunno.
So that's what I would do.
All right.

896
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.770
I think it's great that you're actually,
uh,
you know,

897
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.270
waving to this girl and everything.
This is a great thing about women.

898
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.800
They're all right with you if you're a five,
if you have a personality,

899
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.860
okay.
If you're a,
you know,

900
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:48.750
what's great thing about being a five is you weed out all this stuck up cons

901
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.290
cause they're not going to fuck with you because you're a five.

902
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:57.290
And then you know the materialistic and like cons

903
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.240
when they're in their teams,

904
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.310
how they're materialistic because nobody really has money at 15 they're

905
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:08.670
materialistic with looks.
And as they get older,

906
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.010
what it ends up being is the,
you know,
those cons end up going for the fives,

907
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.240
the bald fat guys,
but they're going after their money.
So this deal,

908
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.190
you're a five,
you probably not.
I bet you're like a strong seven if not an eight.

909
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:28.250
All right,
you just got,
I think it'd be too hard on yourself.
All right,

910
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.370
so
what am I trying to say here?

911
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.870
If you're an average looking guy,
you,
your chances of meeting a sweetheart,

912
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.240
how are are much higher.
If you're the good looking guy,

913
00:54:40.241 --> 00:54:43.210
the quarterback on the team or the fucking playing soccer or whatever the fuck

914
00:54:43.211 --> 00:54:45.910
you do over there,
you know,
it's like you're a celebrity.

915
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.740
You don't know which cheerlead is gonna blow your first and that just Yay.

916
00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.550
You don't know what's going on,
you know,
but you,
you are actually,

917
00:54:54.551 --> 00:54:57.850
you have the kind of looks where you can actually sit there and from a distance,

918
00:54:57.851 --> 00:55:02.230
fall in love with somebody in pine for somebody and wave to them on the train

919
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:06.130
and then be like,
oh,
what did I say?
Something?
You know what?
Fuck this.

920
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:09.340
You think you're going to marry this girl?
This is the,
this is the one.

921
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.660
You walk up to this girl and you get,

922
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.710
you get all your fucking awkward shit out of the way.

923
00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:19.630
Learn how to talk to a woman with this woman.
Okay?
And keep those,
those uh,

924
00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.870
those skills sharp because one day,
you know,

925
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.720
when you do meet the love of your fucking life,
not saying this girl isn't,

926
00:55:25.721 --> 00:55:26.261
but if you do,

927
00:55:26.261 --> 00:55:30.920
why you won't be writing a dumb fuck half a world away.

928
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.530
All right,
hope that helped Gel.
All right,
last week I talked about tattoos,

929
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.320
people who have inspirational sentences written on their rib cage.
Um,

930
00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:42.851
that's what I love.

931
00:55:42.851 --> 00:55:45.070
And it's on the fucking rib cage where they can't even read it.

932
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.770
So it's like that's clearly for the rest of us.

933
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.820
You as you've learned this lesson and it's so important to you that you have to

934
00:55:51.821 --> 00:55:55.300
turn yourself into a fucking posted.
All right.
Now I've got a lot of,

935
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.890
lot of emails about this.

936
00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:00.760
Lot of people like defending their paragraphs,

937
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.630
you know,
some people saying,
look,

938
00:56:04.631 --> 00:56:07.570
I had hope written on my arm and if I didn't,

939
00:56:07.571 --> 00:56:11.770
if I didn't see that every day that I,
I,
I,
that I would have forgot.
You know,

940
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.800
I might be a moron.

941
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.270
I just don't understand why you just can't write that down on a post it,

942
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.150
I have a post it right here,
right on.
No,
this is what I have.

943
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.750
Eat healthy practice drums,
no booze,

944
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.700
have fun giant salad every day if possible for dinner.
Okay.

945
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.640
Post it right on the mirror.
Wake up in the morning.

946
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:32.710
There it is and it just game plan.

947
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.670
I don't even have that written on my fucking rib cage.

948
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.270
Then there was other people though,
you know,

949
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:44.290
somebody who had like never forget and they were fighting over in Iraq and they

950
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:47.470
lost a bunch of their buddies over there.
I'm not talking about that shit.
Okay.

951
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.370
You know what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about dead stitch in time.

952
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:53.920
Saves the fucking book,
but the bill,
you know,

953
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.390
it's not always the,
the rook that queens the night,

954
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.680
sometimes it's the pon whatever the fuck.
You know,
that dumb shit.

955
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.170
So yeah,

956
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:09.940
I got a lot and I got a lot of emails from women with feet tattoos that are no

957
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:11.350
longer want to listen to the podcast.

958
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.310
Um,
don't take the jokes too seriously.

959
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:21.180
People saying this is the class they think why you can't take jokes.
Seriously.

960
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:26.200
You can't do it because people are selfish.
That person with the foot tattoo,

961
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.720
they laughed about all the fat fuck stuff.
Unless they're a fat fuck too.

962
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.450
Then they'd have a fat foot and in a hole they could have a whole mural put on

963
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:38.520
their chubby foot.
All right.
Hey,
this is,
this is a,
uh,

964
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:42.700
this is an email from a tattoo artist.
He said,
Bill,

965
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:46.060
just heard your podcast where you talk about assholes getting their favorite

966
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.450
poem,
Bible verse or inspirational quote tattooed on them.

967
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.170
I've been tattooing for 25 years and let me tell you,

968
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.380
this is the worst trend in tattooing yet.

969
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.210
We all hate doing this shit and managing.

970
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:01.780
He's talking about the tattoo artists at our shop.

971
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:05.140
We call the customers that want this.

972
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.910
They want this crap.
Skin poets,
the tattoos suck to do.

973
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.990
It's like a school assignment and they don't fit the shape of the body very
well.

974
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:18.130
We get a lot of those spiritual yuppy fucks coming in and wanting something they

975
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:22.840
saw on a tiger woods poster
or what?

976
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:26.470
Like just do it.
Um,
no fear.

977
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:28.150
What are some of those dumb ones they have?

978
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:33.280
I hate those fucking things,
you know,

979
00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.180
24,
seven,
you know,
I hate those things.

980
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:42.450
Unless a little kids wearing them,
then they're fucking hilarious.

981
00:58:42.451 --> 00:58:45.840
I saw a little kid,
he had a shirt on that said,
play me or trade me.

982
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.660
And I thought it was fucking hilarious.
Um,

983
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:52.720
but you know,
if you're an adult and you get to walk around with,

984
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.620
this is what I do on your tee shirt.
I don't know.

985
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:01.240
Um,
anyways,
he says he continues.

986
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:04.270
He says you really want to read the same paragraph over and over.

987
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:08.350
I think it all started with Megan Fox.
I guess she has shit written on her.

988
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:13.060
He said,
I miss doing butterflies down by the ass crack.
Uh,
love the show.

989
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:17.000
Played for the white sometimes and go
see.

990
00:59:17.001 --> 00:59:21.220
We all like the go fuck yourself dude.
This guy literally did not use any spaces

991
00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:26.060
or whatever.
I read it well enough.
Well there you go.
That's from a tattoo.

992
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:29.900
Artists Tattoo artists don't like doing it.
They call you skin poets.
So whatever.

993
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.670
There you go.
Skin poets.
All right.
And I'm not talking about,
look,
you know,

994
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.570
if your dad died and you got something on,
I'm not talking about that shit.

995
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:42.710
All right.
I'm talking about where you got to have some sort of,
you know,

996
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:46.550
something deep,
man,
that's like,
uh,

997
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.120
I dunno.
You know what I'm saying?

998
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:53.900
I'm too dumb to fucking even say what I already said.
All right,
Bill,

999
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:58.370
this is from New Zealand.
I believe this is great.
This,

1000
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:03.500
this says you're the,
you're the only ginger I do.
Hey Bill.

1001
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:08.480
I'm a 31 year old girl from New Zealand.
Hey,
say what's up to Phil Rudd for me,

1002
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:12.080
William.
Um,
anyways,

1003
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:16.310
I stumbled across you on youtube a while ago and I began listening to you in the

1004
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:19.090
cab.
I like to drive along,

1005
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.410
cracking up like a nutcase over the shit you say,

1006
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:24.400
while other drivers look at me and wonder why I'm stoned.
Ah,

1007
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.510
well this is why I do the podcast and also to hit my kids.
Uh,

1008
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.310
she says I got my husband and kids hooked on you.
Youtube.

1009
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.920
No need to pay me for the publicity.
Well,
I hope they're not listening.

1010
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:38.120
Considering you just told you,
said you'd fuck me.
I'm,

1011
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.980
I'm sure you're just joking.
Right.
There you go.

1012
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.910
Just in case you get in fucking case,
your husband plays for the all blacks,

1013
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.750
you know,
just give you a fucking soccer knee to the face.
Or is that rugby?

1014
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.320
The rugby,
I dunno.
Um,

1015
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:55.670
I also want to share that with also want to share with you the fact that you are

1016
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:58.940
the only fancy pants.

1017
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.900
I never heard that I have ever wanted to bang.
So feel special.

1018
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.300
Sweet.
Do you realize how fucking condescending this is?

1019
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.533
<v 1>You know,</v>

1020
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.250
<v 2>as you sit out there and that fucking island in the middle of goddamn nowhere on</v>

1021
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:21.251
the half of the planet that doesn't do shit on the of the other hemisphere was

1022
01:01:21.321 --> 01:01:24.920
the last time anybody from that hemisphere did anything.
Jesus.

1023
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:26.420
How many people might pissing off right now?

1024
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.580
This has nothing to do with that hemisphere.
It has to do with this.

1025
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.170
Like I should feel fucking,

1026
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:32.363
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1027
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.350
<v 2>why you acting like I put out a personal ad said no one ever fucked me before.</v>

1028
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.090
So feels special.

1029
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:42.580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1030
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.910
I don't understand this new,
this.

1031
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.920
It's like it's happened since I started doing this podcast where all these like

1032
01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.200
um,
this red,

1033
01:01:56.201 --> 01:01:59.710
I don't know if it was underground hatred of redheads or everybody watched that

1034
01:01:59.711 --> 01:02:00.860
South Park episode.

1035
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:04.270
You're a bunch of hacks and you're fucking stealing off of their jokes.

1036
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:09.200
But I've had a tremendous fucking life.
It's really,
and I,

1037
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:13.600
I never,
you know,
I guess when I was younger,
when I had orange hair,
you know,

1038
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:17.820
I felt like a fucking freak and I took the beat downs,
you know,

1039
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.050
but once you were in adults and what?
Fuck sweetheart,
I don't need sympathy.

1040
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:25.320
Pussy from half a fucking world the way.
Alright,

1041
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.300
go fuck yourself.
I should feel privileged.

1042
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.680
I don't know what the fuck you look like.

1043
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.510
Do you know what kills me too about this,
this,

1044
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:35.700
this fucking red hedge hatred shit.

1045
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:39.250
The amount of fucking people that I,

1046
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.640
that come up to me and I'm even good luck and go,

1047
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:46.340
I'm better looking than they are.
I've been better.
I live a fat fuck man.

1048
01:02:46.341 --> 01:02:49.710
Tinted Brown haired dude coming up to me,

1049
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:52.170
giving me shit about having fucking red hair.
It's like,
dude,

1050
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:57.000
if you looked at yourself,
how many fucking mirrors do need to look at yourself?

1051
01:02:57.001 --> 01:03:00.990
You Tub a shit.
Look at your fucking nose.
You know,

1052
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.920
fucking shark fin in the middle of your goddamn face.
I've got a great nose.

1053
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.180
I have a nice job.
I have beautiful blue,
blue eyes.
I like myself.

1054
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:11.820
That's all I need.
All right lady.

1055
01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.350
I don't even go to New Zealand to get some fucking on the side.
Married Pussy.

1056
01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.410
Jesus fucking Christ.

1057
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:27.400
<v 3>Anyways,
I just stopped reading that.</v>

1058
01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.810
<v 2>Yeah,
that's another thing too.
I've had,
everyone will say it saved me like,
yeah,</v>

1059
01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:35.230
you're good looking for a redhead and I just want to say like,
you know what?

1060
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:38.290
You're not that good looking for,
uh,
for a person.

1061
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:49.340
Yeah.
I,
I'm,
I,
I'm fine with how I fucking look.
So you guys,
you don't,

1062
01:03:49.341 --> 01:03:53.480
you don't need to have sympathy.
I don't mean like,
I'm fucking doing great.

1063
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:59.030
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you for the,
uh,
trying to cheer me up with,

1064
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:03.290
bestowing your,
your sacred pussy on me from the other hemisphere.

1065
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:08.870
Um,
it's unreal.
She lives in a country.
Australia makes one of,

1066
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.033
okay.

1067
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.320
She should be happy if a fucking warthog climbs up are goddamn stairs.

1068
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.280
They have worn hogs out there.

1069
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.143
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1070
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:22.760
<v 2>Anyways.
All right,
let's,
let's,
let's put it here.
Aggressive Douche.</v>

1071
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:28.190
Hey Bill.
I'd been with my wife for six years and,
uh,

1072
01:04:28.191 --> 01:04:29.980
we've been married for one.
Congratulations.

1073
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:34.910
He said when we first started dating a guy she knew turned up drunk on her

1074
01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:39.860
doorstep,
professing his love for her.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1075
01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.150
Jesus.
Wow.
He said,
I wasn't mad.

1076
01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:49.710
She's great.
And I couldn't blame them.
Well,
look,
if you have any empathy,

1077
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.390
I would just be looking like Jesus Christ.

1078
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.310
It's bad enough when they bring up an exit dinner.

1079
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:55.260
Forget about the guy shows up at your house.

1080
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.870
Z out there like John Cusack with a boom box over his head wearing a fucking

1081
01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:07.220
trench coat down.
Chew.
Forget about me.

1082
01:05:07.221 --> 01:05:10.400
What was that song?
I never saw that say anything.
I think I saw part of it.

1083
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:13.970
I've always been bored with the love story.
Um,

1084
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:17.000
there's something wrong with me anyways.
Uh,
this means we've,

1085
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.900
<v 0>well,
I screwed up here.
Oh,
she's great.
And I couldn't blame him.
Uh,</v>

1086
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.900
he goes on to say he was dating her friend at the time though,

1087
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.310
and they are now engaged.
Oh.

1088
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:33.940
So he went from your now wife to bang,

1089
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:38.500
and you're now wife's friend and then realized that he had a better thing.

1090
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:43.560
Yeah.
Jesus,
isn't it
fucking steamboat?

1091
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.760
All this sunburn.
Tourists down there.

1092
01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.340
Hold the pull boys and fucking local,

1093
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.910
the IPO IPA would have the fuck that is

1094
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.480
<v 1>okay.</v>

1095
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.960
<v 0>Ah Right.
We get it.
You're on a Tom Sawyer boat gives a fuck.</v>

1096
01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.260
<v 1>All right.</v>

1097
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.760
<v 0>Hey,
that's kind of Nice.
I shouldn't get mad at that.
That gives it a uh,</v>

1098
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:08.440
maybe you guys thought I was lying.
That was actually in my house and uh,

1099
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.820
I misplaced the court.
All right.
There's no fucking steam boats.

1100
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.040
You don't have your times at been here.

1101
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.440
And I just found out that that's the Mississippi River.
I know that.

1102
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:20.800
I knew that the Mississippi River emptied out into the Gulf here,

1103
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:25.030
but for some reason I thought it was on the western side of the state.
I Dunno.

1104
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:28.360
Anyways,
let's,
let's plow ahead.
Um,
so anyways,

1105
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:32.140
he was dating her friend at the time though,
and now they are engaged.

1106
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.310
This means we've been,

1107
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:37.750
this means we've been for drinks with this couple of few times and they came to

1108
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:39.880
our wedding.
Oh my God,

1109
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:47.350
you didn't put the Kibosh on there.
Yeah,
that's hard though,

1110
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:51.280
right?
Cause that's the x.
But he's with

1111
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.470
her friend.
Oh God.
What did I see?

1112
01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:01.120
You got to elope.
That's the way to do it.
Anyways,
he goes,
I'm pretty laid back,

1113
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.240
so I've been polite.
It was six years ago now,
over the last year.

1114
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:07.090
He started liking her photos on Facebook,

1115
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:12.370
pestering her when she's out with the girls.
Oh No,
dude.

1116
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:16.300
I'm trying to message her on Facebook.
He must know.
She would tell me all this.

1117
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:21.350
So he did
wait.
He must know.

1118
01:07:21.351 --> 01:07:25.700
She would tell me that all this.
So does he mistake my politeness for weakness?

1119
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.810
Yeah,
absolutely he does.

1120
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.960
He has a good woman already and I don't want them to break up.

1121
01:07:29.961 --> 01:07:34.340
Do I punched him in the face or smile as he ogles my wife.
Thanks.

1122
01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:38.360
And Go fuck yourself from some dude.
No,
dude,
you need to address this situation.

1123
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.190
Yeah.
You gotta have you gotta have a talk with the guy.

1124
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:44.223
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1125
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.880
<v 0>Oh,
but wait,
but they're friends.</v>

1126
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:53.000
This is what you do.
All right.

1127
01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:55.460
This is one of these confrontations you've got to have in a public place.

1128
01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:57.563
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1129
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.770
<v 0>tell me when to go out and have a beer or,</v>

1130
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.660
or are grab a sandwich or something like that and uh,

1131
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.910
go out and just sit down,

1132
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.590
ask him how he's doing and all that type of shit and just say,
listen,

1133
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.790
<v 1>uh,
you know,</v>

1134
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.130
me and my wife

1135
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.190
<v 0>are good friends with you guys.
And I'd like it to stay that way.</v>

1136
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.370
Would you like it to stay that way?
And at which point is he's gay.

1137
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.840
He's already going to know what the fuck you getting at and just say,
listen,

1138
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.860
I need you to

1139
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:33.680
stop contacting my wife on Facebook.
All right?

1140
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.560
You want to hang out as a couple?
You know,
go on and get some wine.

1141
01:08:38.561 --> 01:08:42.860
Eat some cheese,
tell some fucking stories.
That's fine.
But,
uh,
you know,

1142
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.500
other than that,
you know,
you,
you need,
you need to back off.
Okay.

1143
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:51.260
And I'm asking you this one time politely.
I'm not,
I didn't,

1144
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:55.310
I'm not saying anything to anybody else.
I'm just telling you man to man.
Okay.

1145
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:59.630
And,
uh,
you know what the,
what the fuck's he going to do?

1146
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.850
He can't go home and tell his wife that,
you know,

1147
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.490
that he's been,
you know,
stocking your wife.
He can't do that.

1148
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.590
And um,

1149
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:17.560
and make it even more uncomfortable and tell them that,
uh,

1150
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.630
my wife knows that I'm here at Duke saying this to you too,
by the way.

1151
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:24.530
So then it's,
that's,
it's just a close that,
all right.

1152
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:27.410
You got to nip that in the buck because that is,

1153
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:32.780
that is the beginning of,
of a creepy movie,

1154
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.630
if you know what I mean.
You know,
I'm actually,

1155
01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:37.970
I actually got nervous halfway through that given you that advice.

1156
01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:42.050
That's why I was saying get into a,
uh,
public place.

1157
01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.440
You got to nip that fucking thing in the butt and I would actually have a

1158
01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:48.620
conversation with your wife too and say,
listen,
if,
uh,

1159
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.800
this persists,
um,
we're not hanging out with them as a couple anymore.

1160
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.810
Okay.
Because,
and if she gives you,
you know,

1161
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:03.190
when he sees by Fred and blah,
blah,
blah,
and just say,

1162
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.340
honey,
I love you.
I need a little empathy here.

1163
01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:10.360
What if one of my exes came to the door

1164
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:12.970
five years ago?

1165
01:10:12.971 --> 01:10:16.840
Professing that she still had a flame for me and still loved me and all of that

1166
01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:21.730
crap.
All right.
And then was stalking me and liking my photos on Facebook.

1167
01:10:21.731 --> 01:10:22.750
How would that make you feel?

1168
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:24.613
<v 1>You know,</v>

1169
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.890
<v 0>I'm not judging you,
but I wouldn't put you in that position.
Okay.</v>

1170
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.450
You liked that last sentence.
That last sentence is called game set.
Match.

1171
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:40.000
Alright.
Uh,
walk.
Hey Bill.
Big Fan and all that.

1172
01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:44.020
Lapdog babble.
Now you need a new walk,
dude,
I've been,

1173
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.770
I've seen a bunch.
I'll go fuck yourself.
I need a new walk.

1174
01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:54.250
You've watched all my specials on TV.
Well good for you.
Good for you.

1175
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:59.740
Thank you for doing that.
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.

1176
01:10:59.741 --> 01:11:02.890
Water toxicity.
A bill.

1177
01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.330
What toxicity is the medical term for when one's high.
Oh,

1178
01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:11.800
this is what I was talking about.
Uh,
what the fuck was it?

1179
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:12.763
Um,

1180
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.200
<v 2>that person,
what is it?
The,
the,
the,
they drank too much water.
Oh,</v>

1181
01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:19.760
that's why someone was asking me.

1182
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:21.550
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1183
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:23.680
<v 0>you know how much water you can drink or something like that.</v>

1184
01:11:23.681 --> 01:11:24.910
You know what's fucking hilarious?
Cause the guy,

1185
01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:28.230
oh I know the guy said he drank a gallon and a half of water every day.

1186
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.820
And I was like,
dude,
be careful man.
You drink too much water.

1187
01:11:30.821 --> 01:11:31.780
You could fucking die.

1188
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:37.470
And the amount of fucking people that wrote to me telling me how much water you

1189
01:11:37.721 --> 01:11:42.130
can drink if 50 people wrote me,
they all had 50 different amounts.

1190
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.810
Um,
so this person,
I don't know if this is an actual doctor or whatever,

1191
01:11:46.811 --> 01:11:51.811
said uh hey bill a water toxicity is the medical term for one's hydration.

1192
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:57.760
When one's hydration reaches dangerous and sometimes fatal levels,

1193
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
the actual mechanism at play is the ratio of water and electrolytes.

1194
01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.720
Salt in one's body.

1195
01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:06.990
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1196
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:11.100
<v 0>okay,
you've already lost me.
What are electrolytes is at that shit?
And Gatorade,</v>

1197
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.810
uh,
the total amount of water one can drink does not matter.

1198
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:18.360
So long as the amount of electrolytes are in balance,

1199
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:22.350
exercise and sweating depletes electrolytes.

1200
01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:25.230
So it is important to eat or mix in some Gatorade.

1201
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:29.420
<v 2>Rehydrating I was right.
Look at that.
Jesus.</v>

1202
01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:31.920
If this was a multiple choice fucking test,

1203
01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:35.080
you know how dumb I am.

1204
01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:38.620
I actually read half of that and when I wasn't even paying attention to it and I

1205
01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.600
got to Gatorade and it snapped me back into it,

1206
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.890
I just get like the second he goes scientific,
it's just Wah,
Wah,
Wah Wah Wah.

1207
01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:48.580
The total amount of water one can drink does not matter.

1208
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:51.760
So long as the amount of electrolytes are in balance.
Ah,

1209
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.250
exercise and sweating depletes electrolytes.

1210
01:12:54.251 --> 01:12:58.990
So it is important to eat or mix in some Gatorade when rehydrated I didn't know

1211
01:12:58.991 --> 01:12:59.231
that.

1212
01:12:59.231 --> 01:13:03.600
I used to eat a fucking piece of fruit so I wouldn't get sick when I sucked down

1213
01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.160
the water.
Uh,
the woman that died at the,

1214
01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:11.220
at the radio stunt drank and didn't eat then reached fatal levels.

1215
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:14.800
Oh.
So basically they could do that if they had a bunch of Gatorade there.

1216
01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:17.050
Anyways,
love the podcasts.

1217
01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:20.920
My girlfriend and I saw your one night or in Tampa a few months ago and you were

1218
01:13:20.921 --> 01:13:23.320
fucking amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1219
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:28.530
Do you ever get a chance the Florida Georgia cocktail party game in Jacksonville

1220
01:13:28.721 --> 01:13:32.260
is the pinnacle of SCC football?
Is there I got to go to that.

1221
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.730
I'm going to do that.
I'm gonna play the comedy zone one.
Uh,
one of these years.

1222
01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.120
I'll do like a one night or I'll do like Thursday,

1223
01:13:40.121 --> 01:13:44.890
Friday and then I'll be drunk on stage Saturday because I'm fucking having a

1224
01:13:44.891 --> 01:13:47.590
cocktail to,
but um,
I got to tell you

1225
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.580
<v 0>watched on the plane coming down here.</v>

1226
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.380
I watch that 30 for 30 again or maybe it was an east 60,

1227
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.790
it seemed like it was an hour long.
I don't know.
On the Alabama Auburn rivalry.

1228
01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.493
<v 1>And</v>

1229
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.670
<v 2>that's one of my favorite pieces of television ever.</v>

1230
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.790
If you've never seen it,
if you not even into sports,

1231
01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:12.310
you just have to watch how insane

1232
01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:18.070
<v 0>that fucking rivalry is.
And there's a guy,
what the hell is his name?</v>

1233
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:20.860
He has a radio show and I wanted to ask,
uh,

1234
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:24.370
people who are living in Alabama who listened to the podcast here,

1235
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:25.810
I know I'm going to say his name wrong.

1236
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:30.520
Is Paul fine bond or something?
That radio show,

1237
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.200
is there any way I can get that?
Can I listen to it online?
Um,

1238
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:36.670
can you give me like a link or something?

1239
01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:39.850
I really want to listen to that this year as they're leading up,

1240
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.630
I'm open Auburn's going to be good this year.
Um,

1241
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.960
I know once cam left that they've,
they had a little bit of a drop off,
but uh,

1242
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.140
I can't remember what they did last year,
but um,

1243
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:54.430
I just want to listen to that shit talk and I,
I,

1244
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:59.730
I was fucking laughing my ass off other than the maniac poisoned and poisoning

1245
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.990
the trees,
which was just ridiculous.

1246
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:06.760
But like listening to those people with those southern accent,

1247
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.850
just yelling at each other and the amount of passion,
it was just,
it was just,

1248
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.700
it was,
it's just fucking phenomenal,

1249
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.850
phenomenal fucking radio.
I have to,
I have to somehow figure out,

1250
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:26.050
I have to go to that game.
Not only do I to go to that game,

1251
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:30.970
but I have to figure out if I can't go,
I have to fucking listen to that.

1252
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.700
Like I've actually already played it out in my head one of these years.

1253
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:37.720
I'm going to go,
I'll go with like Verdesian law head or something,

1254
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.790
maybe a couple other buddies.

1255
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:42.610
And I was already picturing us getting there a couple of days early cause we'll

1256
01:15:42.611 --> 01:15:46.300
do standup probably at the star Doma something.
This is the game plan.

1257
01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:52.080
And in the mornings I just pictured us like hanging out like fucking eating

1258
01:15:55.081 --> 01:15:59.550
breakfast somewhere with the car radio on.
Just sitting there in the parking lot.

1259
01:15:59.551 --> 01:16:02.460
Laugh enough,
fucking asses off getting it.

1260
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.130
There's no [inaudible] if you're not even in the college football,

1261
01:16:05.131 --> 01:16:08.880
if you just watch,
if you can somehow find that,
um,

1262
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:12.390
that role tie war Eagle War Eagle Roll tide,
depending on who you talk to,

1263
01:16:12.391 --> 01:16:17.280
what should come first.
It's just,
it puts the Yankee red sub shit to shame.

1264
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.120
It really does.
I actually think Ohio state,

1265
01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:23.380
Michigan puts Yankee Red sox shift to shame.
I mean,

1266
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:27.190
Yankee red suck think died down now that the sox finally won it.
Um,

1267
01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:32.080
but uh,
it's just a,
it's just a whole other fucking level.

1268
01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:34.930
You've got to check it out,
highly recommend it.
So anyways,
one last,
uh,

1269
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.060
advertising here for the week.
Um,
he voice,
uh,

1270
01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:41.770
your screening cloth.
Okay.
You're screening calls,
closing deals,

1271
01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:45.310
and making money all while lounging poolside in the summer sun.

1272
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.650
Thanks to what he voice everybody.

1273
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:51.070
Eve voice is a better way to connect with people that drive your business,

1274
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:55.570
evolves for,
for business calls to your home,
mobile or any number you choose.

1275
01:16:55.630 --> 01:17:00.250
Wherever you are,
he voice.
We'll find you don't have time to take a call.

1276
01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.820
It's routed to voicemail and you can read it as you're at your own convenience

1277
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:07.570
as a text message eve voice not only gives you an edge over your competitors,

1278
01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.070
it takes away the edge the big competitors

1279
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.590
<v 2>have over you right now with the voice.</v>

1280
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:16.100
You can create the appearance of a whole office building of departments.

1281
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:20.420
When customers call you a sales department,
customer support,
tech support,

1282
01:17:20.421 --> 01:17:21.254
you name it.

1283
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.830
It's going to sound like you've got a giant skyscraper with your name on the

1284
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:28.640
side of it and it works with any phone.
Even yourself.
Hey,
it's summer.

1285
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.890
Don't be stuck in your office all day.

1292
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:53.640
That would be the advertising for this week,
right?
I'm done.
Nice.
Okay,

1293
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.990
let's go onto the next one.
Uh,
dating an ugly girl.

1294
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:02.730
Sorry about the click in here.
Everybody.
Jesus Christ.
Hour and 18.

1295
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:05.930
Fucking chatty Cathy here.
All right.

1296
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.400
<v 2>Dolla dolla shade.
Oh,
I started reading the advertising.</v>

1297
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.500
I am so fucking stupid.

1298
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:16.910
Clicking away dating an ugly girl.
There we go.
See,

1299
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:19.820
they both started with a d so that,
that was enough to get me going.

1300
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.270
Dating an ugly girl.
Hey Bill.
I just recently listened,

1301
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:26.150
started listening to your podcasts at work and I've got to say,
great job,
man.

1302
01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:29.330
Thank you very much.
She say some truly funny and it's funny stuff.
Oh,
thank you.

1303
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:34.100
Um,
I wanted to ask you for your advice on a troubling matter of mine.

1304
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.740
I recently started dating a girl,

1305
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:41.120
<v 0>then I met on an internet dating site.
That's unreal.</v>

1306
01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:44.510
I wish that shit was around when I was fucking single.

1307
01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:49.760
And that was a young man had a full head of hair,
right?
Jesus Christ.
I said,

1308
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:54.740
going to the supermarket,
just picking out fruit,
you know,
AH,
Jesus Christ.

1309
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:59.090
<v 2>If you,
if you're letting your ego get in the way of fucking doing that,</v>

1310
01:18:59.091 --> 01:19:02.720
your audience guide their mind,
still going out,
playing a fucking cover charge.

1311
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:08.150
I guess there's the sport of that,
you know,
not having the gun cocked,

1312
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:12.080
walking around with a shotgun broken over your arm.
Right?

1313
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:13.370
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1314
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:18.290
<v 2>Having your boy go flood,
flush him up,
flush him out of the fucking bushes</v>

1315
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:25.300
every once in a while.
That wouldn't be nice to fish in a stock pond.
Um,
anyways,

1316
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:30.680
he said,
we,
we met on an internet dating site,
but we get along great.
Uh,
all,

1317
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.800
we got along great through emails.
But when we met,

1318
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:37.600
I was surprised to see how ugly her face was and how slightly off she smelled.

1319
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:40.103
<v 3>Ah,</v>

1320
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.670
<v 2>you know,</v>

1321
01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:45.670
I just did such a great commercial for why you should do Internet dating and now

1322
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:51.140
you've convinced me that I,
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
All right,

1323
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:53.330
so what,
what do you need advice at this point?

1324
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:56.950
She has an ugly face and smells bad.
So what?

1325
01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.333
<v 3>Oh,
Jason</v>

1326
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.160
<v 2>[inaudible].
It's dating an ugly girl.
Okay,
well I'm intrigued now.
Well,</v>

1327
01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.870
what do you look like,
sir?
Are you a little often?
Do you smell?

1328
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.360
Did your smells combine and actually smell like something good?
Can that happen?

1329
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:15.690
Can Two negatives make a positive in smells?
I know they're doing math.

1330
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:20.370
Needless to say,
I was coming out of a dry spell also.

1331
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.940
She has a great body,
so I put the moves on her.

1332
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.840
I never actually hesitated.
He should have taken a fucking shower with her

1333
01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:33.880
as well.
That was the move right there.

1334
01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:38.530
You should have taken a fucking shower there and banged it.
Doggy style.

1335
01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.680
Jesus Christ.
Do I got to hold your hand over to the fucking water fountain?

1336
01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:48.170
Anyways,
he goes,
uh,
so I put the moves on her.
I never actually hesitated.

1337
01:20:48.171 --> 01:20:52.220
I just went on being myself around her and talking to her and now we're
together.

1338
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:54.980
The sex is amazing.
I fucking knew it.

1339
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1340
01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.960
<v 2>I knew the sex would be amazing cause there's no other reason to stay with</v>

1341
01:20:58.961 --> 01:21:02.680
somebody ugly and they smell,
they'd been a fuck the shit out of you or a,

1342
01:21:02.681 --> 01:21:03.130
you know,

1343
01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:07.660
they better find a new career because they have their fuck game is over.
Um,

1344
01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:13.150
playoffs now your season's over.
You're playing for a first round draft pick.

1345
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1346
01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:19.360
<v 2>All right.
The sex is amazing.
She has a pretty deep voice teases Christ.</v>

1347
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:25.840
This is like the money pit,
except instead of a house,
it's a woman.

1348
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:31.240
All right?
She has a pretty deep voice for a lady.
So when we bang,

1349
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.630
it's the only time she talks and acts like a woman.

1350
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.661
Dude,

1351
01:21:38.661 --> 01:21:42.710
if you get to the end of this and this person has had a sex change operation,

1352
01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:45.250
I'm not going to be surprised.
Um,

1353
01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.720
Jesus Christ,
do I continue?
Yeah,
I got nothing better to do.
Fuck it.

1354
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:55.630
And he goes,
uh,
blah,
blah blah.
And we get along great.

1355
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:58.060
She's like the best friend I never had.
Yeah,

1356
01:21:58.061 --> 01:22:02.290
I'm sure she probably fucking lift more weights than your too.
Seriously.

1357
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.020
We make each other laugh a lot and we're always learning and growing

1358
01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.480
intellectually with each other.
My dilemma is this.

1359
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:10.510
I'm a pretty handsome guy and we go out.
When we go out together,

1360
01:22:10.511 --> 01:22:13.900
people always stare,
give us angry or confused looks,

1361
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.510
oh come on man,
that might be in your head.
I bet.

1362
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.680
I think a lot of that might be you being self conscious,

1363
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:28.560
confused look like why is this great looking guy with this piece of dog meat?

1364
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:32.910
I don't know if that's your ego or your date in the ugliest fucking thing ever.

1365
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:37.150
You said she's got a nice body.
So you know what I mean?

1366
01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.340
Throws on a little makeup,
does some shit with her hair.
You know,

1367
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.870
maybe comes in and her face a little
becomes 50% less.
Uh,

1368
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:50.010
and this is just getting meaner by the second.
Um,
my dilemma is this,
okay,
blah,

1369
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:50.430
blah blah.

1370
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:54.240
I haven't introduced her to any of my friends and family yet because I'm afraid

1371
01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:58.590
of what they'll think of me.
And how they will judge us behind our backs.
Also,

1372
01:22:58.591 --> 01:23:00.750
I don't want ugly kids and that's pretty important.

1373
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.450
Why are you with this person,
sir?
You're saying horrible things.

1374
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:11.410
She has an ugly face,

1375
01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:13.750
she smells bad and you think she's gonna make ugly children.

1376
01:23:13.751 --> 01:23:15.040
What the what the fuck?

1377
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:17.613
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1378
01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.770
<v 2>You know what it is.
Your deck is still making the decisions in your life,
sir.</v>

1379
01:23:21.771 --> 01:23:24.500
That's why you still with this person.
And secondly,

1380
01:23:24.501 --> 01:23:29.330
just because you're good looking and you get with the good looking person,

1381
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:33.320
that doesn't mean you're going to have a good looking kid.
All right?

1382
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.130
That's one of the fallacies out there.
I can name,

1383
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:40.670
I can name a couple of celebrity couples drop dead gorgeous.

1384
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.760
Had it and had an average looking kid.
Cause you know what it is.

1385
01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.410
It's not like your,
your beautiful and you're beautiful.

1386
01:23:48.411 --> 01:23:52.310
So together you make beauty.
No,
it's you're combining

1387
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.150
<v 3>your features.
You know what I mean?</v>

1388
01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:00.860
<v 2>There's a lot of average and you know,
I can tell you right now,</v>

1389
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:05.540
more times than not an average looking people have stunning kids.

1390
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:07.440
They have jet order,
they have just as,

1391
01:24:07.441 --> 01:24:10.310
as a good a chance of making stunning kids.

1392
01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.610
This is like that shit I was talking to you about like a few weeks ago when I

1393
01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:16.450
was talking about like,

1394
01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:19.930
when people give like Michael Jordan's kid shit cause he's not as good as his

1395
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.690
dad had basketball.
It's like,
well he's only half his debt.

1396
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:28.360
He's Michael Jordan cut with Michael Jordan's wife.
Okay.

1397
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.270
And if she has no leaping ability,
okay.

1398
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:33.570
And can even catch a beach ball underhanded,

1399
01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:38.260
that's going to fuck with the son's ability to go to the rack.
You know.

1400
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.520
So anyway,
that sir,
I,
I'll,
I'll read the rest of this book anyways.
Uh,

1401
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.990
I don't want ugly kid and that's pretty important to me.
She,

1402
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:50.230
she truly is an amazing person and in a perfect world,

1403
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:52.240
I wouldn't hesitate to make her my wife,

1404
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:56.530
but the fact is I'm too much of a bitch to completely accept her my life.
Well,

1405
01:24:56.531 --> 01:25:00.160
you know what?
You're man enough to admit that you're,
you're a bitch.

1406
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:05.520
That's a good step.
Um,
which it is,
but I don't really want to hurt her feelings.

1407
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:08.250
Her life is already pretty hard because of how she looks.

1408
01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:13.200
Do what it does she live in or a bridge.
What is the problem?

1409
01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.740
What should I do?
Am I too selfish and vein?

1410
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:20.760
Any advice in this matter would be appreciated.
Well,
the problem is,
sir,

1411
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:22.680
you've stayed with their long enough,

1412
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:23.830
<v 3>okay.</v>

1413
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:28.090
<v 2>That she's starting to get into your heart.
You know,
she was in your balls first,</v>

1414
01:25:28.091 --> 01:25:32.920
but then you know,
now she's up in,
in,
in your chest.
So,

1415
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:33.783
uh,

1416
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:36.623
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1417
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.440
<v 2>What would you do?
I mean,
well,
I mean,
you have to make the choice.
Look,</v>

1418
01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:45.490
you either accept her for who she is and you introduce her to people around you

1419
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:47.680
or you get rid of her because you're going to hurt her.

1420
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:49.423
<v 3>You know,</v>

1421
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.380
<v 2>that's it.
I don't know what the fuck else to tell you.
Nope.</v>

1422
01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.400
I didn't come off like a dick there,
but I mean,
that's a,
it's just,

1423
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.920
that's the deal.
You got to make the choice.
All right.
Okay.
They'll,

1424
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:05.690
that's the podcast for this week,
everybody.

1425
01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:10.250
I apologize for being a moron and forgetting the plug and all that shit.
But,
um,

1426
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:15.020
I did take a lot of video this week that I'm going to try to have uploaded onto

1427
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:19.100
the podcast page and all that.
I'll try and make it up that way.
Um,
my,

1428
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:23.600
my iPhone pictures and videos as I'm driving and I know it's not safe to be

1429
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:26.510
doing that.
You don't need to point out all the people on the motorcycles.

1430
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:30.350
I know that I was taking people's lives in danger.

1431
01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.970
You would hope the day during their lives.

1432
01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:36.710
So before you think of the most clever con on the fucking Internet,
um,

1433
01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:42.560
alright and send me all your hacky fucking shit about first world problems and

1434
01:26:42.561 --> 01:26:45.860
