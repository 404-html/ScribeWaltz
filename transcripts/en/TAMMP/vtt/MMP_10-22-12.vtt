00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr eight.

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:05.760
It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
October 22nd,
2012 and I know we get thinking,

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
Bill,
why does it sound like you're inside of a fucking tin cans?
Well,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.200
I'll tell you why
I'm in fucking Australia.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.790
I just plugged my goddamn mixer into the fucking adapter and it just shorted it

7
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.390
out.
All right?
It's my fault.
What was I thinking?

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960
Running such a gigantic podcasts such as the Monday morning podcast with a $99

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.940
mixer.
And I did say gigantic podcasts.
This is a big podcast.

10
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:43.530
It's fucking big to me every week on iTunes.
Where?
Number 37.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.120
You like that?
I'm the only podcast too.
Who doesn't lie?

12
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.810
<v 0>All these cuts out there.
Be fucking one of them.
Dude.</v>

14
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:55.860
I got like a million downloads.
I'm number one.

15
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.220
I go fuck yourself.
Yet when you get number one in your ass,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.043
um,

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
I'm here to tell you that I am number 18 and I'm proud of it.
So anyways,

18
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.350
I don't have any headphones.
I don't even microphone.

19
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.530
I'm recording this thing through garage band and this is how it's going to
sound.

20
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.160
All right?

21
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.460
And if you don't want to listen to it just hit stop cause it's not going to get

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.340
any fucking better than this.
All right?

23
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.530
You like how I'm kind of yelling at you because my mixed,

24
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.540
cause I bought a $99 mixer to run the 47th top 47th podcasts on the fucking

25
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.490
iTunes.
Um,
all right,

26
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.540
let's get right down to it.

27
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:40.830
Lance Armstrong officially fucking stripped of all of his God damn titles and

28
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.830
Nike has the fucking balls,

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.230
the fucking balls to walk away from Lance.
You didn't walk away from Tiger Woods,

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.560
you know,
after all the bull shit he was doing.

31
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.240
So I guess if Lynch just fucked around on his wife,
you know,

32
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.480
you still would've had a swish above is fucking left tit.

33
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.100
You wouldn't have had a problem with it a night.
When the fuck do you get off?

34
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:10.090
Haben any sort of moral stance about cheating or not cheating,
you know,

35
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:11.920
if you taken a look at your company lately,

36
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
you think Lance doesn't have the right to fucking go around handing out those

37
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:21.070
live strong bracelets because you think he cheated.

38
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:24.070
Well what about you guys?
Huh?
What about you?

39
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:27.610
Nike just do it.
What does that mean?

40
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.110
Is that what you say to the children?
Who,

41
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.530
so your sneakers together in El Salvador

42
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.150
is Sona Jack do it?
Um,

43
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.060
yeah,
we had a fucked as Nike.
I mean you know what it is.
I loved that.

44
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:47.980
That's when Nike,
Nike drops them in.

45
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:51.880
It gets to look like they don't tolerate cheating.
It's all about money.

46
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.450
With those cons,
they don't give a flying fuck whether he cheated,

47
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.220
whether he didn't cheat.
All right.
When it looked in fat,

48
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.100
like this guy had been busted,
they walk away like Whoa,

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.570
that's not what we're about.

50
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.500
If anybody out there can explain to me what fucking Nike is about other than

51
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.590
money standing on the heads of eight year olds,

52
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.840
um,
you know,
if you can come up with something else,
send me an email.
I,

53
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.160
cause I for one would love to hear it.
All right.

54
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.750
I hope this isn't really a help.
This recording isn't as bad as it looks.

55
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.560
It looks like I'm fucking blowing out your eardrums.
I'm trying here people,

56
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.240
little handicap TM down on deck,
having a nice time down and uh,

57
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.000
um,
uh,

58
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.460
Jesus Christ a fucking made it over here.
Everybody.

59
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.660
14 hour flight,
you know,
with no drugs.

60
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.390
I was thinking of,
you know,

61
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.050
watching a couple of movies and then taking some drugs and I actually,

62
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.390
I worked it out.
I got on the plane,

63
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.600
immediately fell asleep and uh,
I slept for maybe,
I dunno,

64
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.530
about six hours and then I just watched movies.
Well,

65
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.230
what'd you watch bill?
While I watched caddy shack,

66
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.600
then I watched on the waterfront,

67
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.410
then I watch national Lampoon's vacation,

68
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.770
Chevy chase still fucking hilarious.

69
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.840
And then I watched a,

70
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.830
a bgs documentary,

71
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.230
which got really fucking boring really quickly.
And uh,

72
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:37.090
then all of a sudden we landed and that was it.
So there you go.
I know.

73
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:38.290
I watched something else in there.

74
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:40.780
There was something else ran that I started to watch.

75
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.980
Is there watching a couple of documentaries and I know what you think of bill

76
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.550
[inaudible].
Who the fuck would ever watch your goddamn documentary on the bgs?

77
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.470
Well,
you know,
I had 14 hours to kill.
All right.
You're judgmental cunt.

78
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.470
And not to mention the BGS are from Australia.

79
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.070
Figured maybe I'd see something in there that I could bring to my live shows.

80
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.970
<v 2>MMM.</v>

81
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.280
<v 0>Oh whatever.
So we land,</v>

82
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.770
we land here at like six 30 in the fucking morning.
We basically,

83
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:15.540
we left at 10 o'clock at night,
Monday night,
flew for 14 hours.

84
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:20.541
And by the time we got here it was six 30 Wednesday morning,

85
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.790
you lose a day.
You know,

86
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.430
it was an 18 hour fucking difference between La and here.

87
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.680
I don't know if this is interesting,
I don't even know if you can hear me.

88
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.780
You know,
I don't fucking know.

89
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.943
<v 2>MMM.</v>

90
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.150
<v 0>Florida.
Yeah.
So then it was weird cause then we landed here and uh,</v>

91
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.110
then I had to stay up until fucking about nine 30 at night to try and get on the

92
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.150
clock.
And,
uh,
I dunno if it took a couple of days.

93
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.630
I kept bitching about B and jet lag to the point.

94
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:56.820
I think dom I rare was going to slap me in the,

95
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.460
I think I had like 14 conversations with him about how I just,

96
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.120
I couldn't go to sleep,
you know,
and the lovely Nia,

97
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.830
you know,
she's more of a hippie free spirit than I am.
Right?

98
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.130
She just took sleeping pills the first night.
It was fine.

99
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.200
And I'm all sitting head,
you know,

100
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.720
trying to be fucking Johnny Natural Bitchin about what the fuck they do to your

101
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.320
liver,
like another guy of some sort of a doctor,
you know.

102
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.730
So finally the third day here,

103
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:29.630
I actually took some sleeping pills and I slept through the night and I felt

104
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.050
great,
you know,
so there's one for the druggies,

105
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.630
hey me and you taking sleep and kill me in and it actually works.

106
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.740
Um,
so anyways,

107
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.800
I performed at the Sydney Opera House downstairs in the basement.

108
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.420
It was a 400 seater and,
um,
did three nights.

109
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.830
Every show was packed and,
uh,

110
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.270
just great crowds and,
and it was a total,

111
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.310
this district was a total success.

112
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.350
And I'm definitely coming back here because not only did the people come out,

113
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.020
uh,
it's just a great country.

114
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.950
I don't have one fucking bad thing to say about Australia other than the fact

115
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.480
that Sydney is expensive.

116
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.620
Jesus Christ as his fucking place,
expensive.

117
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:27.830
And I led the New York City and that place is expensive.
Okay?

118
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.760
It's not like I'm some sort of redheaded farm boy over here.
Okay?

119
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.820
You're not talking to fucking huck Finn.
You know,

120
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.630
I'm not sitting here barefoot with a goddamn fishing pole over my shoulder.

121
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.430
All right?
Oh,
I got one bad thing,
one bad fucking thing.

122
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.313
All right.

123
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.920
Last night we were coming back from watching these bats fly out of the park.

124
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.700
They call them flying foxes.
I guess they're furry.
It was night.

125
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.510
It was nighttime and they're all,
you know,
hundreds of fucking bats flying out.

126
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.120
It was awesome.
And,
um,

127
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.580
so we're hungry and uh,
we were going to go to the burger king out here,

128
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.960
but they don't call it burger king.

129
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:13.340
They call it hungry jacks because evidently there was some other guy out here

130
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.940
already had a place called Burger King and he sued the Burger King Corporation

131
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:20.450
and somehow we won.
So for some reason,

132
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:25.310
Burger King settled on the name Hungry Jacks.
I don't know why,

133
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.020
I don't know why,
but they have the exact same logo in the menu.

134
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.240
So we go into hungry jacks and is which stand there.

135
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:40.241
All of a sudden this guy and a tank top comes in with these two blonde girls and

136
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.030
one of them is just loud as fucking hell.

137
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.783
<v 1>Okay,</v>

138
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.460
<v 0>I'm standing there and then she goes,
I was like,
that's a crazy fucking laugh.</v>

139
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.090
Like really close to my ear.
Like,
and I'm thinking,

140
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:57.780
did she just do that to with me or can she not handle her alcohol?

141
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.980
And then I guess,
you know,
on their cell phones you can get,

142
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.670
they had some coupon for a free burger or something.
So she goes,
look,

143
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:08.130
I got a coupon for a free burger.
And she,
and then as she's,

144
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.820
she fucking reached past my face and shook her cell phone in front of my fucking

145
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.724
face.

146
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.960
And I can't believe I didn't slap her fucking phone down into the fryer layer.

147
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.950
It's been bugging me.
And uh,
when she went to order,
she,
she,

148
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.770
she said to the guy behind the counter,
she goes,
just meat and cheese,

149
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.130
just meat and cheese,
just meat and cheese like three times in a fucking row.

150
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.480
Just being a total obnoxious cunt.
And

151
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.400
I tried to not let her get to me,

152
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.200
but I just kept replaying that fucking shaking the phone in my face.

153
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.640
She did it.
She shook it right in my fucking face.
I didn't do anything.

154
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.640
I was so like surprise.
And then there's,

155
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:57.120
then there's that weird like it's a woman,
so you gotta do the math.

156
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:00.030
Like what do I do?
Like I,
I'm telling you the amount of times today,

157
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.760
the fucking violent thoughts,

158
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.840
I kept trying to think of anything I could have said.
Anything I could've done,

159
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:12.140
the only solution I could have thought of other than what I did,

160
00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:16.400
which was nothing,
was,
would they were all violent solutions.

161
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.281
I thought about,
well,

162
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.600
what if I just took my shake and dumped it over our head and the fantasy

163
00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:28.601
immediately went to me taking a burger and like mushing or interface slash like

164
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.800
punching her with the palm of my hand through the bread.

165
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.490
Would you be considered assault?

166
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.420
I thought about dragging her out by her fucking hair

167
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.220
and then throwing her cell phone like fucking Randy Johnson in his heyday and

168
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:53.690
having it smash right above her head.
And then just sitting,

169
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:57.680
watching her cry as I went back in and got my food and some,

170
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:01.750
and somehow in all of these I never get,
never got arrested.
But,
uh,

171
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.500
that was the only one bad thing.

172
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.560
Like this girl was like so overdue for a fucking ass kicking.

173
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.210
Um,
I really wished I,
I just knew like,

174
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.090
you know,
those chicks who fight in the UFC,

175
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:22.091
I just wish I knew one that was in the vicinity and could have just had her come

176
00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:25.010
in and dress like really like,
you know,

177
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:28.970
all girly girly and just kind of act sheepish and just let that girl come up and

178
00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:32.180
do the obnoxious thing.
That's shit that she was doing.

179
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.520
Oh my God.
I W I W oh,

180
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.690
I would've paid 500 bucks
to talk to have a woman,

181
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.700
not just,
if there was a service,

182
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.760
I would have paid $500 to fucking watch a woman go in and just knock this bitch

183
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.970
out because she just,
it Wa it would have made her a better person.

184
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.540
<v 0>It really would have,
like today I'm fucking sitting here,
you know,</v>

186
00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:03.960
doing touristy shit.
I walked from,
uh,

187
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.470
what it Bondai beach to cookie beach or whatever.

188
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.750
<v 0>Fucking incredible.
They've got all these,
uh,
the word of sand sculpture.</v>

190
00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:14.970
I don't know what the fuck they call them,
sculptures and stuff.

191
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.710
I gotta be honest with you.
I could give a flying fuck about him.
You know,

192
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.160
sculptors,
you know what they do?

193
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:24.120
They take like a garden hose and some PCP pipe or whatever the fuck it is.

194
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.430
You know,
they take junk from the kitchen and they,
and they make like a fucking,

195
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.400
I dunno what a rocket ship out of it.
I just,
I've never been into it.
It's clever.

196
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.970
But you've seen one,
you've seen them all.
Nia on the other hand,

197
00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:40.110
absolutely fucking loves them.

198
00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:43.470
So she stopped and at every God didn't one of them.
It's windy as hell.

199
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.340
I got salt spray in my face,
but I'm like,
I'm liking it though.

200
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.280
I'm liking the,
uh,
the elements.
But um,

201
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.840
but half of the walk I just kept thinking of grabbing that girl last night by

202
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:01.140
our hair and throwing her off the cliff.

203
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.503
<v 1>You know,</v>

204
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.000
<v 0>she lives but she breaks her fucking hip and she deserves it,</v>

205
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.240
you know?
And when she looks at me like why?
I just say,
cause you're a cunt.

206
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.460
And that's the end of the fantasy.
Is that bad?
Other than that,

207
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:25.080
I had a great fucking time out here and I'll tell you all about it right after.

208
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:28.650
Uh,

Excuse me.

219
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.940
Um,
anyways,
so back to my trip here,

220
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.130
back to my trip here.
Uh,
what did I do?
I went to the zoo.

221
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.540
I went to the zoo and earlier that morning,
one of the zookeepers,

222
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:25.870
unfortunately a lovely woman got crushed against the wall by a,

223
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:30.740
a baby elephant or an owl adolescent one.

224
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.600
You know when everybody was feeling bad for her and we all hope that she gets

225
00:14:35.601 --> 00:14:40.480
better,
but you know it's one of those fucking dales.
They,

226
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.090
they don't want to be there.

227
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.070
That was the overwhelming vibe that I got will,

228
00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:50.550
especially the fucking chimpanzees and the gorillas.

229
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.440
Okay?
You know what I would love?

230
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.770
What I would absolutely love is to go to church Sunday and listen to some guys

231
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:05.111
speaking that fucking creationism Mumbo fucking jumbo and in the background,

232
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.651
just have a bunch of apes sitting in cages staring at people in the fucking

233
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.770
crowd of the church because I'm going to tell you something right now.

234
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.480
I don't give a fuck how much you're in de Jesus.
How much you in dumb Mohammed,

235
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.070
whatever the fuck you're into.

236
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.630
There's no way to look up fucking monkey in the eye and not know exactly where

237
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:27.650
the hell we came from.

238
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.560
There's just no way.
Somewhere along the line,

239
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.190
they broke left and we broke,
right?
But I'm telling you,

240
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:43.400
if you go up the family tree,
oh fucking long enough.

241
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.210
Look at my dumb face.
You're telling me I'm not half orangutan.

242
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.890
There's no fucking way,
there's no god damn way.
Those motherfuckers,

243
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.500
they,
they uh,
they,
uh,

244
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.240
just a cunt hair away from being human and they're,

245
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.230
they're aware that they're being watched.
They don't want to be in there,

246
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.420
you know,
it was really bad.

247
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.720
They had this giant area where they were playing and then they had this one air

248
00:16:09.721 --> 00:16:14.420
where they could kind of walk into like this little cave,
you know,

249
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.230
and they walk into the cave trying to get a little fucking peace and quiet,

250
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.420
just don't want to be stared at anymore.

251
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.690
And there's a big window so we can see him in there.

252
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.800
And I see this one goes in there and I of course run up like the tourist that I

253
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.850
am in,
this mother fucker gets in there.
So that's going wow.

254
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.650
Fucking slap in the walls and jumping around.
And I said to Neil like,

255
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:38.480
that one does not,
is,
is,

256
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.090
that's the one right there that's going to rip your face off because you know,

257
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.530
that dude's the man and he's caged up.
All right,

258
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.230
you got to fucking Alpha male.
They're like,

259
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.050
he's not a bitch and he doesn't want to be in there.

260
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.160
And him just slapping the wall and whatever the fuck he just yelled.

261
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:02.240
And Chimpanzee,
if you translated it to English,
would basically be like,

262
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.740
you mother fuckers are so lucky that glass is there.
Because if you weren't,

263
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.750
I rip all your faces off.
I'd rip a couple feet off and a bunch of ball bags.

264
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.650
So consider yourself lucky.
So anyway,

265
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:20.651
so I leave Nia stays and all of a sudden the monkey starts fucking acting up and

266
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:25.500
somebody's standing there going and he's saying he's going to charge the glass.

267
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.780
And that's exactly what the thing did.

268
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.520
And everybody jumped back and uh,

269
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.330
and then another monkey ran in there and all the humans will like,
oh,

270
00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:40.260
they're going to fight.
And when the other monkey ran in there after the other,

271
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.170
the Alpha chimp flipped out.
When he ran in there,

272
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.800
the two of them just hugged each other and then they sat down,

273
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.630
started grooming another.
It just made me feel bad.

274
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.753
<v 1>You know,</v>

275
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.920
<v 0>I don't mind rep,
you know,
you're going to stick something in a cage.</v>

276
00:17:56.921 --> 00:18:01.060
Make it a reptile.
I was fucking idiots.
They don't know what's going on.
You know,

277
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.130
I gotta do is throw a dead mouse set.

278
00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:07.500
I'm every couple of hours and they're fine reptiles or the mouth breathing

279
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.980
morons are the fucking animal kingdom.
They just,
they,
they're clueless.

280
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.730
You know,
it's like they'll like those people that sit out in the bleachers,

281
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.800
you know,
those jackasses.
That was a Rep.
Thomas.
Um,

282
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.630
speaking of which,
um,
speaking of sports,

283
00:18:29.631 --> 00:18:32.720
I've tried to keep up on the sports.
I've been actually,
you know,
something,

284
00:18:32.721 --> 00:18:35.000
I've been over here so long,
I'm starting to like crickets,

285
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.720
which I've got to tell you something right now.
You know,

286
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:43.310
as much as they bitch about,
uh,
helped me moving this computer.

287
00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:45.320
Is it making a bunch of noises?
Um,

288
00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:49.610
as much as people bitch about how difficult hockey is to watch on TV.

289
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.930
You ain't seen shit until you try to watch a game of cricket when there's nobody

290
00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:58.050
there to explain what the fuck is going on.
Um,

291
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.810
for you yanks out there who never seen the Goddamn game and it looks like

292
00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:05.600
baseball played with a fraternity paddle.

293
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.850
Do you know that that field is 360 degrees.

294
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.560
There's no foul balls.

295
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.940
You filed tip that motherfucker and it goes over the wall behind you.

296
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.070
It's six runs.
That's what you get for a home run.
Six runs,
it gets to the wall.

297
00:19:22.071 --> 00:19:25.640
That's four runs.
There's two guys with paddles.
When you hit the ball,

298
00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:28.670
they both tried,
they run at each other,
go to each other's basis.

299
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.760
And if they can do it before those clients get the ball in,

300
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.770
that's a run or two or something like that.
And they play,

301
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.880
they have like fucking 50 outs.

302
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

303
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.540
<v 0>And they got a quicker game,
20 something or other that only takes a day.</v>

304
00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:47.440
But in a cricket match takes five fucking days.

305
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.400
Good Lord.
He thought baseball was born,
but I got to admit,

306
00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:56.400
after a while I kind of started to get into it,
got into it a little bit.
But um,

307
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.110
I dunno,
what else did I do on it?
So we went to the zoo.
That was a great time.
Um,

308
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.540
other than the fact you just looking into the eyes of animals that don't want to

309
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:09.660
fucking be there.
But uh,
oh by the way,

310
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.180
the two major animals here,

311
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.120
Koalas and Kangaroos,
not a fan of either one.

312
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.660
Now that I've seen him up close for wall is like they just got that look on

313
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:26.090
their face.
It's depressing.

314
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.610
You know,
I've been,
I was joking on stage,
my shows down here.

315
00:20:31.611 --> 00:20:33.670
I was saying the reason why I didn't like for Wallace,

316
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.980
because when I looked at into a Koala bears face,

317
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.210
it reminded me of every time I quit in life.
You know,

318
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.190
they just have that fucking,
you know,
what's the point man?
You know,

319
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.540
just sitting there high off that fucking eucalyptus shit they eat.

320
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.870
They're like potheads some reason they remind me at Tom Bosley,

321
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.250
you know,
Mr,
see Mr. Cunningham on happy days,

322
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:03.560
like if Mr. Cunningham was a fucking animal,
he,

323
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.040
he would be a Koala bear.

324
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.630
Mr. Cunningham would be not Tom Bosley.
Okay.

325
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.140
Cause obviously he didn't sit around and do nothing.

326
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.380
The guy made it as a fucking character actor.
All right.

327
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.000
And kangaroos are fucking rats.
They're rodents.

328
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.170
They got this little fucking head.
That's really weird.
They just,

329
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:28.720
they just creepy.
All right.
And,

330
00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.430
and my version of a kangaroo where those funny ones that they drawing cartoons,

331
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:37.120
they're not funny at all.
They fucking like six feet,
six feet one,

332
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.140
they're like as big as Eli Manning and they can,
uh,
you know,

333
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:46.060
basically rip your guts out with their front feet if they choose and uh,

334
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.060
where they can jump twice as far as Michael Jordan.
So that's,

335
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:52.960
that's pretty scary.
See,
I learned shit when I was over here.
You know,

336
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.410
you guys just think I'm going around drinking fucking beers,
which I did

337
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.490
really.
Bill,
can you recommend a good Aussie bear?
Yes,
I can.

338
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:05.420
A little creatures Pale Ale.
It's fucking delicious.

339
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.630
Um,
all right,
I'm trying to space out,
do a little better job here with the,
uh,

340
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:13.850
the advertising this week.
I'll just read them real quick,

341
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.690
one of the time here and then get back to the podcast,
a amazon.com.

342
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.930

It helps support the cost of producing the podcast as well as help the,

346

uh,

347

So thanks again for going there.
There you go.
Big Bang.
Boom.

349
00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:48.800
You like that quick commercials this week back to the podcast.
Oh,

350
00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:50.660
so this morning,
my patriots,

351
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:55.340
the New England Patriots were playing the green cunts,
the New York jets.

352
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.570
They were playing them,
I thought at four in the morning.

353
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.160
They were actually the four o'clock game,
which was seven in the morning here.

354
00:23:04.161 --> 00:23:08.540
So I got up at four in the morning and I actually watched him,
my computer.

355
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.360
Um,
I watched 'em.

356
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.030
What did I watch?
I watch the giants versus the Redskins,

357
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.440
thanks to my opening act.
My support is,
they call it out here.

358
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:23.700
Nick Cody cooked me up.

359
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:24.680
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

360
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.370
<v 0>with his NFL username and password.</v>

361
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.180
And I was able to watch most of that game before crapped out on me.

362
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.230
And then I had to go to Ed to go to a casino,

363
00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.270
which was five minutes down the fucking road.

364
00:23:38.271 --> 00:23:41.750
But there's so much traffic here in Sydney and they only have like two lanes on

365
00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:45.830
each side.
It took forever to get over.
Um,

366
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.770
and then watched the Patriots first,
the jets,
Jesus,
Jesus.

367
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.570
And you know what I saw during that game,

368
00:23:54.571 --> 00:23:57.870
I saw two teams that are not going to win the Superbowl this year.

369
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.840
<v 2>MMM.</v>

370
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.880
<v 0>I actually think Rex Ryan is doing a hell of a fucking job considering all the</v>

371
00:24:03.881 --> 00:24:06.390
injuries that they have and,

372
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.450
and Bella check is doing a hell of a job considering we have absolutely no

373
00:24:10.451 --> 00:24:14.790
secondary whatsoever.
They definitely played better this week.
But um,

374
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.960
you know,
we won the game,
but I can't,
I can't even talk shit.
It's like we,

375
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:25.880
we,
we blew the game and then they,
and then the jets were like,
oh no,

376
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:29.240
you don't.
Oh No,
you don't.
Well,
we're going to blow the game.

377
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.410
How dare you try to make us win this game?
And then the patriots like,
well,

378
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:36.820
wait a minute,
we don't want to win this game.
You win the game is you?
Yeah.

379
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.420
Will fumble the ball during the kickoff.
The jets go.
Okay,
well we'll,
we'll,

380
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.810
we'll see your fumble and we'll drop an easy pass and just kick a field goal.

381
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.933
<v 2>MMM.</v>

382
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.970
<v 0>I Dunno if we just had somebody,
I was,
I,
I gotta be honest with you.</v>

383
00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:56.580
I was really surprised that we won that game because I really,
you know,

384
00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.750
Defense Wins Games and I felt that the jets had a better defense or have a

385
00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:05.290
better defense that we do,
even though Reavis is out.
Um,

386
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.690
Cromarty still a great player and uh,
we just don't,

387
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.480
we just don't have that guy in the fucking secondary.
But,
uh,

388
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.480
but he was hilarious.
I can't remember I even fucking told this story yet,

389
00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:23.280
cause I had to start this podcast three fucking times cause it's so weird to be

390
00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:26.490
doing this without hearing myself headphones and all that type of shit.

391
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.150
But anyways,
um,
I went over to the star casino.

392
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.460
You know what's hilarious is I'm 50,
50,
whether I already told the story,

393
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:39.910
I hope I didn't.
Um,
I went over there and they were,

394
00:25:39.911 --> 00:25:43.740
there was nobody there.
I walked into this sports book.
There was nobody there.

395
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:48.240
There was this Asian dude playing some weird game in the corner and,
uh,

396
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.930
it had the whole place to myself.
It was actually kind of cool.

397
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.970
And,
uh,
I dunno,
is it weird that it,

398
00:25:56.971 --> 00:25:58.730
like I got over there by nine in the [inaudible]

399
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.091
<v 3>morning,</v>

400
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:03.110
I'd watched the first app on the computer before crapped out on me at nine in

401
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:06.740
the morning and went over there and I just started drinking by myself.

402
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.360
I had three beers.
I told myself I was only going to have to like,

403
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:16.040
then once we fucked up and fumbled,
I was like,
yeah,
fuck it.

404
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.173
I'll have it.

405
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.080
I'm going to fucking drink my sorrows away cause we're gonna lose this game.

406
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:23.180
And somehow we want,
you know,

407
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.170
<v 0>anybody go to the game out there.
How many fucking,</v>

408
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.610
<v 3>okay.</v>

409
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.610
<v 0>Fairweather fans left after we fumbled the fucking kickoff trying to beat the</v>

410
00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:36.760
traffic,
those Douche bags.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

411
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.040
I'm psyched that we won,
but in the long run,
is it,

412
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:43.170
is it really going to help the Patriots?
You know what it is,
you know,

413
00:26:43.171 --> 00:26:44.520
what's really hurting the Patriots?

414
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.590
<v 1>How good Tom Brady is in belt bill Belicheck and our offense is because we went</v>

415
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:53.460
so many fucking games that we shouldn't.
And uh,

416
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.050
then we don't get a high draft pick and we really need to,

417
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.390
we need to get somebody cause anybody coming out of college that's just not

418
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:05.190
going to be a lights out.
Cornerback has,
God knows we could fucking use one.
Oh,

419
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:05.940
and by the way,

420
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.260
I absolutely fucking hate those old school,

421
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.720
New England patriot and uniforms.

422
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.970
And I know there's a lot of people that like it,

423
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:18.030
but all I see those and I get sick to my stomach.

424
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.540
I see those uniforms and all I think of is Dan Marino throwing for 500 yards.

425
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.960
You know,
I think of the bears patriots super Superbowl,

426
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.060
I think a Tony [inaudible]

427
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.860
<v 0>um,
Irving fryer before he got his shit together.</v>

428
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.140
Um,

429
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:47.140
I roughing the passer against the fucking Oakland Raiders in 1976.

430
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.240
That's all I think of.

431
00:27:50.241 --> 00:27:53.900
I just think of losing or coming close to winning and then fucking losing.

432
00:27:53.901 --> 00:27:57.680
That's all I think of about whenever I see those,
those uniforms.

433
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.491
Although you know,

434
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:01.670
if I see a tee shirt that has the old pat Patriot helmet on it,

435
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:04.940
I'm a sucker and I'll buy it.
But I,
I hate seeing us.

436
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.070
I just hate seeing us wear those uniforms.
It's,
it's just not a good time.

437
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.050
I imagine people will,
uh,

438
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.740
Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans probably feel the same way when you have the cream

439
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.480
sickle uniforms.
Doesn't that just remind you of Oh,
and 14,

440
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.850
I guess you had Doug Williams,

441
00:28:22.851 --> 00:28:26.810
you had that one year and like 79 where you got all the way to the,
uh,

442
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.300
the NFC championship game where I believe the Los Angeles Rams beat you nine to

443
00:28:33.891 --> 00:28:38.600
nothing.
Norming Cromwells kicked three field goals.
Isn't that what happened?

444
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.860
And then they played the Pittsburgh Steelers,
the roid it up Pittsburgh Steelers.

445
00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:45.290
By the way.
That's for that comment on Twitter.

446
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:47.390
That gave me shit about the patriots cheating.

447
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.210
It's always funny to hear a Steeler fan talk about cheating.

448
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.960
You really should go back and see why you had the steel curtain.

449
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.000
It should've said the steroid curtain.

450
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:05.120
Jesus Christ.
Even Terry Bradshaw admitted that he was using steroids.
Um,

451
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.283
but whatever,

452
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.060
whatever they got synergetics now they're giving up the fucking old people.
Um,

453
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.150
so anyways,
how farmer to this fucking,

454
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:14.930
<v 1>okay.</v>

455
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.170
<v 0>Horribly recorded podcasts.
My half hour.
Look at that.</v>

456
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.720
Moving right along.
Let's uh,
let's turn on the fucking light here.

457
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.770
Oh,
by the way,
I didn't make it up to the Great Barrier Reef.

458
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.140
I didn't make it up there.
It was just going to be too much of a thrash and uh,

459
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.670
I actually found out how to do it the right way.

460
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.003
<v 1>You know,</v>

461
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:40.820
<v 0>granted,
I heard that they,</v>

462
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.810
they're going to allow the public to go to the Great Barrier Reef for much

463
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:47.260
longer.
And if they don't,
what,
what are you going to do?
You know what I mean?

464
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.170
I think the barrier reef is more important than,
uh,

465
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.410
this freckled face con actually seeing it.
Uh,
let's,

466
00:29:56.411 --> 00:30:00.190
let's get to a question for this week is an advice.

467
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:01.870
One brother in law bill.

468
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.950
So my brother in law is a fucking pussy.

469
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.880
He is the poster boy for Napoleon Complex.

470
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.270
He smacks his wife around Jesus Christ,

471
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.980
doesn't keep groceries in the fridge for his kids.
Talk Shit.

472
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:22.981
About how he'll eat my lunch to people once he has a couple of whiskeys and

473
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:26.200
cokes in him.
The guy's a real piece of shit.

474
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.490
Despite all of this.
I've never judged the motherfucker,

475
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.090
never made a big thing out of his drunk shit.
Talking on me.

476
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.580
Always gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Well,

477
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.580
did you judge him for fucking slap in your sister around,

478
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.250
right?
If he's your brother in law,
then his wife has to be a system

479
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.530
or is it on your,
your,
could it be on your wife's side?

480
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.200
I don't know how that shit works.
I never understood that.

481
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.870
This is my third cousin,
Eh.
It doesn't mean shit to me.

482
00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:59.680
I don't know what that means.
Do you have three cousins?
He's three times removed.

483
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.840
Um,
anyways,

484
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.980
a couple of weeks ago it all came to a head and an aunt ended up having to kick

485
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:10.981
his fucking ass after he showed up to my two year old daughter's birthday party

486
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:14.140
drunk and caused a scene in front of my family.

487
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.100
I'll be the first to tell you that I don't like confrontation.

488
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.400
I don't walk around like I'm some bad ass tough guy.

489
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.600
This stuff has been brewing for a while though and that night I had no choice

490
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.050
but to grant his wish and beat the shit out of him.
Well,
good for you.

491
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.950
I got to say it felt pretty fucking good too.
I imagine it did.

492
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:37.540
It feels good for me to find out that you did it.
Um,
anyway,

493
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:39.070
so fast forward a little bit.

494
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:44.100
My wife's sister is now sending text messages about him wanting a rematch,

495
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.210
blah,
blah,
blah.
Also,
it's your wife's sister that he's slapping around.
Oh,

496
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:52.990
this guy wants a rematch.
The guy writes lol.

497
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.700
We live in close proximity.

498
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:59.701
So it is not unusual to see these slugs at the same grocery store or liquor

499
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:01.660
store,
gas station,
et Cetera.

500
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.920
So when the time comes and I do see this stupid little fuck,

501
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.210
how do I play it?
I have nothing to prove.
I don't like to fight.

502
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.390
I'm 31 years old and have a family,
but I'm,

503
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:18.870
but I'm certain this cunt will put me in a position when I do see him.

504
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.770
If you were me,

505
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.580
how would you go about handling this situation when it does arise,

506
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.400
which I'm sure it will sooner or later.
Thanks bill.

507
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.303
<v 2>MMM.</v>

508
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.690
<v 0>What would I do a,
I call him up.</v>

509
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.350
I called the guy up the lovely Nia.
Everybody don't,
yeah.

510
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.620
Um,
I would call the guy up

511
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.420
and uh,
I tried it that way.

512
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.180
Call him up while he's sober and you're sober.

513
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.160
You do it over the phone so it doesn't escalate to a physical thing.

514
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.020
And I would just say,
listen,

515
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.860
I heard that you're saying that you want a rematch and all that type of stuff.

516
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:12.110
All right?
I don't want to fight you.
That's not what I want to do.

517
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.880
But if you put me in a position,

518
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.890
I will defend myself and the outcome is going to be the same.
All right?

519
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.290
Stop being a fucking pussy.
Learn how to hold your alcohol.

520
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.740
All right?
But I'm gonna tell you right now,
I am not looking for a fight,

521
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.600
but if you come at me,

522
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.080
I am going to pound your short little ass into the fucking ground in front of

523
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:39.920
your wife and kids.
All right.
That's what I'm going to do.
And by the way,

524
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.780
stop slapping around your wife.
I don't know.
That's probably bad advice.

525
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:49.150
Maybe say something better than that,
but,
um,

526
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.620
do it over the phone.
Is there a nice way to say that?
Just say,
listen man,

527
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:57.050
I don't want to fight you.
All right.
I heard that you want a rematch.

528
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.360
It's unfortunate that things got physical.

529
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.920
That's the route you go because you won the fight.
So there's no real,

530
00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:08.840
you don't have to gloat.
He knows what happened.
All right?
You know,

531
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:13.520
you got out of hand,
you know,
maybe you to go to AA or something.

532
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.400
You know,
you seem to be a really chippy when you have a couple of drinks.
Um,

533
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.250
and then when he starts yelling all this stuff,
just say,
listen,

534
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.840
I didn't call up to argue with you.

535
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.140
I'm just telling you I don't want to fight you again.
All right?

536
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.950
Please don't put me in a position to have to fight you again.

537
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.010
All right?
Just leave it there.
Ah,
you know what,
you guys,
you know what?

538
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:39.970
It's inevitable.
You guys are going to fight.
All right,

539
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:44.720
so just drop that guy.
Give him a fucking straight right.

540
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:46.970
Just fucking rightness.
Fucking chops.

541
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:54.610
Why don't you go over there?
Just go over there and fight him again.

542
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.020
Kick his ass and it's Rome in the bushes and just laugh as you watched that

543
00:34:59.021 --> 00:35:03.700
little fucker tap to crawl out of them.
You know,
you know what I'm worried about,

544
00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.290
sir?
Is it,
you're going to end up getting sued.

545
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.050
You know that's something that the little [inaudible] this guy in the,

546
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:15.670
he's actually the fucking,
I dunno,
he slaps his wife around.

547
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.030
Does it keep groceries in the fridge?
He can't hold his alcohol.

548
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.880
The guy that wrote you?
No,
no,
no,
no.

549
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.920
The guy that wrote me this is his brother in law.

550
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.440
His brother in law on his son.
His sister.
No,
I don't know.

551
00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:33.040
I think it's his wife's sister.
I mean,
I,
I don't get it.

552
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:35.860
I don't get what's going on here.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I mean,

553
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.160
cause if he slapped around your sister,
you should do with James Caan did in the,

554
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.850
in the godfather and beat the fuck out of him with every,

555
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.610
you know,
trashcan on the block.

556
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

557
00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.420
<v 0>I Dunno,
I don't,
it seems real.
I Dunno.</v>

558
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.870
For some reason his question wasn't about how do I get him to stop hitting his

559
00:35:58.871 --> 00:36:03.760
wife.
Yeah.
That's Kinda the main issue,
isn't it?
I Dunno.

560
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.420
I don't think that that's,
I don't think in his world it is.
These might be a,

561
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.110
that you see that show Gypsy blood when we were over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

562
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.650
Like those guys like fucking there.

563
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.900
They have cockfights they kicked the family dog around and they have their kids

564
00:36:20.901 --> 00:36:21.430
sit there.

565
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:26.320
Pete have half hour fights with each other taking punches to the head and this

566
00:36:26.321 --> 00:36:27.460
and that going go,
you got it.

567
00:36:27.461 --> 00:36:31.570
You got to convince this woman to leave this asshole.
That's the thing.

568
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:38.010
Uh,
that's a real,
why wouldn't you do that?

569
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.470
He's slapping her around Lima.
He tried to tell her that some leave him.
Well,

570
00:36:41.471 --> 00:36:42.580
why wouldn't she leave?

571
00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.520
<v 1>You know what I mean?
What do you mean?</v>

572
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:50.440
<v 0>There's a,
there's a million reasons why people stay in abusive relationships.</v>

573
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.010
It's not so black and white and like,
oh,
you're getting beat up leave.

574
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.410
It's sometimes more complicated than that.
Well,
yeah,
I know,

575
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.040
but you can't just go over there and be like,
hey,

576
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.580
you know what you should believe like,

577
00:37:00.581 --> 00:37:04.040
like she doesn't know the guys slapping her around.
I'm just like,

578
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:05.160
you ain't got to have some like,
hey,

579
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:09.360
you should leave and I have an apartment for you.
Well,
yeah,
sure.
Cool.

580
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.910
Like that's like,
because other than that you're like,

581
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:13.530
that's like walking up to somebody broke going,

582
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.210
you should win the lottery now it's,
it isn't.
All right.
Well I'm stupid.

583
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.490
Listen,
don't get mad at me.
Okay.
I have to make it,
I have to keep it funny.

584
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.710
I have to keep it funny.
I understand.

585
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:28.410
I understand that guy shouldn't be hitting with the girl and he should try and

586
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:33.190
help them out.
I mean,
I mean,
that goes without saying.
What,
what,

587
00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:34.390
what?
What are they supposed to do?

588
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.410
<v 1>Well,
I don't know.</v>

589
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.120
<v 0>I mean,
yeah,
that's a tough one.
But I mean,</v>

590
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:46.100
if the wife wasn't around the husband it might,
it might help a little.

591
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.600
It might help a lot.
It sounds like.
I Dunno.

592
00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.520
It's hard to get involved in people's,

593
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.450
they should stuff that little fucker in a trashcan.
Put duct tape over the lid,

594
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.710
poke some holes in this or the cut can still breathe and then just move his wife

595
00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:05.430
out to a safe place.
There you go.
And then roll the guy down the hill.

596
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.420
All right.
It's a dilemma for Junia.
If you could be invisible for a day,

597
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.420
what would you do?
Invisible for a day.

598
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.060
What would you do?
MMM

599
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.573
<v 1>hmm.</v>

600
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.180
<v 0>I Dunno.
I would probably sit in on 'em
people's therapy sessions.</v>

601
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.000
Really?
Yeah,
it would cause I'm really interested in that kind of stuff.
Anyway,

602
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:37.960
psychology and know you can just be a therapist.
I know.

603
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.830
I want it to be a therapist for a long time.
Yeah.

604
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.980
I always said like if I wasn't doing what I'm doing now,

605
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:47.830
I'd maybe like go back to school for it.
But yeah,

606
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.860
I was going to be an invisible for a day.
That's what you would do.

607
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.560
I think I would.
Is that weird?

608
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.310
It's weird to me because I'm a p obviously you're way nicer person than I am.

609
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.510
Oh,
why?
What would you do?
Oh my God.
This a zillion things.

610
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:07.000
Everything from look up women's dresses.

611
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.790
What are you fucking two years old to a,

612
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.430
you can just go online and just see a woman,
not the sagittal canal.

613
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.050
Okay,
so you don't need to like lay down.
We are no sidewalks.
Yeah.
Like

614
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.730
I need to do,
that's the dumbest.
What a waste of our visibility.

615
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.620
That's a fucking waste.
Or you're terrible at this.
Or I would,
uh,

616
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.940
I go to the CIA building and I just start reading files.

617
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.760
That sounds more like you while I looked up dresses of agents.
Yeah.

618
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.860
You got to do something perverted.
Look,
I'm just being honest.

619
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:47.980
There's no way I could handle the power of being invisible.

620
00:39:47.981 --> 00:39:52.981
You don't have to be invisible in order to see women's like private parts that

621
00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:57.270
doesn't require,
yeah,
build it.
You can just do it on the Internet and yeah,

622
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.080
but that's not the same.
That's like,
oh,

623
00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:02.260
I can also watch that fucking Oliver Stone's JFK movie.

624
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.130
That's not like walking into the CIA building and reading all this stuff before

625
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:06.970
they black it out,

626
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.223
<v 1>you know?</v>

627
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.361
<v 0>Okay.</v>

628
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:14.140
But that makes more sense to do invisible rather than look up somebody's skirt,

629
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.460
whatever.
It's your fucking visibility.
Stop taking my visibility away.

630
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.090
Lame.
What's the next one mean?
It's,
you know,

631
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:26.980
something near my CIA thing was better than you.
[inaudible] that's like,

632
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.170
that's like a job.
You could just go do that.
That's like,

633
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:33.340
what would you do if you were invisible?
Um,
I go to a construction house,

634
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.200
construction site and watch him build a house.
He just be a construction worker.

635
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.700
No.
Do it that.
It's more about like being nosy about people's business.

636
00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:44.800
That's why I want to be invisible.
Well,

637
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.520
what you're doing is the female version of me looking up address.

638
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.050
I'm looking into their mind.
Well,
look,
if,
if,
if so I'm likely cheaper than you.

639
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.810
If guys did,
then you,
if guys genitalia looked a little better,

640
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:02.800
you'd be laying down on the sidewalk to looking at ball bags.
Yeah.
Gross.
I know.

641
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.260
No one wants to look at a ball bag.
Exactly.

642
00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:07.000
So that's why you're not a better person,
but yet.

643
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:10.960
But everyone wants to see ah hoo.
Ah,
AH,
alright.

644
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.940
Dilemma.
All right.
You were just given a yacht.
What would you name it?

645
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.860
<v 1>It's not really a dilemma about</v>

646
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.470
<v 0>Ah,
why is that a dilemma?
Fuck,
I was just given a million dollar boat.</v>

647
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.390
What would you name it?

648
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:29.043
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

649
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.250
<v 0>I Dunno.
I would,
I would name it tender headed.</v>

650
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.610
Oh God.
Yeah.
It's my name of my company.

651
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:40.730
It's my whole branding identity is tender headed.

652
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.090
Why wouldn't I not supposed to be something kind of like funny is what are you

653
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:48.470
going to name and go fuck yourself.
And I don't know off the grid.
Uh,

654
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.920
key low a board.
No,

655
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:54.770
I told you if I ever had a boat I would definitely does.
No Way.

656
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:58.550
I would not be moving drugs.
I wouldn't be able to handle that power.

657
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.940
Just taking a fucking water taxi.
Just being out there.

658
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:06.900
It's like I'm out on the water.
It's nobody out here,
you know?
Hmm.
I could just,

659
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.090
I would,
I would fucking,
I would have every once in a while,
not all the time.

660
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.430
Every once a while I would have a brick,

661
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:18.431
a weed or a kilo of coke and I would just be out there by myself just out there

662
00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:24.440
naked
jerking off on the seas and just having a good time.

663
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.240
I wouldn't handle,
I could,
I,
you know,

664
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:30.200
this is a reason why I'm where I'm at in society.
God knows better.

665
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.550
Every once in a while he fucks up and then he lets a crazy person through.

666
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.470
Um,
all right.
How far are we into this thing?

667
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:41.780
I'm really hoping this isn't going to sound fucking horrific.

668
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.790
You pause it and listen to it for a second.
I did.
That sounds,

669
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:49.340
it sounds like I'm in a fucking tin cans the best I can.

670
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.660
So there's no like levels here that I can fuck with and I don't know.

671
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.483
Um,

672
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.230
<v 3>can you give me,
can you put that thing all the way to the right?</v>

673
00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.280
Does that do anything?

674
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.450
<v 0>I Dunno what that does that,
that maybe turns it up.
Yeah.</v>

675
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.190
I have no idea how any,
uh,
how have you enjoyed being in Australia?

676
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.600
<v 3>Oh,
I've loved it.
It's been amazing.</v>

677
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:15.250
And shout out to all the cool people that came to your show.
Absolutely.

678
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:19.900
And were nice enough to say hi to me.
That all good.
A lot of people were like,

679
00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.900
they were like the lovely Nia.
Yeah,
that was really nice.

680
00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:25.540
So shout out to all you guys had said hello to me.

681
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.410
That was nice and made me feel really special and welcome.

682
00:43:29.411 --> 00:43:33.730
And now the city is amazing.
Having a great time.
Definitely want to come back.

683
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.260
<v 0>That was probably the nicest 11 seconds.
Everyone was very sincere.</v>

684
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.020
<v 3>It's true.
I've felt very welcome by.
Bye.</v>

685
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.610
<v 0>Frys it's true.
I really liked it.</v>

686
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.300
People in Australia are so nice.
You know what?

687
00:43:51.301 --> 00:43:54.660
I think it's time to talk about sweet,
sweetest day.

688
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:58.050
All Mr [inaudible] love the podcast.

Uh,

696
00:44:23.471 --> 00:44:25.000
would it be great if you could have a,

697
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:30.310
if you could print legal postage at home anytime of the day while invisible

698
00:44:30.451 --> 00:44:35.280
looking up skirt.
Um,

706
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.310
I use it whenever I send out my DVDs.
And a,

707
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:13.230
I highly recommend it.
Go to stance,
stock calm.
Before you do anything else,

708
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.120
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in [inaudible],

709
00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:17.190
B u r,
r,

710
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:21.490
and you'll get your $55 free bonus postage stamps.

711
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.420
Stop comment or bird.
All right.
Onto the sweetest day,

712
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.040
Mr. Burn,
love the podcast.
Bubba.
Okay,
onto my question.

713
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.880
My wife keeps busting my balls to participate in what I call a bullshit holiday.

714
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.210
Yeah,
it's called sweet,
sweetest day.

715
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.770
I've never even heard of this says certain areas of the Midwest celebrates

716
00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:46.680
something called sweetest day on the third Saturday in October.

717
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.750
It's just another excuse for cards,
flowers,
candy,
et Cetera.

718
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.010
I am originally from New Orleans,

719
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:57.090
New Orleans and didn't move to the Midwest till 2009 until then,

720
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:00.540
I was unaware of this.
I was unaware of this holiday even existed.

721
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.190
This is the first I'm hearing of it to sir.
Never heard of this at all.
Exactly.

722
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.330
It says,
I am also in the military,
so we live outside of Ohio.

723
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.460
The first six years of our marriage,

724
00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.330
this holiday was never even mentioned once.
During that time.

725
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.940
So every year since moving to Cincinnati,

726
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:21.150
I have refused to partake like clockwork.

727
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:26.180
Every year I catch flack cause my wife's friends slash family brag about the

728
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:31.320
gifts they received.
Am I being a Dick for not participating in this?

729
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.880
Should I stand my ground or given to celebrating something with only regional

730
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:38.640
importance?
Any help would be appreciated.

731
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:41.700
Go Fuck yourself and happy for me to stay.

732
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.400
And do they not celebrate Valentine's Day there.

733
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.600
This is basically what it is.
This is an extra Valentine's Day.

734
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:55.860
This is like when the NFL wanted to add more games in the players union was
like,

735
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.920
fuck that.
We're already getting enough concussions.

736
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.140
This is the Valentine's Day version of that.

737
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.270
So there's one in February and then there's one in October.
Oh,

738
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:09.330
get her something nice so she doesn't have to feel shitty in front of all those

739
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:13.350
people.
What's the big deal?
Get some flowers.

740
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:18.090
This is what the deal is.
There's some Perth.
You take her out to dinner?

741
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.230
No,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
What the fuck is she going to get him?

742
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:23.790
<v 1>Okay,</v>

743
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.130
<v 0>isn't it?
It's not a mutual thing.</v>

744
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.080
Don't try to back your out of this.
You weren't even trying,

745
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.050
you weren't even fucking even remotely thinking about the guy in this.
Wow.

746
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.770
I wasn't until you just mentioned it,
but yeah.

747
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.430
You weren't get her this getter that.
Yeah.
What about him?
Yeah.

748
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.890
You already have Valentine's date.
We already have to buy you shit.

749
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.300
You guys don't buy us a fucking thing on that.

750
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.170
What have you ever gotten me for Valentine's Day?
It's not x.

751
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.860
That's a show.
I love that too.

752
00:47:56.861 --> 00:47:59.380
Like how you guys consider sex.
Like that's a chore for you.

753
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:03.430
Like it doesn't feel good.
I wish there was a holiday where I just like,

754
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:06.710
let you blow me after you took me out to dinner.

755
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.880
Isn't that something that men are trying to get going?

756
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:13.210
That's something I was trying to get going.
No stake in a blow job day.

757
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:20.200
You know what and I'm telling you if,
if,
if you lady is a champion,

758
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:24.520
she'll actually enjoy doing that.
Making you a stake in fucking blowing you.

759
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.200
Maybe that's the compromise.

760
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:29.830
Let's do something for each other on the sweetest day.
How about that?
We'll both,

761
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.340
you know.
Yeah.
You know what I want you to do.
You want,
you want,

762
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:37.370
I don't want you to do for me on,
on sweetest day me.
Yeah.
What?

763
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.480
I want you to forget that it exists and my gift to you is that I'll do the exact

764
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:45.820
same thing.
Give me a fucking break.
You want to go out?

765
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.240
If you want to go out one night,
just say you want to go out,
don't do it.

766
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:50.010
But the ship,

767
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.860
I don't have to go out and go buy a bunch of candies and all that crap.

768
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:58.120
Who came up with this sweetest day thing.
The fucking people will make the candy.

769
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:00.740
Yeah,
but how can we use his Christ?

770
00:49:00.741 --> 00:49:03.700
Do you have to be invisible looking through files to figure that out?

771
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.880
But how she came up with the Suzuki Samurai's tips over easily.

772
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:12.730
The people who make the jeep.
But how can we haven't heard of it though.

773
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.100
How come it?
Yeah,
it's,
it's a regional thing.

774
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:20.101
Like why is it because people in Cincinnati are dumb and they don't realize that

775
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:25.740
they're getting fucked.
Don't,
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
I have no idea.
I,

776
00:49:25.741 --> 00:49:29.490
I dunno.
I Dunno why it goes on there.
Yeah.

777
00:49:29.491 --> 00:49:33.150
I mean it's definitely kind of ridiculous to have to participate in just because

778
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:37.050
everybody else is kind of ridiculous.
It's completely fucking ridiculous.

779
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.820
They can compromise my both do it.
Let's do like a special day together and it's,

780
00:49:41.821 --> 00:49:45.620
it's a together thing as opposed to let me go out by yourself.

781
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.870
So just so you can show off to you,

782
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.370
you know something about all of this shit that's just shit that you'd be going

783
00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:54.750
on in your relationship anyways.
You shouldn't have to fucking go,
you know that,

784
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:55.560
you know,

785
00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.580
hallmark said stand up and salute and then you stand up like a fucking Zombie,

786
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.570
you know,
fuck you homark fuck yourself.
Fuck all your days.
Fuck all of that.

787
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.970
What do we do every year for Valentine's Day?

788
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.110
We go out the day before Valentine's Day.
Day after day after day.

789
00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.050
But you don't even know.
Yeah.

790
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:20.051
Not on Valentine's Day to avoid the crowds because Sam's go out day in the

791
00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:23.900
inflated prices and we have a great time.
Oh,
it's phenomenal.
Yeah.

792
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.040
February 15th is one of the greatest nights.
Yeah.
That's love.
Or go out

793
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.930
<v 3>to dinner.
Nobody's out.
You just do what you do it that way.
So what,</v>

794
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:34.760
so what should he say to his wife about this?
And he'd just be like,

795
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:36.710
I'm not ready to just be in this bullshit.

796
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.620
I don't want her to have to go through what I go through is what does she have

797
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:43.690
to do?
He,
she's go,
hey swaty and just when she looks at the grand,

798
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.680
it's grabbed his dick.
I got y'all today.

799
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.010
Right here for some sugar.
Right on my deck.
Right.

800
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.390
There you go.
There's your fucking ballpark.

801
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.750
No,
it's stupid.
Um,
she probably knows it's stupid too,
but you know,

802
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:07.110
everybody else is like,
oh,
you didn't get you.
Who is this Brad Rad?
No,

803
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:11.300
we don't need names.
Oh,
you don't name names?
It's Chad.
Chad.

804
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.770
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,

805
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:20.450
it's my fault for showing it to God.
Look,
um,
yeah,

806
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.960
the third Saturday in October.
Yeah.
That's weird.

807
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:30.020
Well,
I,
it,
it's,
it's yet another one way holiday.

808
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.360
This is what I would say that would be like,

809
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.180
I would just be like,
look this,
there's already a Valentine's Day.

810
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.580
Christmas is right around the corner.
You know what I mean?
And it's like,

811
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:47.460
when was the last time he made me a steak and blew me because it's fucking steak

812
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.760
in a blow job that we got.
We really have to come up with a day.

813
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.700
Maybe it should be the third Saturday of October.

814
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:59.030
October is Halloween.
Sweden.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's figure this out.

815
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:01.810
All right.
Okay.
January is new years.

816
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.430
February and Valentines Day and Abe Lincoln's birthday or George Washington or

817
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:10.790
something like that.
It's black history month.
Black history month.
Okay,

818
00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:15.390
so that's out.
Um,

819
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:20.150
March.
March is Saint Patrick's Day.
We got,
we get,
it's got to be a month left.

820
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.360
That feels like something that would fall in line with Saint Patrick's day.

821
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.860
It's taken a blow dry day.

822
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:29.750
It sounds like you just can't get a drunken Irish food would come up here.

823
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:33.330
That then it gets to Frat boy and then you get that,
then it becomes date rape.

824
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:37.910
Then it becomes rapey.
April is Easter

825
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:44.550
in April fool's day and Hitler's birthday,
so that's out for 20 minutes.

826
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.780
May Mother's Day.
Memorial Day.
God Damn.

827
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.340
June is father's day.
Father's Day.
June.
That's weird.

828
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.570
Huh?
Like for father's Day,
like if your husband's a father,

829
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:06.950
give him a snake and a blow job.
A blow job to bits.
Right.

830
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.860
She want to stay,
I don't know.
July that fourth the 4th of July.

831
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:16.680
Yeah,
that works.
No,
no.

832
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:19.820
It feels like more of a fall holiday.
Honestly.
The staking a blowjob.

833
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.140
What about August is nothing in August.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah,
this is good.

834
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.720
They go to the end of the summer,
August or September.
Corn is in season.

835
00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.340
It's very phallic looking.
There you go.
Come up with a day.

836
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.770
The 17th okay.
August 17 that's right.

837
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.370
Have a blowjob like lucky seven and one blowjob.

838
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:48.300
You heard it here first folks,
August 17 second a blow job there.
You know what?

839
00:53:48.301 --> 00:53:50.700
There's a lot of women out there that are actually going to enjoy doing that.

840
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.390
Put it in the calendar so when it comes up next year you make a big
announcement.

841
00:53:55.130 --> 00:54:00.120
I got to get this thing going.
I have to trending on Twitter to get it going.

842

Just like the podcasts.

876
00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:17.880
Podcasts is where we're kind of underground.
When he blasted the hallmark,

877
00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:18.890
they're obviously an ethical,

878
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.830
had anything to do with fuck call mark hallmarks right there with Nike.

879
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.370
Just do it.
Keep sowing you piece of shit.

880
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.500
Give us the money.
Yeah.

881
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:36.020
It's so ridiculous.
Um,
and they,

882
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.560
all I talk about is the shame of Lance Armstrong.

883
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:43.561
What about the shame of having people have to sweep raw sewage out of their

884
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:47.500
fucking houses during the rainy season because you're not paying them enough

885
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:51.310
money that they got to have a door on their fucking concrete dwelling.

886
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:57.400
I don't,
what are you going to vote anyways?
Anyways,
um,

887
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.200
we got anything left.
Oh,
he's the last thing for this week.
Learning Spanish.

888
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.720
Uh,
what's up bill?

889
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.470
I heard you bitching about Rosetta stone on your latest podcast.

890
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.620
I wasn't bitching about it.
I was frustrated that,
uh,

891
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:16.270
I don't have the time to commit to it.
You were bitching.
I was a bitching.

892
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.430
You always bash.
Yeah,

893
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:22.810
but I wasn't bitching about Rosetta stone of pitching that I couldn't get the

894
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:27.730
fucking,
I had lost the disk.
I like Rosetta stone.
Okay.

895
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.610
All right.
Then he said,
dude,
that's old technology.

896
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.500
It's like you're still trying to make phone calls with one of those backpack

897
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:39.970
windup army phones we used in Vietnam.
Jesus Christ is that old.

898
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:45.820
Uh,
yeah.
It's like he goes,
just give this a try.

899
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:51.370
It's a free website.
I'll fuck you in your advertising and trying to get in here.

900
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.880
Okay.
He says this,
this,
this other place.
The format.

901
00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.490
Okay.
The format they have for learning a language,
in my opinion,

902
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:04.870
is far superior to resent a stone.
I'm,
I'ms ,

903
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.200
I'm guessing this person actually make some money off this.
He Goes,

904
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:13.201
plus there's no fucking software and it's free tracks your progress and it

905
00:58:13.431 --> 00:58:16.960
allows you to communicate with other users if you're having trouble.

906
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.430
Very helpful.
Just trying to help out a fellow ginger.
All right.

907
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:25.000
Ginger has got to stick together.
I,
I am a redhead.

908
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.120
I'm from the states were called redheads.

909
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.940
All these people in the states using that expression.

910
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:35.560
Ginger is fucking hilarious to me with the fucking,

911
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.850
what was Austin Powers steam out of nowhere.
Was that ginger?

912
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.680
How is,
I know ginger is red,

913
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.670
but what is it about ginger that is rent?

914
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.540
Like where did they came up with spice,
isn't it the spice?
Yeah,
baby.

915
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:53.410
You look at a ginger using a ginger root before it's now red.
No,

916
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:57.840
you have I put it in.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
I am.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

917
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:03.190
It's not right at all.
Oh,
I don't know how it came about from fucking dry.

918
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:07.180
Ginger is,
well,
I don't think so.
I have no idea.
Anyway.
Um,

919
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.050
so you know what's funny too is how people keep sending me things saying that

920
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.580
redheads are going to be extinct by the year 2080.

921
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:18.940
It's like,
it's so alive.
I mean,
what,
how is it gonna Affect My,

922
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:22.100
I won't be extinct.
I'll be dead

923
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.810
<v 0>from fucking old age.
Hopefully.</v>

924
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.900
<v 3>I don't understand how redheads are supposed to be extinct.
Like a whole,</v>

925
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.441
I'd like,

926
00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:33.440
there'll be no more people in the world who have red hair ever.
Like what,

927
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:34.560
what,
based on what

928
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:40.510
<v 0>dos or somebody said something on the Internet and all these fucking morons who</v>

929
00:59:41.351 --> 00:59:44.050
aren't qualified to pass it on.

930
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.860
<v 3>Yeah.
I'm going to go ahead and,
and say that that's probably an urban myth.</v>

931
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.500
<v 0>You know,
it's funny,
as I was describing what they were doing,</v>

932
00:59:50.501 --> 00:59:55.130
I realized that I describe what I do on stage every night.
Yeah.
By the way.

933
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.680
But that's the fun.
Great.
