1
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.810
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.350
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.490
Just before Friday.

4
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:11.491
Monday morning podcast and ah,

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.040
just whisper and wild check it out.
Yeah.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
<v 1>It's like fucking seven 15 in the morning.
My wife's downstairs still sleeping.</v>

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.620
Um,
you know what's Hilarious fucking verse.
He texts me,
right?

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
It like six,
10 in the morning.
He goes,

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:34.320
I was just at a great diner,
ordered eggs over medium.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.570
They came eggs over easy and then writes unreal.

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.300
So then I wrote back,
I text back,
right?
I was laying in bed,

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.180
my fucking phone goes off.
Right?
So I wake up and that's what,
that's what I read,

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.290
right?
So I just text him back and I go,

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.120
they didn't care Paul.
Right?

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.480
And then he writes t techs back.

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.350
How were you up at this hour animal?

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.210
And then I text back,
I go out,
cause some guy on the east coast keeps texting me.

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.510
How come when you put your fucking phone on vibrate?

20
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.720
I guess it's the vibrating sound.
You think it's going to be silent?

21
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.610
I got to find this thing.
Go into your settings.
Oh fuck you.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
You know,
my goal for 2016 is just not going to my settings.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.520
What are they going to come up with?

24
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:33.780
The fucking robot that does that four year right?
Just goes into your set.

25
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.710
Why you don't want that?
Then you lose total control.
That's like sign it over.

26
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:40.610
Power of attorney,
at least fucking dope said.

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.620
I know the guys and I'd have a a money manager and you know I haven't paid a

28
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:49.980
bill a year.
So they just have some guy writing checks on their account,

29
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.840
signing their fucking name.
Oh there you go.
Is it good move financially.
What?

30
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.360
Cause you don't want to lick a stamp a couple of times a week,

31
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.910
you're going to just hand over all your finances.

32
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.720
Everything you ever fucking work for to some fucking jerk off

33
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.580
can't do that shit.
You cannot do that.

34
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.280
Anytime you're in a position of a money manager,

35
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.020
you can not do it because there's no way.

36
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.440
You're not making more money than that fucking guy.
If he was,

37
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:19.780
he'd have his own money manager,
right?

38
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.360
So all he's going to do is see you making more money than him.

39
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.230
And then he's handled it and all the money,

40
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.800
and then eventually he's going to be like,
hey,
you know your,

41
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.470
I think I'm entitled to more.

42
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.660
Maybe I'm going to go to Mcdonald's today on his dime.

43
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.850
And he writes a check Bot up,
up,
up.
Ooh.
For four bucks,
right?

44
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.420
Big fucking chows down.
Yeah.

45
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.660
<v 1>Any weights if just go pays attention.
See if he fucking notices</v>

47
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.840
about a $4 checked at Mcdonald's was written this month.
Dothan Shay,

48
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.310
wait another month.
Plates.
Safe place safe.
I mean,
we're fucking with jail time.

49
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.520
He had played safe,
right?
You go to three months,
he doesn't fucking notice.

50
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.730
I gave my kids got a birthday coming up.
La.

51
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550
Let's see if I dip in here and I go to fucking toys are rest.

52
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.580
Let's see if he noticed this and see if he notices.

53
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.240
I go down there and get the fucking Millennium Falcon and all these star wars

54
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.230
shit for my son and for my daughter.
I'll get her the fucking kitty.

55
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.890
Carry all fucking easy bake.
Whatever the fuck you get abroad.
Right?

56
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.990
A little broad LP,
right?
Not Linden.

57
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800
By talking a little bright here,
right?
So you fucking go down.
You do that,
right?

58
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230
There's fucking whatever,
150 bucks.
So the camp does,

59
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.620
he notice doesn't fucking notice,
right.

60
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.550
Does Not fucking notice.
And then you know,
he just Spec it.

61
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.300
It just keeps opening and opening and then the gate can't stop,

62
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.360
can't fucking stock himself.
He's taken so much fucking money.

63
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.560
He starts donating some of it to charity.
He's fucking taking his friends out.

64
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.920
I don't worry.
It's on me.
Right?

65
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400
That's all the guilt he knows it's coming is he sits between his 2000 thread

66
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.690
count fucking sheets at night.

67
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.930
He's just laying there known at some point that door's going to be kicked in.

68
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.850
You know,
he's just going to hear out the door
and then he's going to be like,

69
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:11.120
did I just dream that?
Boom,
it's going to come open and there is going to be

70
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.960
like Jerry Lunda Guard and fucking,
uh,

71
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.890
and Fargo trying to go out that bathroom window and they're just going to grab

72
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:21.724
him as he,

73
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.433
<v 0>Eh,</v>

74
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.910
<v 1>face down on the fucking bed.
Right.
And then is what's going to happen.</v>

75
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:29.181
All right.

76
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:31.790
They'd get them and they go to jail and then what the fuck you going to do then?

77
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:35.630
You've got to take this to court.
He's already blown all the fucking cash.

78
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.853
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.550
<v 1>Or you know what you could do?</v>

80
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.960
You could make out a check to the fucking gas company every fucking month.

81
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:43.920
He could do that.
You know,

82
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:47.580
you could sit down in front of the TV watching a little bit of the,

83
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:50.640
knew she could do that and just not open yourself up to that shit.
I mean,

84
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.590
that's what you could do.
Oh,
I'm on my fucking stump today.

85
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.140
I just yell at my wife is going to give me shit.

86
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:00.780
But you know when you're in a relationship,

87
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:05.160
does this ups and downs in the relationships and there's times when you give a

88
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:08.430
shit what that person thinks about you.
And then there's times when you don't.

89
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.280
<v 0>Okay,</v>

90
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.910
<v 1>seven in the morning on a Thursday.
What?
I'm a little grumpy.
I don't give a fuck.</v>

91
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.990
She'll be mad through breakfast.
I just do to stand.

92
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:22.130
Why you have to yell that early in the morning?
I don't understand.

93
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.720
I know you don't understand.
I know all day long.

94
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:31.070
You don't understand.
See a fucking God damn emo.

95
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.780
That's the lady's emo.

96
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.640
I don't understand why you don't just do everything that I want at the moment

97
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:42.260
that I want you to do it.
I don't understand that I live with somebody else,

98
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:46.130
then it's a different schedule than I do.
I don't understand.

99
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.180
Um,
anyways,
Jesus Christ.
I,
uh,

100
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.030
you know,
I've watched the last three Celtic games in a row believer in and not,

101
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.460
<v 2>I can't remember the last time I watched three Celtic games,</v>

102
00:06:00.461 --> 00:06:03.550
regular season games in a row.

103
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.470
Not even when we bought the NBA title in 2007,

104
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.980
2008,
whatever the fuck it was right that season.

105
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.650
I never watched three games in a row.
I just didn't,

106
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.120
I hadn't watched him and for fucking ever,
I was totally turned off by the NBA.

107
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.350
I was convinced that it was fixed.
I said it for years.
I said,
this game,

108
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.180
the fucking league is fixed.

109
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.780
And then they ended up finding a rough that was fixing games that fuck the

110
00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:33.400
Sacramento Kings out of a playoff series.

111
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.080
The Western Conference finals,
if I remember correctly,

112
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.130
and the Lakers went on to the finals and won a championship.
That guy,

113
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:46.600
he's admitted that he fixed that series.
The Lakers still have that banner.
Right.

114
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.110
And I didn't give a shit.
I would sit now,
I felt vindicated going,
hey look,

115
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.130
this is what I've been saying.

116
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.890
I told you it was fixed and you know what these hoop had said to me.

117
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.720
That's right.
I call them who?
Peds.
You don't what they said they got on.

118
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.950
It's just one guy.
It's just one fucking guy.

119
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.800
Hilarious.
Fucking hilarious.
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.510
I'd love to see a guy do that on like the view or the talk one of those shows,

121
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:12.010
you know,
with all the ladies sitting there,

122
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.940
when they bring up domestic violence going over,
fuck,
hey blah blah blah.

123
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:18.340
Women are beaten every year and just be like,
well you know,
it's just like,

124
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:19.870
you know,
it's like 6% of guys,

125
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.190
other 94% of us are crushing it

126
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.560
<v 1>as far as not hitting women.
I'd love to see it do that.
You know what?</v>

127
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.670
You'd be called a fucking sexist,
that God damn animal.
It would probably,

128
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.550
if they could affect your bottom line,

129
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.140
cause it's never ed about educating people when they make ignorant statements,

130
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.520
it's about destroying their ability to earn a living,

131
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.100
which is great.
You know what I mean?

132
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.030
Cause I'm sure that helps that person's hateful heart.
You know,

133
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.610
to have the group that they have an issue with,

134
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.200
take away his paycheck every fuck at wake or her paycheck,
then I'm sure they go,

135
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:04.910
oh now I get it.
Now I get,
I should be less racist.

136
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.840
And like they,
they do that when someone gets busted for being a racist.
Right.

137
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.630
They get busted for fucking being a racist.
Right.

138
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.400
And rather than trying to educate them,

139
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.540
they just kick them out on the fucking street.
Where does,

140
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.820
I'm not saying you don't hold somebody accountable.

141
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.510
I'm not saying you don't sit down until you should try to fucking educate them.

142
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.840
I guess there's gotta be some sort of a fine though,
right?

143
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.680
Get a couple of weeks suspension.
I don't know.

144
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.800
How do you get your really change in a racist?

145
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.240
<v 2>I don't know.
You know what I mean?</v>

146
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.920
<v 1>Well,
you know what white guys can't jump,
but they make those little things that,</v>

147
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:44.130
you know,
they stick on the bottom of your sneakers to give you the quick twitch.

148
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.810
At least they showed that on the back of the,
you know,
the comic books.

149
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.910
Maybe they could make that full like racist people,

150
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.090
<v 2>you know,
a better yet.
You know,
not better yet,
but have</v>

151
00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.230
<v 1>alleged we switch it up.
How about,
how about nags?
You know,</v>

152
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.450
if you're with somebody who's just a whiner or they nag at that,

153
00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:08.810
just a fucking pain in the ass.
It's just something you can put on the bottom.

154
00:09:08.811 --> 00:09:11.600
This shoe,
give him a little spring in this step,
you know,

155
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.580
get the endorphins moving.
You know what I mean?
Get him to walk around the block.

156
00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:20.690
Maybe see a couple of butterflies,
you know,
chill the fuck out.

157
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:22.490
Maybe you could do that.
I have no idea.

158
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.070
Do you see those two surfers in Australia and vented that thing that can vacuum

159
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:31.220
up the ocean?
It really can't,

160
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:33.740
but it could get rid of a lot of litter.

161
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.120
I don't know how many you'd need to fuck it in the swirl we got going up there

162
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:42.320
and the fucking Pacific Ocean.
But it was a really cool idea and it was um,

163
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.700
evidently safe Marie for marine life and all of that type of shit.

164
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:51.110
And it actually gave me hope for our ability to,
uh,

165
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.090
continue being here for any sort of foreseeable future.
And then I was just like,

166
00:09:56.091 --> 00:10:00.260
you know,
what's going to happen?
Is there a,

167
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.350
the game that they're going to have to play to get that thing to a national

168
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.830
fucking level,

169
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.240
international level that everybody would actually use it,

170
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.330
the sea of corporate and political red tape that you would have to go through

171
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.210
and the amount of ownership that you're going to have to give up.

172
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.370
Probably 100%.

173
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

174
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.330
<v 1>To actually make that fucking thing happened
is prop.</v>

175
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:38.331
The chances of them actually using that fucking thing is probably Zeros.

176
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.310
Fucking percent.
That's what's going to fucking happen.
You know what I mean?
Hey,

177
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:48.120
is a thing that could possibly solve the problem.
What is the thing?
You know,

178
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:51.990
it's funny as you vacuum up the fucking litter out of the ocean and then where

179
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:52.824
do you put it?

180
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.413
<v 0>You know,</v>

181
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.640
<v 1>then you put it in the ground.
And what about the worms?</v>

182
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.220
Then the parts can't eat it than the cats have nothing to eat.

183
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:06.830
The dogs have nothing to chase.
You know,

184
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:10.790
certain groups of people have nothing to eat right then we have nobody to fight,

185
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.090
eh,
then fuck it.
Uh,
our military goes down the j out so fucking,
it's a tough,

186
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.200
it's a slippery slope.
You start vacuum out the ocean.
You know,

187
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:22.430
I was thinking the other day,
you know,

188
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:27.431
when the world population got out of control is when Shit couldn't be made out

189
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:30.770
of natural shit anymore.

190
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

191
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.600
<v 1>You know,</v>

192
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600
like if you look at kids toys and back in like the forties and fifties if you go

193
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:42.170
on Ebay and look at those creepy fucking toys played by now,

194
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.580
dead kids,

195
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.480
kids that are now grown up,
gutting divorce you.
Oh Jesus,

196
00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:56.730
I the fucking clouds hanging over me today.

197
00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.660
This is what happens if somebody texts me before I want to fucking wake up
grumpy

198
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.761
back then.

199
00:12:02.761 --> 00:12:06.660
If you look at those creepy as fucking toys that looks slightly haunted,

200
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.820
you know what I mean?
They made out of wood,
metal,
the cars,

201
00:12:11.821 --> 00:12:16.770
even like the tires who made out of rubber,
that was all,
all natural shit.

202
00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:20.280
So at the end of the day,
if you fucking threw those things out,

203
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.760
even if you throw them into the fucking ocean,
they don't belong in there.

204
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.730
The end of the day,
what do you got?
You got a little bit of metal,

205
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.680
a little bit of wood,
right?
It's going to break down.

206
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.240
It's going to be fine.
I'm not saying it's trove fucking,
you know,

207
00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:39.030
old dead kid's toys into the ocean.
That's not what I'm saying.
Yeah.

208
00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:39.870
But I'm saying or whatever.

209
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:44.700
You take it down to the dump and all of that Shit's going to biodegrade.
Right.

210
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.310
It was,
you know,
once we went into the plastics,
just fuck it over.

211
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.370
Cause it was so many God damn wine and kids,

212
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.670
they had more wine and kids so they had fucking trees and rubber that comes to

213
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.020
my tree.
Right.
Jess?
What makes that little lowland?

214
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.950
He can climb that rubber tree plant.
Ah,

215
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.230
fucking it's a tree and a plant.

216
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:10.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

217
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.900
<v 1>It doesn't make any sense.
And it's the Bruce Jenner of fucking trees.</v>

218
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.630
It's a hybrid.
It's got a leg on either side of the fence.

219
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.510
Um,
let me look to shut up.
Oh,
you get to listen to bill type here.

220
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.860
Just what makes that little ant Danky can climb that rubber tree.

221
00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:37.700
Plant.
Rubber tree plant.

222
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:42.290
Maybe they just put plants in there so it would rhyme with everyone knows that

223
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.390
it can't climb a rubber tree plant.

224
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.080
<v 1>All right.
Images.
Well that looks like a fucking plant to me.</v>

226
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.090
Rubber tree plant.

227
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

228
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:04.200
<v 1>Why?
What is it?
Any of them say rubber tree plant on it.
Rubber tree plant.</v>

229
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.370
You know what?
My apologies to Frank Sinatra,
whoever wrote that fucking song,

230
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.430
rubber tree plant be the first to view this product.

231
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.690
You can get one for 50 bucks.
Don't.
I'm telling you,

232
00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.640
if you fucking had a bunch of those things,

233
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.610
if you had a bunch of rubber tree plants,
right,

234
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.520
and you just grew them in a greenhouse outside your house,

235
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:26.460
all your neighbors would think that you were fucking,
you know,

236
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.880
dealing weed and all you would do it was just making yourself your own homemade

237
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.040
radio tie.
Yes.

238
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.290
Can you still buy studded tires?
Do you remember those fucking things?

239
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.460
They had nails in them.
You know,

240
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.120
you could run over children with them and they blame the kids studded tires.

241
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.440
Now you go studied tires for a stud list,
snow tires,

242
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.900
images for studded tires.
Look at that or you get a little traction.

243
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.880
Then of course some rednecks got to do it with the spikes coming out.
Yeah.

244
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

245
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.040
<v 1>I love those rednecks who like raw Roland call that fucking dope.</v>

246
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.480
Like to make it some sort of statement and they always turn it on and they blow

247
00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:19.200
the black smoke into a Prius.
Yeah.

248
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.410
So he's a guy's like pumping their fists.

249
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.773
<v 0>MMM.</v>

250
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.430
<v 1>I Dunno.
It's one of my favorite things.
So what was I talking about?
Yeah,</v>

251
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:31.430
you got to go back to make the kids' toys.
If I was elected president,

252
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.960
if I was running for office,
right.
I,

253
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.440
I,
that's what I would say.
I would go up there.

254
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.000
I would completely ignore Donald Trump.
And whenever he talked to me,

255
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:45.830
I would just look at the crowd and be like,

256
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.570
is he puckering his lips or his lips still?
Puckering I can't look at him.

257
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:55.460
He looks,
he looks like an old angry fish who,
uh,
didn't achieve his dreams.

258
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.380
And now we pick it on all the younger fish.
Sorry.

259
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.960
And is,
here's the color of a goldfish.
Um,

260
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.460
I would just say listen,

261
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.290
but we need to do is we need to get the population down to where we can make

262
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.800
children's toys out of wood,
metal and rubber again.

263
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.860
Do you understand me?
We got to stop vaccinating people for polio.

264
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.350
We got to let the measles come back.
We got up,
we got a burn off the herd.

265
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.963
Okay.

266
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.710
So we need to do so we can once again make toys,

267
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.860
but a wood,
metal and rubber.
Same thing with cars.

268
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.970
And I don't give a fuck about safety.
No more crumple zones.

269
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.583
All right.

270
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.470
Go back to the old days in a sticky and fucking model.
T's,

271
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.220
you know,
driving around in a Goddamn toaster.
That's what's going to happen.

272
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.840
And then you whip around the corner,

273
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.710
you have flipped the fucking thing over and that's it for you.
Right?

274
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.710
And you biodegrade and sodas the car,

275
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.580
cause it's going to be no more growth hormones and preservatives or any of that

276
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:07.690
shit in the fucking food.
Oh yeah.
People are going to starve.

277
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.650
Goddamn right.
They are tech on a fucking starve.

278
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.430
<v 1>But they're going to biodegrade.</v>

280
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

281
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.490
<v 1>And they will create,</v>

282
00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:23.170
will throw them all on the same fucking ditch and they will create a fossil fuel

283
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:25.690
that we can use to gather in the future

284
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.520
kind of octane.
You think that would be set the right word.

285
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.993
<v 0>Okay.</v>

286
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.540
<v 1>You know,
human beings turns into a fossil fuel.
Do you think we'd be an 87</v>

287
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.290
91 or [inaudible] 93 whatever the fuck that means?

288
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.960
Is that just a purification process?
You know,
it's funny.

289
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:48.010
There's actually somebody who's not in that industry that actually could explain

290
00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:52.800
it.
That's the kind of person you do not want to be in a car with for any low,

291
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.510
like
I can't want it.
What the fuck?
I'm trying to say.

292
00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.440
Long specific time.
It didn't sound right in my fucking head and I still said it.

293
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.600
Long period of time.

294
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.140
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

295
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.890
<v 1>That fucking guy who just knows a little bit about everything,</v>

296
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.640
but he's still fucking in that fucking one bedroom apartment.

297
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.580
You know that guy still in that same apartment.

298
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.260
He's been there for 13 fucking years and there's not a subject on the planet

299
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:24.261
that you could fucking bring up yet that content has not got his bag of gold.

300
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.770
Why is that?
I'll tell you why.

301
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:30.890
If you had a ton of fucking person that no one wants to drive across town within

302
00:18:30.891 --> 00:18:31.724
a fucking car,

303
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.940
do you think somebody wants to spend eight hours a day in a board room with you?

304
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.380
They don't.
They're going to bury you in that sea of cubicles,
right?

305
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.030
They're going to use you as a litmus test to see who the fuck is tough enough to

306
00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:45.230
get to the next level.

307
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.390
<v 3>Okay?</v>

308
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.080
<v 1>I'll tell you think that Susie Q down there has got to stuff for maybe a corner</v>

309
00:18:50.081 --> 00:18:53.320
office.
I know what we'll do.
We'll stick them right next to Burke.

310
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.470
Who fucking knows something about everything right,

311
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.660
but can't even clean the sleep out of his fucking,

312
00:18:58.661 --> 00:19:02.890
I have him sticking his head over a cubicle every day with this stale,

313
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:05.080
not quite bad,
but not quite fresh breath.

314
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.460
Listening to her conversations on the phone.
You know,

315
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.350
Daddy,
what are you doing this weekend?
Let's get brunch.
I'm dying to go to low.

316
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.120
Liz Vc of the best French toast that he pops his fucking head over the wall.

317
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.220
Actually,
it's French toast was not created in France.
Little known fact.

318
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.000
I mean,
she could fucking handle that.

319
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.830
She gets the corner office day after fucking day.
It's literally,

320
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.060
it's gotten to the point she can't have an orgasm because she just keeps hearing

321
00:19:40.061 --> 00:19:42.520
his fucking voice in her head,
you know?

322
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.830
<v 3>Okay,</v>

323
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.470
<v 1>boyfriend thinks she's fucking around on them or I'll fucking,</v>

324
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:49.680
life has fallen apart pitch.
She says new age woman,
right?

325
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:53.430
She's willed herself not to have a period she's going for that fucking corner

326
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:57.890
office.
You know something.

327
00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:00.680
If you're sitting there right now,
go,
what the fuck is this guy talking about?

328
00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:03.520
I'm not talking about anything.
I have a,

329
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.660
a moral obligation to talk for a half an hour every fucking Thursday.

330
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.430
God,
I'm only 20 minutes in.

331
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.380
I was woken up before I wanted to wake up and uh,
you know,
I'm a little grumpy

332
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.630
by the way.
My new fucking Bible,
uh,

333
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.860
my new fucking religion is Mario Batali's cookbook.

334
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.270
I made the chicken.
How does a hundred style,

335
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.860
which I had never heard of.

336
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.970
It was absolutely fucking delicious and I messed it up a little bit to when it

337
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:38.550
was still fucking delicious.
Could use a little more salt.

338
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.550
And I had my heat on a little bit high,

339
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.940
but I took the chicken off early and I didn't overcook it that God,
uh,

340
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.820
cause the lovely Nia came in.
She goes,
I think it's done.
Go.
You think it's done?

341
00:20:47.821 --> 00:20:50.460
She gets,
yeah,
she goes cut into it.
I go,
I hate cutting into it.

342
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.460
I don't want to cut into it cause if it's not done then I'm letting all the

343
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:57.000
fucking juices sounded dries out.
She goes,
I think it's done.
I said,
all right.

344
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.150
I could have browned it a little more,
get a little more of a golden color.

345
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.090
But other than that,
it was fucking delicious.

346
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.840
What's in it you want to add?
You want,
you might have not have asked you.

347
00:21:06.841 --> 00:21:11.790
You know what?
Let me hit pause.
I'll read it for you.
Hang on.
All right,

348
00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:14.340
I'm back.
Okay.
Yeah.
Chicken hunters style.

349
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

350
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.521
<v 1>All right.
He says,</v>

351
00:21:16.521 --> 00:21:21.521
chicken cacciatore seemed to be a subset for every mediocre chicken dish ever

352
00:21:21.741 --> 00:21:23.810
served to me at a restaurant,

353
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.900
at a rate in restaurants in the seventies and eighties.

354
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.290
I love these talking shit right out of the right out of the gate saying

355
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:33.770
everybody else who's fucked up this dish.
But I'm not,
um,

356
00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.690
anything with a mushroom or an onion in it.
Qualified for the title in my world.

357
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.560
Chicken cacciatore is simple braise.
That depends on a lot of quality,

358
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.240
a lot on the quality of the bird itself,
but Blahblahblahblahblah so,
um,

359
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.780
Cleo,
you gotta stop staring at me.
It's going to happen.

360
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.810
We're going to go to the place you want to go to.
All right.

361
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.450
You already did number one.
You already did number two.

362
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.930
And I gave you a big can of food with that extra shit you liked on top.

363
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.590
All right,
I have a podcast to do.
I have an obligation.

364
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.360
Don't yawn in the middle of this.

365
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.530
Where would you be without me?
And where would you be without humans?

366
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:15.400
You know what you'd be,
you'd still be a wolf right now.

367
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:17.740
Right now you'd be eyeballing me.
Is that thing week?

368
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.340
Can I go for its throat cliff?

369
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

370
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.170
<v 1>And a different set of circumstances.
You'd fucking eat me.
Do you realize that?</v>

371
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.890
Huh?
I'd never met a dog.
All right.

372
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.410
All right.
All right.
I never had a dog that just fuck it.

373
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.330
You're not a fucking little chihuahua.
What are you doing?

374
00:22:39.331 --> 00:22:42.540
How you I get claiming me?
Is that what the dog whisperer says?

375
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:46.050
You don't get down off the couch.
Don't lean into me.

376
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.780
I'm gonna Relax.
Got,
dammit.
I fucking love that dog.
Anyways.

377
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.650
Um,
yeah,
so I made it this week came out fucking great.
Uh,

378
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.250
the name of Mario Batali's book,

379
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:08.251
which I highly fucking recommend is a Molto Italiano 327 simple Italian recipes

380
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:15.190
to cook at home.
And uh,
let me tell you something right now.

381
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.990
Don't let the word simple for you.
All right?

382
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.080
He keeps fucking,
I got to learn how to do this.

383
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:24.910
What is this fucking thing he keeps saying?

384
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.740
What's that thing where you put the fucking meat and water like overnight begins

385
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:33.730
with a B?
I forget what the fuck it is.
He keeps bringing that shit up.

386
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.620
It's driving me nuts because I can't figure out what the,
hang on a second.

387
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:43.300
Hang on a second.
I'll find it here.
Cleo.
Stop looking at me like that.

388
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.920
I love how you,
cause you can't,
you just think you're just gonna Stare at me.

389
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.550
<v 5>MMM hmm.</v>

390
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.680
<v 1>Where is it?
Where is it?
Oh,</v>

391
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:58.590
for fuck's sakes.
Whatever.

392
00:23:58.591 --> 00:24:00.420
You guys know what I'm talking about.
You fucking,

393
00:24:00.421 --> 00:24:03.720
it's in an old school way of like Louise to try to preserve the meat.

394
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.860
But then people found out that I actually added flavor to it and it keeps

395
00:24:07.861 --> 00:24:12.270
sending me to like page three 76 to learn how to fucking do this shit.

396
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.283
Brining

397
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.570
brining was originally used as a means of preserving meats and other foods.

398
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.580
Since the advent of refrigeration,

399
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.220
such preserving techniques have become unnecessary,

400
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.050
but brining has become popular again as a means of increasing the succulents of

401
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:32.160
meat or bird cuts,
that lack of fat or great flavor.

402
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.910
So I got to learn how to fucking do that.
Isn't that great?
Cleo?

403
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.450
Like I didn't have enough on my plate.
Speaking of which,
you know,

404
00:24:39.451 --> 00:24:41.760
what an exciting thing I'm going to good go do today.

405
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.770
I'm going to get my luggage repaired.

406
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.900
I got this fucking pigeon toed wheel that's been fucking the bane of my

407
00:24:48.901 --> 00:24:53.070
existence as I go through every fucking airport in this country.
Um,

408
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.370
I can only carry the luggage on the right side if I'm on the left side.

409
00:24:56.371 --> 00:25:00.840
And that thing is that that fucked up wheel is leading the charge.
Um,

410
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.730
it's over and it's going to affect my mood and I'm going to be rude to people

411
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.140
and,
uh,
I'm finally going to get it fixed before I start another year,

412
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.520
um,
out on the road.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

413
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.500
the Patrice O'neil event is coming up.
Uh,

414
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.310
the benefit is coming up in,
uh,
Jesus Christ and a couple of weeks.

415
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.020
Are you kidding me?
That you can mine?

416
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.403
<v 5>MMM,</v>

417
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.310
<v 1>it's going to be on January the 26th.</v>

418
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.300
Now I'm getting into town before then.

419
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.630
Wouldn't it be nice if all freckles maybe did a couple of warm updates in the

420
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:45.010
tristate area?
Uh,

421
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.820
look for an announcement on those shows in the next week or so?
Um,

422
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.140
and I'll be working with an old friend of mine,
uh,

423
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.230
Al Del Benny who I started off with a long time ago and he's coming in all the

424
00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:02.200
way from Australia.
Um,

425
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.890
we all started out together with the late great Patrice O'Neil and last year

426
00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:09.320
when I was working Sydney,
Australia,

427
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:13.910
I reconnected with them and we were telling all these hilarious stories about

428
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:17.480
Patrice and how much we missed him.
And he said,
man,
I would love to come back.

429
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.660
I go,
you'd fly all the way in from Sydney,
Australia.

430
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:22.730
And he goes in a fucking heartbeat.
That all right.

431
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:27.470
That's what Patrice meant to all of us.
So he came all the way back and,
um,

432
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.480
we're going to be doing some shows together to help him pay for his trip.

433
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.020
And then we're going to do the benefit on Tuesday night.
Should be a great time.

434
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.910
Um,
which is the,
one of the good things that's actually come out of this tragedy,

435
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.500
this fucking awfulness is,
uh,
you know,

436
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:49.150
we all get to get together once a year,
um,
and do a good thing.

437
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.980
So before it gets sad,
I'm going to move on.
Um,

438
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.710
where do we go here?
Yeah,

439
00:26:56.711 --> 00:27:00.730
so I've watched like three fucking Celtic games in a row and I'm already

440
00:27:00.731 --> 00:27:02.600
watching the Bruins games.
It's like I was,

441
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.320
I feel like I'm still living in Boston right now.
It's kind of Nice.

442
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.280
You know the games come on at like four,
four 30 out here.
I taped them.

443
00:27:09.281 --> 00:27:13.300
I start watching them at like six.
I can get the game done in about 90 minutes.

444
00:27:13.301 --> 00:27:17.080
I can still go out and do my spots.
It's great.

445
00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.730
So I actually know some of the Celtics names now.
We've got a guy,
Isaiah Thomas,

446
00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.480
no relation point guard,
Jae Crowder.
I like

447
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.180
what the fuck's the other guys?
They uh,
whenever I look at his name,
I can't,

448
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.950
I can't fucking pronounce it Kelly.

449
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

450
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.010
<v 1>Oh,
Nina.
Whatever the fuck it.
I can never fucking room about a Goddamn name.</v>

451
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.440
I Dunno.
I have a dent.
We uh,

452
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.670
Tommy Heinsohn takes each one of the best big men passing in the game.

453
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.790
Kelly Olynyk Day you,

454
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:49.670
<v 0>yeah.</v>

455
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:54.010
<v 1>Had to like walk away from it.
So we lost a Brooklyn.</v>

456
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.860
We Be Brooklyn.
And then last night we fucking had the game,

457
00:27:56.861 --> 00:28:01.840
the whole fucking game and playing the Pistons and then they just kept chipping

458
00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:04.210
away at it.
I mean,

459
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:08.020
I don't know shit about the Celtics other than they score like 30th 37 in the

460
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:10.540
first quarter every night.
And then you know,
you're like,

461
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.550
I literally texted version like the Celtics and we'll lighten it up,
you know,

462
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.830
shooting some high percentage of the next quarter.
They just shit the bed there.

463
00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:25.820
We say that about basketball to game a rugs.
It's a game of runs.
Oh yeah.

464
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:26.900
It'd be sure it isn't fixed.

465
00:28:26.901 --> 00:28:30.130
They're not shaving points to keep the fucking crowd interested because if you

466
00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:32.350
blow them out in the first quarter that people are just going to turn the

467
00:28:32.351 --> 00:28:37.050
channel.
I Dunno.
So whatever.
Then this fucking kid,
right?

468
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.490
Reggie Jackson,
no relation.
So how old are you?

469
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.310
He's fucking kids are coming around.

470
00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:46.240
They get the same names of the greats that I watched when I was a kid.
Uh,

471
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:51.100
Reggie Jackson,
Jesus Christ,
kids got ice water in his veins.
Lacy did that game.

472
00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:54.340
I don't know anything about them,
but you know what's killing me is the Pistons.

473
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.250
They're back.
They got mixed filthy and McNasty again,

474
00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.080
except it's the white version.

475
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

476
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.450
<v 1>Yeah.
This fucking bearded white dude going out there.
Right.
This guy,</v>

477
00:29:05.451 --> 00:29:10.451
he used up five fouls in about six minutes and they kept him in for the whole

478
00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:13.970
fucking game.
He never filed out.

479
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.050
They had him and then they got this other big white dude who looks like the

480
00:29:18.051 --> 00:29:21.470
fucking,
one of the bad guys.
All areas.

481
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.303
Burson.

482
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.700
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

483
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.870
<v 1>Ellie Salva Dude,
you get,</v>

484
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.340
if you tell me that guy doesn't look like that guy from the James Bond movie,

485
00:29:30.341 --> 00:29:34.240
metal mouth.
They had them,
they had the metal in his mouth.
Furry,

486
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:37.660
a very clever name.
Um,

487
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:44.210
you had him at a,
who's the other guy?
Aaron Bates.

488
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.320
White,
mixed,
filthy and white.
Mcnasty.

489
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:53.180
Now for people who didn't watch the Celtics pissed as rivalry and don't know

490
00:29:53.181 --> 00:29:57.170
that reference.
That was a bill and beer who I guess was a white guy.

491
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.720
I guess now it's all white McNulty,
filthy McNasty,
um,

492
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.130
Bill and beer and,
uh,
the other guy,
what actually liked

493
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.650
Rick Mahorn does that right?
Macro Hawaiians.
That's right.
And uh,

494
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.600
what's this?
They were fucking,
you know,
Mohan was just a tough motherfucker.

495
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.490
Bill Laimbeer was a piece of shit.
That guy was a piece of shit.

496
00:30:20.491 --> 00:30:22.920
But I gotta give it up to that guy at the top of the key.

497
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.850
He fucking hit that shot every God damn time.
But other than that,

498
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.560
he was just a piece of shit.

499
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.060
And I remember watching the 30 for 30 on the bad boys in Detroit and he goes,

500
00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:35.790
you know,
we used to try and play a mind game.
He's trying to play mind games.

501
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.330
He act like he was out there playing chess.
It's just like bill,

502
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:44.190
you would take in guys knees out,
you would throw in elbows to the head.

503
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.390
That's not a head gate.

504
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.720
That's just punching somebody in the face when they're looking up,

505
00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:52.650
trying to get a rebound.
It's not a head game in that dead deep.

506
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:54.503
Um,

507
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.370
two favorite things was when Larry Bird punched him in the fucking face

508
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.750
as lamb berries at the biggest whiny look on his face.

509
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.190
It was like a giant Danny Ainge.
And when,
uh,

510
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.690
chief Robert Parish just gave him like,
he gave him,

511
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:17.280
like he would punch him with like his forearms gave him like this overhead,

512
00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:18.410
like a,
it was like,
uh,

513
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.070
when the UFC guys do like the fucking grounded pound except what was the inside

514
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:26.190
of his forearm.
And he was standing behind them.

515
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.800
It was so fucking great,

516
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.870
but he was on the ground covering up like a little girl and he was such a piece

517
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:37.020
of shit.
The refs didn't see it.
They knew what happened,

518
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:40.440
but they didn't call anything.
It was fucking tremendous.
But whatever.
Anyways,

519
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:44.520
they got these two guys now,
um,
uh,

520
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.160
Aaron Baynes and Earth Sun

521
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.750
les over whatever the fuck their names are.
Uh,
just,

522
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.660
I dunno,
it was more about the Bains gap.
Judging these guys on one fucking,

523
00:31:56.661 --> 00:32:00.440
I'm sure they're good players,
but I'm judging them on one fucking night.
But,
uh,

524
00:32:00.441 --> 00:32:02.870
what's his,
but I don't know.
I thought I thought that dude,

525
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:07.390
Reggie Jackson looked fucking great.
Um,
and then on the other nights,

526
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.960
I'm much the fucking Bruins.
It's great.

527
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:13.990
Even though we fucking can't get a run going lost to the capital's again fucking

528
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:17.900
concept.
Um,
whatever.
I'm going to keep watching.

529
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.520
Is that a true fan who clean up?
Relax.
I'm almost done here.

530
00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:27.350
How much time I got left?
Oh,
32 minutes.
32 minutes.

531
00:32:27.351 --> 00:32:29.600
All right.
So that's,
uh,
that's about it.

532
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.710
I did my contractually obligated fucking blabbering by the way.

533
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.690
It's actually been raining out here in la,
which has been tremendous.
Um,

534
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.080
<v 5>okay.</v>

535
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.230
<v 1>God knows we need,
it was like the first sustained,
we like two days of like,</v>

536
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.400
we're rained for like half the day,
like pouring,
which is tremendous.

537
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.473
And they always get,
you know,

538
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.750
La people shit because they freak out when it rains.
It's like,
well,

539
00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:56.870
we live in a desert.
And then secondly,
people just go lie,
don't drive.
It's just,

540
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.930
it's fucking rain.
Well,
what happens is,
is when it doesn't rain for a long time,

541
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.740
what happens is on the roads,
all the fucking

542
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.880
<v 5>shit from the cars.
Okay.</v>

543
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.480
<v 1>You know,
oil,
antifreeze,
transmission,
fluid,
brake fluid,</v>

544
00:33:13.481 --> 00:33:16.540
all that shit that leaks.
It just builds up

545
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.270
on the ground.
And then when the water lands,
it becomes like this soup.

546
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.730
So I'm not saying it's like snow,

547
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.720
but it's a little worse than east coast because I used to flip out when I was

548
00:33:27.721 --> 00:33:30.420
out here,
like these fucking people,
they're acting like it's a blizzard out here.

549
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:35.400
It's just rain.
Just fucking go.
But uh,
it is a little bit,
yeah,

550
00:33:35.401 --> 00:33:38.620
it's a little bit of both.
They drive like pussies out here and uh,

551
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.590
the rain is a little more slippery,
uh,
by Jesus Christ on the worst.

552
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.790
Um,
all right.
That's it.

553
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.060
That's the podcast with this fucking all the Thursday afternoon podcasts.

554
00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:51.120
I just checked in on.
Yeah,
just,
just checking in to see how your week's gone.

555
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.630
I hope it's going good.
I hope you know what?

556
00:33:54.631 --> 00:33:56.910
I hope you have a wonderful dog in your life like I do right now.

557
00:33:56.911 --> 00:34:00.780
That's just sitting staring at me because it has an inability to talk.

558
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.800
So when it does is it walks over and it sits down like a foot away from me when

559
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:07.950
it is an itching itself and it just stares at me.

560
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.540
<v 5>Cleo,
you want to go outside?</v>

561
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:20.250
Get off.
Huh?
Cleo?
See if I get to talk.

562
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:25.610
Cleo,
do you cleo?

563
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.610
Cleo,
now what are you getting Mike?
Frank,
come on.

564
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.633

You know,

618
00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:47.860
Jay law had the one about him with the Bart Nick being a teddy bear and all that

619
00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:50.710
shit.
Hope you enjoy him and I'll talk to you on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.

620
00:37:50.711 --> 00:37:51.544
You'd kind of

621
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.490
<v 5>hit the side of the gathering.
And Man,</v>

622
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.440
I was bombed his blood on my hands and have all the signs of it.

623
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.200
<v 1>All right.
Well I went to another rose bowl,</v>

624
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:26.820
everybody and I think I'm just now starting to recover.
First of all,

625
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:29.330
what a fucking game.
I um,

626
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.510
just like the rose bowls are already unbelievable.

627
00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:38.511
But to add that whole play off atmosphere to it was just insane.

628
00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.403
And uh,

629
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.760
this year being all the guys we got over there,

630
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.990
we were so fucking organized this year
we,

631
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.170
we had,
we had fucking everything.

632
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:57.170
We had fucking everything,
food,
booze,
other stuff.

633
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:06.340
Jason Law had put on a display of tailgate cooking then it,

634
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:11.300
it was,
he had a career year.
That's what we were saying.

635
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.350
He had a breakout.
It was just fucking,

636
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.210
it was the best breakfast sandwich I ever had.

637
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.910
Then he made these ribs that were unbelievable.

638
00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:23.360
Then we went to the game and at the end of the game it was freezing out by then.

639
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.890
And we were smart as how smart we were.

640
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:29.060
We brought a quarter wood and one of the grills we turned into just like a

641
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.880
firepit and everybody else too is waiting for the traffic.
Every ball,

642
00:39:32.881 --> 00:39:36.140
these people coming and gathering around our little fire going,

643
00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:38.090
you guys are smart.
It's really smart.

644
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.450
What I left out is we brought everything except fire.
We've flipped,

645
00:39:41.451 --> 00:39:42.500
forgot to bring a lighter.

646
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.260
They were bringing the grills and they were bringing the charcoal.

647
00:39:45.261 --> 00:39:47.540
So I assumed that they were going to bring the fucking lighter.

648
00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:50.480
And I brought the letter every year.
So I guess that one was one was on me.

649
00:39:50.481 --> 00:39:54.530
I don't know what,
but other than that it was a,
uh,

650
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.520
it was another amazing time.
And,
um,

651
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.710
it was fucking hilarious with basically we get into the game,

652
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.830
got in on time because it's a fucking playoff game,
right?

653
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.980
And there was so many people getting tickets said I couldn't get four together.

654
00:40:09.981 --> 00:40:14.220
I got two and two.
So we were like couple rows,
two,
three rows in front of a Bart,

655
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.510
nick and lie ahead.
And we're sitting there,
you know,
and I'm pretty,

656
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:22.720
I'm not as bad as it was last year,
but I was fucking,
uh,
I was feeling no plane.

657
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.900
All right.
I was definitely more than dehydrated at that point.

658
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:31.990
And all of a sudden I see security walking out with Jason lie head and there's

659
00:40:33.771 --> 00:40:38.771
no Joe Bortnick in Jay is looking at over at me with his hands,

660
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.990
like up like what the fuck?
And he's yelling at me and I'm going,

661
00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:44.500
Jay Jay where they take it and I'm in like,

662
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.690
I'm in the middle of this fucking road is like 30 people on one side,

663
00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:52.100
30 and the other,
this old school stadium,
right?
Total fucking fire hazard.
Right?

664
00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.700
I'm like,
Jack,
where you go Jay and he's fucking yell at me.
I can't hear.

665
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.940
And the whisking him out so fast.

666
00:40:58.941 --> 00:41:02.970
There's nothing I could do other than I just keep going with Jay.
Jay,
try

667
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.320
looking at me like,
what the fuck turns out?

668
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.810
Uh,
I don't know.
Bart.
Nick was outside.

669
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.940
He was in the stadium,
but outside the stands,

670
00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:21.060
I guess he had sat down or something and not at off the,

671
00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:21.980
when he came to,

672
00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:26.240
there was like fucking 20 cops surrounding them because he's such a big guy.

673
00:41:26.241 --> 00:41:28.520
I thought they were like,
they were like,
what is this guy starts swinging,

674
00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:33.020
we're fucked.
And they went down there and they told I,

675
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.680
they looked at his ticket
and they went up to get Jason.
That's what they did.

676
00:41:35.681 --> 00:41:37.600
And they said,
we got to,
he's been overserved,

677
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:42.870
which is the understatement for all of us for 2015 and a lie ahead.

678
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:44.231
To his credit,

679
00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:48.160
the only thing he did better than cooking was talk his way out of that.

680
00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.300
He just kept going.
I come and look at the guy and he,
he,
he's,
he's a teddy bear.

681
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.480
He said he's not,
he's not hurting anybody.
He's going to go up days and sit down.

682
00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.860
He's going to be any of that.
He's a,

683
00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.670
he just kept saying he's a teddy bear and Joe was just looking at,

684
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.393
I'm teddy bear,

685
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.480
they fucking let 'em in fucking lawyer.

686
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.710
The politician gets him to his seat,

687
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.760
he sits in his seat and then promptly fucking passes out and some lady behind

688
00:42:18.821 --> 00:42:21.430
law head goes,
hey,
you're going to have to get him outta here.

689
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:26.350
And Jay just looked at her and said,
hey,
hey,
come on.
Wait,
wait till he's not,

690
00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:29.890
her name was,
he's a teddy bear.
Okay,
listen.
And she fucking jogged back at him.

691
00:42:29.891 --> 00:42:34.420
And Jay was just like,
listen,
if tell you what,
if you will just watch the game,

692
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.420
you're not even going to see them.
Okay.
I mean,

693
00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:39.820
I can wake them up if you want me to.
I'll wake him up.

694
00:42:39.821 --> 00:42:41.860
I don't think you're gonna like it,
but I can't wake him up.

695
00:42:41.861 --> 00:42:46.030
And people just started laughing and it was over and we had a wonderful time.

696
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.020
I'm seeing two of the top college football programs play each other.

697
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.220
It's a hell of a game through two and a half quarters.
And then,
uh,
Oregon,

698
00:42:54.221 --> 00:42:59.221
I got to give a shout out to the ducks just for shutting up the Fsu band that I

699
00:42:59.471 --> 00:43:02.270
didn't have to hear that,
that fucking Tomahawk Chop again.
And I,

700
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:06.850
I dude I fucking called it that ban,
knows three songs,

701
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.600
they know the school song,
they play something else and then everything else.

702
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.573
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

703
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.550
<v 1>the whole fucking game.
And um,
it was,</v>

704
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.340
I mean,
I don't know,
I would like to see a little bit of a closer game,
but uh,

705
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:25.110
I really enjoyed,
uh,
the fact that they shut that band up.
Nothing against Fsu.

706
00:43:25.111 --> 00:43:28.130
I actually really liked the Seminoles and I've always loved that program.
But um,

707
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.150
somewhere along the line that Tom locked chopped just fucking

708
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.220
<v 3>okay.</v>

709
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.500
<v 1>It would be like if at the Red Sox,
like,
you know,</v>

710
00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:37.630
awful it is when they sync sweet Caroline.

711
00:43:37.631 --> 00:43:40.240
Just imagine if they did that between every fucking ending.

712
00:43:40.241 --> 00:43:43.030
I mean you'd want to kill yourself,
right?
If you want any sort of a human being.

713
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:44.380
And that includes being a red sox fan,

714
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:47.530
cause I want to jump off the fucking monster when I hear that fucking song.

715
00:43:47.531 --> 00:43:49.930
Just once.
I want you to look at around him,

716
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.840
fucking women putting their head on the fucking guys shoulder.
It's just like,
ah,

717
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.790
<v 3>okay.</v>

718
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.170
<v 1>I Dunno.
Maybe I dunno.</v>

719
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.690
Maybe I should be a little more positive about the shit like that.

720
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.820
I have no idea.
Um,

721
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.560
<v 3>okay.</v>

722
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.770
<v 1>The rose bowl,
everybody.
Oh Dude,
I'll tell you right now,</v>

723
00:44:06.771 --> 00:44:08.720
if you're gonna pick a beer to start the day with,

724
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.870
I'm telling you Miller high life,
ah,
in,
uh,
in the,

725
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.150
you got to get it in the bottle.
Oh my God,
the sun's just coming up.

726
00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:19.600
We've got there seven Oh four in the fucking morning.
It was freezing cold out.

727
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:22.840
There was a frost on the fairways.
I'm telling you guys,

728
00:44:22.841 --> 00:44:25.570
you've got to fucking do this.
Okay?
You don't got to go to the Rose Bowl.

729
00:44:25.571 --> 00:44:30.571
Fucking pick something that you and all you had dumb guy friends are you and all

730
00:44:32.081 --> 00:44:34.000
your dumb fucking women friends.
Just,

731
00:44:34.001 --> 00:44:38.200
you gotta have that one thing you do every year.
You got to have that.

732
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.840
I don't give a fuck what kind of responsibility you got out.

733
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:43.960
You got to have that one fucking thing.
So anyways,
we got to,

734
00:44:43.961 --> 00:44:45.970
the frost was on the fucking fairways.

735
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:47.430
<v 0>Okay?</v>

736
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.070
<v 1>I actually said this year when I got out,
I said,
hey guys,
guys,
got to go.</v>

737
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:52.980
Take this in right here.
This is the best part of the tailgate.

738
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:57.030
It's the beginning and this time tomorrow you're going to wish that,

739
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.270
that this fuck it moment.
I actually know because you'd be too hung over.

740
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.940
Three days later when you get all the poison out of your system,

741
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:04.920
you're going to be fucking longing for that feeling.

742
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.210
Do we get out of that truck ear to ear,
fucking grins.

743
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.140
And then Bart,

744
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:16.710
it's got this thing that he yells out to everybody to the entire parking lot.

745
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.570
Um,
I don't want to say what it is cause he yells,
it's so fucking loud.

746
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:23.980
And so far,
nobody's ever found our fucking tailgate,

747
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.590
which has been great because we make a spectacle of ourselves.
Uh,

748
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.330
you got to do it.
So anyways,
the Rosebowl let's,
let's read this thing here.

749
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:34.650
Dear Billy football,
uh,
love the podcast.

750
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:37.420
She knew it was special,
was nothing short of amazing.
Thank you very much.

751
00:45:37.421 --> 00:45:39.600
And thank you everybody who's been watching it,

752
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:42.720
rewatching it and telling other people to watch my new special you people are

753
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:47.520
all the same.
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Oh,
Jesus,

754
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:51.340
Bill.
Um,
I really appreciate it because a,

755
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.710
this one has been getting the best response and uh,
you know,

756
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:58.390
that makes me look good with the people I'm in business with over there at

757
00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:02.610
Netflix.
So,
uh,
you guys did me a solid.
I really appreciate it.
All right.

758
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.210
Um,
anyways.
Anyways,
here we go.
Anyway,

759
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:09.000
I had a question about your Rosebowl outing last weekend.

760
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:14.060
The game itself was great from that opening Oregon drive when Mary Yada,

761
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.610
I hope that's how you say his name.
I didn't,
it's two Heisman trophy winners.

762
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:22.560
I don't even know their fucking names.
I was so busy this year.
I was so hammered.

763
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:26.370
I even had a fucking program.
I had no idea.
Uh,

764
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:31.390
Mary Yada pitched it to the guy who somersaulted to the one yard line f and

765
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:35.580
later completed the two point conversion.
All that was great.
The beginning,
uh,

766
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.800
to famous James flopping around,

767
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:41.940
fumbling for an Oregon touchdown late in the third.

768
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.790
It was just a great game and I was thoroughly jealous.
You were there.

769
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.810
You're obviously an Oregon ducks fan.
Uh,
my question is,

770
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.730
can you share with us a couple of your favorite moments from this year is

771
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.430
Roosevelt?
I kind of did that but there's probably some more.
I'm sure you had.

772
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.140
You in the goon squad.

773
00:46:58.141 --> 00:47:03.141
You roll around with a gun and some funny situations or conflicts.

774
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:07.530
Ps,
I saw la ahead and part Nick in Boston for the all things comedy tour.

775
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.500
They were great guys and had the pleasure of sitting with Bart Nick at,

776
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.010
at the bar while Jay crushed it on stage.
Cool dudes.

777
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:17.820
I would love to drink and smoke stokes with you all some time.

778
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:20.700
Happy New Year and go fuck yourself.
You Apron wherein cont.

779
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.520
Uh,
that was a good one.
You best?
Um,

780
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.710
I think I've already told the,
uh,
the stories.
Yeah,
it's,

781
00:47:31.711 --> 00:47:36.060
I don't want the football or the food.
I mean,
I dunno,
I was pretty sober,

782
00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:40.620
but I was kind of a consistent level,
like blacked out.

783
00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:42.403
Um,

784
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.190
<v 5>okay.</v>

785
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.900
<v 1>I don't know what it was.
Was it this year?</v>

786
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.640
Just the whole fucking thing.
You know,

787
00:47:50.641 --> 00:47:54.540
it was cool as watching a father with his two sons and he was playing automatic

788
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:57.930
Qb,
it teaching his kid the cornerback to get inside,
you know,

789
00:47:57.931 --> 00:48:01.080
inside the receiver and a watching the big brother,

790
00:48:01.081 --> 00:48:04.650
older brother fucking rivalry reminded me when I was a kid,

791
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.040
I sat there smiling and drinking a beer,
probably look like a pedophile,

792
00:48:08.041 --> 00:48:11.100
but I was actually thinking nothing but clean stuff.

793
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:16.410
Everybody looks like a pedophile now.
Um,
I dunno,

794
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.710
I gotta be honest with you the whole fucking days,
a goddamned blur.

795
00:48:19.711 --> 00:48:22.170
I remember most of the game I did.

796
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.590
I passed out a little bit in the first quarter for about a minute and a half

797
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.610
football time and,
and then the second quarter for about a minute and a half.
But,

798
00:48:29.611 --> 00:48:32.910
uh,
other than that,
you know,
I crushed waters for the rest of the fucking game.

799
00:48:32.911 --> 00:48:36.510
I didn't have any beers afterwards because I had to drive.
And that's by then,

800
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.880
you know,
we stayed there till like eight 30,
nine o'clock at night.

801
00:48:38.881 --> 00:48:40.710
So by then I haven't drank in like eight hours,

802
00:48:40.711 --> 00:48:43.950
so I'm actually so sober up fucking hung over at that point.

803
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.050
<v 2>What's the Rose Bowl this year?
And I did not drink.
I did not drink.</v>

804
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.800
And I know there's a lot of you who are disappointed that I didn't drink because

805
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:18.730
you want me to fill up your life with a hilarious story of me making an ass of

806
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:23.350
myself once again to kick off a new year.
Well,
God dammit I didn't,

807
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.310
but I stood around and I watched it enough other people,
fuck it,
do it.

808
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:31.030
And I still have plenty of stories and I got the braids cells to remember them.

809
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.630
Uh,
so fucking awesome game.

810
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.250
It was Wisconsin versus Tcu and uh,

811
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.760
I was like most people,
I'm like,
who the fuck is Tcu?

812
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.630
And then you look in the program.
Let me go grab the Rose Bowl program.

813
00:49:46.631 --> 00:49:51.500
Hang on one second because you guys just
just relaxes.

814
00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:53.050
I'd walk across the road

815
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.480
trying to find the Rosebowl program.
Oh,
here it is.
Look at this.

816
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:00.314
I found it.

817
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.230
I really need to get an assistant on this podcast.
All right,
I'm back.

818
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:08.830
So here's the Rosebowl program and basically

819
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.800
the rose bowl this year,
if you were going to turn it into an awful,

820
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:19.710
you're going to turn it into an awful made for TV movie.
This was like,
I,

821
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.710
I guess it was a story about respect.
All right.
In that,
you know,

822
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.980
people barely respect Wisconsin because they never go to the rose bowl.

823
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:30.380
I can't remember the last time they won the big 10 championship,

824
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:34.550
but they finally won it.
They want it and,
uh,

825
00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:38.360
they beat the likes of,
uh,
let's,
let's see.
Let's see.
Let's see who they'd beat.

826
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:42.020
All right,
let's go through their whole fucking season here really quickly.

827
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:45.820
Stop Rolling your eyes.
You fucking commy non sports fan cunt.

828
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:49.850
All right.
Start off the year they beat Unl v.

829
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.720
These are the cupcake games early in the ED and they beat San Jose State,

830
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:57.410
Arizona State.
There's a PAC 10 team,
Austin Peay.
Who is that?

831
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:02.090
Somebody who's name did they play?
Like one guy?
Uh,
then they beat Michigan state.

832
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.850
Then they beat Minnesota.
They beat Ohio state,
right?
Big 10 Iowa.
Purdue,

833
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:11.210
you've heard of these teams?
Indiana,
Michigan,
one of those teams.

834
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.830
They actually lost two.
But I went by too quickly.
Northwestern,
you know,

835
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.680
they played some fucking teams teach.

836
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.120
See you on the other hand didn't play shit.

837
00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:29.150
So okay.
She down there outside of Dallas,
Texas,
Texas,

838
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.730
Christian.
Oh Gee.
She's university.

839
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:35.210
And you wonder why no one gives a fuck about the mountain west program.

840
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:39.670
I want you to write me and tell me just exactly.
Okay.
Oregon state though,

841
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.520
that's PAC 10,
that's a Tennessee tech.
This is,
they're undefeated season.

842
00:51:43.521 --> 00:51:48.230
They beat Oregon State,
Tennessee tech,
Baylor,
Smu,

843
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:53.510
Colorado state,
Wyoming,
Byu,
air force,

844
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:58.340
UNL,
V,
Utah,
San Diego State,

845
00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.460
New Mexico.
That was,
they're undefeated season.

846
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:05.780
And this sitting there scratching the top of their fucking heads,

847
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.010
wondering why there that people are questioning their record.

848
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.900
All right,
so here's the deal.
I'm sitting there going,
all right,

849
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:19.610
I like this big 10 even though the big 10 isn't what it used to be considering

850
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:22.820
they went,
oh,
and five on fucking new years day.
Um,

851
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.540
who doesn't like an underdog?
So I'm going,
well,
fuck it man.

852
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:29.700
I'm going to root for Tcu even though they have Christian.
Oh Geez.

853
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:32.630
He's in the middle of their fucking name,
which you know what that means?

854
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.560
They automatically think they're better than everybody else and Jesus loves us

855
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:40.640
best despite the fact that they're preaching that everybody needs to be more

856
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:42.170
understanding like Jesus.

857
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.590
Somehow they miss the irony of the fact that they feel like they're the chosen

858
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:48.860
ones,
like all stupid fucking religions do,
right?

859
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.220
Jewish people think they are the chosen ones.

860
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:56.900
Christians think they're the chosen ones.
Muslim thinks that you know what?

861
00:52:56.901 --> 00:53:00.950
You guys are all a bunch of Douche bags,
all right?
None of them matter.

862
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.690
That's why there's so many of us.

863
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.720
If we were special that only be like nine of us once there's 7 billion of

864
00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:11.060
anything.
I mean,
we're about why we're not special anymore.
Okay?

865
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.080
Do you understand that?
Well,
like socks,
you know,

866
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.150
actually some poor people can afford socks.

867
00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:22.970
The socks is still important to some people,
you know,

868
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.650
I know what the fuck I'm saying.

869
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:29.651
So they got a fucking bee in their bonnet about how nobody's respecting them.

870
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.930
So I'm sitting there,
this is before I talked to anybody from Tcu.
I just saw,

871
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:37.980
all right.
You know,
purple and black.
Those are decent colors,
man.
I liked those.

872
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:42.930
Wisconsin.
I'm looking at all these fatties from Wisconsin,
you know,

873
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.720
walking around,
just horrible,
horrible shape.
I think when,
you know,

874
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:53.630
when Europeans look at America and they think of of the fat fucks,
you know,
I,

875
00:53:53.631 --> 00:53:54.680
I think,
I dunno,

876
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:59.580
I think they send away for a Wisconsin broche university brochure every year.

877
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:05.310
I don't know what,
because Jesus Christ,
those were some healthy fucking people.

878
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.751
All right?

879
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:11.040
Evidently the recession has not hit Wisconsin yet because those people have

880
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:15.710
plenty of money for extra food.
So anyway,
so I'm sitting there and uh,

881
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.570
we start to walk into the game,
right?

882
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.110
Me and three of my buddies were all good and I don't name names on this fucking

883
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:26.500
thing.
We go to walk into this goddamn thing and I start looking around after Oh,

884
00:54:26.501 --> 00:54:29.970
after a wonderful tailgate.
We really did it up this year.

885
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.560
Plenty of booze.
Uh,
which I did not partake in.

886
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:38.850
I brought a 12 pack of water.
Go ahead,
email me,
call me a fag.

887
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.100
I don't give a fuck.
I feel great.
You fucking cunts.
Look at,

888
00:54:43.101 --> 00:54:47.250
I'm still defensive about it,
you know,
at least done one of those,
those,
those,

889
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:52.200
I'm not a preachy,
sober person.
I'm not going like,
you know,
why do you do that?

890
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:53.430
What are you,
what are you running from?

891
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:55.380
I know why you're doing it because it's fucking fun.

892
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.650
And I'd still be doing it if my head didn't get three times the size of its

893
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:00.210
usual enormous size.

894
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:05.990
You know my head when I'm not boozing looks like one of the moons of Jupiter.

895
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.540
Okay.
I don't know.

896
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.900
I don't need to continue adding to it,
you know,

897
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:16.650
and then have it be like Pluto and then scientists can fucking debate on whether

898
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:20.040
or not it's a fucking planet.
All right.
You fucking fucking fucking,
there you go.

899
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.780
See I needed the help there.
The F word for me is,
is my,

900
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.330
my uh,
uh,
what are those things?

901
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:30.570
Is the HGH of my fucking comedy.
All right.

902
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:34.020
And I will continue to use it and I don't give a shit cause they're not banned

903
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.900
in my industry.
Um,
anyways,
so what was I saying?
Oh yes.

904
00:55:38.901 --> 00:55:43.170
We had a great tailgate.
We show up.
I became in the back way this,
this,
this year.

905
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:45.420
All right.
We parked right along the fence.

906
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.080
We were right near the clubhouse on the golf course.
And then you can,

907
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:51.810
I could literally see one of the lights that lights up the stadium.

908
00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:54.180
So we were right there.
There was no way we were getting lost this year.

909
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:58.800
Actually brought a frying pan,
brought some eggs.
We had burgers,

910
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.720
hot dogs,
steak.
We had shit to throw in the omelets.

911
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:07.860
Cheese,
everything you want.
We had a spatula,
we brought tongs,
we had napkins.

912
00:56:07.861 --> 00:56:09.660
We had a fucking garbage bag.

913
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.180
We had a grill bag of charcoal,
four bags of fucking ice,

914
00:56:15.181 --> 00:56:16.260
a coolie and everything.

915
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.570
We had fucking corn chips.
We had salsa.

916
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.070
We had two bottles of Ho Jarrod fucking pickles,
ketchup.

917
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.400
We had everything we had.
We had,

918
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:33.030
we had real forks and steak knives for the stakes.

919
00:56:33.031 --> 00:56:38.031
We had everything except for a fucking table.

920
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.830
God,
next year it's going to be the per every year two bottles,

921
00:56:46.831 --> 00:56:50.640
a crown royal,
a case of fucking beer.
We,
we will,
we will ready to go.

922
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:53.250
We even had orange juice for the fucking eggs.

923
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.910
We will ready to go and we forgot a God damn table cause one of the ways we

924
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:02.230
start the day off with one of the best fucking omelets.

925
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:05.680
You ever going to have new year's Day sitting on a golf course on a sunny day,

926
00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:06.131
no one,

927
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:10.540
the rest of the Goddamn country snowed in screaming at some ticket agent that

928
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:15.250
they got to get back to Albuquerque before they yak.
You know,
shits the bed,

929
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.710
right?
We forgot a God damn table,

930
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.370
which isn't bad when you eat an Omelet,
but when you're eating the fucking steak,

931
00:57:23.371 --> 00:57:28.371
that's an inch and a half thick that's been cooked at best rare.

932
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.990
Supposed to be medium rare.
Okay.
It was,

933
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:39.000
it was just medium rare.
What happens is we got it on a paper plate.

934
00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:41.190
And as you use pressure to cut into that,

935
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:47.130
it creases in the middle and you see this puddle of,
of,
of grease.

936
00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:49.890
It just starts coming.
It comes close to your balls and then it goes away.

937
00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:53.760
Just like the tide coming in and you're sitting there going,
you know,

938
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:57.180
I really should a just drip the rest of this grease down into the grass,

939
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:01.650
kill a couple of lady bugs and then continue on with the eating process.

940
00:58:01.651 --> 00:58:03.600
But it tastes so fucking good.
You Go,
you know what?

941
00:58:03.601 --> 00:58:05.910
I think I could do it one more time.
And then you do it.

942
00:58:05.911 --> 00:58:09.470
And what happens if fucking rolls right off onto you get jeans and you haven't

943
00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:11.370
noticed.
I don't give a fuck.

944
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:12.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

945
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.460
<v 2>What you spill,
where you spell it,</v>

946
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:18.090
you could have your arms outstretched if you spill any sort of liquid.

947
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.200
It not only does it land in your Crotch,
it lands right at the head of your Dick.

948
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.260
So it always looks like he pissed your pants.
So that's what I look like.

949
00:58:25.261 --> 00:58:29.020
I had grease on the front of my pants.
Um,
I,

950
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.430
meanwhile I'm sitting here watching all these Wisconsin fans walking around and

951
00:58:32.431 --> 00:58:35.860
they got these candy striped fucking overalls.

952
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.130
They look like Richard Simmons shorts.

953
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.870
If you fucking mugged him and cleaned out his closet of early eighties fucking

954
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:47.010
gay,
his running shorts ever.
And you somehow turned them into overalls,
you know,

955
00:58:47.011 --> 00:58:49.560
be wanting of women were wearing them,
that'd be kind of hot.
Right?

956
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.920
But there was a bunch of guys wearing them too.
They,

957
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.950
they all look like they look like it looked like a jugglers convention is the

958
00:58:55.951 --> 00:58:58.560
best way to put it.
So I'm sitting there going,
man,
I like the big 10.

959
00:58:58.561 --> 00:59:01.080
I want to root for Wisconsin.
Then every once in a while,

960
00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:04.620
because it seems to be like 80%,
75%,

961
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:08.790
maybe 70 at the smallest Wisconsin fans,
and then Tcu,
so you know,

962
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:14.040
who doesn't like an underdog?
So I start walking towards the stadium,

963
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:18.630
right at,
uh,
I'm thinking of it to go for Tcu.
Fuck this.
I helped this little,

964
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:22.510
uh,
mountain west,
whatever.
Fucking,
I don't know what conference it from.

965
00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:28.090
Huh?
Um,
I hope these guys win.
And,
uh,

966
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.120
I start going up to the stadium and,
uh,

967
00:59:31.121 --> 00:59:33.070
one of my buddies elbows me and he turned around,

968
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:38.110
he points to these Tcu fans and this guy is wearing brown loafers,

969
00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.770
these light purple,
uh,

970
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:46.830
like Roy Docker's with the Tcu emblem and then like a v Neck sweater

971
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.920
and like these ray bond fucking risky business sunglasses on.

972
00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:58.200
And He,
I like if you,

973
00:59:58.201 --> 00:59:59.760
if you were casting a movie,

974
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.270
do you guys see Facebook that Facebook is social network?

975
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.300
Do you know how like the Harvard guys were,
this is what this guy looked like.

976
01:00:06.301 --> 01:00:07.980
And I was like,
oh my,
are you serious?

977
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:14.390
Is this guy and an anomaly or is this really what Tcu was all about?

978
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.360
My buddy literally goes to me,
he goes,
that's it.
I'm rooting for Wisconsin.

979
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.140
You know,
I look at this fucking guy and I,
and I was sitting there going,

980
01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:24.470
you know what?
I think he's right.
Not On,
don't,

981
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.300
maybe it's just this one fucking guy.
And then I see another guy,

982
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.480
he has on a purple fucking blazer with gold buttons.

983
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.370
Oh well shook some pleaded slugs and low first

984
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.500
to the game.
And all of a sudden I started looking at these.

985
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.540
This is not all of them,
but I could,
15% of them are dressed this way,

986
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.700
looking like those rich kids who fucking,
you know,
uh,
air quote,

987
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:55.340
accidentally killed their date,
you know,

988
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.090
and then they say it was consensual because she wanted rough sex too.

989
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.940
And that daddy has enough fucking money to get him out of it.

990
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:05.600
That's what they started looking like.
So I'm like,
Holy Shit.

991
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.630
Fuck this.
I'm,
I'm,

992
01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:11.180
I'm rooting for Wisconsin now we're in the crush to get in the game.

993
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:16.750
And I look in front of me and there's this pasty fat fuck Wisconsin fan in front

994
01:01:18.111 --> 01:01:20.090
of me with the Wisconsin have turned around.

995
01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:22.800
And I don't know if it was dry skin or Eczema.

996
01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.140
He had a perfect band of it going around the back of his,
you know,

997
01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:31.710
his hairline at the back of his head and the flakes of it,

998
01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:35.010
we're on the back of his sweatshirt.
I know.
I hope you're not eating.

999
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.640
Okay.
So I'm looking at him gone.
Oh,
horrified.

1000
01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:44.110
Absolutely horrified.
And then I'm turning around,

1001
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:49.111
I'm looking at these fucking slack and a sport coat wearing douchebags.

1002
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.950
And at that point I didn't know who I was for.

1003
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.490
I was actually hoping that during the flyover,

1004
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.990
one of the jets would go into the crowd and they could just start all over
again.

1005
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:03.760
It was,
it was horrific.
Worst Group of fans I've seen.
And in three years,

1006
01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:07.360
granted I was sober this time and I could actually remember this.

1007
01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:11.080
So I go into the stadium,
right?
And,
uh,
Lo and behold,

1008
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:16.060
I'm in the TCU section,
right?
And I'm like,
okay,

1009
01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.013
uh,

1010
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:22.080
I don't know if I liked this and I just didn't all signage here.
Start here.
Okay.

1011
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.290
This girl like three rows back,
Jay,
come on,

1012
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:33.080
come on.
Frogs.
And I go,
frogs.

1013
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:37.610
They're the fucking,
I didn't know what they were.
We got to give it to Wisconsin.

1014
01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.630
Badger is a bad ass fucking Ama.
TCU horned frogs.

1015
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.940
Okay.
And,
and that their mascot,
look,
I don't need,

1016
01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:49.860
it looks like something out of like the,
that star wars bar scene,
you know,

1017
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.490
and against go frau come.

1018
01:02:52.491 --> 01:02:57.350
I'll TC TC you and I'm looking at the girls and they,
uh,

1019
01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.380
they,
they have their jeans
tucked into their cowboy boots,

1020
01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:05.380
like they're in that band,
great white,
you know,

1021
01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:09.760
and then on top they have like these dime store Dolly Parton cowboy hats on.

1022
01:03:09.761 --> 01:03:14.260
And I was like,
oh my God,
I fucking hate these people.
And at that point,

1023
01:03:14.261 --> 01:03:17.650
and I was sitting right in the middle of them and I immediately just became a

1024
01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:20.890
Wisconsin Fan.
Now in defense of Tcu,

1025
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.520
I think if I was hanging in the Wisconsin section,
I would route,

1026
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.230
I would have rooted for Tcu.

1027
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:27.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1028
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.370
<v 2>I would have rooted for Tcu,
you know,</v>

1029
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.100
in the middle of me just screaming that tasty ag,
you come off frogs.

1030
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:36.390
I can't tell if Nia just laughed or the guy downstairs yelled at me,
I'll,

1031
01:03:36.391 --> 01:03:37.224
that's a dark.

1032
01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1033
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:42.710
<v 2>Oh,
okay.
My fault.
Or it's Mel Blanc.
Um,
good.</v>

1034
01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:45.590
Anybody imitate a dog barking better than that guy.
Anyways,

1035
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.910
let's plow ahead here.
So then I just sat there and uh,

1036
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.430
just was rooting for Wisconsin and I just want it and I,
and I,
I just,

1037
01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.450
and another thing too that's really fucking annoying about Tcu you fence okay.

1038
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:01.913
Is

1039
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:02.990
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1040
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.510
<v 2>no matter what's going on during the game,</v>

1041
01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.970
they have a reason to fucking put their hands in the air.
See,

1042
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.400
can't see the fucking game.

1043
01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:15.320
Anytime it was third down they had this gay little thing,
well you know,

1044
01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:17.390
you make the a I'm okay sign.

1045
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.610
They would do that signifying third down and then they would just sort of shake

1046
01:04:22.611 --> 01:04:26.550
their hands like,
Ooh,
just in case you don't know what down it.

1047
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:28.670
And it everybody.

1048
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:33.760
So it's like third down and anybody who watches football knows third down is a

1049
01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:38.020
really important fucking down as a fan who played,

1050
01:04:38.021 --> 01:04:39.580
have paid a fuck load for the ticket.

1051
01:04:39.581 --> 01:04:43.360
You want to see what happened and these fucking idiots is so busy going to the

1052
01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:45.790
loo.
You couldn't see anything.
Then,

1053
01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:50.791
not to mention there's fat whore in front of me who from the size of her should

1054
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.120
have been a Wisconsin fan.
But then again,
I've been to Houston,
Texas.
Okay.

1055
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:57.230
Those people like their barbecue to the,

1056
01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.920
these are the people that really make America look bad.

1057
01:04:59.921 --> 01:05:02.170
It's the fucking middle of the country.
You got damn people.

1058
01:05:02.171 --> 01:05:04.570
I don't know what your problem is this because you're landlocked.

1059
01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.230
Don't they have swimming pools where you people get through a couple of laps

1060
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.380
people on the coasts or in shape?
All right.

1061
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.270
Seattle all the way down to San Diego.
These motherfuckers are in shape.
Go ahead.

1062
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.430
San Diego,
go right up the coast.
Los Angeles,

1063
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:25.290
San Francisco or Portland,
Oregon.
They're in shape.

1064
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.260
A Seattle.
They're in shape.
Vancouver.

1065
01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:30.240
I even leave the country and they're fucking its shape.

1066
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.020
You start getting out there in Nebraska.
Our Wisconsin.

1067
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:38.683
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1068
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:43.650
<v 2>Fucking people are are horrific other than Florida.
Florida doesn't count.</v>

1069
01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.670
All right.
Florida is a,
I don't know what it is.
It's like the ball bag,

1070
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:50.580
but he says it looks like a Dick to me.
It looks like a fucking 56 year old.

1071
01:05:50.581 --> 01:05:53.670
Scroll them just hang in there.
Um,

1072
01:05:53.671 --> 01:05:57.940
after the Dick got lopped off.
Um,
anyways,
so they,

1073
01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:01.350
they handed out the like,
like them doing that third down thing wasn't enough.

1074
01:06:01.351 --> 01:06:05.640
They handed out these fucking little purple like rags.

1075
01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:10.050
Okay.
First of all,
stealing from the Pittsburgh Steelers,
the terrible towel.

1076
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.650
They steal that.
And then the on them,
it said fear the frog,

1077
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.920
which they stole from a Maryland fear the turtle,

1078
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.213
right?

1079
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.420
The first school to actually admit that they have a bad name,

1080
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.250
a bad mascot.
Fucking name.

1081
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:31.080
So then what day with this fucking fat whore in front of me,
I swear to God,

1082
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.910
every God damn play.
Okay.

1083
01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.990
Her fucking team would be,
we had engine seats were,

1084
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.580
was in the other end zone at Wisconsin's 10 yard line trying to drive in for a

1085
01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:47.060
score.
Okay.
They're,
they're 90 yards away.
If you're standing on the goal line,

1086
01:06:47.061 --> 01:06:50.780
forget about being 40,
50 fucking rose up in the Goddamn Stan.

1087
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:55.100
And she would be sitting there as she's talking to a friend too.

1088
01:06:55.101 --> 01:06:57.480
That's what killed me.
Classic brought it a game.

1089
01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:58.970
She's sitting there shooting the shit.
You know,

1090
01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.910
she probably went there for the tournament of fucking roses and she just kept
it.

1091
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.740
I finally,
I tapped her on her fleshy shoulder

1092
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.670
and she immediately took it.
As I was saying,
put it down.
I said,

1093
01:07:10.671 --> 01:07:15.080
can you just wave that?
Can you wave it more in your like in front of you?

1094
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.400
Which this is the funniest thing ever.
She does,

1095
01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.230
and immediately realizes that when she does it,
she can't see the fucking game.

1096
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:27.080
Welcome to my world.
You're fat whore.

1097
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.350
That's what I've been dealing with for the last three fucking quarters.

1098
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.000
So then what she did was she then switched into her left hand.
Okay.

1099
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.490
Because not only is she a fat whore,
she's a dumb fat whore.
Okay.

1100
01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.990
And the first moment when I tapped her,
she was like,
oh,

1101
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.670
this guy must be a Wisconsin fan,

1102
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:45.323
<v 3>you know,</v>

1103
01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:50.400
<v 2>because he's telling me to put it down.
Then she realizes,
oh,
it's in his way.</v>

1104
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.340
Did she waves it in front of her face and realizes,
oh,
now I can't see.

1105
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:59.720
And you would think at that point light would dawn on our fucking fat head.

1106
01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:03.860
And she'd be like,
oh,
I get it.
If I wave this thing,

1107
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.840
people behind me can see the fucking game.
Not this fat whore,
not this one.

1108
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:13.040
She fucking puts it in the left hand and starts waving like that.

1109
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.300
Like that's the solution.

1110
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.150
Like she notice that there's another fucking 80,000 fans to her fucking left up.

1111
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:20.201
It was the worst.

1112
01:08:20.201 --> 01:08:25.201
And it's times like those where I just a times like those were made for taster's

1113
01:08:25.511 --> 01:08:26.020
choice.

1114
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.830
Remember that coffee just brew up a nice hot pot and he just dumped it right

1115
01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:32.290
over her fucking head.
That's what I would have liked to in a perfect world.

1116
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:37.810
And as she screamed
from the scalding Burns,

1117
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.770
um,
she would collapse afterwards.
So maybe pass out either way,

1118
01:08:41.771 --> 01:08:44.560
she would be out of my way.
And I got to tell you,

1119
01:08:44.561 --> 01:08:49.561
that would be the equivalent of three normal Americans who live on the coasts,

1120
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:53.440
who lived near the ocean.
Hey,
you know what?

1121
01:08:53.441 --> 01:08:55.600
I just realized that's how I'm gonna make my million dollars,

1122
01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:59.410
my multimillion dollar so I can parachute out of this goddamn business.

1123
01:08:59.411 --> 01:09:00.790
I've been trying to come up with

1124
01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.390
some bullshit that I could sell for 1995 late at night.
And I think I just did,

1125
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.670
you know,
I'm going to sell,

1126
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.650
I'm going to sell,
uh,
ocean water.

1127
01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:16.690
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1128
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:20.440
<v 2>And Little Salt Shakers for 1995.</v>

1129
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.790
That's what I'm going to do.
And I'm just going to go,
you know,

1130
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.460
have you ever noticed how,
you know,

1131
01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:31.270
people who live on the coast of this country are in shape,
you know,

1132
01:09:31.271 --> 01:09:33.970
and now I'm now just show a bunch of good looking people running down the street

1133
01:09:33.971 --> 01:09:37.000
with their knees nice and high,
like the Wisconsin fucking marching band,

1134
01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:40.610
which was the shit,
um,

1135
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:46.110
just running down the fucking street,
you know,
high step in it.
And then,
uh,

1136
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.470
the white version of high stepping,

1137
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.010
which is basically ring our knees up to our waist as opposed to the Grambling

1138
01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:54.550
black version where you basically,
you know,
you're,
you're,
you,

1139
01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:58.330
you couldn't do it in a dome stadium because you would break your fucking toes,

1140
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:07.890
whatever black people we're trying,
we're trying anyways.

1141
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:12.930
So,
uh,
yeah,
I would,
I would sell it and I would just say,

1142
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.330
and then you get,
if you know,

1143
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:16.380
are you tired of being fat in the middle of the country?

1144
01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:19.200
And just so somebody who is sitting a been taken a bite out of it and then just

1145
01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:22.760
look at the camera like,
you know,
throwing their arms up like woo,
yeah,

1146
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.290
I am sick of being a fat fuck,
you know,

1147
01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.680
you know they have sent a bunch on the east coast wire on the west coast.

1148
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.620
Why aren't they fat fucks?
And I'll just,
I just spin it.

1149
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.000
It's because they live there,

1150
01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:38.001
the ocean and there's smelling that salt water in the air and I'll just make up

1151
01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:42.570
a bunch of shit.
I'll pay off some fucking people in the FDA.
Uh,

1152
01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.780
it doesn't seem like a hard thing to do considering half the drugs that could

1153
01:10:45.781 --> 01:10:46.650
approve nowadays,

1154
01:10:46.651 --> 01:10:51.000
and I'll just say it's because of smelling salt water air that you're able to

1155
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:53.460
eat Cinnabon and shut off those fucking pounds.

1156
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:57.000
And I'll sell it like little bottles of fucking Cologne to every fatty and the

1157
01:10:57.001 --> 01:10:59.400
fucking Midwest and I'll make my money.

1158
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:05.330
And then I'm going to move to Denmark and I'm going to pay 90% taxes yet have

1159
01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:09.720
free health insurance and uh,
you know,

1160
01:11:09.721 --> 01:11:14.721
in a little vesper I'm going to go around those little fucking I little streets

1161
01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:18.580
out there.
I'm trying to put together a Scandinavian tour,
by the way this year.

1162
01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:22.030
I'm really looking forward to that.
Um,
so there you go.

1163
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.300
You know something like you,
I also lost interest halfway through that.

1164
01:11:25.301 --> 01:11:30.250
So that was the rose bowl for me this year.
I didn't drink.
I had a,

1165
01:11:30.251 --> 01:11:33.640
uh,
I had a fucking awesome time.
I remembered the game.

1166
01:11:33.641 --> 01:11:37.600
Congratulations to a,
let's go froward.

1167
01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:40.510
Congratulations to you.

1168
01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:45.190
A horribly horribly dressed human beings just horribly dressed.

1169
01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.720
Trash,
white trash is the only way to describe what I saw it there.

1170
01:11:49.721 --> 01:11:53.800
You guys really looked like you never left the Greater Dallas area.

1171
01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:56.800
Um,
you know,

1172
01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:59.050
I'm going to go out on a limb here and I would say I'm never going to get an

1173
01:11:59.051 --> 01:12:00.640
opportunity to perform at that school.

1174
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:06.880
And if I ever get an offer,
I'm going to be really suspect of it,

1175
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.990
thinking that they actually listened to this podcast.
Oh my God,
the dime store.

1176
01:12:10.991 --> 01:12:15.610
Fucking
every the woman,
women are dressed like that.

1177
01:12:15.611 --> 01:12:19.210
Dolly Parton movie.
Best little whorehouse in Texas,
except they were serious.

1178
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.270
They probably put out my best path for this one.

1179
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:26.050
I saw a guy actually took a picture of him or did they zoom into them?

1180
01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:30.310
I have some video.
I got to give it to my web guy,
um,
of this guy.

1181
01:12:30.311 --> 01:12:34.840
He was dressed in a suit with a big black Stetson looking like fucking,
uh,

1182
01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.430
Jr Ewing standard.
You know,
if it was the early eighties,
I would,

1183
01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.120
he would have looked good,
you know,
but it's fucking 2011,
dude,
it's,

1184
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:47.020
it's time to let that go.
You're fucking,
uh,

1185
01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:49.000
oil man slash coke dealer.

1186
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.930
Look from fucking 1981 30 years later,

1187
01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:57.430
you're still rocking that look like dead serious,
dead serious.

1188
01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.340
These are the kind of people that think like there's that you can cure

1189
01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:04.690
homosexuals,
you know,
and uh,

1190
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.200
you know,
like one of those countries,
singers like a hit,

1191
01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:11.580
so they just write a song about how great America is and the two right.

1192
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.390
<v 5>And the fans are too dumb to see the fact that they just trying to make some</v>

1193
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:16.570
money invisible

1194
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:34.880
at a
time

1195
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.720
strong enough.
