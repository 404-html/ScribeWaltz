00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.270
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and a,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.280
as promised I told you I was going to give you an extra 15 minutes and I know

3
00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:14.930
there's a bunch of your wine and on Twitter.
Oh my God.

4
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.250
You said you're going to put it up Wednesday and now it's Thursday.

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.350
That isn't what you said.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920
Watch your fucking grow up.
All right,

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.800
was cool hand Luke once said,
well,

8
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.670
you people stop [inaudible] these fucking eggs.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.740
He said something like that.
Nah,
I'm just kidding.
Look,
I had a busy fucking day.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.950
You know,
what do you want from me?
I had such a crazy week.
Um,

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.700
I was actually at an acting gig yesterday and I thought,
you know,

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.380
I looked and I was like,
this is three,
four pages,
you know,

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
all this shit's gonna be over in a couple of hours.
And,
um,

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.010
it ended up,
I ended up being there like 12 hours from like eight to eight.

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.060
It was basically it,
Eh,
uh,
daddy drinks at night.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.490
So that's why you didn't get your podcasts.

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.510
Oh,
Jesus.
Um,
I had a fucking brutal day.

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
I just had one of these days where nothing worked out and I didn't flip up until

19
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.100
the end of the day.
I'm really working on my temper.

20
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.950
I first thing I did was I,
I had to do a something this morning,

21
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.930
uh,
looping,
it's called looping.

22
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.060
It's basically when you shoot something and then,
yeah,

23
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
somebody made a noise or you sat down some books or somebody scratched their

24
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:43.020
fucking balls and that sound of fingers and pubes basically they want to get

25
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:47.490
your line clean so you have to go over to this recording place and then they

26
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.070
show you the line that you said,
and then they count it down,

27
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.700
<v 0>boop,
boop,
boop.</v>

28
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.980
<v 1>And then you fucking jumped in and you got to say the line you just said.</v>

29
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.400
So I had to do that this morning at 9:00 AM right.

30
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.010
So I punched in the fucking directions,
right.

31
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:04.520
I moved the Prius and I get out my fucking truck,

32
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.910
take that up to top of the driveway and I'm off.
Right.

33
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.790
And I put in the gps shit and

34
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.013
<v 0>uh,</v>

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.590
<v 1>I actually gps to whatever the fuck you call it,
did it on the iPhone.</v>

36
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620
<v 1>What I did was I put in the address of the person who sent me the email telling</v>

38
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.760
me where I was supposed to go.

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.130
My dumb ass drove to my agent's office and I'm like,

40
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.490
wow,
this is like really close to my agent's office.
And I was like,
wait,

41
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.720
this is my agent's office.

42
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.170
And I was a half hour fucking late and that's how it started and I didn't lose

43
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.580
my shit.
Yeah.
Nope.
I just gave it out.
I just,

44
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.610
I somehow got through it and I finally snapped when I got home after a bunch of

45
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:52.454
Shit went wrong,

46
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.650
I went to get fucking light bulbs at home depot and I put the one the size that

47
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.330
I needed.
I took it out and I put in my pocket because those new squiggly ones,

48
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.120
you know,
the old school ones that were just an old light bulb,

49
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.780
it said 75 watts or whatever.
I can't figure out where the fuck they are.

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.870
Long Story Short,
I get out of the car,
I turn around,

51
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.530
I bang into my truck and I smashed the light bulb in my pocket,

52
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.990
still have not snapped,
still haven't snapped.

53
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.390
I can't even remember half the shit cause I don't even care.

54
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.180
By the time I got home,
I go to get my fucking car,

55
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.400
the Prius to go pick up Nia.
And uh,

56
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.760
I get there in the fucking battery's dead cause I left it on like a boombox or

57
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.850
some shit.
And um,

58
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.900
but it turned on just enough for me to put the key in and when it's still on,

59
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.970
it wouldn't shut off and I couldn't get my key out.

60
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.530
So that's when I fucking snapped.

61
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.430
And I believe I slapped the dashboard like maybe anywhere between five and 36

62
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.750
times.
I can't remember.

63
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040
And then I fucking just tried to Yank my keys out and I broke the plastic thing

64
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.880
on it.
So there you go.
That was my day.

65
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
That was my day.
Was that even remotely interesting?
Ah,
Jesus,
I don't give a fuck.

66
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.120
What do you want from me?
I had a brutal day,
so I snapped one time.
Um,

67
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.130
but anyways,

68
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.220
and I only think of where you worked all day yesterday at 12 hour day.

69
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.330
By the time you did you lazy artists,

70
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:20.950
did you get a chance to watch the Bruins game?
I came on,
I was on,
you know,

71
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.400
we're down where we were working and I,
I kept checking.
Um,

72
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.200
I try not to be that asshole who in between takes is fucking looking at his

73
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:33.010
Twitter and stuff.
I try not to be that guy,
but uh,
you know,
come on,

74
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:37.630
it's a playoff game.
This is a huge game and I'm not here to talk any shit.

75
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.710
Everybody.
I got to tell you,
I am just as stunned as penguin fence.

76
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.590
You know,
I said at the beginning of this series,
I said,

77
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:48.160
my brain said penguins and six,
my heart says Bruins and seven,

78
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.440
I am fucking dumbfounded with how great we're playing and how,

79
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.700
uh,
how we're doing it against what I thought was the best team in the NHL.

80
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:01.240
Certainly the team with the most talent and um,

81
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.783
you know,
I dunno.

82
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.590
So I actually just watched the re I came home and it was in the middle of the

83
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.510
second overtime and I ran into the bathroom real quick when I came out,
uh,

84
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.690
Bergie had scored and I was fucking psych,

85
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.150
but I wasn't psyched the way I would've been a five and watching it from the

86
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.710
beginning,
uh,
I was more relieved because,
um,
you know,

87
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:27.310
Campbell went down and I remember that time we went up three games to none.

88
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.771
And Craig,

89
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.510
you went down and then that other can't came back for the flyers and all of a

90
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.710
sudden the whole momentum switched.
So look,

91
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.270
I lived through the dark years of being a Boston sports fan.
So it's,

92
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.980
it ain't over till it's over.
We're up three games to none.

93
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:44.920
Anything can fucking happen.
Uh,

94
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.340
I'm hoping we close them out cause I don't want to give these guys any bit of

95
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.160
life because you know,

96
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.350
there's a lot of guys in that team that have the name on the Stanley Cup,
so on.

97
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.100
I don't what to tell you.
I'm fucking thrilled.

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.440
And for all you people out there who will giving me Shit,
you know.

99
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

100
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.200
<v 1>About whatever I said about your boy.
They're on your team.
Listen,
that shit.</v>

101
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:10.280
Marshawn debord he stuck out his knee on a Chris Coolers.

102
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.950
Kesha now got two minutes for slashing them back.

103
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.650
He should have been allowed to smash his stick over his fucking head.

104
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.880
Anytime anybody sticks then the out like that's a piece of shit.
Fucking move.

105
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.040
See that penguin,
feds.
Now why don't you try doing that with your boy there.

106
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.693
<v 0>All right,</v>

107
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.060
<v 1>we start guys only five feet tall.</v>

108
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.630
We got a little Tasmanian Devil and I like to have what's his face?

109
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:41.860
Bread didn't um,
Mauro,
whatever the fuck his name is,
get their Marshawn's face.

110
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:44.410
I like that.
I like seeing that I,
that doesn't make me mad.

111
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.090
I'll make me hate the other team.

112
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:50.740
I like seeing people with fucking hot add a penguins game to play and that that

113
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:54.440
third game they just fucking couldn't score a goal.
What about Johnny boy chuck

114
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.140
and the fucking second overtime?
Yeah.
Two saves that,

115
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.440
that first one he had on Crosby was going in the fucking net.
Um,

116
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.680
I dunno,
you guys heard how I talked about the Bruins all year.

117
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:10.620
I didn't have any faith of them.
I'm like,
they can't score more than two goals.

118
00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:13.830
I'm actually blown away.
They just flipped the switch.
But a,

119
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:16.680
I'll tell you scaring the shit out of me the most is the La kings because

120
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:19.050
nobody's talking about them and they just won the fucking cup.

121
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.680
They kind of being disrespected and there are big ass fucking team and that game

122
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:24.330
is 18 minutes old at this point.

123
00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:26.460
When I'm doing it and I'm calling it right fucking now,

124
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.290
kings are winning the game and they went in the series at my heart.
Won't let,

125
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.970
let,
let me say that they're going to win the cup.

126
00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:36.840
They're going to play the Bruins.
Hopefully in the Stanley Cup finals and a,

127
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:39.930
we will have our work cut out for ourselves.
All right,
so there you go.

128
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:44.910
There's my hockey talk for the week.
Now let's get to talking about religion.
Oh,

129
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.740
<v 2>oh</v>

130
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.390
<v 3>Yay.</v>

131
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.510
<v 1>Um,
I got an email.
Actually,
it wasn't said to me,
it was sent to somebody else.</v>

132
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:57.570
I know.
And then they would just like,
hey,
you might want to check this out.

133
00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:00.000
So I thought it was going to be one of those emails where they were like,

134
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.610
you know,
hey bill,
how are ya?

135
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.410
Just want to tell you I saw you on a slap these fucking Ying-yang show.

136
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:11.400
And I really thought you were funny,
but it wasn't like that at all.
Uh,

137
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.730
this is guy is a Catholic and he has a fucking bone to pick with make.

138
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.910
All right,
so strap yourselves in for this one.
Starts off.
It says,

139
00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:25.911
this message is for bill crybaby fucking Burr and I hope to Christ he gets it

140
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.110
because I'm too worked up to search for a way to get this to him directly.

141
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.290
What's again not mad at this guy I'm loving is pash.
He's right.
He's right.

142
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:38.041
My grill right now,

143
00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:40.950
he's on the bench and I'm standing there after I fucking gave him a knee to
knee.

144
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.971
I actually,

145
00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:45.300
I went knee to knee on all they'll fucking bearded baby there evidently.

146
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.560
So here he goes.
He continues.
Let me tell you something.
Birth.

147
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.910
I'm trying to give this a good read.
I'm pointing as I do this.
You sly me.
Fuck

148
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.130
you.
Don't just,
just like the Catholics.
You fucking hate them.

149
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.330
I don't know what happened to you and your life to make you hate the Catholics.

150
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.070
Maybe you were molested.
Well,
yeah.
Maybe if I was raped by a priest.

151
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:11.730
Don't you think that that would be a logical fucking reason?

152
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.300
Would that still make me a crybaby?

153
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.340
All
right.
There we go.
We're just getting going.
Maybe you were molested.

154
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.500
Maybe he had to attend too many midnight masses on Christmas Eve.
Nah,

155
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:31.200
that's copping out.
Pussies did that.
You get up on Christmas Day,

156
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.510
you do your paper routes,
then you go,

157
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.240
you take a shower and then you go to the mass.

158
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.510
Then you have a big breakfast and then you open your gifts.

159
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.540
That's how it was done in my house.
Are you guys getting it out of the way?

160
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.410
Hey Jesus.
Hey,
quick,
high five.
Just want to say what's up before I go to bed.

161
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.010
All right,
Bang my fucking wife and uh,
just on some presence.

162
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.140
Thanks for everything you've done for me.
Um,
anyways,
he says,

163
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:59.160
or maybe your mommy and daddy forced you to go to church against your will.

164
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.840
Uh,
well,
yeah,
of course they did.
As did yours.

165
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.660
What were you doing when you were five?
You know,

166
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.300
I'm really enjoying climbing this tree board I really,

167
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.950
really would love to do is to put on some uncomfortable clothes and listen to

168
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:18.180
some adults go horror movie for a fucking hour.

169
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.160
They didn't force me to do it.
It's not like I had any rights,
you know,

170
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.570
they weren't my parents.
They can do whatever they want it to,
as did George Surf.

171
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.800
So anyways,
he goes and you're still resentful of it,
like rebelling,

172
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.250
rebelling little teenage bitch.

173
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.230
I don't fucking know,
but I'm tired of hearing about it.
We get it.
Hey,
hey,

174
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.970
speak for yourself,
sir.
Don't use,
we say that you're sick of it.

175
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:52.510
Say I'm sick of it.
Be a big boy now.
Um,

176
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.600
he says the fact is the,
they hold I,

177
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.690
the fact is that you can't talk about whatever the fuck the fact is.

178
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.750
You can talk about whatever the fuck you want to talk about.
That's your right.

179
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.320
Well,
thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for backing up the constitution.

180
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.090
He says,
but there's a lot of us where I come from who are tired of your,

181
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.710
I'm a poor,
recovering Catholic.
Whiny crybaby fucking story.

182
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.900
You whiny little bitch.
I got it sir.
I got it.
You're calling me whiny.

183
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.390
Um,
how can you wine is,
is it really considered wining where you're like,

184
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:29.260
I'm done with an organization that sided with the pedophiles,

185
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.910
you know,
quit your whining.
Um,

186
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.230
he said,
I happened to like your comedy a lot.
Very nice.
Draw me back in.

187
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.740
It's salt me for nine paragraphs,
then pull me back in.
Go for the ego.

188
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.050
Very smart move.
I liked this guy.
He said,

189
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:48.370
but I'm sick and tired of you attacking my faith.
Will do.

190
00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:50.260
That's why there's other podcasts.

191
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

192
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.340
<v 1>There's all kinds of part.
I bet you can find one.
Um,</v>

193
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.060
I don't know.
Jesus is awesome podcast.

194
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.310
Why don't you go listen to Stryper?
They have like a bug 19 album's about that.

195
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.050
You know,
you can put on some fucking yellow and black striped pajamas,

196
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.450
you know,
change your last name to sweet teas up your fucking hair.

197
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.410
You could have a great time.

198
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.790
Why you acting like I'm the only fucking podcast out there and you're being

199
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:23.410
subjected to this.
You're not.

200
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.880
There's a whole big beautiful free world for you out there,
sir.

201
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.660
Download what you want.
Is that anyways,
he continues.
He goes,

202
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:34.240
the thing that kills me,
the thing that kills me,

203
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:39.040
I like to see is bringing it down.
He's crossing his legs now.

204
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.080
He's going Colombel one.

205
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.700
The thing that kills me is that you try to be so open minded and fair about a

206
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:50.350
lot of things and I respect that.
But how about being fair with the Catholics?

207
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.720
Uh,
sir,
I'm not yelling at Catholics.
I'm yelling at the Catholic Church.

208
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.960
That's what I'm mad at.
Those people who's murdered,
tortured and raped people,

209
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.590
those ones who always seemed to be on the wrong side and a World War II,

210
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.160
right?

211
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.580
Jewish people are trying to fucking follow where the hell all this shit went and

212
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:15.530
where,
where does part of it lead to?
Huh?

213
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.360
Who had some of this shit fallen out of their pockets?
The Catholic church,

214
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.423
right.

215
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.640
They would play at both sides of the shit on one side right there.

216
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:31.480
High five and Fdr it fucking uh,
Walt Frazier there.

217
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:35.950
What the fuck's his name?
We shall never surrender Winston Churchill.

218
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.183
Right?

219
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.810
<v 4>And on the other side they're going,
hey,
we go wade off.
There we go.</v>

220
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.880
<v 1>This scumbag.
So I'm not attacking you.
You're taking this as an attack.
I'm not.</v>

221
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.313
All right.

222
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.730
Are you really going to sit there and tell me that you enjoy that music bad at

223
00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.060
Bain and I bought,
I bought a bowl by a paypal

224
00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:02.050
<v 4>whap out of that [inaudible] why did I babble?</v>

225
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.460
Xibalba booboo.
Yeah.
Dot.
I booboo.

226
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:07.771
<v 1>I mean,</v>

227
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:10.980
how many times can you fucking go there and you can go as many times when I'm

228
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:14.610
not giving you shit,
sir.
You're really taking this personally.
So any guys,
no,

229
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.630
no doubt.

230
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.350
What happened was fucking wrong and you aren't the only one who's second bite.

231
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.610
Okay.
We agree.
We agree.
It's something he goes,
trust me.
He goes,

232
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:26.340
I have plenty to tell you about being a catholic growing up,

233
00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:28.530
but you don't see me fucking whining about it.

234
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.150
I don't know why you think of wine.

235
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.330
I think I'm telling jokes and people are laughing and I don't think you'd like

236
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:38.240
the jokes and I,
you're trying to say it's that I'm whining.
I'm not here going,

237
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:38.440
okay,

238
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.110
<v 4>well I try within Catholic,</v>

239
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.820
<v 1>I'm not doing that.
I'm just</v>

240
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.190
<v 4>go wipe out Beta.
Bada Bada boom,
Bada Bang table.</v>

241
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.590
<v 1>I'm scat singing,
which I claimed that I hate.
She can call me hypocrite.</v>

242
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.260
So when he goes,
he goes,
I wasn't molested,
but I had some friends who were,

243
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.700
well,
oh my God,
right there.
I swear to God.

244
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.310
<v 0>Okay,</v>

245
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.840
<v 1>if I didn't give a shit about my house,</v>

246
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:08.350
I would have taken this microphone in this mixer and just throw it through my

247
00:15:08.351 --> 00:15:12.310
fucking window.
Well,
let me ask you this,
sir.

248
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.620
Okay?
You had friends that were molested

249
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.220
yet you still go to the church,
okay.
Now,

250
00:15:23.221 --> 00:15:27.190
if you walked into a pet store,
let's pick a chain.
All right?

251
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.920
If you walked into Wendy's,
okay.

252
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.050
At two of your buddies got molested in there,
would you go back to Wendy's?

253
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.710
Would you really sit there and be like,
look,
it's not the Burgers,

254
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.670
it's the,
it's the fucking guy on the fries burgers.
Fine.

255
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.080
Now what if the people making the burgers were covering for the guy on the fries

256
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.780
and they put them over there on the fly of fish.

257
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.530
Put a couple more of them over there on the apple pies.

258
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.183
<v 0>Huh?</v>

259
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.590
<v 1>I just jumped fucking fast food chains,
whatever.</v>

260
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:10.000
I'm not familiar with the Wendy's menu.
I find that more.

261
00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:15.001
May I find you'll fucking anger at me at me who never touched your friends?

262
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.180
Never fucking uh,
I dunno.
Had An inquisition.

263
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.290
I don't got any Nazi money.
You know,

264
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.110
I don't tell you that you're born into sin.
The second year board.

265
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.660
I mean that just that fucking thing.
And if you don't get,

266
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:39.661
if you don't get dunked in this water that we dashed that fucking shit in that

267
00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:40.570
this baby,

268
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:45.571
you're going to burn in hell forever because some check ate an apple ad fucking

269
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.800
when asked a mouth like a weak law,
whatever the fuck's the story is right.

270
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.890
Whatever you want to be mad at me.
Be Mad at me,
sir.

271
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.030
I'm sure you can kick the shit out of me,
but I think you have misdirected anger.

272
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.053
<v 0>You know?</v>

273
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.750
<v 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

274
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:11.110
Were you upset when they took away all those wins at Penn State?

275
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.610
Were you upset by that?
Actually I was.

276
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:17.710
I thought that was bullshit because the players didn't do it.

277
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.420
That's a bad example.
I don't fucking know.

278
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.050
I don't know.
I was a little bit,
were you upset when they took down?

279
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:31.460
What's his face?
His statue there?
Huh?
What's the matter?

280
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.390
Oh look who's here.
Look who just decided to wander red here.
I got it.

281
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.460
I got a mic here for you.
The lovely Nia.
Everybody.

282
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.753
<v 0>Okay?</v>

283
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.350
<v 1>Who's that?
This guy is just going off on me.
Nia,</v>

284
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.680
are you there?
Can you wait?
Wait,
wait my level,
how your levels are.

285
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.260
My Miko gilts are me up to the baseline now.
How come that isn't working?

286
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.270
I don't know.
Are you sure?
I can see me when I'm talking.

287
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.280
Wait,
but I'm way louder cause you always louder.
There we go.

288
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.690
Not now talk.
Hello?
Hello.
There you go.
I'm hearing an echo.
I don't know why,

289
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.320
but I like it.
Um,
so this guy's going off of me because I've been,

290
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:18.210
because you took an idea like cold lotion and ran with it.

291
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.440
And then the knowledge,
that collaborative effort that went into the cold lotion.

292
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.130
What was the collaborative effort?
I put it on your back.
Yes.
And you went,

293
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.830
you freaked out and said,
oh it's cold.
And you're like,

294
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:32.640
is there anything worse than if someone puts cold lotion on you?
And I laughed.

295
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.940
He said,
that sounds like a seventies term.
And I said,
that's some cold lotion.

296
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.993
And you were like,

297
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.940
<v 4>I said that.
No,
I said,
that's an old of my God.</v>

298
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:45.890
You said it sounded like those sort of 70th lag black guy,
jive,

299
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:50.620
whatever saying that I said it.
And I said,
that's some cold lotion.
Oh my God.
No.

300
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.000
I said,
are you really,

301
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.280
you have the nerve to make these people.
Maybe you came up with it.

302
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.800
I swear to God,
how dare you.
But you,
but you were the why did ever,

303
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.880
<v 1>why do I not go?
I Dunno.</v>

304
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.390
You're the one that said it is a seventies type of thing,

305
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.810
which it really does sound like and then that's what then I said it.
I go man,

306
00:19:13.811 --> 00:19:17.530
that's up coal lotion.
That's why I said no.
I said that's some cold lotion.

307
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.980
Well that's a big difference that you just said.
I did say now you said,

308
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.170
I feel like I said it.
Look,
if you want to split this drift,
I don't,

309
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.160
I didn't want to make this ugly here.
You know.
I'll give you full credit.

310
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.090
<v 4>Hi.
But I play right now full credit check and credit for cold lotion is cold</v>

311
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.450
lotion.
Oh wait,
you left me out of it with some cold loans.

312
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.800
You called lotion me uncle.
No,
this is what it is.

313
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.833
<v 1>What it is.</v>

314
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.160
I have you on my podcast is a guest and you come on like you're going to be all

315
00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:49.760
cool and then you start attacking me.
That's cold motion.
All right?

316
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.690
You call lotion neighbors.
Oh,
whatever.
Whatever.
Sick.
Let me,
let me,

317
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.860
let me continue with this hashtag called lotion.
Alright,

318
00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.010
let's make cold cold lotion happen.
No,
no,
no,
no.
They,
they decide.

319
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.920
Don't fucking beg for it.
Needy.
I'm not begging you.

320
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:06.440
Sounded a little desperate state.
Oh,
shut up.
All right.

321
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.070
What's this guy talking about?
But he's trashing me.
He's trashing me because I,

322
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.450
I make come.
He says,
I,
I trash Catholics.

323
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.160
I whine about it.
He says,
I keep whining about it.
And he said wine like 50 times.

324
00:20:19.161 --> 00:20:23.600
And I think I'm in the fourth paragraph.
So,
uh,
so you actually,

325
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:26.570
you got to be said that he agreed with being,
obviously the molestation was bad.

326
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.930
He goes,
I was never molested,
uh,
when I was a kid,

327
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.060
but I had some friends who were,
it goes together.
We went through a lot,

328
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:40.070
but I knew then at 12 years old,
this isn't what the real church is about.
I,

329
00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:42.650
I'm 100% in agreement with that,

330
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.100
but I think you need to go beyond,
hey,

331
00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:49.930
the real churches about fucking my friends against their will.

332
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.680
I also don't think it's about like you're born into sin and all that and I'm

333
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:57.790
allowed to have that opinion,
but I'm not coming at you anyways.

334
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.590
So he goes to true still remains.

335
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.120
Even if a bunch of fucking dead beat human beings and pedophiles jumped in there

336
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.470
and fucked it all up.
You know what?
You know what that's called?
It's called evil.

337
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.020
And why wouldn't evil go after the church?

338
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.980
The basis of the church is still there.
And instead of attack and get,

339
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:18.220
maybe you should at least find your way through the layers of shit,

340
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.260
which I admit have existed in the past and they pass and take a closer look.

341
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.830
Douchebag.
But wait a minute,
wait a minute.
So my question to this guy is,

342
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.093
<v 0>okay,</v>

343
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.610
<v 1>you're making it sound like there's little pockets of evil.</v>

344
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.480
I want you to explain to me the inquisition.

345
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.590
I want you to explain to me them having the spoils of Nazi pilfering in their

346
00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:46.904
pockets.

347
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.380
I want you tell me why they made this decision to hide these pedophiles and I

348
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:58.801
mean the organization from top to bottom is dirtier than fucking professional

349
00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:03.900
cycling.
All right,
so you're making it seem like this,
this like,

350
00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:06.870
hey,
there's a,
there's always going to be a couple of bad apples in the barrel.

351
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.900
It's like the whole pyramid is fucked up the whole way that they got everybody

352
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:17.850
on board I believe is fucked up.
All right.

353
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.420
You shouldn't have to murder and torture people to believe in to get them to

354
00:22:21.421 --> 00:22:23.010
believe in your version of the shit.

355
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.450
And I don't know how as an adult you could look at your religion and then see

356
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:30.750
other adults with a completely different religion and then just feel without a

357
00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:31.584
doubt

358
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.010
<v 4>yours is right.
100% right.
I'm looking at this letter though,</v>

359
00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:39.370
just on your computer and it's like there is a very,
not even vaguely,

360
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:42.610
there's like a seriously threatening tone to it.
Not In a,
in a serious way,

361
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.880
but he goes,
if you ever,
and I mean ever,

362
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:48.490
every capital letters wants to talk more about this.
Why?
Like,

363
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:51.940
it sounds like he's a really upset and I promise I can be civil about it.

364
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.350
You fucking call me and we'll discuss it.
He's like me.
He's like me.

365
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.990
I don't think he's that led to me.
It sounds,

366
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:02.100
it sounds to me like you need some answers and I'm the fucking guy to give him

367
00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:03.490
to you.
He does sound like you.

368
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.670
You are screwed up on some shit when it comes to the Catholics.

369
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.170
Don't be fucking pussy,
I guess up.
Was He talk with somebody or don't?

370
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.610
I don't give a shit four exclamation points that I don't have shit.
I,
Oh,

371
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:18.970
you're right.
I don't have shit that was so worked up over this.

372
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:22.210
He forgot to put it in a couple of words.
You obviously give a shit.
You wrote.

373
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.350
I have a football game this weekend and I've got to pretend the guy across from

374
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:28.060
me is use.
This guy's at that Lyman,

375
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:31.660
so I'll give him a pass on not having give cause he plays those big fat sausage

376
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.520
fingers.
Oh man,
we could make 1 million bucks doing that.

377
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.710
Why don't we make a big fat sausage finger for people with big fat sausage

378
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.400
finger keyboards.
Oh,
that's awesome.

379
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.040
Sausage finger and all you

380
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.660
<v 1>have to do it.
Just have,
you know,
some little guy,
nerdy guy typing away,</v>

381
00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:51.860
having a good time.
Right.

382
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:54.710
And then you have the other guy wanting to look at porn on the Internet,

383
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:55.850
but he can't because he has,

384
00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.480
<v 4>isn't it like that restaurant where we uh,
hear about that on TV?</v>

385
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:04.900
Is it in Vegas or something where if you're over 250 pounds,

386
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.920
you eat for free and people were like to,
to borrow from you.

387
00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:12.190
I've run my hands a whole people are really upset about it because they feel

388
00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:15.610
like they're like rewarding obesity because they have something called like,

389
00:24:15.611 --> 00:24:15.791
you know,

390
00:24:15.791 --> 00:24:20.110
they have like one of those burgers that has four patties in eight slices,

391
00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:24.280
the cheese and I'm literally selves to death.

392
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.160
Your overall,
if you're,
if you're to fifth year over,

393
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.030
you can eat in this restaurant for free.
I don't get that.

394
00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:34.660
So how do you got to eat more and you're going to lose money?
It's just the,

395
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.540
I think it's just a stupid gimmick.
Um

396
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.060
<v 1>Oh wait a minute.
Yeah,
but you fucking flipped my switch.
This title,</v>

397
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.070
people over 50 have a lot of smaller friends that'll come with them.
Maybe?
No,

398
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:48.740
but they're the only ones that do,
they have to drive him over in the van.

399
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:50.210
You know those people,
they have like that.

400
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.680
They just got to roll them into like one of those old Ford Astros and then you

401
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:56.360
drive while we're here in module eight,

402
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.520
maybe they're so fat they have to have people bring the food out to them and

403
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.710
then those people.
Yeah,
you give me a number seven.

404
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.920
I think he told the Dude's a whole thing was like,

405
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:10.370
he recognizes that there are a lot of big people in this world and I don't know,

406
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.920
I think he was trying to spin it into some like positive thing.
Oh well hey,

407
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.760
here's one.

408
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.760
I went over to the home depot today and only wanting to do some light bulbs and

409
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:23.300
I needed this hacksaw to cut up something metal.
You know,

410
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.970
it's stupid curtain rod that we have sticking up against our fence.

411
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.360
Like we're fucking Sanford and son.
I want to cut that thing up.

412
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.760
You have so no,
but that's for wood.
Oh,
okay.
So it's for the,

413
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.270
I use it once a year for the Christmas tree.
Um,
and you like doing it too?

414
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.140
I liked,
I liked disposing it properly.

415
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:48.210
People really do just throw their Christmas trees out on the curb,
like center.

416
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.660
That's bad enough.
The holidays over

417
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:57.530
mugging victim,
just laying there fight always looks like a dead body to me.

418
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.190
I always feel like,
you know,
like

419
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.260
I always hear like fucking,
uh,
that truck's lab as far as I can remember.

420
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:07.820
I always wanted to be a gangster.

421
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.270
<v 4>I tweeted something because</v>

422
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.060
I was driving behind somebody who put their,
um,

423
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.000
their Christmas tree and the trunk,
but it was sticking out,
you know,

424
00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:21.090
all the leaves or branches or whatever.

425
00:26:21.091 --> 00:26:24.430
They King Sos and I said they got this,
um,

426
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:29.300
Christmas tree in here looking like Billy batts.
Good.
Very nice.
See,

427
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.990
nobody said you didn't have a good references.
They need,
um,

428
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.500
hashtag coastal lotion.

429
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.530
<v 1>So,
um,
yes,
but how was it also going to help?
I bought a hall going to Home Depot.</v>

430
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:47.580
He said new scam,
at least the home depot around the corner.
All right.

431
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.470
And I'm just talking about home depot,
sir.

432
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:54.360
I'm not trashing the cat and I really hope I'm not whining.
I go in there,

433
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.480
so I'm just getting a couple of products.
I didn't want him to be a giant,

434
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.580
I don't want to be a giant,

435
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:02.040
whatever you call those things that you're pushing around with the four wheels

436
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.270
clapping,
shopping carts.
Yeah.

437
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.860
Oh,
I go,

438
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:13.800
do you have one of those little little baskets I could skip around the store

439
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:16.650
with,
throw some pedals around,
and then they're like,

440
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.160
and they're like,
no,
we don't have,
we don't have them,
but we do have these.

441
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:25.080
And there was these home depot buckets,

442
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.550
like the kind of stuff you die of a bunch of shit in,
you know,
like,
like a blank,

443
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:34.290
like a bucket.
Yeah.
So I'm like,
well,
I don't want that thing.

444
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:37.680
And they go,
yeah,
we understand that.
So I start walking around the store,

445
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.790
filling up the bucket.
I'm troll alone,
you know,
getting the sign,

446
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:44.460
all this stuff's scheme and they gave you the basket.

447
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:47.220
So they know they have a whole stack of them.
They don't,
they don't have baskets,

448
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:50.850
they just have buckets,
buckets.
Now Home Depot on the bucket,

449
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.210
I assume it's a home depot bucket me up.
I don't know how else to explain it.

450
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.073
Okay.

451
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.160
So I'm filling up to stuff and then I get up to the register and the guy starts

452
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:01.740
running it up and it just seemed a little high.
And I,
you know,

453
00:28:01.741 --> 00:28:05.430
after he's done ringing and goes,
you know,
48,
23 and I went,
hey,
you know,

454
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:09.900
I don't want the bucket.
They charge in any goes.
And he goes,
oh,
okay,
okay.

455
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.830
And I was just like,
yeah,
take it off.
And he goes,
all right to get it taken off.

456
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.270
You've got to go stand in this line over here.
Oh,
but,
but he,

457
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.350
but I was just like,
oh,
I started laughing.
I was like,
ah,
those bastards.

458
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.530
And he got all like,
like,
where do I go?
No Sir.
And I'm going to do,

459
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:28.500
and I'm not saying you,
I'm not saying,
yeah,
I go,
you know the game up to,

460
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.780
I couldn't get them to crack.
He,
he was,

461
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:34.590
he was fucking like the Home Depot Manchurian candidate.
He's like,
sorry sir,

462
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:36.300
but what will go?
So that's the new shit.

463
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:40.980
So now they take the fucking bucket back.
Now he got all his shit.

464
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.550
How do I carry so they don't have the little plastic bags,

465
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:46.380
Les Brown plastic bag and see home depot on them.

466
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:48.920
They don't give them to you anymore.
No,
they don't have bucket or nothing.

467
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.540
They don't have the little basket Trella lies.

468
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.150
They don't have the trial allows anymore.

469
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.170
Now you either have to use a shopping cart or bucket.
Yeah.

470
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.470
So then they took the bucket away.
They said,
well,
okay,

471
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:00.930
we'll take the bucket away.
And I go,
now what I did,
they go,

472
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.890
you got to carry this stuff out.
And I was like,
you know what,
I will,

473
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.700
that's some cold low now.
Right.
We're killing it now.
No.
Um,

474
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.780
I kia does that.
Ikea,
if you want a bag,

475
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.130
you get an ikea bag.

476
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:18.000
And I don't know how much it's like 35 cents but something but just cheap enough

477
00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:19.290
so it doesn't,
it might break you,

478
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:23.000
but just annoying enough to say why should I have to pay for a bag?
No,

479
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.520
cause they're brilliant because what they cause all those plastic bags or going

480
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.670
out into the ocean and the choking out the porpoises,
right.
So all the,

481
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.590
all the hippies who are like,
hey man,

482
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.970
like you guys get to start with the plastic bags,
man.
So they're like,
fine.

483
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.760
So now there's like a charge.
If you want to get a plastic bag,

484
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:41.290
but they're a corporation,
they're going to try to make money.

485
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.900
They're trying to hide behind this with some environmental.

486
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.480
That's bullshit because there's plenty of places where you can still get a

487
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.314
plastic bag.

488
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.220
You can get it at the Walgreens and get the damn grocery store.
So they don't,

489
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.770
they don't care about the porpoises.
I know they don't,

490
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.190
they care about making money,
but I like even when the hippies try to get them,

491
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.050
they still figure out a way.

492
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.860
Hippies like we really are still in the sixties and seventies there's no more

493
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:09.400
hippies.
Why can't you let me off my fun?
Oh,
but you're just,

494
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:11.620
you're just as much of a Hippie as anybody else.

495
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.390
You're running around unplugging,
plugging things.

496
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.480
I wish I had hair like a hippie.
Shrieking.

497
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.550
I look like a principal.
You're very concerned about the environment.

498
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:26.160
Are you a hippy?
Uh,
I'm not going to.
I try not to.

499
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.580
I try not to be a voice for so annoying about that.
You are a hippie.

500
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:34.530
You're just as bad as the people you're talking.
You're not fucking plug.

501
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.880
I'm not showered with mint tea or whatever the fuck it is.
They do.

502
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.950
Don't they all smell like put your spices?

503
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.393
<v 5>MMM.</v>

504
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.550
<v 1>No,
I'm not a hippie.
Just because you give a shit.
Well,</v>

505
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:54.720
these people give a shit too.

506
00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:57.960
So why are they happy is because I was just trying to be funny.
Oh,
okay.

507
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.370
Is that all right?
All right.
We were only supposed to do 15 minutes,

508
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:07.110
so this is an extra 15 for all the people on the Internet.
Where is it,

509
00:31:07.111 --> 00:31:12.060
man?
Oh,
hey.
You know what?

510
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:15.320
I got a big announcement to make.
I'm preggers no,

511
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.410
whoever says I have a big announcement,
they always has to be on pregnant.
Um,

512
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.850
where is it here
please tweet that,
that bill burrs pregnant,

513
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.680

514
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:35.430
And I have to look as excited as a first time mom.

515
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.380
Um,
so wait,
wait,
wait.
Here we go.
Ah,
I have a tour.
If,
you know,
this is the thing,

516
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.070
the people always come up to me after my shows and they'll say,
hey,
we,

517
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:47.520
we drove four hours to the shelf.
Don't you tear it,

518
00:31:47.521 --> 00:31:51.110
don't you turn my fucking well,
I want to read it.
Okay.
Okay.

519
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.460
So they'll come up to me at the end of my shows.
They'll be like,

520
00:31:53.461 --> 00:31:58.110
we drove four hours,
you know,
six hours,
eight hours.
I've had people like,

521
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.010
we flew in here from Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was like,
you know,

522
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.960
that means something,
right?
So I was like,
I called up my agent and go,
well,

523
00:32:06.961 --> 00:32:09.510
why don't I go out to some of these more obscure places?

524
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.400
<v 5>MMM.</v>

525
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.820
<v 1>You know where these people are at.
So I came up with this tour</v>

526
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.610
or my agent did.
It's going to be basically all the middle of the country.

527
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.180
It's the,

So I'm doing the Tom Brady theater.
It's just the Brady theater.

541
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.240

uh,
like Brady Bill Brady.
Then it's really disrespectful.

542
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.890
My fault.

but was that is dead?

551
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.950
I never watched the actual did it take place there?

552
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.360
I have no idea if that's just a bad ass name.
That's just a bad,

553
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.770
bad ass name though.
My commodity.

554
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.570
Some good looking cowboy tried to talk game do you came up right?

555
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.180
You weren't with me,
right?
You're already liking this comes walking.

556
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.350
<v 4>Can it wait,</v>

557
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:30.900
where are you automatically?
So yeah,
I'm with you.

558
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.470
Yeah.
Where are you from?
From

559
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.040
<v 1>where you from?
Cowboy deadwood,
South Dakota.
That's a bad accent.</v>

560
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:39.710
That wasn't sexy at all.
Wasn't no.
Who are you thinking of?

561
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:43.040
You thinking of a fucking Michael Moore there and uh,
Michael Moore.

562
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.600
Tell me Fellman Luis Grad fit what?
I think Michael Moore did.

563
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:51.230
He play somebody named Michael.
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.

564
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:54.860
I want to go watch the,
uh,
the kings and Black Hawks.
And like I said,

565
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:56.810
I feel like the kings not only gonna win game two,

566
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:59.630
I think they're going to win the series if they play their game.

567
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:04.580
That's a big ass fucking team.
Ah,

568
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:05.631
Jesus.

569
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:10.520
Paul Versey who's going to be on the Billy [inaudible] Billy red state tour as

570
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:11.720
is,
uh,

571
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:16.040
Jason Law had Jason Lawhead all the bands getting back together.
Hey,

572
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:18.410
first he let me call you right back.
I'm finishing a podcast.

573
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.470
All right.
That's it.
All right.
And uh,
play eight,
by the way,

574
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.040
Nhl hockey finally getting its due on the cover of sports illustrated.

575
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.570
It says something like the best game or the best whatever and it just has like

576
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:39.420
on the covers back east is going to be the Bruins I think against the rangers.

577
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:41.550
Cause I think,
uh,
you know,
they got to go to press I think,

578
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.860
I don't think it's against,
might be against the penguins.
And then they have the,

579
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.210
uh,
maybe they just have the conference finals,

580
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.980
but they're talking about how the NHL playoffs or the greatest like,
you know,

581
00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:54.530
I love it.
This,
this far like this deep into the playoffs,
they,

582
00:35:54.531 --> 00:35:58.700
any player they interview has like stitches on their face or a fat lip.

583
00:35:58.701 --> 00:36:02.270
What about that guy?
We saw that guy in the black box.
If that guy,
the kinks,

584
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.810
he literally looked like,
I like,
he stuck his face in a woodchipper.

585
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:10.640
How like how excited you are during hockey season.
I,

586
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.190
I fucked.
It's all coming together now.
You are,

587
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:16.010
you're always so happy during hockey season.

588
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.250
You're like a little school boy on Christmas Day.
Every day you're liking low.

589
00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.920
Oh boy.
Go Watch the game.
Texting me in the middle of the day.
Nini,

590
00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:28.610
can you take this such and such game for me?
I love it.
Yeah.

591
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.250
I'm actually bummed that it's so,
I love that it's getting the respect,

592
00:36:31.251 --> 00:36:32.570
but I liked it.
It's underground.

593
00:36:32.571 --> 00:36:36.170
It's like a band that you love and you can get good fucking sit close and watch

594
00:36:36.171 --> 00:36:38.780
them before all the fucking scream in horror show up.

595
00:36:38.781 --> 00:36:40.870
And then next thing you know,
you're up in the upper deck.
Go.

596
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.190
You know what I mean?
I watched him in the fucking,

597
00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:50.490
um,
I followed this guy,
uh,
on,
uh,

598
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.040
on Twitter that has like,

599
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:57.720
puts up all these classic pictures and uh,
uh,

600
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.880
the guy who helps me with the podcast,
Andrew sent me this,

601
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:03.930
this unbelievable photo of,
I believe it's a rangers,

602
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:07.980
Montreal Canadiens game and he can see the crowd and this unbelievable color.

603
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.350
And uh,
it's just,
first of all,
you should see the crowd.
It's mostly guys.

604
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.030
Yeah.
And everybody is just dressed to the nines.
Oh,
for a hockey game,

605
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:21.210
dude suits overcoats the whole thing.

606
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.660
And you just think now the fat fucks with their faces.

607
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:27.580
Painted kids,
give him the finger and shit.

608
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.180
You know,

609
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.810
these whores running around with at t shirts tied off shooting tee shirts that

610
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.900
people catching them,
they can't even fit in.
The fucking thinks,
hey,

611
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.850
just wonder like,
what happened?
You know,

612
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.210
but I've never worn a suit and tie to a game,
so I'm part of the problem,

613
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:42.940
you know.

614
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.270
Do you know what would happen if you actually wore a suit and tie to a game?

615
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:48.180
Like people would look at you like what are you one of the owners?
Yeah.

616
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.400
Which is not a bad thing,
especially if you were sitting in one.

617
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.460
I like the fancy receipts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But now,
you know,

618
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:56.540
back in the day I feel like people could hold their alcohol.
Uh Huh.

619
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.660
Feel like now you just going to show up and somebody is going to dump one of

620
00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:02.420
those fucking 72 ounce,
big gulp.

621
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.670
Molsons all over a nice overcoat.
I Dunno.
Whatever.
I'll try to,
uh,

622
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.810
I'll try to give you guys a,

623
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:13.010
I'll try to post that somewhere and maybe next week if you guys remind me,

624
00:38:13.011 --> 00:38:14.060
send me an email and I'll,
I'll,

625
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.940
I'll tell you who that guy is that I follow my Twitter.
Uh,

626
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.800
do I see Joe Rosa gave me great advice.

627
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.210
He took the Twitter APP office phone.
Oh yeah.
You told him.
I said that.

628
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.110
I did.
I took the Twitter app off and I took the Facebook f up because,
yeah.
Yeah,

629
00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:30.330
because I was becoming one of these fucking zombies,

630
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:34.500
like every five seconds my phone would make an auto would,
which be checking,

631
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:37.000
checking,
checking,
checking.
Just what am I doing?

632
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.750
Facebook is the fucking worst because you know I love about Twitter.

633
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.351
It's smaller,

634
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:44.230
so if people really want to go on and on and they think cuts them off,

635
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.800
that's one of those quick answering machines,
right?

636
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.960
Facebook people can just go on and on.
Yeah.

637
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.780
How funny is it me saying that going on and on,

638
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:56.920
but like just some of this shit that like somebody wrote some stuff like,

639
00:38:56.921 --> 00:39:01.000
you know,
I trusted somebody know and I guess that was wrong because you know,

640
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:05.770
I just,
I guess I care to,
it's whole fucking long thing.
I Dunno why I read it.

641
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:08.020
I'm just like,
why would you,
why would you put that out there?

642
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.750
Because you're trying to connect with people.

643
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.020
You're trying to share your feelings.
He gets,
you know,

644
00:39:13.021 --> 00:39:17.200
also good that Colby Colby,
when he hurt his Achilles,
when as a kill,
he snapped.

645
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:20.380
He went out and he was just going,
what do I do?
Do I rehab it?

646
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:21.910
Do I just say to hell with it?

647
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:28.170
That's a great Coby and pricing Colby with no Achilles tendons paralyzed from

648
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:32.870
the fucking neck down could still kick my,
um,

649
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.990
all right,
there's 40 minutes.
All right.
There you go.
Just like that.

650
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.400
And another part or the best fucking thing that raccoon came in the back and

651
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:46.250
Cleo barked at it and then ran back to the door to look for you.
Look for me.

652
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.060
Let's go get that motherfucker.
And I was sitting right out there too,

653
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.680
and she saw,
she growled a little bit and he started barking and she did.

654
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:57.710
She ran back to the door and she was looking around like,
where are you?
Yeah,

655
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.490
let's get this
Si.
What a cat.
What a cat ever do.

656
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:04.690
Actually in order to cat would do,

657
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:08.800
a cat would just immediately take care of the problem and you'd have no idea.

658
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:11.510
And then it would just be sitting there with the dead body.
And you just be like,

659
00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.690
glad to things on my side,
but it can be a little nervous.
Yeah.

660
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:19.390
Cleo really had this look on her face,
like,
where is he?

661
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:23.500
Does nothing like a big dark Dolores Daddy,
let's go.
All right,
cool.
All right.

662
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:26.020
That's the,
uh,
that's the bonus tracks for this week.

663
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:31.240
Thank you for being patient is always,

664
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:35.570

All right,

665
00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:36.280
